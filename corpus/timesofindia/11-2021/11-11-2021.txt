US District Judge Royce Lamberth cited the seriousness of New Jersey gym owner Scott Fairlamb's conduct when he sentenced him. Fairlamb was captured screaming at officers by their body-worn cameras before shoving one and then punching him in the face and pleaded guilty in August. "Had you gone to trial, I don't think there's any jury that could have acquitted you," the judge told Fairlamb. Fairlamb was the first rioter sentenced for violence against police during the attack. Lamberth noted that his sentence will be a benchmark for the more than 120 defendants charged with attacking police during the Capitol assault by thousands of Donald Trump supporters trying to overturn his election defeat. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after the riot and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. About 140 police officers were injured. Fairlamb's lawyer had asked Lamberth to "take into consideration the approximate 11 months his client has already served in custody" and not add additional time. An emotional Fairlamb addressed the judge during the hearing, saying he brought shame upon his family's name. "I have nothing but remorse," Fairlamb said, later adding: "I just hope you show some mercy on me, sir." Federal prosecutors had recommended a 44-month sentence. Justice Department lawyer Leslie Goemaat highlighted Fairlamb's martial arts training during Wednesday's hearing, as well as earlier run-ins with the law. "He was trained to throw a punch and was well aware of the injury he could cause," Goemaat said. Goemaat also mentioned a video Fairlamb recorded during the riots in which he said: “What Patriots do? We fuckin’ disarm them and then we storm the fuckin’ Capitol!” "The defendant's own statements on that day suggest that he came prepared for violence," Goemaat said. 'Qanon Shaman' sentencing next week Most of the guilty pleas in Jan. 6 prosecutions have been in cases involving non-violent misdemeanors, but government lawyers are now seeking prison sentences for some defendants facing more serious felony charges. Prosecutors in a late-night court filing recommended a four-year, three-month sentence for Jacob Chansley, the participant in the Jan. 6 riots nicknamed the "QAnon Shaman." Lamberth, who is also handling Chansley's case, will sentence him on Nov. 17. Chansley’s attorney, Albert Watkins, said in a Tuesday court filing that Chansley should be released "as soon as possible," noting that he will have spent more than 10 months in pretrial detention. "I can say with confidence that Mr. Chansley is in dire need of mental health treatment," Watkins said in the filing, adding that further time behind bars "jeopardizes his mental stability." Some 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack, the Justice Department said. Four people have pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement. The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected those claims as unfounded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-capitol-rioter-gets-41-months-in-prison-longest-sentence-imposed/articleshow/87634791.cms||---

Speaking through an interpreter, Xie Zhenhua told reporters at the UN climate conference in Glasgow that China would strengthen its emissions-cutting targets, and intended to develop a national plan on methane. He also said both countries wanted to do more to stop deforestation. Xie said the United States and China, the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, had also reached agreement on Wednesday on a joint declaration, which would be released.

"What is the reason behind Government of India's silence on this? Rahul Gandhi had asked to constitute a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) so if there is no foul play then why government hesitates to constitute a JPC?" said Baghel. Congress party has alleged that the BJP-led government is running away from the probe into the matter. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra on Tuesday slammed Congress for alleged corruption in the Rafale deal in the period between 2007 to 2012 following fresh media reports. Congress has said that the UPA government had negotiated the purchase of one Rafale fighter aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526.10 crore after an international tender for procuring 126 aircraft. The BJP-led government decided to buy 36 Rafale aircraft off the shelf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-centre-hesitates-to-constitute-jpc-in-rafale-deal-matter-asks-bhupesh-baghel/articleshow/87634920.cms||---

The Declaration emphasised that Afghanistan’s territory shouldn’t be used for "sheltering, training, planning or financing" any terrorist act while reiterating support for a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan. With several countries sharing concerns about terrorist groups active in Afghanistan and their benefactors, it also stressed respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and also non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Read AlsoAfghanistan conference: India looks to forge consensus on terror, legitimacy, aidNSA Ajit Doval set the tone for India’s conference on Afghanistan with discussions Tuesday on enhanced terror threat from the country, and also the looming humanitarian crisis it's facing, with his Tajikistan and Uzbekistan counterparts. Both central Asian countries share a border with AfghanistanThe conference chaired by NSA Ajit Doval saw the participants discussing the evolving security situation in Afghanistan and its regional and global implications while calling for efforts to ensure Afghanistan didn’t turn into a safe haven for global terrorism. Official sources said participating countries acknowledged India’s concerns over cross-border terrorism perpetrated by Pakistan based groups who are also active in Afghanistan.

The day-long event, the first being hosted by India, will focus on terrorism and related security challenges and uncertaintiesAccording to sources, the participants also stressed that no one should boycott the NSA dialogue process due to the "bilateral agenda". Both China and Pakistan had turned down India's invite to the conference. The NSAs also called on PM Narendra Modi and were said to have had a substantive exchange with him as PM shared India's perspective on Afghanistan. Read AlsoAfghanistan soil shouldn’t be used to target others: India &amp; RussiaNEW DELHI: The NSA conference on Afghanistan on Wednesday saw India and Russia joining others in underlining the importance of ensuring the rights of women, children and national minorities in Afghanistan. They condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and underscored that the"The sides paid special attention to the current political situation in Afghanistan and threats arising from terrorism, radicalisation and drug trafficking as well as the need for humanitarian assistance’’ said the Declaration issued shortly after the conference that saw participation by 7 countries, including Russia and Iran, apart from India. The conference is seen as an important step by India to underline its role in regional efforts for peace and stability in Afghanistan and to remain relevant despite the Kabul takeover by a traditionally inimical Taliban. Russia, as Doval said in his opening remarks, was the initiator of the idea for a conference. According to the Declaration, the countries stressed the necessity of forming an open and truly inclusive government that represented the will of all the people of Afghanistan and had representation from all sections of their society, including major "ethnopolitical forces’’ in the country. "Inclusion of all sections of the society in the administrative and political structure is imperative for the successful national reconciliation process in the country,’’ said the participating countries. There was an understanding that it was important for the Taliban to address this issue before the international community could consider recognising their government. On terrorism, the Declaration said, they condemned in the strongest terms all terrorist activities and reaffirmed their firm commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its financing, the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and countering radicalization, to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism. They also called for collective cooperation against the menace of radicalisation, extremism, separatism and drug trafficking in the region. The conference emphasised that the fundamental rights of women, children and minority communities are not violated and expressed concern over the deteriorating socio-economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan while underlining the need to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to the Afghans. “Reiterated that humanitarian assistance should be provided in an unimpeded, direct and assured manner to Afghanistan and that the assistance is distributed within the country in a non-discriminatory manner across all sections of the Afghan society,’’ said the Declaration. This is significant as India’s proposal for transporting 50,000 MT wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistan is still pending with Islamabad. "The NSAs noted the need to provide humanitarian assistance and emphasized that the land and air routes should be made available and no one should impede the process," said a source. Recalling the relevant UN resolutions on Afghanistan, the participants noted that the UN had a central role to play in Afghanistan and that its continued presence in the country must be preserved. They also expressed deep concern over the suffering of the people of Afghanistan arising from the security situation in Afghanistan and condemned the terrorist attacks in Kunduz, Kandahar and Kabul. Official sources said the meeting exceeded India's expectations as they highlighted that this was the only dialogue at the level of NSAs and that there was complete unanimity on the need to continue this process and have regular consultations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/allow-unimpeded-aid-into-afghanistan-say-nsas-in-delhi-declaration/articleshow/87634736.cms||Sachin Parashar

---||Business||Bidi & tobacco companies use social media platforms to advertise and up sales||MUMBAI: Social media giants including Facebook, under attack for hate speech and misinformation, could now face the heat on account of public health as well. The tobacco industry is using Facebook to facilitate bidi sales, openly leveraging social media platforms to advertise harmful products, in violation of India’s tobacco control legislation, says a study. The report `Selling Death on Social Media: How Bidis Are Reaching Consumers Online’ by Vital Strategies, a global public health organization, details digital media monitoring data with 344 instances of bidi marketing on social media between December 2020 and August 2021, almost exclusively through Facebook (98%). The study highlights social media marketing by tobacco and bidi companies as a growing public health concern, especially as evidence shows that it leads to an increased likelihood of tobacco use among youth. Of the 267 million tobacco users in India, over one-fourth smoke bidis, with nearly half (47%) of users smoking their first bidi before their 10th birthday. Easily accessible throughout the country and cheaper than cigarettes, it is estimated that eight times as many bidis as cigarettes are sold in India. Under India’s national tobacco control law, the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco is banned across platforms, including marketing on the internet. Ironically, all tobacco products are marketed on the internet where restrictions are more difficult to enforce, though the marketing strategies used for each product vary. Bidi companies tend to use direct marketing to sell their products online. This is a concern because exposure to bidi marketing leads to an increased likelihood of use among new and current consumers, the study says. Facebook hosts at least 30 distinct pages for bidi companies, with many of these companies appearing to be utilizing Facebook pages to facilitate sales, the study found. Bidis are being openly marketed on social media with clear pictures of the product in nearly 80% of cases. In contrast, most tobacco products are promoted inconspicuously or in more clandestine ways, to comply with existing laws, the report says. This is because the bidi industry continues to be less regulated than cigarettes, and hence faces less scrutiny. Nandita Murukutla, VP, Global Policy and Research Vital Strategies, said: “The evidence is clear: tobacco marketing increases tobacco use. This evidence formed the basis for national and international regulations that ban or restrict the advertising of tobacco. When the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control went into effect in 2005, ... social media use was in its infancy. As advertising regulations in traditional media have taken hold, the industry is migrating its marketing online where national regulations have been less clear. This report is a call to action for governments to surveil and address tobacco marketing on digital media. It is also a call for social media companies, Facebook in particular, to close down tobacco marketing that facilitates sales of this deadly product.” Amit Yadav, senior technical advisor tobacco control at The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease said, “We must address online bidi marketing so that offline enforcement is more effective’’. India is both the second largest producer and consumer of tobacco products worldwide. Bidi smoke delivers more tar, carbon monoxide and nicotine than other cigarettes, and severely increases the risk for several cancers, coronary heart disease and heart attacks, several global studies have warned. Our findings confirm that smokeless tobacco products were marketed most often on Instagram (42%), followed by Facebook (39%) and YouTube (12%), while smoking tobacco products were marketed on Facebook (53%), followed by Instagram (31%) and Twitter (10%), it adds. Over the last few years, social media use has grown among India’s rural community—where bidis are particularly popular— to 299 million active internet users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bidi-tobacco-companies-use-social-media-platforms-to-advertise-and-up-sales/articleshow/87635041.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||India||As fresh whistleblower leaks points to Facebook laxity in India, government promises action||NEW DELHI: As concerns rise over Facebook’s inability to contain hate speech and polarising content in India over lax oversight and despite repeated warnings issued by internal staff, the government said it will take action against social-media giants for lapses, even as the current IT Act – that came into force in 2001 – may soon be drafted anew to factor in societal threats, technological advancements and ensure user safety and security. “You can't have the cyberspace as the wild west where there are no rules and no laws apply," Junior IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said while speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021. The minister said that accountability needs to be driven in the way the social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter monitor inciteful and hateful content, especially as much of it has the potential to create discord in the society. “So, it is an evolution for these intermediaries (social media platforms) to go from a belief that the cyberspace space has no jurisdiction and no laws to one where countries are cooperating in creating a set of rules.” The minister’s views come at a time when there are fresh concerns over Facebook’s inability to monitor hateful and inciteful content in India with new reports pointing out that the company’s senior global officials didn’t read much into the concerns raised by their own internal staff between 2018 and 2020. The concerns have come out through revelations made by former Facebook data scientist and whistleblower Frances Haugen in various submissions before regulators in the US. When contacted, an India spokesperson for Facebook’s parent Meta said that teams within the company have developed an “industry-leading process of reviewing and prioritizing” which countries have the highest risk of offline harm and violence every six months. “We make these determinations in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and following a review of societal harms, how much Facebook’s products impact these harms and critical events on the ground,” the Meta spokesperson said. The company claimed that it had hate speech classifiers in Hindi and Bengali from 2018. “Classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali first came online in early 2021.” Minister Chandrasekhar has previously said that effective checks should be maintained to guard against instances of hate crime, fake news, cyber bullying, child pornography, and also unlawful content around children and women. The updated IT Rules for social-media companies, announced in February this year, were a step in this direction, he added. He said that making rules for social media companies does not mean unfairly controlling their working. “I have made it very clear that the government has no intention in getting into anything to do with the internet and intermediaries, creative work and innovation, and investment. We have no role except to ensure that the internet always remains open, it is safe and trusted by those who use it, and in the Indian context. I can assure you that this government is committed to keeping the internet open. It is only interested in ensuring the internet remains safe, trusted and accountable to its users.” On getting a new IT law in place, he said that the current law was made in 2001, and was later amended in 2008. “It is almost 21 years old, which means for centuries in the internet age… It is absolutely clear in my mind that as a nation that is heavily invested in technology, for whom the internet is a big part of our digital economy, we will need to evolve our laws and we will need to get more modern laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-fresh-whistleblower-leaks-points-to-facebook-laxity-in-india-government-promises-action/articleshow/87635104.cms||Pankaj Doval

On November 5, three people were killed in Arnia when assailants opened fire at them. “Two of them had succumbed on the spot while the third died during treatment. Another person also sustained bullet injuries,” Jammu SSP Chandan Kohli said. “Following the attack, the assailants had stashed the weapons in a hideout and fled the spot,” said the SSP, adding that a case was subsequently registered under relevant sections of the law, and an SIT constituted to probe the crime. “On November 8, the wife of one of the prime accused, Sadeeq Choudhary, was questioned and she led police to the hideout from where the weapons were recovered,” the SSP said. “Today (Wednesday), the SIT received information about the movement of the accused and formed three teams to trace them. The trio was caught from the outskirts of Kathua,” SSP Kohli said. “The arrested include Sadeeq Choudhary of Arnia, Bhupinder Singh of RS Pura and their accomplice Gulab Din of Samba, who had been harbouring the two prime accused,” the SSP said. Sadeeq earlier worked in the police department and was dismissed from service in 2019, while Gulab Din alias Ghaisa is a wanted criminal with a string of cases against him, he added. “A revolver along with 10 cartridges was recovered from Bhupinder and four vehicles used in the crime were seized,” SSP Kohli said, adding: “Based on information obtained from the trio, police raided Bhupinder’s house and recovered 12 bore guns, some sharp-edged weapons, 10g heroin and Rs 2 lakh cash.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arnia-shootout-three-arrested-weapons-recovered/articleshow/87635197.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Pakistan Supreme Court questions PM Imran Khan over army school massacre case||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday grilled prime minister Imran Khan in the Army Public School massacre case, questioning his government for holding peace talks with the very terrorist group that had carried out the deadly attack on the Peshawar school in 2014, and ordered the PM to probe security lapses leading up to the assault. In December 2014, a total of 147 people, 132 of them children, were killed when Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) terrorists stormed the school. Khan’s government, however, is currently in talks with TTP and as part of the reconciliation process it has already announced a complete ceasefire with the banned outfit. In a rare move, Khan appeared before the court on the orders of a three-judge SC bench headed by chief justice Gulzar Ahmed. With regards to media reports regarding negotiations with the TTP, the bench questioned whether “we are bringing them (TTP) back to the negotiating table instead of taking action against them?” “Are we going to surrender once again?” one of the judges, justice Qazi Mohammad Amin, asked the PM. Khan was asked to explain his government’s actions against officials involved in the school’s security. He replied that he was not the country’s PM when the attack took place. It prompted the chief justice to ask him what his government has done in the past three years to redress the grievances of the families of the victims. “You issue order and we will take action,” Khan told the bench, adding that the relatives of the victims were compensated. At this, the chief justice remarked that the parents wanted their children and not compensation. The court informed the PM that the victims’ parents want action against officials who were posted at high-ranking positions at the time of the attack. At one point of time, the debate over fixing responsibility became heated when Khan said before the court: “Find out why 80,000 people were killed. Also, find out who is responsible for 480 drone attacks taking place in Pakistan.” The chief justice responded: “Finding out about these things is your job, you are the prime minister. As the prime minister, you should have the answer to these questions.” During the hearing, the bench asked the federal government to listen to the stance of the victims’ parents, saying action should be taken against anyone whose negligence was proven. The apex court also directed the government to submit a report, signed by the PM, in this regard in four weeks. The SC order came after years of protests by parents and relatives of the children who had lost their loved ones in the attack. The families are also protesting the government’s efforts to strike a peace deal with TTP. Khan’s appearance is the first time since 2012 that a sitting prime minister had been asked to appear before the top court. Raja Pervez Ashraf, the then prime minister from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), was asked to appear in connection with a graft inquiry against former president Asif Ali Zardari. Khan’s grilling by the top court happened days after his government’s surrender to the far-right Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which was behind anti-France protests over the publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad last year there. The TLP was believed to be covertly supported by the country’s powerful military establishment. The government-TLP tussle was preceded by Khan’s tug-of-war with the top military brass over the appointment of the country’s new ISI chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-questions-pm-imran-khan-over-army-school-massacre-case/articleshow/87635250.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Civilian, cop injured in grenade attack in old Srinagar city||SRINAGAR: A civilian and a policeman were injured on Wednesday evening when terrorists threw a hand grenade near Aali Masjid in Eidgah area of old Srinagar, the third terror attack in four days in the city. The police said the terrorists had meant to target the CRPF post in the area but the grenade fell on the road. The injured were civilian Aijaz Ahmad Bhat of Srinagar’s Hawal locality and policeman Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Narwara Eidgah, the police said. The cop was in civvies and, therefore, probably not the target, the police said. Terrorists had killed a cop in Batamallo on Sunday, and a civilian, a salesman for a Kashmiri Pandit shopkeeper at Bohri Kadal in Srinagar town, on Monday. While a top J&K police officer refused to say that Monday’s killing of salesman Mohammed Ibrahim Khan (45) was communal in nature, the owner of the shop, Sandeep Mawa claimed that the attack was meant to send a message to Muslims to refrain from working at businesses owned by Kashmiri Pandits. The senior J&K police officer said Mawa’s version was baseless and that sleeper cells of hybrid terrorists have returned to selective killings since October 2021 after top terrorist commanders were killed in combat operations this year. Sandeep Mawa, a doctor by training who runs the Srinagar-based business of his father, Roshan Lal Mawa, who lives in New Delhi, owns a house in Karan Nagar, Srinagar. Sandeep Mawa said he occasionally visited his grocery shop at Bohri Kadal in central Srinagar and had presented a car to Ibrahim Khan, his salesman, for his selfless service to the Mawa family for the last 13 years. The senior police officer said Mawa had been provided adequate security cover, with two PSOs always accompanying him, and tat he had been alerted after the recent targeted killings in the valley. Mawa has said this incident will not scare him into leaving the Kashmir valley. "I will stay back in Kashmir under all circumstances. I lost my uncle, M L Bindroo, a pharmacy owner, to terrorists’ bullets on October 5 this year, but these incidents will not scare me into migrating out of here," Mawa said. He added that the had left Kashmir in the early 1990s but had returned in 1998 and would not leave again Mawa claimed the killing at his shop was a case of mistaken identity as the assailants thought it was he who had got into the car when it was actually Ibrahim. "Interestingly, the assailants had switched off all the streetlights in the area before attacking the man in the car," Mawa alleged. A senior officer said the police was ready to review Mawa’s security cover and provide more men to guard him if it felt it was needed. Mawa said he was "really concerned" about Ibrahim Khan’s family. "We are planning to help the family, his wife and two children, so that they have a comfortable life ahead," Mama said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/civilian-cop-injured-in-grenade-attack-in-old-srinagar-city/articleshow/87635279.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Parcel revenue stood at Rs 174.40 crore during April-October 2021, which is 220% more than that of Rs 54.57 crore in the corresponding period last year. Around 4.01 lakh tonnes of goods were transported during April to October 2021,” an official said. The growth in parcel traffic is mainly driven by successful running of Kisan Rail carrying perishable traffic to the far-flung markets of the country. In Financial year 2021-22 (April to October), the Kisan Rail has made 497 trips to various destinations transporting 1.80 lakh tonnes of goods and earning a revenue of Rs 69.22 crore. Since inception, 724 trips of Kisan Rails have been made, transporting 2.51 lakh tonnes, generating a revenue of 98.18 crore. Anil Kumar Lahoti, general manager of Central Railway, said that parcel transportation by rail is the safest, quickest and the most environment-friendly option available for customers. “Central Railway’s efforts in setting up of Business Development Units in all its divisions have provided easy access to businessmen, traders and dealers to transport their goods quickly,” he said. In addition to time-tabled and indent-based Kisan Rails, Parcel Cargo Express Train has also been running successfully. “Performance of divisions in parcels has been very encouraging too. Mumbai division is leading in parcel revenue by generating Rs 65.86 crores, followed by Bhusawal division with Rs 53.30 crore. Solapur division has led the way in incremental traffic by achieving a percentage growth of 547% with revenue of Rs 29.68 crore against Rs 4.59 crore during the corresponding period last year. Sangola in Solapur division has become a hub for Kisan Rail. In addition to the 19 stations for parcel traffic under Central Railway, three more stations — Rahuri, Dehu Road and Kasbesukane — have been opened for parcel traffic in 2021-22.

It added that 10% of Indians have only travelled within their own state. East India was the region with the highest percentage of people to have only travelled in their state. Tier-2 city dwellers are most likely to have travelled to two to five states (55%) versus 54% and 47% for Tier 3 and 1 respectively. Conversely, Tier-1 dwellers are most likely to have visited 6-10 states (30%) versus 25% of Tier 2 and 3 residents, said the survey by Agoda.  When it comes to age groups, 35-44-year-olds are more likely to have travelled to two to five states versus the 45+ age group. “Less than 1% of respondents have travelled to all 28 states,’’ the survey said.  Forty-eight percent of Indians have visited the capital city of New Delhi, with 40% visiting Maharashtra and 31% Karnataka. Taking a deeper look at Union territories besides Delhi (48%), Chandigarh ranks number 2 on the most visited Union territories list for Indians, with Jammu and Kashmir as number 3. North Indians’ top three destinations were within the region itself, with 73% having visited the number one spot, Delhi, 58% taking to Uttar Pradesh (number 2), and 46% to Haryana (number 3), the survey said.  Similarly, south Indians have travelled most within the region. Tamil Nadu took number one spot with 66%, Karnataka at number two with 57% and number three, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala with 55%. East Indians top spot were West Bengal (67%), Delhi (44%), and Bihar (42%), the survey said.  The top two destinations for each city tier were Delhi and Maharashtra, but for Tier 2 cities, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh take the joint third spot. At the same time, Tamil Nadu is the third spot for Tier-3 city dwellers, the survey found.  The top three motivations and purposes to travel were scenery (68%), food (50%) and arts and culture (43%). “Female respondents were more likely than their male counterparts to be motivated to travel for scenery (females 73% - male 64%), and food (females 54% - male 48%). Male Indian respondents were more likely than females to be motivated to travel for history (females 34% and males 40%) and sports (females 20% - males 30%),” said the survey. Scenery was a top draw for all respondents, but most for 35–44-year-olds at 75%.  Friends’ recommendations were the primary source of travel inspiration. “When it comes to getting travel inspiration by region, South Indians were the most likely to be inspired by friends and family, followed by those from the West, North, and East,” it said. When it comes to social media, those respondents from the West were most likely to get inspired by social media than any other region, followed by North and South Indians in joint second and East in the fourth spot, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-most-visited-destination-for-indians-survey/articleshow/87635415.cms||---
---||World||China, US pledge to enhance climate cooperation at UN talks||GLASGOW: The world’s top two carbon polluters, China and the United States, pledged Wednesday to increase their cooperation on climate action in a joint declaration issued at UN climate talks in Glasgow. In separate news conferences, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and US counterpart John Kerry said the two countries would work together to accelerate the emissions reductions required to meet the temperature goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. “The whole point of this is that the steps we’re taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us to be able to accelerate our efforts,” Kerry said. Governments agreed in Paris to jointly reduce emissions enough to keep the global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, with a more stringent target of trying to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) preferred. Both sides recognize that there is a gap between efforts taken globally to reduce emissions and the goals of the Paris deal, Xie said. “So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations,” he said. The joint declaration came as governments from around the world were negotiating in Glasgow about how to build on the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of global warming. A draft deal released Wednesday calls for pulling the plug on coal power, the single biggest source of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The early version of the final document also expresses “alarm and concern” about how much Earth has already warmed and urges countries to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about half by 2030. Pledges so far from governments don’t add up to that frequently stated goal.

Speaking through an interpreter, Xie Zhenhua told reporters at the UN climate conference in Glasgow that China wouldSome nations, especially island states whose very existence is threatened by climate change, warned that the draft didn’t go far enough in requiring action to limit increases in global temperatures — or in helping poorer countries to pay for adapting to the warming and for losses from it. “‘Urging,’ ‘calling,’ ‘encouraging,’ and ‘inviting’ is not the decisive language that this moment calls for,” Aubrey Webson, Antigua and Barbuda’s UN ambassador, said in a statement. Read AlsoChina climate pact a vote for successful COP26: US climate envoy KerryGLASGOW: US climate envoy John Kerry said on Wednesday an agreement with China was a statement of support for a successful United Nations' climate summit, with both taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elementsWith time running out in the climate summit, a clear message had to be sent, he added: “To our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you and we are taking this seriously.” Meeting the Paris goals would require a dramatic reduction in emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas that remain the world’s top source of energy despite the growth of renewables like wind and solar power. But setting deadlines for phasing out fossil fuels is highly sensitive to countries that still depend on them for economic growth, including China and India, and to major exporters of coal such as Australia. The future of coal is also a hot-button issue in the US, where a spat among Democrats has held up one of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bills. The draft calls for accelerating “the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels,” though it sets no timeline. Greenpeace International director Jennifer Morgan, a long-time climate talks observer, said that the call in the draft to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels would be a first in a UN climate deal, but the lack of a timeline would limit the pledge’s effectiveness. “This isn’t the plan to solve the climate emergency. This won’t give the kids on the streets the confidence that they’ll need,” Morgan said. European Union climate chief Frans Timmermans was more upbeat about the negotiations. “We’re ready and willing to make sure we deliver on the highest possible levels of ambition, leading to prompt global action,” he said. The draft is likely to change, but it doesn’t yet include full agreements on the three major goals that the U.N. set going into the negotiations: for rich nations to give poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate aid, to ensure that half of that money goes to adapting to worsening global warming, and the pledge to slash global carbon emissions by 2030. The draft acknowledges “with regret” that rich nations have failed to live up to the climate finance pledge. Currently they are providing around $80 billion a year, which poorer nations that need financial help both in developing green energy systems and adapting to the worst of climate change say isn’t enough. Papua New Guinea Environment Minister Wera Mori said given the lack of financial aid that his country may “rethink” efforts to cut logging, coal mining and even coming to the U.N. talks. The draft says the world should try to achieve “net-zero (emissions) around mid-century,” a target that was endorsed by leaders of the Group of 20 biggest economies in a summit just before the Glasgow talks. That means requiring countries to pump only as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means. Highlighting the challenge of meeting those goals, the document “expresses alarm and concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 C (2 F) of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region.” Separate draft proposals were also released on other issues being debated at the talks, including rules for international carbon markets and the frequency by which countries have to report on their efforts. The draft calls on countries that don’t have national goals that are in line with the 1.5- or 2-degree limits to come back with stronger targets next year. Depending on how the language is interpreted, the provision could apply to most countries. “This is crucial language,” World Resources Institute International Climate Initiative Director David Waskow said. “Countries really are expected and are on the hook to do something in that timeframe to adjust.’’ In a nod to one of the big issues for poorer countries, the draft vaguely “urges” developed nations to compensate developing countries for “loss and damage,” a phrase that some rich nations don’t like. But there are no concrete financial commitments. Britain’s Alok Sharma, who is chairing the negotiations, acknowledged that “significant issues remain unresolved.” “My big, big ask of all of you is to please come armed with the currency of compromise,” he told negotiators. “What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and I know that we will not want to fail them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-us-pledge-to-enhance-climate-cooperation-at-un-talks/articleshow/87635510.cms||---

Ella’s remarks at the Times Now Summit 2021 on Wednesay will further animate the discussion on the subject, as so far, the government and some experts are of the view that a booster dose is not urgent and ensuring full vaccination with two doses remains a priority. Some nations, though, have initiated booster doses for their elderly population.

Hinting at politics as a possible factor behind the negative reports, Ella recalled how soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the Covaxin shot to express confidence in Indian science, innovation and ‘atma-nirbhar’ capabilities, it was labelled by some as a ‘BJP vaccine’ or ‘Modi vaccine’. In a Q&A session, Ella indicated that the nasal Covid vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech could be taken in lieu of the second dose of Covaxin or to protect previously infected persons. Spelling hope for a mask-free future, he said that the nasal vaccine was more effective in preventing transmission of the virus as compared to an injectable vaccine which does not reach the upper lungs and could eliminate the need for a vaccinated individual to continue wearing a mask.

Shah also inaugurated the Times NowProbed on the long-drawn scrutiny by the WHO on Covaxin, Ella said, “The negative things (said about Covaxin) in the country put WHO in a little awkward position”. He said WHO wanted to be sure if it was doing right or wrong and so reviewed data more intensely, with every small issue becoming a major one. “I think probably we are the only vaccine in WHO that has gone through so much scrutiny... We have gone through more scrutiny because of our internal systems also,” the CMD said.

Speaking at the Times Now summit, Rijiju saidElla rued how the campaign on Covaxin — as part of which even a suicide in Bhopal was projected as vaccine-induced death and scientific journals were asked to probe — based on own projections, interpretations and ideas delayed the publications as well as WHO pre-qualification process. He said that instead of criticising the vaccine, people could have just approached Bharat Biotech for the truth. “But (people) making own opinion...it not only hurt us, but also the future of startups in the country. If somebody wants to be against the political system of the country, they can take a different angle but not on healthcare. We are neutral, we want India to succeed. We want people to be benefited,” said the scientist-entrepreneur. On WHO withholding approval for emergency use of Covaxin in pregnant women, Ella said though more than a million expectant mothers had been administered the vaccine safely in India, WHO was really looking at data in a clinical mode. “We are on the job. We will finish it in the next 2-3 months,” said Ella. On bringing a vaccine for children, Ella said Bharat Biotech was the only company in the world to have done clinical trials among those between 2 and 18 years of age. “Safety and immunogenicity is well established in this population right now. We have submitted the data to the data controller but WHO, unless the national regulatory authority approves it, will not approve,” he said. Hinting at supply issues as one of the major constraints behind the government’s lack of decision on approval, Ella said, “Maybe, the government is thinking that if it is approved then every child has to vaccinated in the country. Are there enough supplies... But for us it is a global competition…So I think the Indian government should recognise. We need quick indication from India so that we can move WHO.” Dismissing talk of shortcuts in grant of emergency nod to Covaxin, Ella clarified that though the approval process was hastened, no provision of the Indian law or ‘Schedule Y’ rule was violated. “If anything had been violated, I would have gone to jail by now,” he said. The Bharat Biotech boss said that unlike other companies like Pfizer and Oxford, that are not into R&D and licensed the vaccine, Bharat Biotech developed the vaccine from scratch. “Had I been in the US and done all these things, I would have been better recognised,” he said with a grin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/booster-dose-after-6-months-of-2nd-covaxin-shot-ideal-bharat-biotech-cmd-krishna-ella/articleshow/87635907.cms||---

Formal joining through signing of the framework agreement of the ISA happened during a meeting between India’s environment minister Bhupender Yadav and the US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry at India’s delegation office here at COP26 venue. The meeting took place amid unresolved key issue of finance on table at the COP in the wake of the release of the first draft text of the Glasgow decision. It is learnt that both Yadav and Kerry discussed the issues of finance and carbon market (Article 6) in detail where the latter spoke about contribution of the US and other developed nations towards climate finance and promised to scale it up further as announced under the the ‘finance delivery plan’ of the developed countries. Welcoming the US to the ISA fold as a new member, Yadav said, “This move will strengthen the ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world.” The ISA was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former French president Francois Hollande on the sidelines of COP21 on November 30, 2015 in Paris.

Signing the framework agreement, Kerry, said, “It has long been coming, and we are happy to join the International Solar Alliance, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in making. We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries.” On the US formally joining the Alliance, Ajay Mathur, director general of the ISA, said, “The US’ endorsement of ISA’s framework and approach is an heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognizing the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source’s potential as a catalyst for global energy transition.” Earlier at COP26, the US also joined the Steering Committee of the GGI-OSOWOG comprising of five members – USA, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and India — and endorsed the ‘One Sun Declaration’ along with 80 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-signs-in-india-backed-solar-initiative-gets-a-boost/articleshow/87636168.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Basic nations oppose EU’s ‘carbon border tax’ proposal||GLASGOW: The Basic nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - on Wednesday strongly opposed to the EU's proposal of 'carbon border tax' and asked the affluent nations to bridge the trust deficit by fulfilling their obligation on climate finance through mobilising at least $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025 even as COP26 presidency released heavily bracketed first draft text of Glasgow decision amid key unresolved issues on table. "Any unilateral measures and discriminatory practices, such as carbon border taxes, that could result in market distortion and aggravate the trust deficit amongst Parties, must be avoided," said the BASIC ministers after the meeting, chaired by India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav. Though the ministers in their joint statement pledged their full support to the United Kingdom COP26 Presidency for a successful conference, they picked up all key issues of concerns and asked the developed countries to honour their pre-2020 commitments regarding mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, without transferring any burden and responsibility to developing countries. "The progress on the pre-2020 agenda should be the key benchmark of success of COP26," they said. Under the world’s first proposal on carbon border tax, the 27 EU nations had a few months ago decided to impose carbon border taxes on imports of carbon-intensive goods. The tax plan, yet to be legally formalised, will come into force from 2026. It is believed that the 'carbon border tax', being pushed by the EU nations, will impact manufacturing and export in developing countries, primarily in India and China. It may also be a move to protect European industries from outside competitors who can manufacture products at lower cost as they are not charged for their carbon emission during the manufacturing processes. The draft Glasgow decision, part of which would be included in final COP26 outcome, asked for commitments from 196 countries to boost their climate targets by 2023 to keep the warming limit goal of 1.5 degree Celsius alive and to submit by next year their long term decarbonisation strategies to be on promised net-zero trajectory. The brackets in the text reflect unresolved issues of finance, adaptation, loss & damage and carbon market (Article 6). On a positive note, the text for the first time called for acceleration of the phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Though the draft, which is to be discussed by countries over the next two days to finalise the COP26 outcome, welcomed the $100 billion delivery plan, there has been no push to accelerate funding. As far as the issue of ‘loss and damage’ (compensating countries hit by extreme weather events) is concerned, it is recognised in the main text, but it lacks specifics. Underlining that the developed countries must urgently step forward to fulfil their obligations and mobilize at least $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025, and initiate, at COP 26, deliberations on a formal process for setting a new collective quantified goal on finance under the Paris Agreement, they said "The new collective quantified goal must build from a floor of $100 billion per year, be significantly publicly funded with greater transparency and predictability and take a balanced approach towards mitigation and adaptation in light of the needs and priorities of developing countries."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/basic-nations-oppose-eus-carbon-border-tax-proposal/articleshow/87636140.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It is not a charity. It’s their (affluent nations) historical responsibility. This is what they had promised to do.” Responding to the COP26 president Alok Sharma’s answer to a question by TOI last week that the 'finance delivery plan' already has a mechanism to monitor its progress as demanded by India and the OECD has been doing it in its current process, Yadav said this is their (OECD) own mechanism. “We want such a monitoring mechanism to come from COP26,” said the minister. The minister said that whatever India has done so far, it has done it with its own finances. “India has over 7,000 km of coastline. The country too is quite vulnerable to climate change. So, we too need finance for our future actions. Besides, whatever India has been saying, it has been for all developing countries.

Since most of the year has already gone by, it has been decided to restore the funds for the remaining part of the financial year that ends on March 31. An MP will get Rs 2 crore for development activities for 2021-22. From the next financial year, the stipulated annual grant of Rs 5 crore will be given to each MP. The decision will be welcomed by MPs, many of whom felt that a means to reach constituents had been cut off harming their outreach efforts. Opinion on the utility of the scheme, however, remains divided with it also being seen as prone to manipulation and graft. Under the MPLAD scheme, all the MPs can recommend development programmes involving expenditure of Rs 5 crore every year in their constituencies. For managing the health and adverse impacts of Covid-19 in the society, the Cabinet in its meeting held on April 2020, had decided not to operate MPLADS during the FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 and place the funds at the disposal of the finance ministry for managing the impacts of the pandemic. “The country is now on the road to economic recovery and the scheme continues to be beneficial for the creation of durable community assets, in fulfilling the aspirations of locally felt needs of the Community, in skill development and creation of jobs across the country, thereby helpful in achieving the objective of Atamnirbhar Bharat,” the government said in a statement issued after the cabinet meeting. “All parliamentarians had enthusiastically given their consent to contribute in the fight against Covid,” Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur said at the post cabinet media briefing. He said taking into account the recovery and improvement in the economic situation and even growth seen in various sectors, a decision has been taken to restore MPLAD scheme for the remainder period of the fiscal 2021-22. From 2022-23 to 2025-26 funds (co-terminus with the period of 15th Finance Commission) will be released under the scheme at the rate of Rs 5 crore per annum to them in two instalments of Rs 2.5 crore each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cabinet-restores-mplad-scheme-after-covid-break/articleshow/87636215.cms||---

The ministry’s views, finalised after consultations with the law ministry, removes a false sense of security against insolvency proceedings for discoms and gives debtors a fresh legal ammunition for recovering dues. The issue arose after the Tamil Nadu government wrote to the ministry on September 16, saying the provisions of IBC insolvency do not apply to discoms since they were discharging public functions as an extension of the state government. It also said there was a conflict between the IBC and the Electricity Act. The Tamil Nadu letter was prompted by a writ petition for initiation of proceedings under IBC filed in the Madras high court by South India Corporation Pvt Ltd. In its letter dated November 8, the ministry cited Supreme Court ruling in several cases, saying state-run discoms are set up under the Companies Act and not under statute like the NHAI. So they are not an extension of the state government. It also said the matter has been “settled” by the Supreme Court. The ministry letter also said there was no dichotomy between the provisions of IBC and the Electricity Act, which applies to different operational issues of discoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-immunity-from-ibc-for-state-discoms-says-centre/articleshow/87636326.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Malik also alleged that during Fadnavis’s tenure as CM, persons with criminal backgrounds were appointed on state-run boards and corporations and given the status of cabinet minister or junior minister. Malik claimed Fadnavis had taken the lead in criminalisation of politics and shielded criminals involved in the fake currency scam which allegedly took place after demonetisation in 2016. He also alleged Fadnavis was making all attempts to divert attention from the controversy surrounding NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who carried out, in Malik’s words, a “fake” raid on a cruise ship on October 2. “Who is Riyaz Bhati? During the tenure of Fadnavis as CM, Bhati was caught with fake passports, first in 2015 and then in 2020. I don’t know whether he was arrested or not, but he was let off in two days. Bhati was seen with Fadnavis at several BJP events. I don’t want to drag the PM into the controversy but Bhati had access to the PM’s event and even clicked pictures with him. He secured entry from the VIP gate. If entry for the PM’s event is so strict, how did Bhati secure a pass for it? Ultimately, the matter was settled after dons from other countries called the IPS officers here,” Malik said on Wednesday. He alleged Fadnavis had protected a person who had been caught with fake currency notes worth Rs 14.56 crore in BKC area. A few people were then arrested from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune, he said. “... Following demonetisation, in most states, massive fake currency was seized. On October 8, 2017, DRI seized fake currency worth Rs 14.56 crore, but the case was suppressed with the blessings of Fadnavis. Notes with a face walue of Rs 8.8 lakh were then shown as seizure. At that time, Wankhede was in charge of DRI,” Malik claimed. Fadnavis, he alleged, appointed Hazi Arafat Shaikh, elder brother of one of the accused in the fake currency case, Imran Alam Shaikh, as chairman of the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. Hyder Azam, was appointed chairman of the Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Corporation, he said. Azam had been accused of illegally bringing in people from Bangladesh to Mumbai, and his second wife is a citizen of Bangladesh, Malik claimed. Malad police were investigating her antecedents, but all cases were suppressed on Fadnavis’s instructions, the minister alleged. Munna Yadav from Nagpur, alleged to have a criminal background, was appointed chairman of Constructions Workers’ Board and given the rank of junior minister, Malik said.

The two will jointly build, sell and market multi-cloud services. This will include Airtel offering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to its 4,000 enterprise customers, and 1 million small & medium business customers. Oracle will leverage Airtel’s data centre network, Nxtra, to expand its cloud presence in India. The two will set up and manage a cloud centre of excellence (CoE) in Gurgaon, with a dedicated team of specialists from both organisations. And they will undertake joint IP (intellectual property) solution development in areas like 5G, multi-cloud, B2B customer experience, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and unified communications. Kumar said a lot of customers are coming to them asking for 5G solutions. Ajay Chitkara, CEO of Airtel Business, the division that offers enterprise solutions, said there are some clear demands from the market. One, he said, is around the regulated ecosystem – the government and other regulated customers want data to be protected and ensure the data is inside the India data centre. “That’s a very unique proposition that we are building together,” he said. Another is around 5G, where the two will use Airtel’s edge data centres – of which there are 120 now – to build specific use cases. “A third set of demands are around latency specific applications, where customers will take data centre, cloud and connectivity as a combined offering on a consumption basis (paying based on consumption). Currently, cloud is consumption based and network is contract based,” Chitkara said.  Airtel’s B2B business is now one of its fastest growing segments. Chitkara said Airtel is committed to invest $750 million in the business over the next three years, and the Oracle partnership is part of that. Apart from the smaller edge data centres (each of 1 to 10 MW), Airtel also has 10 large data centres (30 to 100 MW). Airtel works with other major cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud too. Kumar and Chitkara said demand for public cloud is soaring. Kumar said India is one of Oracle’s fastest growing markets worldwide. “We are seeing high double-digit business growth and we expect this will continue for the next 4-5 years,” he said. The company’s two local cloud regions (Mumbai and Hyderabad) are almost running at peak capacity. It is expanding the Mumbai one, and that will be available early next year. “India perhaps is the only market outside of the US to further expand local cloud presence,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oracle-airtel-enter-into-major-cloud-partnership/articleshow/87636480.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||CM: No plans to appoint dedicated min for B’luru||Bengaluru: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has decided not to appoint a dedicated minister for Bengaluru, at least for now. During his recent visit to TOI office as Guest Editor, Bommai categorically said he will continue to hold the Bengaluru development portfolio because it is convenient for him to take administrative and financial decisions. “Being the finance minister, I can ensure adequate funds for development works and quick administrative clearance for implementation of projects,” he added. Some city MLAs, however, see the move as risky considering BJP needs to strengthen its organisational structure in the run up to BBMP elections, which is likely to be held early next year. “There are seven ministers from Bengaluru. One of them should have been given the responsibility, especially keeping BBMP polls in mind, which are a few months away. You need a minister to lead the party’s campaign and set the tone for the polls. The CM cannot take a risk as he cannot dedicate time for party activities,” a minister said. Sources said the CM was initially inclined on allocating the portfolio to Ashoka in view of the polls, but decided otherwise following stiff opposition from city MLAs. Bommai has now asked Ashoka to oversee the implementation of Amrit schemes. The Congress has appointed R Ramalinga Reddy as the KPCC working president for his considerable influence in the capital city. “If BJP aims to come back to power in the civic body polls, it needs the support of all party MLAs and ministers from Bengaluru. Had the ministry been given to any one of the seven, there would be bad blood. By retaining it, the CM can make all ministers work in tandem,” a BJP MLA pointed out. “It is best the CM retains the portfolio as it’d mean there will be equitable distribution of funds among legislators for their constituencies. Unlike his predecessor, Bommai is easily accessible. It is a win-win situation for all,” said urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj. “If the CM proves his mettle by developing Bengaluru, it will give other urban centres in Karnataka confidence of seeing better development,” said Chickpet BJP MLA Uday Garudachar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-no-plans-to-appoint-dedicated-min-for-bluru/articleshow/87636483.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Stroke incidence highest in Cuttack, mortality highest in Varanasi: Study||BENGALURU: A study on stroke incidence and mortality associated with it in five districts of India, taken up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shown huge variance and treatment gap. As per the study conducted for a two year period during 2018 and 2019, 187 people in every lakh population suffer strokes in Cuttack, Odisha, every year, while in Cachar district of Assam it was 96 stroke cases per lakh population. Deaths due to stroke within 28 days of onset of stroke ranged from 15 per lakh population in Kota, Rajasthan to 46 deaths per lakh population in Varanasi. The study ‘Stroke Incidence and Mortality: A Report of the Population based Stroke Registries, India’ prepared by the ICMR’s Bengaluru unit National Centre for Disease Informatics & Research (NCDIR) was released on Wednesday. To address the nationwide gap in data on stroke incidence among adults in India, population based stroke registry was set up in five different regions of the country, such as North-Varanasi, West-Kota, East-Cuttack, South-Tirunelveli and North-east-Cachar. Dr Prashant Mathur, Director, ICMR-NCDIR said that it’s crucial to have reliable, ongoing systematically collected data on stroke, its risk factors and outcome as part of setting up stroke surveillance in the country which will inform policy and programmatic actions. SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack district of Odisha, Silchar Medical College and Hospital in Cachar district of Assam, Tirunelveli Medical College in Tamil Nadu, Government Medical College in Kota of Rajasthan and Institute of Medical Sciences along with Banaras Hindu University (BHU) from Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh were part of the study. Speaking to TOI, Dr Prashant Mathur, Director, ICMR - National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research further said that the findings of the survey, where the highest incidence of stroke was seen in Cuttack should not be seen as representative of the stroke situation across eastern India. “It can mean that something similar is happening in the eastern part. There will be differences within the the eastern India too. It’s only a regional representation and not from the epidemiological perspective. We have picked up cases that were brought to the government medical colleges of the five districts,” he explained. Among the stroke cases reported, two-thirds were in males, and the majority (89%) occurred in the age group of 45 years and above. According to Dr Mathur, the incidence of stroke is more among men as per the study. “This needs to be further looked into. This also reflects that the healthcare seeking behaviour is seen more among men,” Dr Mathur told TOI. The study also analysed three major risk factors associated with stroke patients. While in Cuttack, hypertension was a risk factor in 75% of the cases, and where it was least in Kota at 40.3 %. Diabetes as a risk factor was seen in 35.1% of the cases in Varanasi and it was least in Cachar at 15.9%. Tobacco was another risk factor analysed: highest in Cuttack at 62.4 % and least in Thirunalveli at 23.1 %. The stroke mortality at 28 days after the onset of stroke was highest in Varanasi at 46.6 %, and it was lowest in Kota at 15.3 %. “Mortality rate depends on factors such as late arrival of the patients to the hospital, establishing the right diagnosis, initiating thrombolytic therapy and a combination of all these. Varanasi may not be equipped to treat, diagnose stroke cases,” said Dr Mathur. Mid-level cities undergoing rapid changesThe researchers did not include the metropolitan cities for the study. “We wanted to look at what’s happening in mid-level cities, as they are undergoing health and epidemiological transition. The registry will be a long term set up, which will study the pattern for next 20-30 years. Metros have a lot of migration population, whereas we wanted to study the stable population and these districts were chosen,” said Dr Mathur. He added that the study is ongoing and in next two years, the data will be analysed once again, based on the stroke registries at the government medical college hospitals in the said districts. He said that the union ministry of health has mandated Multidisciplinary Research Units set up in over 70 government medical colleges across the country with a mandate to take up research in noncommunicable diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/stroke-incidence-highest-in-cuttack-mortality-highest-in-varanasi-study/articleshow/87639853.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The court hoped the matter will be taken up urgently. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi cited its August 31 order and said time had been granted but the additional government advocate is still not in a position to explain why the matter related to a fresh tender hasn’t been placed before the cabinet and additional 10 days are being sought for seeking instructions. “We fail to understand why GPS cannot be installed in the existing 108 ambulances and a control room set up to man them so that services are provided during an emergency and people who require immediate medical attention are sent to hospitals,” the bench said. The court has now granted two weeks to the additional government advocate to seek instructions and hoped the government will take up the issue with urgency and do the needful. ‘Dharwad hosp should function by March 2022’ The high court on Wednesday directed the government and authorities concerned to ensure Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences functions as a higher psychiatric hospital as per norms fixed and make it operational from March 1, 2022. A division bench passed this order while hearing a suo motu PIL filed by Karnataka State Legal Services Authority on implementation of Mental Healthcare Act. The bench perused the affidavit filed by Naveen Raj Singh, principal secretary to the medical education department, and said the court is not satisfied with the explanation given for the delay in implementation, particularly installation of an MRI machine at Dimhans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-must-act-on-gps-ambulances-urgently-hc/articleshow/87636486.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC quashes OCI students’ plea on equating them with NRIs||Bengaluru: The high court dismissed a batch of petitions filed by Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card holder students, challenging the March 4, 2021 notification issued by the central government, stating they are “devoid of merit”. As per the notification, OCI card holders are not eligible for admission against any seat in professional education colleges reserved exclusively for Indian citizens, other than those availing under NRI quota and supernumerary seats. However, considering the special circumstances of the case, Justice Krishna S Dixit said all the petitioners are permitted to stake claim for admission consistent with the interim reliefs made in favour of many of them, subject to eligibility and qualification. Ten days have been granted to the petitioners to produce requisite documents before Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA). “There is one common characteristic discernible from the three notifications of 2005, 2009 and 2021. All OCI cardholders are foreigners but not all foreigners are OCI cardholders. These notifications treat OCI card holders on par with NRIs. The latter are citizens whereas the former are not. That these notifications in a sense restrict the educational rights of NRIs even when they are citizens qua the domiciling citizens, is obvious. They confer on OCI card holders educational rights at par with NRIs though they are not citizens. So far as the claim to governmental seats and non-supernumerary seats is concerned, both the citizenship and domicile are not treated as central to the policy criterion, although they have some ‘non-policy significance’. In other words, these notifications are ‘citizenship-neutral’. They are ‘domicile-neutral’ too. Even if the OCI cardholders assumedly happen to be the citizens of India and have domiciled in the state of Karnataka, the factor pales into insignificance,” Justice Dixit noted. Petitioners Alekhya Ponnekanti and others had argued that the notification takes away certain rights of professional education vested in them by virtue of earlier notifications dated April 11, 2005 and January 5, 2009. They contended that they are domiciled in India and have pursued their schooling for more than seven years and therefore, ought to be treated on a different footing. The Centre countered it, saying the impugned part of the 2021 notification was incorporated to protect the interest of the domiciling natives who lack the competitive edge vis-a-vis the OCI cardholders and NRIs who have greater exposure to the outer world, by virtue of birth and upbringing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-quashes-oci-students-plea-on-equating-them-with-nris/articleshow/87636488.cms||---

Dr Rakesh Shetty, in his late 40s and owner of Sri Maruti hospital, Bagalur near Yelahanka, was taken into custody based on a complaint filed by V Murali, 26, from Yelahanka on November 8. According to Murali, apart from assaulting, Rakesh Shetty and his friends urinated in his mouth and on his body. DCP (north-east) CK Baba said search is on for three more suspects. “We arrested the prime accused within eight hours of registration of the FIR,” he said. The doctor is in judicial custody. Murali used to ferry Shetty and his staff in his autorickshaw. “On November 4 evening, Dr Shetty asked me to transport food and other items from a friend’s house to a club in Satanur near Bagalur, where he and around 12 friends were partying. I took the food items to the club and served them. Shetty asked me to go back to his hospital and bring another doctor called Swami. As I was getting late to go home and meet my relatives, I told Swamy to hurry up. But he made me wait for more than an hour and I objected to that. He came out at 10.30pm. Upon reaching the club, Swamy told Shetty that I insulted him in front of everyone,” Murali said. An enraged Shetty abused him saying he didn’t have respect for doctors. “They forced me to consume alcohol and locked me inside the bathroom. Using beer bottles and other objects, they beat me up. They urinated in my mouth and on my body. I lost consciousness. Next morning, I came out of the club and using someone’s phone, I called my parents. They shifted me to Yelahanka hospital,” he stated. An officer said the injuries on Murali’s body, the doctor’s medical certificates and CCTV footage from the scene of crime confirmed the attack. The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) 342 (wrongful confinement) 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) besides the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/doc-in-soup-for-locking-up-and-assaulting-auto-driver/articleshow/87636491.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||‘Not convicted in any case is not a ground for bail’||Bengaluru: Not being convicted in any case is not a ground to grant bail, the high court said while rejecting bail to a person accused of illegally storing huge quantities of liquor and toddy at his house. Rejecting the petition filed by Nagaraj from Bidar, Justice HP Sandesh said the petitioner stored 7,200 litres of liquor and 8 litres of toddy in his house and since he has been committing similar offences from 2017-18 and six cases have been registered against him, it is not a fit case to exercise discretion under section 439 of CrPC for granting bail. “If he is enlarged on bail, he will again indulge in a similar offence. Not convicted in any case is not a ground to grant him bail,” the judge said. Nagaraj had sought for bail in a case registered by the excise inspector for the offences punishable under Sections 14, 15, 32(1), 38 (A) of Karnataka Excise Act-1965. He claimed that though five cases were registered against him, he has not been convicted in any of them and false cases had been registered. According to him, the offences were not punishable with death or life imprisonment. The government advocate argued that the petitioner is a habitual offender. When the excise inspector raided his house, he escaped and was caught later. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/not-convicted-in-any-case-is-not-a-ground-for-bail/articleshow/87636492.cms||---

The suspended engineers — Premananda Kumar RG from SWD division and MG Nagaraju from road infrastructure division — will be eligible for livelihood allowance, special commissioner (administration), BBMP, Dayanand KA, said. He added the suspension was not on the basis of complaints from citizens, but due to shortcomings noticed by chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta during one of his inspections. The major roads engineer was found to have taken inadequate action towards the upkeep of the roads. The stormwater drain engineer was found to be absent from duty and unresponsive during flooding of some areas. Gupta said: “There are such issues across the city, but this event should set an example for the rest of the officials to pull up their socks .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-suspends-2-engineers-over-bad-roads-flooding/articleshow/87636493.cms||---

But his associate Sujit Poojari Kudkoli was found guilty and awarded a jail term of two years and fined Rs 20,000 for illegally procuring a pistol. The prosecution failed to establish criminal conspiracy by Raja and Kudkoli to extort money from four businessmen in Bengaluru and also procure illegal firearms to use them to threaten their targets. “Documents produced on behalf of the prosecution failed to establish the fact of criminal conspiracy entered between accused no.1 (Raja) and accused no.2 (Kudkoli) for supply of arms and extortion of money. No supportive call details reports were produced by the prosecution to show that accused no.1 made threatening calls to demand money from the businessmen. The call details report is not sufficient to establish that threatening phone calls were made by Raja... Therefore, this court is of the opinion that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of the offences the accused duo is charged of,” the judgment reads. Central Crime Branch (CCB) police had arrested Kudkoli from Anand Rao Circle on April 25, 2014 and seized a country-made pistol and magazine from him. The prosecution alleged that Kudkoli worked for Raja and used to threaten businessmen for extortion on Raja’s direction. The prosecution only proved that the pistol was illegally procured by Kudkoli and hence, he was convicted under the Arms Act. Other charges against him, including extortion and criminal conspiracy, were not established. The 64th additional city civil and sessions court judge Rajeshwara had pronounced the judgment on October 22. This is the second acquittal in over 40 cases filed against Raja in Bengaluru. In April 2018, he was acquitted in a murder conspiracy case filed by High Grounds police. Raja , 50, was on the run for over 18 years in connection with criminal cases filed against him in Karnataka and Maharashtra. One of the sensational cases in which he was allegedly involved was the gunning down of BJP leader RN Nayak in Uttara Kannada district’s Ankola town in 2013. A red corner notice had been issued by Interpol and he’d been detained in Morocco on February 12, 2015 after he was found to be staying in that country under a fake identity. Subsequently, he was extradited to India in August the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/extortion-case-relief-for-bannanje-raja/articleshow/87636495.cms||Santosh Kumar

---||Bengaluru||Govt sets ground for revised transit-oriented policy in B’luru||Bengaluru: Karnataka has initiated the process for implementing the revised transit-oriented development (TOD) policy that aims to develop mass rapid transport corridors to minimise the need for personal vehicles in Bengaluru. “We held a preliminary meeting and some more will follow before we get down to the implementation stage,” said Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary, urban development department. TOD in Karnataka has been in the draft stage since February 2019. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) had first released a draft TOD policy two years ago after the Centre framed guidelines for major cities on how to implement it. “It could not be implemented for practical and political reasons,” said officials. Now, the Directorate of Land Transport (DULT) has readied a revised policy, which may soon be placed before the cabinet, they added. “We have provided inputs to the new policy and brought some changes to the earlier one. We are awaiting the government’s nod,” said Anjum Pervez, MD of BMRCL. According to the draft policy, the population of Bengaluru Metropolitan Region is expected to go up from 9 million in 2011 to over 20 million by 2031. As of now, share of public transport in the city is just about 48 per cent and needs to be increased to 70. It can be achieved by enhancing accessibility and mobility, which requires huge investments to expand mass transit systems — Metro and commuter rail. Bhaskar Nagendrappa, president of CREDAI-Bengaluru, said the benefits of TOD will be immense as public ridership will go up when people can easily access jobs, education, healthcare, etc, by using the transit. “With growing Metro rail connectivity, the city has scores of opportunities for transit-oriented development with good bus transportation...,” he added. Setting up neighbourhoods around areas of transit will promote walk-to-work and cycle-to-work culture and, therefore result in healthier lifestyles, lower pollution, higher foot traffic for commercial businesses and decreased suburban sprawl, said Suresh Hari, former president of CREDAI. However, some experts are still sceptical. Monica Matthias, director, Hoysala Projects, said implementing TOD in Bengaluru is a challenge because of various reasons. “In the core city (Zone A), it is a challenge because of high density and high property values. Also, the TOD policy pertaining to Bengaluru considers mass transit like Metro and not buses as a means of transport. But buses are a more popular means of commuting in Bengaluru. The city actually needs a mobility plan... The National Urban Transport Policy emphasises a mobility plan that integrates both land use and transport planning, through TOD,” Matthias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-sets-ground-for-revised-transit-oriented-policy-in-bluru/articleshow/87636497.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Two Congress leaders part of bitcoin scam: Karnataka CM||BENGALURU: The ongoing war of words between the ruling BJP and opposition Congress over the alleged multi-crore bitcoin scam intensified on Wednesday with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai claiming that two Congress leaders are involved in the racket. “There are names of Congress leaders in the bitcoin scam. Let the Congress worry about that instead of hurling false allegations at us,” Bommai told reporters in Delhi. He was reacting to Congress MLA and former minister Priyank Kharge’s tweet that if the bitcoin scandal is investigated thoroughly and transparently, the BJP government in Karnataka will soon see a third chief minister, indirectly suggesting Bommai will be removed. The CM further said that his government has an open mind as far as this issue is concerned. “Let them tell what is the crime and who is the beneficiary. Let the opposition give some documents on it. We will get it investigated. We have nothing to hide,” he said. Reacting to the CM’s allegation, Congress leaders dared the former to disclose the names of their leaders and arrest them. “If Congress leaders are involved, why is the government keeping quiet? Why no arrests are being made,” opposition leader Siddaramaiah asked. KPCC president DK Shivakumar said the home minister should make public the details of the chargesheet in which the names of two Congress leaders are allegedly mentioned. “What is he (home minister) waiting for? Let him tell the people. He must also talk about the letter written to the PM and the name of the person who wrote it,” he added. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy said discussions about the bitcoin scam had been going on since 2016-17 when the Congress was in power. “Had Siddaramaiah taken stringent action then, the scam would not have been so big,” he added. Kumaraswamy alleged that both the BJP and Congress have been working overtime to bury the bitcoin scam and the ongoing blame game is part of their plan. He also claimed that all details of the scam had reached the Prime Minister’s Office. RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa alleged that Congress has been blackmailing the government by saying the CM and IAS officers are involved in the bitcoin scam. “If they have any documents to prove their allegations, let them go to court,” he added. Eshwarappa said Bommai will continue as CM till the end of his tenure. Earlier, speaking to reporters in Kalaburagi, Kharge said t he has information that the hacker had hacked into three bitcoin exchanges, 14 websites, including 10 poker websites, and exploited malwares and made away with Rs 2,283 crore. Police had also recovered 31 bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore. “But these things have been left out of the chargesheet. We also want to know why was a hacker granted bail after claims that he had hacked into government websites,” Kharge asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-cong-leaders-part-of-bitcoin-scam-cm/articleshow/87636504.cms||---

At this level, the nine-year-old startup is more valuable than traditional giants such as Coal India, BPCL, Britannia and just below M&M and Bajaj Auto. For the former investment banker. it has been a dream journey so far—the sizzling stock market debut of the company has already catapulted her as the richest self-made woman in India, with a net worth of close to $7 billion. On listing the stock price of FSN E-Commerce, which runs Nykaa, almost doubled to Rs 2,001 on BSE, up from its IPO price of Rs 1,125. It ended the debut session on the stock market at Rs 2,207 and a market capitalisation of Rs 1.04 lakh crore, or a little more than $14 billion. The bidding for its Rs 5,349-crore IPO had closed on November 1 with an oversubscription of 81.7 times. The high market capitalisation of Nykaa also makes it one of the most valued stocks on BSE. At the debut-day closing price it had a price-to-earnings ratio of 1,588 times compared to the IPO valuation of 839 times for this online cosmetics retailer. Why did Nayar, who cut her teeth in investment banking, choose cosmetics and fashion? Nayar says she entered a sector about which she knew almost nothing. "I looked around for ideas and saw that beauty was an underdeveloped market in India compared to the West or even Japan and South Korea. It looked like an opportunity and since we are professionals with no deep pockets, I wanted to start in a sunrise industry before many others jumped in," she told TOI. Before ringing the opening bell at the National Stock Exchange on Wednesday, she told the gathered audience, "I started Nykaa at the age of 50 with no experience in technology or beauty or fashion. I hope the Nykaa journey can inspire each of you to be the nayika (heroine) of your lives." She noted she was in an established career which would often see her help entrepreneurs in the position she is in today. She said she saw few believers and many naysayers when she started Nykaa. "The beauty industry was nascent and customers were wary of ordering online given counterfeit products," she added. Having earned a degree in commerce from Sydenham College, Mumbai, Nayar did an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad in the 1980s. She spent close to two decades with Kotak Securities, rising to the position of managing director of Kotak Investment Banking before leaving it to begin her entrepreneurial journey. Perhaps entrepreneurship was in her blood. She is a Gujarati, born and raised in Mumbai. Her father ran a small bearings company, assisted by her mother. Nayar has said previously that household chatter revolved around investments, stock market and trade. Asked about her thoughts on the price pop of the shares, she says it is a combination of the growth potential that investors see in an underpenetrated market like India and the strong unit economics that saw the company turn black last fiscal. The beauty and personal care market in India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12% to $26 billion between 2019 and 2025, as per reports from consulting company RedSeer. Though the market dipped last year due to the pandemic, it is expected to pick up pace as more people shop online. "For an ecommerce company like ours, we have the right unit economics. We do not lose but make money on every order that we service. The balance between acquiring new customers and keeping unit economics intact is very important. If you don’t have that, you end up diluting your equity to get that growth," she cautions. Nayar says that small towns, which account for more than half of the topline, will continue to remain the growth drivers. While 95% of the total sales are online, the rest is from the 80 stores across the country. That is expected to go up to 15% as its stores and footfalls go up along with the pandemic receding. Nykaa had 7.1 million transacting customers till August this fiscal, up from 5.6 million in the whole of last year. Nykaa has over 1,500 brands with a comprehensive selection of makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrances, personal care, luxury and wellness products for women and men. It has a portfolio of luxury brands including Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder. The company's revenue grew 38% to Rs 2,440 crore last fiscal while profit was Rs 62 crore, against a loss of Rs 16 crore a year earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nykaas-dream-debut-founder-now-indias-richest-self-made-bizwoman/articleshow/87636423.cms||Avik Das

Read AlsoCovid prevented duty cut earlier: Petroleum and urban development minister Hardeep PuriNEW DELHI: Fuel prices have risen only 30% during the seven years of the Narendra Modi government against 70% in the similar intervals since 1973 and last week’s excise duty cut was aimed at “giving consumers relief” and a confidence over robust revenue collections as the economy was “firing on allSpeaking at the Times Now Summit, Gadkari said, “The reduction in excise duty has brought immediate relief and this was required. Linking this to the election is wrong. We did this after the bypoll results and not before the polls. We have one election or other every month. If we link all government decisions to elections, then we can’t do anything.” Gadkari said the government is taking multiple initiatives to reduce crude imports, which amounts to nearly Rs 8 lakh crore annually. He said initiatives such as higher ethanol blending in petrol, the introduction of flex engines, green hydrogen, bio-CNG and penetration of electric vehicles will substantially reduce India’s crude oil consumption in near future and will also reduce air pollution.

---||Delhi||38-year-old, under witness protection, shot in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: A 38-year-old man was found dead in Chhatarpur in south Delhi on Thursday morning. The man, who had been shot in the head, was a witness in a murder case registered at Mehrauli police station and had two security personnel protecting him. He had sent the pair home before the incident. A woman called the cops around 4.45am to inform them about the man lying dead on the fourth floor of the JMD Estate building. The deceased was identified as Sanjiv Sejwal, a resident of Lado Sarai. “A police team found Sejwal lying dead with a revolver by his side. The crime and forensics teams were called to the spot to carry out a detailed inspection and to comb for clues,” said a police officer. “The body was moved to a hospital for the post-mortem examination. We have established that on Wednesday night, Sejwal had come to JMD Estate to meet three friends and was partying with them. The woman caller was also at the party.” The initial inquest proceedings and police enquiries hint at a possible case of suicide. More details will be confirmed once the autopsy report is received. Police said that the CCTV footage from the area indicated Sejwal and friends had ordered food in the evening. The deceased’s friends left the party late at night. The investigators are trying to contact them to establish the sequence of the events that eventually culminated in Sejwal’s death. Police have seized the licensed pistol used in the alleged killing and sent it for analysis. “We found that Sejwal was a witness in a murder case in Mehrauli in which his nephew had been killed by some men over a monetary dispute in 2014. A charge-sheet was also filed in this case in 2017,” the officer revealed. “Since Sejwal had recorded his statement before the court as a witness, two personal security officers had been attached to him. However, before he died on Wednesday night, he sent both his bodyguards home.” The preliminary investigation in the death has also revealed that Sejwal was involved in an IPL betting scandal last year in which six men were arrested from south Delhi’s Mehrauli. Police are probing several angles, including a property deal that went wrong or personal enmity, that could have led to the man’s death. Sejwal is survived by his wife and two children who live in Lado Sarai. Harsh Vardhan, additional deputy commissioner of police (South), said that at the time of the incident the woman caller and Sejwal were the only persons present in the rented apartment. She is also being questioned. “The matter is being probed from all possible angles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/38-year-old-under-witness-protection-shot-in-s-delhi/articleshow/87655173.cms||---

The governor said that the growth target of 9.5% also looked achievable, however, there were headwinds in the form of global development. The governor said that there was already a rebalancing of the liquidity in the money markets but, as long as the central bank maintained its accommodative stance, funds would be surplus. “Prices of energy, steel and commodities have gone up but there is a sense among some analysts that they have peaked. We expect that it will be in line with our projection of 5.3% as positive developments emerging from petrol/diesel cut have not been factored in,” he said. He was speaking during a fireside chat in a banking summit organised by a business daily. Das, however, cautioned against global developments. “Global headwinds are coming up. Growth in most developed and advanced economies, which was positive until second quarter, seems to have moderated. Global growth of 5.9% target may undershoot because of shortage of semiconductors and shipping containers. Freight charges and commodity prices have gone up. Covid seems to be a rising concern in some countries in Asia and the West,” said Das. On retail loans overtaking corporate loans for the first time, Das said that banks need to price risks properly and decide on the extent of exposure they want to take in each sector. “What percentage should go for retail and housing is for bank boards to decide and allocate risk pricing,” said Das. Pointing out the growth in home loans, Das said that this was a combination of the increased demand for large homes because of the pandemic, coupled with the record dip in interest rates. At the same time, Das said that the shift of corporates to the bond market was a positive development. “Over the last one year, corporates have accessed more funds from the bond market than bank funding. That is a positive development. When they go to the market, the market will decide the risk and price the bonds. So far as bank credit is concerned, our interactions show that there are signs of investment pick-up,” he said. He added that his feedback from interactions with banks was that credit will pick up from next year. On the withdrawal of the liquidity infused during the pandemic, Das said that the measures were designed for a finite period and the liquidty would be rebalanced. He said that the money released from reduction in cash reserve ratio has come back and part of the long-term repo operations money has also returned. The RBI was impounding little below Rs 7 lakh crore through its reverse repo window. “So, the liquidity is getting rebalanced. As long as the policy stance is accommodative, liquidity will be in surplus, but the excess liquidity will be rebalanced,” he said. Das said that despite the expansion of the RBI balance sheet, the need for capital infusion into the central bank was “kind of a situation that will not arise”. Das again cautioned against cryptocurrencies and said that the investor base number in India was exaggerated. “Crypto, whatever name you call it, is a serious concern from the point of view of macroeconomic and financial stability. How the issue is to be dealt with, we have given recommendations to the government. Yes, in terms of volumes and amount invested, the number is growing. But the number of investors, the sense I have, I am not sure of the numbers being quoted,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tax-cuts-on-fuel-improve-inflation-outlook-rbi-guv/articleshow/87635339.cms||---

While the retail part was subscribed 1.7 times, the institutional part was subscribed 2.8 times and the part reserved for high net worth investors (HNIs) was subscribed just 24%, BSE data showed. Till day 2 (the previous day) of the offer, the IPO was subscribed 48%. The IPO for the tech-enabled payments solutions pioneer in India is set to be the largest such offering in India, ahead of Coal India’s Rs 15,200-crore in 2010. The IPO bidding round for Paytm, one of India’s leading startups, closed the same day Nykaa — another startup — listed succesfully on the stock exchanges with a valuation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore. In July, the highly successful listing of Zomato, a startup that is one of the leaders in India’s food delivery industry, had paved the way for many more to take the route to go public, market players said. According to sources, some of the investors which bought Paytm shares during the anchor round, which closed on November 3, have also put in large bids during the just-closed bidding round. One of the largest pension funds in the world, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), put in a bid worth nearly Rs 1,300 crore, they said. A spokesperson for Paytm said the company’s successful closing of the IPO bidding round was a testament to the India story, its startup ecosystem and the depth of the Indian capital markets that enabled it to reach this milestone.  “Our belief in the power of Indian tech dominance stands proven,” the spokesperson said. “We hope to continue to strive and drive financial inclusion for the underserved and unserved population of the country.” In its anchor round, the company had raised Rs 8,235 crore. In addition to CPPIB, global fund management majors like Blackrock, the government of Singapore, UBS and a host of other entities had picked up 3.8 crore shares of the company at the upper end of the Rs 2,080-2,150 price band for the IPO, a company release had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-ipo-closes-with-2x-subscription/articleshow/87635411.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi chief hints at enhanced ESG rules||MUMBAI: Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi on Wednesday said that Indian legislation was ahead of the curve in formulating rules for adoption of practices that promoted ESG (environment, sustainability & governance) by the corporate sector. The top markets regulator further pointed out that Sebi was also ahead of the curve in formulating rules to promote ESG practices for its regulated entities as early as 2012 and recently enhanced it with a new code. He hinted at enhancing some of its ESG rules and codes to be in tune with global investing & regulatory practices. Tyagi warned about ‘greenwashing’, a practice through which corporates and other entities take a path that seemingly promotes ESG, but the results do not reflect the same. The Sebi chief said ESG-focused funds in India will have to adhere to an investing process under new rules that will require these to invest only in those companies that follow the regulator’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). Tyagi was speaking at an even organised by industry trade body Ficci. Tyagi also hinted at some forthcoming changes to how listed Indian companies carry out their ESG initiatives. He said the international forum for securities regulators, International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is in the process of publishing its report on ‘ESG Ratings and ESG Data Providers’, which would include recommendations on these entities, along with regulatory and supervisory approaches with respect to the same. He said that Sebi was keenly watching international developments in this space and would soon take a call on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-chief-hints-at-enhanced-esg-rules/articleshow/87635428.cms||---
---||Business||Mutual fund assets, monthly SIP flows hit record in October||MUMBAI: Growing investor interest about mutual funds helped assets managed by Indian MFs rise to a record high of Rs 37.3 lakh crore in October, up from Rs 36.7 lakh crore in September and Rs 28.2 lakh crore a year earlier. During the month, contributions through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route also rose to a new record high at Rs 10,519 crore, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, net positive flows during October in all categories of open-ended MF schemes — be it debt, equity, hybrid, solutions-oriented, index, fund of funds or ETFs — coupled with continued buoyancy in SIP flows, which are at a historic high, boosted overall Indian MF industry assets to a record level. During October, net inflows through all the debt schemes together was nearly Rs 13,000 crore, while through the equity schemes it was Rs 5,215 crore. However, as the market is hovering at record high levels, investors are also showing their preference for hybrid schemes, industry players said. During the month, net inflows through the hybrid schemes was at Rs 10,437 crore. Investors’ rising preference for passive investing could be seen from a net inflow of Rs 10,759 crore, they said. AMFI data also showed that investors were taking money off closed-ended and ELSS schemes, with the month’s figures at Rs 1,082 crore and Rs 136 crore. The data from industry trade body further showed that average AUM at the end of October was at Rs 38.2 lakh crore, another record high. It also showed that the number of MF folios were at 11.4 crore while the corresponding number under retail schemes were at 9.3 crore, both all-time high numbers. The number of SIP accounts at the end of October was 4.6 crore, up from nearly 4.5 crore a month ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-assets-monthly-sip-flows-hit-record-in-oct/articleshow/87635387.cms||---
---||Business||RBI’s global hackathon to take digital payments beyond smartphones and OTPs||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced its first global hackathon to take digital payments beyond the present limitations of mobile phones and OTPs and to make them safer. The first edition of the central bank’s HaRBInger 2021 aims to identify and develop solutions that have the potential to make digital payments accessible to the under-served, enhance the ease of payments and user experience while strengthening the security of digital payments and promoting customer protection. Participants in the challenge (open to all over 18 years) have an opportunity to win Rs 40 lakh. The four challenge areas are innovative, easy-to-use, non-mobile digital payment solutions for converting small-ticket cash transactions to digital mode, context-based retail payments to remove the physical act of payment while transacting in-store, alternative to OTP and PIN for authenticating digital payments and developing a tool that will monitor social media analysis. The hackathon is owned and sponsored by the RBI and is hosted on Application Programming Interface Exchange (APIX) platform. A participant has to register online throught the link provided on the RBI’s website. “The challenge has been to sustain the growth in payments and ensure a shift in customer behaviour towards the vision of a less-cash society by creating a framework of robust, convenient, accessible, low cost and secure digital payment and settlement system,” the RBI said. The RBI note on the hackathon said that to onboard the underprivileged and underserved faction of the society to digital payments, non-mobile, swift and easy-to-use innovative solutions for converting small value cash payments of an amount less than Rs 100 to digital mode, needs to be explored. This would enhance the reach of digital payments and enable greater inclusion of the underserved into the mainstream. The context-based retail payments are aimed at removing the physical act of payment from the payment experience. “Context-based payments require no direct interaction between the customer and the merchant. It is mostly contingent on completion of an underlying activity and may include automatic payment at grocery stores once a customer exits the store,” the RBI said. It added that different use cases in the retail segment can be thought of to enable a seamless payment experience which may include an application. The solutions may also focus on consent mechanism, fraud prevention and security features besides enhancing the user experience. The search for alternatives to PIN and One-Time Password (OTP) is driven by the fact that these are received by the remitter over his mobile phone. “While the SMS through which the OTP is received is not an encrypted secure messaging system, the instances of digital payment frauds where the users are tricked into sharing the OTP have also been observed. As such, an alternate smart secure authentication mechanism may result in more secure digital transactions,” the RBI said. Given that customers are now voicing their concerns largely on social media, the analysis of consumer complaints and concerns over platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram may facilitate the digital payment operators as well the regulator in taking proactive and swift action for consumer protection and fraud prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-global-hackathon-to-take-digital-payments-beyond-smartphones-and-otps/articleshow/87629592.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Vadodara||Uncertainty looms over Nyay Mandir||Vadodara: The fate of Nyay Mandir, built in 1896 at a cost of Rs 7lakh, today hangs in balance. Reason? Nobody knows how to utilize the magnanimous heritage structure that once served its time as the high court of the erstwhile Baroda state. Ahead of the elections last year, the state government had given the possession of the Nyay Mandir to the revenue department. However, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is yet to get its possession from the government, while much brainstorming to alter the original plan of developing a city museum and other facilities there has already taken place. It was decided way back in 2014 that a city museum will be developed in Nyay Mandir and that the VMC will work on the project. While it may not have possession of the building, VMC functionaries — particularly those from the elected wing of the civic body and the city unit of the BJP that rules VMC — seem to have different visions regarding its future. They do not seem to be on the same page. Sources said that some in the civic body were of an opinion that the VMC headquarter located in Khanderao Market should be shifted to Nyay Mandir. Khanderao Market is also a heritage building, but is bursting at its seams and ugly extensions and partitions have been made to it to accommodate more people or offices. The most recent incident being that of shifting of the office of the personal assistant (PA) of the mayor to an extension so that a washroom for the mayor could be accommodated in the place where the PA’s cabin existed. Nyay Mandir is much larger and is sufficient for the civic body’s needs. But many are objecting to this arguing that the building will be ruined like the Khanderao Market if alterations are made there as per requirement. There may be need for lifts, washrooms partitions electrical lines if it is put to use by VMC. At the other end, VMC had over a decade back discussed the plan of a new headquarter building which is yet to see the light of the day. Mayor Keyur Rokadiya said that several options had been discussed some time back. “We have not reached a conclusion yet. However, I will be meeting the chief minister after Diwali and request him to ensure that the buidling is handed over to us at the earliest,” he said. BJP city unit president Dr Vijay Shah who was actively involved in ensuring that the heritage building was handed over to the revenue department said that the VMC has to get the building first and only after that any decision could be arrived on. He said that there was a possibility that the building could accommodate both the VMC office and the city museum along with other facilities. A major concern in VMC is the expenses involved in the upkeep of the building. Whenever the civic body is given the possession of the building, it will also be responsible for its maintenance. The cash-strapped VMC may not find it easy to maintain the heritage structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/uncertainty-looms-over-nyay-mandir/articleshow/87633857.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Visakhapatnam||Cases wane but no room for complacency, warn experts||Visakhapatnam: Going by the daily Covid-19 infection incidence, Andhra Pradesh was well past the peak of the second wave at least five months ago. The state is currently reporting easily manageable case numbers. At least half the eligible adult population has completed its two-dose vaccine schedule, while the first dose coverage exceeds the 85% mark. The daily case positivity rate has dropped to less than 1%. But amid the significant drop in case numbers and increasing vaccination rates, a certain degree of complacency has crept in when it comes to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the state. When TOI visited several public places in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday, about 50% of the people were seen not wearing or not correctly wearing their masks. Crowds at public places are almost back to pre-Covid levels, leaving little room for complying with physical distancing norms. Vendors and traders, who are highly vulnerable to contracting the virus due to their transactions with hundreds of people a day, also seem to have let their guard down. Inquiries made by the TOI at various shops and pharmacies confirmed the trend of a drop in sales of face masks and sanitizers in the last three months. Experts, however, have raised warnings about the perils of complacency as several countries are still witnessing a record surge in cases. Speaking to TOI, Andhra Medical College principal Dr P V Sudhakar said the public should not be in a hurry to shun masks or social distancing. “There were numerous examples from across the globe how complacency would lead to a surge in case numbers and can spur the third wave. The decreasing daily case numbers should not lead to any complacency on the vaccination part or Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Sudhakar. State Covid-19 nodal officer and Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr K Rambabu said while the Covid-19 vaccine would help prevent serious illness, social distancing and masks are still key to prevent transmission of infection. “Vaccines and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour will be the only way to end the pandemic. Even after getting two shots, unmasked people can still contract the virus and transmit it to others. The health department requests the public to follow all Covid-19 guidelines to ensure no resurgence in case numbers,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cases-wane-but-no-room-for-complacency-warn-experts/articleshow/87634311.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Business||‘Biz families shouldn’t let age & ego ruin ties’||Mumbai: Asian family businesses are undergoing a pivotal shift, with over 30% of them likely to see a generational change in the next five years, says a report by Russell Reynolds Associates. Family businesses in India are increasingly looking to build consensus among members to resolve conflicts as the new generation comes with a different world view. TOI spoke to Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala for his insights on how family businesses can better manage the dynamics. His advice: Keep communication channels open to identify conflicts. “They should not be dictated by ego and age,” he says. Mariwala is in talks with the Indian School of Business and SP Jain Institute of Management and Research to develop case studies for students based on his book ‘Harsh Realities’, co-authored by management thinker Prof. Ram Charan. Excerpts: Despite rising feuds around succession planning, not all promoters realise the importance of managing such dynamics... What’s your advice? When a new generation enters the family business, it usually comes with an advanced educational background as compared to older members. The new generation is equipped with more knowledge and, in a fast-changing environment, it is far more tuned to the latest trends. More so with digital initiatives. They are living this change and have age on their side. They are not conditioned by the past unlike the older generation, whose understanding of the current changes may not be as good as that of the younger ones, though I am not saying they are not updated. The new generation usually is more ambitious and wants to create an impact. This is a very critical juncture in a family business. History has shown that whenever the next generation comes in, it brings in a certain degree of discontinuity in the way the business is handled. The key challenge for families is integrating the views of the younger generation with that of the older ones while keeping in mind what is good for the business. Families need to have open channels of communication, thereby identifying conflicts. They should not be dictated by ego and age. A family council can help large families, which can create a family constitution that will take care of not only the aspirations but also guide the family on all aspects, including the entry of youngsters into the business, the exit of older members, compensation, and job rotation. If differences of opinion within a family cannot be resolved, then one may have to take steps to divide the company either on the basis of ownership or on the basis of management. If irreconcilable differences still remain, then it’s better to split the business financially. So, there is no right answer. We have seen businesses where only two members of a family are fighting, and there are those which have survived many generations and are flourishing by creating supporting mechanisms. How do you see structures such as family governance evolving among Indian businesses? Since you have gone through a stressful family separation, what advice would you offer? Depending on the size and type of business, governance needs to be thought through at two levels. The first is within the family guided by a family constitution that we talked about earlier. The other is defining how the family interacts with professionals. If you want to create a company that is professionally managed, then you need to ensure that professionals also flourish. And in many family businesses, we observe that there are multiple family members involved. This potentially creates dual reporting structures. Professionals don’t like that and then there’s resistance. So, it’s important to create the right mechanism and governance to attract and retain good professionals. Otherwise, you will attract people who would want to be close to the family and play power games. This then is not based on meritocracy, but influence. In professionally-run family businesses, At times there is a dichotomy between the vision of the CEO and that of the promoter... How should that be resolved? As a founder, I had to align myself with the current management team at Marico. Aligning in terms of purpose, strategy, culture, and values of the organisation is very important. You need to have alignment with the CEO as well as with the board. In fact, when I appointed a professional successor as MD of Marico, we independently wrote down thoughts of our respective roles and expectations of each other. There was a close match. We then documented these and both of us had complete clarity. The key is to ensure that we foster the right culture of empowerment, agility, capability, risk-taking, and be aligned on areas of growth, and review the same periodically. The key role of any board is to select the right CEO and make that CEO perform better. How should a family balance emotions attached to trusted lieutenants while choosing leaders? Some people may have played a very important role in the company’s growth journey during the evolution of business. But at some stage, if one realises that the said person is not able to add value, and if you start rewarding loyalty, then it can actually impact the organisation and its growth. Ultimately, you function as a team and if you have a weak link in the chain, strong players in the team would get demotivated because the weak link impacts their performance. The best talent may tend to leave while the weaker members may continue with the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biz-families-shouldnt-let-age-ego-ruin-ties/articleshow/87635268.cms||Namrata Singh

The main attraction of the event is 45 Aagam chhod which has been inked in gold that was kept on display for devotees along with kalpsutra that was carved on seashell by an Odiya artist. “On the occasion of Gyan Panchmi, we put different auspicious religious things including 45 Aagam chhod, which were handwritten with gold ink by a Muslim artist from Surendranagar district a decade ago. Sadly, the artist passed away last year after suffering from Covid-19,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji told TOI, adding that the invaluable religious scripture now enjoys approximately Rs 5 crore in market value at present. Shubhmangal foundation had gifted a gold written Bhagwat Gita to a Hindu foundation along with a Sikshapatri to Vadtal Swaminarayan trust. In return, the trust had gifted the gold written kalpsutra to Shubhmangal foundation, he explained. Along with this, handwritten kapsutra on seashell by an Odiya artist, wood print of Saraswati devi by Rajasthani artist, idol of lord Parshwanath made from a single wood trunk, an ivory Bhandar, Astlakshmi made from shreeparn wood and many more are kept on display, he said. Talking about the event, the acharya said that 300 devotees from different parts of the country are observing Updhan fast under the supervision of acharya Abhayadev Surishwarji. “We are going to celebrate the Mokshamala vidhi on December 8, the day on which Abhayadev Surishwarji will also complete 60 years of Diksha,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji added. He said that of the 300 devotees observing fast, 150 are aged between 7 and 14 years. The 47-day long Updhan fast is a very tough ordeal which demands total dedication, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gold-inked-scriptures-shine-on-gyan-panchmi/articleshow/87634886.cms||Mehul Jani

The counsel for the petitioner, PVG Umesh Chandra, told the court that police officers should produce the arrested accused before a medical practitioner soon after an arrest is made under section 54. They should also produce the accused before the magistrate concerned within 24 hours apart from conducting preliminary investigation under section 57 of CrPC. He further submitted that the Supreme Court has issued guidelines in the DK Basu vs State of West Bengal case on the procedure to be followed under section 54 of CrPC, following which an amendment was also brought in to ensure that the apex court’s guidelines are followed. It would amount to violation of Supreme Court orders if police do not comply with the procedure contemplated under section 54 of CrPC, he said, adding that section 57 of CrPC is drawn from Article 22(2) of the Constitution. Pointing out three incidents of custodial violence that were brought to the notice of the high court in recent times, Umesh Chandra said numerous such incidents take place in the state which go unnoticed. He also sought directions to magistrates dealing with such cases to strictly follow the guidelines. Considering his arguments, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cops-not-following-sc-guidelines-pil/articleshow/87634266.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Family businesses in India are increasingly looking to build consensus among members to resolve conflicts as the new generation comes with a different world view. TOI spoke to Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala for his insights on how family businesses can better manage the dynamics. His advice: Keep communication channels open to identify conflicts. “They should not be dictated by ego and age,” he says. Mariwala is in talks with the Indian School of Business and SP Jain Institute of Management and Research to develop case studies for students based on his book ‘Harsh Realities’, co-authored by management thinker Prof. Ram Charan. Excerpts: Despite rising feuds around succession planning, not all promoters realise the importance of managing such dynamics... What’s your advice?When a new generation enters the family business, it usually comes with an advanced educational background as compared to older members. The new generation is equipped with more knowledge and, in a fast-changing environment, it is far more tuned to the latest trends. More so with digital initiatives. They are living this change and have age on their side. They are not conditioned by the past unlike the older generation, whose understanding of the current changes may not be as good as that of the younger ones, though I am not saying they are not updated. The new generation usually is more ambitious and wants to create an impact. This is a very critical juncture in a family business. History has shown that whenever the next generation comes in, it brings in a certain degree of discontinuity in the way the business is handled. The key challenge for families is integrating the views of the younger generation with that of the older ones while keeping in mind what is good for the business. Families need to have open channels of communication, thereby identifying conflicts. They should not be dictated by ego and age. A family council can help large families, which can create a family constitution that will take care of not only the aspirations but also guide the family on all aspects, including the entry of youngsters into the business, the exit of older members, compensation, and job rotation. If differences of opinion within a family cannot be resolved, then one may have to take steps to divide the company either on the basis of ownership or on the basis of management. If irreconcilable differences still remain, then it’s better to split the business financially. So, there is no right answer. We have seen businesses where only two members of a family are fighting, and there are those which have survived many generations and are flourishing by creating supporting mechanisms. How do you see structures such as family governance evolving among Indian businesses? Since you have gone through a stressful family separation, what advice would you offer?Depending on the size and type of business, governance needs to be thought through at two levels. The first is within the family guided by a family constitution that we talked about earlier. The other is defining how the family interacts with professionals. If you want to create a company that is professionally managed, then you need to ensure that professionals also flourish. And in many family businesses, we observe that there are multiple family members involved. This potentially creates dual reporting structures. Professionals don’t like that and then there’s resistance. So, it’s important to create the right mechanism and governance to attract and retain good professionals. Otherwise, you will attract people who would want to be close to the family and play power games. This then is not based on meritocracy, but influence. In professionally-run family businesses, at times there is a dichotomy between the vision of the CEO and that of the promoter... How should that be resolved?As a founder, I had to align myself with the current management team at Marico. Aligning in terms of purpose, strategy, culture, and values of the organisation is very important. You need to have alignment with the CEO as well as with the board. In fact, when I appointed a professional successor as MD of Marico, we independently wrote down thoughts of our respective roles and expectations of each other. There was a close match. We then documented these and both of us had complete clarity. The key is to ensure that we foster the right culture of empowerment, agility, capability, risk-taking, and be aligned on areas of growth, and review the same periodically. The key role of any board is to select the right CEO and make that CEO perform better. How should a family balance emotions attached to trusted lieutenants while choosing leaders?Some people may have played a very important role in the company’s growth journey during the evolution of business. But at some stage, if one realises that the said person is not able to add value, and if you start rewarding loyalty, then it can actually impact the organisation and its growth. Ultimately, you function as a team and if you have a weak link in the chain, strong players in the team would get demotivated because the weak link impacts their performance. The best talent may tend to leave while the weaker members may continue with the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biz-families-shouldnt-let-age-ego-ruin-ties/articleshow/87635333.cms||Namrata Singh

The government also wanted the PPA to place all records before the Jal Shakti ministry as well as the finance ministry to include water component in the total project cost. Irrigation engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy made a presentation on the various components of the project at the PPA meeting held in Hyderabad on Wednesday. Stating that the Union finance ministry’s decision to impose component-wise restriction to reflect the expenditure and releases has not happened for any national project, he urged the PPA to send a suitable proposal to the Union Jal Shakti and finance ministries with a request to remove such caps. “The ministry of finance, in a communication, has stated that claims of the state government should be restricted to the price level of 2013-14 only and the Polavaram Project Authority has to regulate the releases component-wise. Accordingly, it has worked out the component-wise eligibility for 2013-14 price level only,” the engineer-in-chief said, adding that the finance ministry further considered to grant total project cost of Rs 20,398.61crore as cost of irrigation component after removing the drinking water component. Mentioning that removing the water supply component from irrigation component is against the norms of Central Water Commission, he brought to the notice of the PPA that the decision of the ministry of finance is also in violation of the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act which mandates the government of India to execute the project bearing entire balance cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/polavaram-govt-seeks-urgent-nod-to-revised-cost-estimates/articleshow/87634294.cms||Samdani MN

The employees include temple priests, potu workers (temple kitchen staff), paricharaka, purohita sangham, kalyanakatta, and those working in the emergency services departments, many of whom have been working for 73 societies and 11 agencies under the TTD for close to 15 years now. Their hopes of getting regularised at some point have now been dashed with the TTD administration firm on forming a separate wing on the lines of AP Corporation for Outsourced Services. The process of registering a dedicated outsourcing corporation for TTD has already been initiated. Blaming the temple body for unilaterally going ahead with the merger of societies and agencies into a centralised outsourcing corporation without taking the consent of outsourced and contract employees, TTD employees welfare association president M Nagarjuna said the employees were promised they would be absorbed as regular employees of the temple body. Meanwhile, the TTD has said that the number of societies and agencies which employ contract and outsourced workers have increased over the years. “There are allegations that salaries are not being properly paid to outsourced employees in some of these societies and agencies. To put an end to such irregularities, TTD has decided to set up a unified and centralised corporation to ensure that salaries and other benefits are directly paid to such employees without the intervention of middlemen or private agencies,” a statement from the temple body said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/unified-outsourcing-corp-for-benefit-of-employees-ttd/articleshow/87634515.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Although chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will take the final call keeping in view his previous assurances and the latest political equations, aspirants are leaving no stone unturned to enter the portals of the legislature. The chief minister is likely to finalise the lists after taking into consideration the 50 per cent share for SC, ST, BC and minority communities. Elections will be held to fill two seats each in Visakhapatnam, Krishna and Guntur districts, and one seat each in Vizianagaram, East Godavari, Prakasam, Chittoor and Anantapur. According to sources, the party is most likely to grant an opportunity to former legislator Marri Rajasekhar from Guntur district. The chief minister had promised to take him into the cabinet for vacating Chilakaluripet assembly constituency to accommodate a BC woman candidate during the last assembly election campaign. Another seat in Guntur district fell vacant following the retirement of senior leader Ummareddi Venkaetswarlu. Although Ummareddi, a former Union minister, wanted to make another entry into the legislature, the party is said to be looking for another candidate to fill the slot keeping in view the veteran leader’s age. Dutta Ramachandra Rao from Krishna district, former legislator Amanchi Krishna Mohan and former MP Narasimham’s wife Thota Vani from East Godavari (all from the Kapu community) are in the race from their respective districts. Sources said any two from the four strong contenders from the Kapu community are likely be given a chance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aspirants-jostle-for-mlc-tickets-cm-to-take-final-call/articleshow/87634422.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Rejecting nominations sans proper reason draws high court ire||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over election officers for rejecting nominations without giving proper reasons. After hearing several petitions challenging the rejection of nominations, the court said it appears election officers have forgotten they are government employees. G Mahendra Babu from seventh division of Nellore municipal corporation, Shaik Jafar Ali from 17 division of Rajampet municipality, and others moved the high court challenging the rejection of their nominations. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocates N Ashwani Kumar, K M Krishna Reddy and K Ramesh Babu told the court the election officers acted in a biased manner in rejecting the nominations. When the nomination papers were submitted, they did not raise objections but later rejected them citing silly reasons, they alleged. The high court took a serious view on the manner in which the nominations were rejected. Justice D Ramesh said he will issue notices to the election officers for explanation if they are made respondents in the petition. However, he was not inclined to entertain the interlocutory applications seeking directions to accept their nominations, observing there is no scope for judicial review once the election process is set in motion and the only remedy before the petitioners is to file an election petition. While dismissing the interlocutory applications with a direction to approach the state election commission, Justice Ramesh issued notices to the respondents in the writ petitions. In another matter pertaining to security for contestants and voters on election day, the court directed the police to take steps for conduct of free and fair elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rejecting-nominations-sans-proper-reason-draws-hc-ire/articleshow/87634452.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Liquor VAT slashed but a drink costs the same||VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Wednesday amended schedule-VI of the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act by reducing the rate of tax on various categories of liquor. VAT, which was being levied at anywhere between 130% to 190% on different categories of liquor, has now been reduced to the 35% to 60% range. However, the reduction is not being transferred to the end consumer as the excise department has issued another GO stating that the MRPs of liquor will remain unchanged with the addition of a ‘special margin’. In the GO 312 issued for amending VAT slabs on liquor, it was stated that VAT on liquor is high when compared to other states such as Telangana, which is collecting flat 70% and Karnataka, where no VAT is levied on liquor. To bring about parity with the neighbouring states, VAT slabs have been rationalised, stated the GO. The state government issued GO 313, stating that though VAT slabs have been reduced to bring about parity with other states, keeping in view its policy of reducing consumption of liquor, it has decided to levy a special margin that is equivalent to the reduction in VAT in order to keep the MRPs unchanged. The Andhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL) will be the ultimate beneficiary of the rejig of VAT slabs. As the MRPs remain unchanged, the amount equivalent to the reduced VAT will go to APSBCL. With the present arrangement in VAT slabs, the state government is likely to lose Rs 400 crore revenue per month as the average percentage of VAT reduction comes to 100% on the basic price of liquor. When contacted, the managing director of APSBCL, D Vasudeva Reddy said the decision to amend the VAT was taken by the government. He said the margins of APSBCL will increase with the present arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/liquor-vat-slashed-but-a-drink-costs-the-same/articleshow/87634463.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Inland Waterways Authority (IWA) has cleared permission for constructing two bridges for a 3.7-long-kilometer stretch on the Eluru Canal at Satyanarayanapuram. Vijayawada is geographically located between three major irrigation canals—Eluru Canal, Bandar Canal and Ryves Canal—and Budameru Rivulet. The canals have twelve bridges across them to ease transportation. But with traffic in the the city increasing, traffic congestion has become prevalent on the bridges. “We are residing at Gadeevari Polalu area at Madhuranagar. Though we are very near to Gunadala area, we are travelling all the way for five kilometers to reach Eluru road. Madhura Nagar Rail under bridge has been under construction for months. A bridge on Eluru and Ryves canals will be a big relief,” said K Maneesh Kumar, a businessman. In a bid to ease up traffic on the bridges, the district administration proposed eight new bridges in the city and also laid foundation stones. Irrigation officials have submitted detailed project reports (DPRs) and plans to the IWA and are waiting for approvals. Vijayawada Central legislator Malladi Vishnu expressed happiness over approvals for the double bridge on Eluru Canal at Satyanarayanapuram. “We are committed to solving the traffic problem in the city. Construction of new bridges is key for development of the city. We will soon start work on these bridges after water levels recede in the canal,” Vishnu said. Gunadala flyover, a new bridge near Kotha Vantena and a bridge at Madhuranagar on Budameru will be given top priority, Vishnu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/more-bridges-over-canals-planned-to-shorten-commuting-time-in-vij/articleshow/87634360.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Ahmedabad||Costlier coal: Dye makers see production costs soar||AHMEDABAD: Spiralling coal prices have pushed up the prices of basic raw materials used to make dyestuff and dyes. Costly coal along with the reduction in imports from China have caused dye and dyestuff raw material prices surge 50 per cent to 400 per cent during April-October period. With coal prices increasing nearly two-times over a six-month period and a consequent increase in cost of basic chemicals, dyes and intermediates makers have downsized production by an estimated 80 per cent, according to Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA), as their production costs have gone up. Coal prices have increased by 191 per cent over the past six months. Chemicals including aniline, acetic anhydride, naphthalene, sulphuric acid,H-Acid, J-Acid, K-Acid and vinyl sulphone, among others, which are used for manufacturing dyes and intermediates are become costlier in the range of 50-400 per cent. Coal plays an important part in chemical processing and production. Chemical factories use boilers to manufacture these raw materials,which are used in making dyestuff and intermediates. While gas and electricity-run boilers are also used to make these raw materials, coal-fired boilers are mostly used by manufacturing units as they are cost effective as compared to gas or electricity fuelled boilers. “The prices of basic raw materials have gone up substantially because of the steep surge in prices of coal. High coal prices have increased the production cost of factories which produce basic raw materials for dyestuff and intermediates. Reduction in supply from China further added to the pressure,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat Region, Basic Chemicals,Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). “As a result, dye manufacturers have been forced to raise the price of finished products they produced using these basic raw materials,”added Patel. Dyes and intermediates makers are also dependent on imported chemicals from China. “The power outage in China and consequent force-shutting of production has led to a 25 per cent short-supply of some of the basic chemicals. Supply constraints against a high demand is also responsible for raw material prices to go up,” said Natubhai Patel, managing director, Meghmani Organics, which manufactures these chemicals. A hike in raw material prices came at a time when the cost of gas,plastic packaging material and even freight charges are running high due to which MSMEs are facing dire working capital constraints. This has forced dyes and intermediates manufacturers to downsize production. “Dyestuff manufacturers are barely utilising 20 per cent of their installed capacities are manufacturers are unable to absorb the dramatic rise in production costs, which have increased by at least 50 per cent. Our clients refuse to bear the increased cost of dyes and intermediates and therefore, we’re only manufacturing enough to fulfil existing order commitments,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/costlier-coal-dye-makers-see-production-costs-soar/articleshow/87634613.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Some of these patients were mild cases and didn’t require hospitalization or oxygen during Covid infection, doctors said.Child specialists said kids have been at receiving end of the poor air quality to a great extent. Doctors advised that people need to be alert and immediately see a doctor in case they get any symptom.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said he has been seeing a lot of Covid recovered patients in last one week. “With onset of winter and post Diwali generally, there is a spike in cases of asthma and COPD patients. This time, recovered patients, who had mild Covid, are also more. They complain of tightness or heaviness in chest, cough, and cold,” he said.Dr Sarnaik, who is member of district Covid task force, said some tests are prescribed for complete evaluation of such cases. “If Covid recovered patients have any symptoms, they must immediately see a doctor. Lung function test, chest Xray, allergy blood tests are done,” he said.As the pandemic turned ‘endemic’ and fears evaporating from minds, people seemed to have also discarded their treatment documents. “Covid history mentioning what type of infection it was, did O2 drop, pneumonia are helpful indicators for the treating doctor. But many patients say they have misplaced the records,” he said.Some patients also try to hide their Covid history though it serves as reference for further evaluation. “They should not conceal the Covid history,” he added.Pediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde said asthma and COPD patients need to be managed by increasing their dose of inhalers. “Air pollution, cold weather and viral infection worsen asthma,” he said.Dr Abhishek Madhura, assistant professor at GMCH department of paeditrics, said problems get aggravated for COPD patients. “Condition of all the asthmatic patients, reporting now, was in control a week ago. Now, their doses have been increased.

On September 14, the KGMU Lucknows medico Dr Osama Shahid and Abhay Kumar Mehta were arrested while Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar were also arrested later. However, PK managed to escape when team of Varanasi police raided his place on September 19. With the progress in investigation, the police detected that 25 aspirants were in contact of this gang. Of them 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine skipped. As many things were found fishy in the cases of these 25 aspirants, the National Testing Agency directors cooperation was sought in investigation. National Testing Agency (NTA) that conducts NEET withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for 2 years from appearing in exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/help-of-cops-of-16-dists-sought-to-summon-aspirants-in-touch-of-solvers-gang/articleshow/87635377.cms||---

Petitioner Ashwani Shukla said it is clearly written in the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act that no commercial activities were allowed in these areas. While the ropeway is not being operated by the civic body itself. It is run by some other company for Rs 3 crore annually. For its operation, the MC has not even taken permission from government, ministry of environment and wildlife board. The petitioner went on to add that in 1983, Uttar Pradesh government had written a letter to the civic body of Haridwar, asking it to operate a cable car in Mansa Devi, adding that the work should not be allotted to some other firm. After the cable car became operational, Mansa Devi temple came under Rajaji National Park in 1986 and then in 2015, this area came under the tiger reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-ropeway-ukhand-hc-seeks-explanation-from-state-over-its-operations-despite-ban/articleshow/87634604.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Jhimli new look board admit cards||Jhimli.Mukherjeepandey@timesgroup.com Kolkata: Both CISCE and CBSE have sent admit cards for the first semester to X and XII board examinees. This is the first time that both the boards are organising the exams in two instalments and the admit cards that have come in, mention that they are for the first semester/term. That apart, Covid safety protocols, and in case of CBSE, the OMR sheets have also been mentioned in the admit cards. City schools are now scheduling distribution of admit cards and in most cases students are themselves coming and collecting them. Schools say that there is no point stopping board examinees from coming in to collect admit cards because campuses are re-opening next week for them. Some schools are however calling in parents to keep it safe since in these schools board examinees will not come in before the exams start. While ISC starts from November 22, ICSE starts from November 29. In case of CBSE, minor papers that are offered by a handful of candidates will start from November 17 while the major papers start from November 30. The CBSE admit cards have more new additions in the admit card compared with the CISCE issued ones. Not only do they mention that this admit card is meant for “Term-1”or only for the first board exam instalment, but they also say that each candidate comes in with a sanitiser bottle to the exam hall. “This is the first time that candidates will answer their board exam on OMR sheets so the admit card mentions that children have to follow instructions mentioned on the question paper and OMR sheet. The last point of advisory on the admit card says how the candidate has to get acquainted with the OMR sheet and how to respond on it. These are definitely new additions to the exam system in these Covid times,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School. Some principals pointed out that the reading time has also been increased by five minutes, perhaps because of the new format. “Earlier candidates had 15 minutes reading time, now the admit card mentions that they would be given 20 minutes to read the question paper,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. The CISCE admit cards mention that they are meant for “Semester 1 Examination.” Under a separate head, “Safety Instructions”, the admit cards remind kids about the importance of maintaining safe distance, wearing their masks properly and washing hands frequently. “I have distributed the admit cards of class XII and will distribute those of class X now,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohun Mission School. “I will distribute both on Monday,” said Father Rodney Borneo, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jhimli-new-look-board-admit-cards/articleshow/87634619.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra police to seek extension of Kashmiri students’ remand in court today||Agra : Three Kashmiri students who were booked on charges of sedition by Agra police, for allegedly cheering Pakistan’s T-20 win over India in the recently held T-20 World Cup match and “sharing posts related to it on social media" , will be produced in a local court through video conferencing for extension of their judicial remand, on Thursday. The students from Agra's Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering Technical Institute were earlier remanded to a 14 –day judicial custody on October 28. They were then attacked by some lawyers in the presence of police while they were being taken to the district jail from the court. Several lawyers’ associations in Agra had subsequently refused to provide legal assistance to the students. A Mathura-based advocate, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, is currently defending the students. He is also fighting the case of 26-year-old PhD scholar, Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Mohammad Alam, who were booked under UAPA after they were arrested along with journalist Siddique Kappan while going to meet the family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped and killed. Chaturvedi said he has filed a petition in the high court, seeking a transfer of the case from Agra to Mathura for the “security” of his clients as they had been attacked in the court premises earlier. When contacted, P D Salonia, superintendent of Agra district jail, told TOI that the trio will be produced through video conferencing as prisoners on remand usually appear virtually. College records show that the students, who secured first divisions in Class XII, were “performing well”. They had got admission in the institute under the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS), which is given to meritorious Class XII students from Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-police-to-seek-extension-of-kashmiri-students-remand-in-court-today/articleshow/87633684.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Techie held for rape threats to cricketer's child||MUMBAI: An IT engineer from Hyderabad has been arrested for posting rape threats to the 9-month-old daughter of an Indian cricket star on Twitter after India lost the match to arch rival Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on October 24. Ramnagesh Akubathini (23), who worked with a Bengaluru-based startup, had constantly altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down. Akubathini's father said his son graduated from IIT Hyderabad two years ago. He was in his hometown as he was working from home during the pandemic and was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under IPC sections pertaining to sexual harassment and criminal intimidation, among others, and under the IT Act. He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathani trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-month-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Subsequently, he faced a barrage of online abuse. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profile to make such threats. The cyber team is well equipped to track them," said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. Ramnagesh’s upset father Srinivas told TOI, “My son is just a cricket lover and usually very sober in his reactions…I can’t understand why he did this.” The Delhi Commission for Women has also taken suo motu note of the tweet on the basis of media reports and asked Delhi police to register an FIR and arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-father-says-son-a-cricket-lover-usually-very-sober/articleshow/87634624.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||DDA reopens land pooling portal, hopes for better response||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has reopened the portal for landowners to pool their land and expects more participation. This is the fifth time since the launch of the ambitious land policy in February 2019 that the portal has been opened. “The response has been positive and the aim of reopening the portal from November 10 to December 24 is to allow more participation. Those who have land parcels near the priority sectors will particularly benefit from this opportunity,” said a DDA official. Sources said the Delhi government recently notified nine more villages as development areas for land pooling and reopening of the portal for 45 days would allow landowners of these villages to participate. The number of villages already notified for development under land pooling is 95 and the newly added nine villages fall in Zone P-I. On February 5, 2019, DDA launched a web-enabled, single-window portal for inviting registration for participation in land pooling. The portal was scheduled to be open for six months, i.e. till August 4, but due to a lukewarm response, DDA extended the date to September 6. At the time the portal first closed, the area of land pooled under the policy stood at 6,407 hectares. The portal has been reopened four times since then, and currently, the total land pooled under the policy is more than 6,900 hectares. According to officials, the land that has been pooled is enough to create a sub-city, but scattered land parcels need readjustment. Though DDA had finalised three “model sectors” in three different zones, which will be developed under the policy and serve as a template for future growth, work couldn’t fully start on the projects due to the pandemic, which affected the process such as verification of land records and field surveys. DDA had proposed major changes in the policy and made it flexible to present it as more attractive to developers and landowners. “Flexibility has now been given to developers and they have been enabled to use variable FAR. We have also permitted mixed use in land pooling area. The flexibility to convert commercial use to residential has been permitted as long as norms are not violated,” the official said. “We are moving in the direction of creating the model sectors, which will give a huge momentum to development under the policy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-reopens-land-pooling-portal-hopes-for-better-response/articleshow/87655188.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||HC orders fresh valuation of mill plot||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has ordered a fresh valuation of the remaining unsold parcel of land belonging to Maheshwari Mills Ltd in Tavdipura, which had gone into liquidation two decades ago. According the Textile Labour Association’s (TLA) advocate, Dhimant Vasavada, the high court has ordered the removal of encroachments from nearly 5,000 sq m of mill land and directed the official liquidator to obtain a fresh valuation of the land parcel to be sold. The high court has ordered that the process be completed in four weeks. The last valuation was made by a valuation committee in 2018. Earlier, part of the mill land was sold and from the realization, ex-workmen were paid 67% and 33% was paid to secured creditors. The encroached land could not be sold because of litigation between two families, who are still in possession of the land. A detailed report on the encroachment was placed before the high court, which has ordered removal of the encroachment. The two families had been fighting a legal battle in courts, which have rejected their claims to the land. In 2013, the Supreme Court rejected their appeals but the land could not be cleared of encroachments. TLA took up the issue of encroachment again and demanded in the high court that the official liquidator (OL) be directed to implement the apex court’s order for removal of encroachments. In 2019, the high court had ordered inspection by the district inspector of land records (DILR) and earmarking of the land in the presence of the TLA’s representatives. Accordingly, inspection was carried out and it was reported that there was encroachment on two different parcels of mill land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-fresh-valuation-of-mill-plot/articleshow/87634638.cms||---

Hearing the verdict, the victim’s father, who works as a labourer, broke down and said, "Today, I feel that the agitated soul of my daughter will be calmed." He further said, "If all such cases get a speedy trial and conviction, criminals with perverted minds will think a hundred times before laying an evil eye on others' daughters." The court of Justice Pallavi Agarwal also slapped a fine of Rs 1.40 lakh on the convict, who is himself a father of four girls. The money will be given to the victim girl's parents. On the day of the crime, the child was playing outside her house when she disappeared. Her body was found in a village pond two days later. An autopsy report revealed rape and injury marks on the body. An FIR was filed against the accused who was last seen with the girl. Forensic reports confirmed his involvement and he was booked for kidnap, rape, murder and causing disappearance of evidence, apart from other relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Speaking about the case, Bharat Sharma, assistant district government counsel said, "We had produced seven witnesses, including the one who had actually seen the accused playing with the child on the day of the crime. Besides, forensic reports also confirmed his involvement in the heinous crime." Elaborating further, SSP Bulandshahr Santosh Kumar Singh said, "Initially, it was a blind case and for two days, police teams worked hard to trace the child. Her posters were pasted across the village and extensive search operations were conducted in the nearby agricultural lands. Then, a witness revealed he had seen the child with a local man, which helped us crack the case."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pocso-court-sentences-man-45-to-death-for-rape-murder-of-2-year-old-after-just-over-a-yr-of-trial/articleshow/87633709.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kanpur||CM Yogi Adityanath flags off Kanpur Metro trial, PM Modi to launch services in December||KANPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday flagged off the trial run of the Kanpur Metro, saying the city’s people will soon have access to the best transport facility and the Prime Minister could launch the service in the next four to six weeks. As soon as the CM pressed the button, the decked-up Metro train, stationed inside the Depot, began moving. It then came out of the Depot onto the main line and the trial commenced. On the first day of the trial, the train ran at a speed of 60 km/hour between Geeta Nagar cross-over and IIT Metro station. The trials are being carried out under the strict supervision of Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO). Speaking on the occasion, the CM said, “It will be our effort to get the Metro service launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the next four-six weeks. The start of Metro services would be a treat for Kanpurites as they will get its benefits.” “I am thankful to Kumar Keshav Ji, managing director, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited. Apart from this, I am grateful to the Prime Minister and Hardeep Singh Puri Ji wholeheartedly for their cooperation in this project. When it is opened for the general public, Prime Minister Modi will come to launch it,” he said. “The trial run of Kanpur Metro has commenced before its scheduled time. Within the next four to six weeks, the people of Kanpur will have a better public transport facility to commute. I congratulate all of you in advance. Kanpur has now become a metro city in itself. Metro service will provide great facility to the residents of Kanpur from the point of view of public transport,” he said, adding that the achievement of Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) in completing the work in time is commendable as the entire world has been facing problems due to the Corona pandemic. “There was no Metro in the state in 2017. Now, Metro trains are running in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida. Apart from this, Kanpur will get it soon. Uttar Pradesh is the only state in the country to provide Metro facilities in five districts and it is a great achievement,” the CM said at the function held on the occasion. The CM also flayed the previous governments for the delay in Metro project. “Kanpur was supposed to get the gift of Metro earlier, but it could not happen due to the negative and corrupt attitude of the previous governments,” he said. Earlier, the CM saw the facilities at the Metro Depot. He went inside the Operations Control Centre (OCC) and observed the facilities. He was briefed by Kumar Keshav about the OCC. Several other senior officials were also present. The CM also boarded a coach of the stationed Metro train and saw it from the inside. He was briefed about the state-of-the-art Metro and the facilities for the passengers. He was accompanied by UP ministers Satish Mahana, Neelima Katiyar, MP Satyadeo Pachauri, IAS officer Durga Shankar Mishra, BJP MLAs and others. After the inspection, the CM hit the button and the Metro started moving and went outside the Depot. UPMRC claimed that it had constructed the priority section of Lucknow Metro project in over two years time, carried out the trials and then that was the fastest work to have been done. But the trial on the priority section of Kanpur is being done in less than two years. The work on Kanpur Metro had started on November 15, 2019. The UPMRC MD, while talking to the media persons after the CM’s programme, said, “It would be our effort to start the Metro services on the priority corridor in the next one and half months. The finishing work at Metro stations is going at full speed and in the next one and a half months, the finishing work will be over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-flags-off-metro-trials-says-pm-could-launch-service-in-4-6-weeks/articleshow/87635392.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

The government’s pension is insufficient to support a family. My 37 years of service taught me that anganwadi employees have never been respected and are underpaid. Many of us are on the verge of committing suicide. We do not have any other options for survival,” said Udayakumari. The anganwadi workers named the strike as ‘survival strike’ because this is the only survival option they have. The strike is to let the government know about their miseries. The protest is to bring those injustices to light. More than 1,000 anganwadi workers from all the districts participated in the strike led by the INTUC which was staged in front of the Secretariat. The protesters demanded that the workers should be given a minimum salary of Rs 21,000 and that they have to be considered as government employees. The pension amount has to be increased to Rs 5,000 for teachers and Rs 3,000 for help workers, the workload has to be reduced, temporary workers must be made permanent and must initiate other welfare allowances and ESI. Presently, the salary provided for the anganwadi teachers is Rs 12,000 and the pension amount is 2,500. While the Kudumbashree is being provided with wages for taking surveys and other government related works, the anganwadi workers are forced to do all those works without any wages, they said. “We were forced to work in all government-sponsored projects and the wage is pitiful. We must work day and night. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the workload, one of the officials said that the time set aside for workers to sleep is a gift from the government. The majority of the time, the salary is also delayed. We are also compelled to perform cleaning duties,” said Bindhu N S, an anganwadi teacher from Wayanad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/underpaid-anganwadi-teachers-seek-justice/articleshow/87634654.cms||---

Cops here are now planning to move to Pune to record Gosavi’s statement. The process of getting a warrant against him has also been initiated, said SSP (Meerut) Prabhakar Chaudhary. The FIR against Gosavi, a copy of which is with TOI, mentions that a person named Rehbar Raza had filed a cheating case against him, his father and wife in December 2020 at Meerut's Civil Lines police station. It said Gosavi had duped him of Rs 14 lakh on the "false promise of giving good returns". When Raza enquired about his money, Gosavi allegedly threatened to implicate him in a "false case and even kill him". Chaudhary said on Wednesday that though the matter pertains to events that happened in Noida, the FIR was filed in Meerut on court orders and that an investigation was also conducted at the time of filing the case. “We have already informed police in Pune about the cheating case against Gosavi in Meerut. We had recorded his father’s statements earlier this year, but he claimed to have no knowledge of his son’s whereabouts. However, he maintained that he knows that there are several cases against his son in many police stations. Since then we have been looking for him,” the SSP said. Gosavi was a "witness" in the Mumbai cruise drugs case and came into the limelight after he was seen in a selfie with Shahrukh's son after the NCB raid on the luxury ship last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-begin-probe-in-yr-old-cheating-case-against-ncb-witness-gosavi/articleshow/87633726.cms||Ishita Mishra

Thakurdwara is an ancestral temple attached to the house of one Bachcha Singh. He is also the caretaker of the temple. The incident came to light when Bacha Singh woke up on Wednesday morning, and came across the main door that was found to be open and the lock of the sanctorum was broken.

---||Amritsar||Bathinda rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby joins Congress, within hours of quitting AAP||CHANDIGARH/BATHINDA: Less than 24 hours after she quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bathinda Rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby joined the Congress party in the presence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and party’s state president, Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Wednesday evening. The move caused much heartburn in AAP, with leader of opposition in state assembly and Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema saying that she shifted loyalties for an election ticket of the Congress. However, Ruby insisted that her decision was not influenced by the demand for candidature. “You don’t need to be an MLA to work for people. In AAP, I raised a voice in favour of Bhagwant Mann: that he be made chief ministerial face of AAP for the 2022 polls. In a recent meeting, AAP MLAs had expressed concern at the dipping graph of AAP and demanded a resolution in favour of Mann,” she said. “There is a big difference in what they say and what they do... Nothing is being done by the AAP for the ‘aam aadmi’ in the state.” On why she joined the Congress, Ruby said she was “impressed” with its ideology. She claimed that the AAP government could not do in Delhi in 49 days what Channi and Sidhu had done for Punjab in the last 50 days. “The real party for the ‘aam aadmi’ is the Congress,” she said. Sidhu said Ruby will be treated as a family member and will be given due respect. Channi also welcomed Ruby. He added Kejriwal was not aware of Punjabi sentiments. After the resignation, AAP MLAs told TOI that desertions just before assembly polls were not a good sign. However, Cheema hit out at Ruby on Twitter: “Ruby is our younger sister, (she should) be happy wherever she goes. This time, she did not have a chance to get a ticket from the AAP. Therefore, she is joining the Congress. It is a request to the Congress not to cheat Ruby and give her a ticket from Bathinda Rural seat.” In reply, Ruby said Cheema knew better about where the party was going. “I could not stay quiet.

When contacted, Cheema said Ruby had not turned up even when party national convener Arvind Kejriwal was in Bathinda. "She had almost made her intentions clear after the party legislative meeting on November 7. Through my tweet, I have only wished her good luck for her future and cautioned her," he said.

That was in 2018. The cop wasn’t able to walk or speak following the crippling mishap. The wheelchair-bound cop couldn’t report to work until 2020, after which the government stopped his salary. His treatment and joblessness created a severe financial crisis for his family. Now, three years after the fatal accident, SSP (Saharanpur) Akash Tomar, learning about the case, took to social media and urged policemen across the state to help Kumar. He managed to raise Rs 25 lakh, all of which has been deposited in the constable’s wife’s bank account. Tomar said, "The constable's wife had approached me, after which I made an appeal to the police fraternity across UP. I had also written to the department about the constable's present situation and recommended a disability pension for him." Kumar's wife Anjali told TOI, "The SSP was the first to deposit, Rs 10,000, into my account. We have received Rs 25 lakh so far and are grateful to everyone. I only request the government to provide better treatment and pension for my husband." Kumar, his wife and their six-year-son these days live with his parents in Baghpat. According to police sources, Kumar received his salary for two years after the accident but it was adjusted against his pending leaves. All his medical bills were also reimbursed, but it was halted a year ago which resulted in a financial crisis for the constable and his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-pool-in-rs-25l-for-crippled-constable-reeling-under-financial-crisis/articleshow/87633741.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Officials claimed that the civic body will be the first from the state to earn carbon credit. Apart from generating fuel that can be used in vehicles, the biomethanation plant, which processes green waste, will also help the JuMC earn around Rs 20 lakh annually as carbon credit. The civic body has already got the approval from Universal Carbon Registry (UCR), which issues carbon credit. As per a rough estimate, JuMC will earn around 9,000 credits annually. By selling the carbon credit in the open market the JuMC can earn around Rs 20 lakh. Carbon credit is a transferable permit which allows its holder, be it an organization or country, to produce a certain volume of greenhouse gases (GHG). The biomethanation plant, with a capacity to process 15 tonnes green waste per day, was installed at a cost of Rs 5 crore. The agency that has provided the plant will handle its maintenance and operation for the first five years. Vinod Moradiya, MOS, urban housing and urban development, will inaugurate the plant on Saturday. The civic body daily collects around 130 ton of waste mainly from hotels, restaurants, commercial establishments and households. Out of this, around 50 ton is the green waste which is mainly kitchen waste, vegetable waste and other wet waste. Using 15 ton of green waste, the biomethanation plant will generate 500 kg of gas which can be used as fuel. Junagadh municipal commissioner R M Tanna said that the project is designed on the concept of waste to wealth. “This is a unique project because we will earn carbon credit out of it. If this waste is not processed, it would lead to accelerated global warming. We have been testing this plant since last one month and now we are going to inaugurate it,” Tanna said. JuMC is planning to start city bus service in future and the gas generated from this plant will be used in those buses as fuel. Till then, JuMC will procure the gas from the agency operating the plant at Rs 2 per kg less than the market price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/going-green-junagadh-civic-body-set-to-earn-carbon-credits/articleshow/87633771.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

As per the MoU, IIRS will monitor glacial lakes, glaciers, landslide zones and avalanche-prone areas in Uttarakhand through satellites. The move is expected to help the state -- which has seen several natural disasters in the recent past – get timely alerts about detectable natural calamities in advance so that it is better placed to respond to such catastrophes. According to an estimate, there are over 1,000 glaciers and over 1,200 small and big glacial lakes in the higher mountainous region of Uttarakhand. Girish Joshi, senior consultant, USDMA, told TOI that “the disaster management authority is going to extend Rs 3 crore to the IIRS for the study and regular monitoring of glacial lakes, glaciers, landslides and avalanche for next two years.” Dhan Singh Rawat, minister in-charge of the disaster management department, said technical co-operation and training imparted by the IIRS would prove beneficial in dealing with various calamities and other challenges in the state. Describing remote-sensing technology as important for pre-disaster preparedness, SA Murugeshan, secretary, disaster management department, added, "The IIRS’s training to the department's personnel will be on geographic information system-based products prepared earlier by the state disaster management authority." Prakash Chauhan, director, IIRS, gave a presentation on the occasion on various studies done by the institute on the Himalayan region and analysis of the disasters in Kedarnath and Uttarkashi districts in the past with satellite images. He said that the institute has been continuously monitoring lakes, avalanches and landslides formed in the Himalayas. "As soon as the information is collected, it is made available to the Government of India and state government," he added. Significantly, 298 people have been killed and 66 reported missing in weather-related disasters this year alone in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/isro-inks-pact-with-uttarakahnds-disaster-management-authority-for-satellite-based-mountain-hazard-assessment/articleshow/87634681.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Her husband Sooraj, who along with his wife goes by their first name, raised an alarm. Other female passengers soon reached out. And Simpi gave birth to a baby boy inside the train’s toilet. A few Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel on the train thereafter assisted the couple and also provided them financial help. When the train halted at Moradabad station, members of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) moved the woman to the district hospital. The woman's husband, who works at a private firm in Delhi, said, “Our doctor had earlier informed us that my wife would give birth sometime next month. So, we decided to go to our hometown during Chhath pooja for better health care and spend time with family and relatives. But maybe, God wanted it to happen this way. I'm very thankful to both CRPF and RPF personnel and fellow passengers for their assistance.” Speaking about the incident, RPF official Dharmendra Kumar said, “We were informed that a woman on board the train had gone into labour inside the washroom and had delivered a premature baby.

Nodal officer (vaccination) at MLN Medical college, Dr. Utsav Singh told TOI that over 1.5 lakh doses, including 95,000 first and 55,000 second, were given to eligible recipients between April 7 and October 31 this year. He claimed that MLN medical college-SRN hospital is the only government hospital in Prayagraj division to have crossed the 1.5 lakh doses mark in the past seven months. He added, “Out of 1.5 lakh doses given to the recipients of all age groups at MLN Medical college, there were 55% male and 45% female recipients. The figure also included 7,500 beneficiaries in terms of international flyers and 3,000 under the Abhibhavak campaign group. In Prayagraj district , over 37.26 lakh doses were given among eligible recipients till now. Dr. Singh said that officials of the health department, in a bid to speed up vaccination in rural and urban areas, have also picked up a “ split vaccination plan” wherein vaccination teams were changing vaccination sites within a stipulated time (one to two hours) to cover maximum number of recipients at a particular spot. In rural areas, ground health workers like ASHA, ANM and Aganwari workers were also issuing “invitation slips”, popularly known as “bulawa parchis” to eligible recipients after preparing a list and appealing them to take their first or second dose. Moreover, ground health workers have also taken up a different exercise in selected blocks where they were putting “tick mark symbol” outside the houses of the recipients. Single tick mark symbol is being placed outside the house of the recipients who have taken the first dose and double tick mark symbol on the house of those who have taken both the doses in rural areas. Meanwhile, health department officials claimed that over 37,26,537 doses were given to eligible recipients in the district so far and about 60% recipients were from the age group of 18-44 years. Officials said that about 62% target recipients were given the first dose while 20% target recipients were fully vaccinated.

The minister said if Rs 6,600 crore had gone to the state exchequer, 24,000 new buses could have been procured and 50,000 drivers and conductors and other staff could recruited for these buses and that two new buses could be run from each village of the state. “The scam will be thoroughly investigated by forming a SIT and every person found guilty, be it a leader or an official, would not be spared at any cost,” he said. Warring stated that the daily income of the department has started increasing by more than Rs 1 crore per day after crackdown on tax evaders, illegal activities and bus operators without permit. He said the income of PRTC and Punjab Roadways stood at Rs 39 crore and Rs 34 crore, respectively, in September and has risen by around 42% in October, with PRTC earning over Rs 54 crore and Punjab Roadways earning over Rs 49 crore. “Ten-year rule of SADBJP and four-and-a-half-year rule of Capt Amarinder Singh’s compromised government allowed sheer loot of the state exchequer... the Akalis surpassed Ahmed Shah Abdali in looting the public money with both hands,” the minister alleged. Warring stated that the 2012 order of the Punjab and Haryana high court judge Justice Surya Kant against illegal expansion in multiple permits was not implemented properly. “We have now implemented this decision in toto and cancelled the 680 multiple permits of illegal expansion of more than 1 lakh kms. With this, the state government has started getting profit to the tune of Rs 42 lakh daily during the month of October,” he added. The minister stated that 304 buses have been confiscated for evading taxes, plying without permits and other violations and 64 buses have been challaned so far. The transport department has been able to collect Rs 7 crore as tax. As many as 842 more buses will be added in the state government fleet soon while 1,100 buses of PRTC and 1,550 buses of Punjab Roadways are already plying on roads in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-to-probe-rs-6600cr-loss-punjab-transport-minister/articleshow/87635450.cms||---

Rajbhar made the assertion days after Yadav put Jinnah in the same league as Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, triggering criticism from several quarters, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Regarding his recent meeting with the jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari in Banda jail, Rajbhar said “how could Mukhtar be termed a criminal until he is convicted?” Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, Rajbhar strongly defended Yadav on his recent statement on Jinnah. “Top BJP leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani had praised Jinnah on many occasions, hence the BJP leaders should first read their own history. The partition of the country could have been avoided by making Jinnah the first PM of the country,” he said while referring to the purported statements of BJP leaders. Rajbhar, however, displayed annoyance after being repeatedly questioned on Jinnah. “Why are you not raising inflation and other issues of public interest,” he asked the reporters. On being targeted by BJP’s Rajbhar face and UP minister Anil Rajbhar for meeting Mukhtar in Banda jail, the SBSP chief said, “How he (Anil Rajbhar) can term a person a criminal without being convicted in any case by the court. I had met Mukhtar in jail as per the provisions prescribed by the government for meeting any prisoner. I have had relations with Mukhtar for the past 18 years. Why did the BJP not question my meetings with him when I was in government as its alliance partner?” Rajbhar termed the BJP “opportunist”. “If the BJP would need the support of two public representatives to save its government, it would fall at the feet of Mukhtar.” He also targeted Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati. “When she needed Mukhtar’s support, he was termed as a messiah of the poor. But, after exploiting his popularity she forgot him. Similarly, the BJP people also go to Mukhtar to seek his blessings,” claimed Rajbhar while terming the UP minister a “novice”. Rajbhar said that he would be holding a meeting of his Bhagidari Morcha leaders for conducting a mahapanchayat of Dalit, OBC and deprived sections at Jagatpur in the coming days. Yadav had made the remark apparently equating Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi and Nehru while lavishing praise on Patel on his 146th birth anniversary on October 31, raising many eyebrows. “Sardar Patel understood the ground and he made decisions accordingly. Hence, he is also known as Iron Man,” Yadav had said at a public meeting in Hardoi. “Sardar Patel, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/india-wont-have-been-partitioned-had-jinnah-been-made-first-pm-rajbhar/articleshow/87635457.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Chandigarh||Shots fired at Harsimrat event, Akalis say for scaring attackers||Ferozepur: Shiromani Akali Dal leader Vardev Singh Noni Mann fired in the air outside the venue of a SAD event near Makhu Gate here on Wednesday when some people from a crowd protesting against the party attacked his security guards. The SAD claimed that the attackers belonged to the Congress. The incident took place when protesters outside the venue and SAD workers started shouting slogans against each other. SAD claimed that during this time, some unidentified persons damaged the vehicles of Mann, who is the SAD candidate from Guru Har Sahai, and former MLA Joginder Singh Jindu from Ferozepur Rural. According to reports, when the security guards of Mann and Jindu tried to save the leaders, the assailants reportedly beat up the guards and tore their uniforms. However, the assailants fled after Mann took out his pistol and fired a few shots in the air in order to save the guards, SAD claimed. Following this, the situation turned tense, but the police intervened and the mob was dispersed. Later, all Akali and BSP leaders led by former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal met the SSP of the district and demanded registration of a case against Congress for their alleged hooliganism. Harsimrat alleged that sensing defeat, local Congress MLA Parminder Singh Pinki has been terrorizing our party workers and leaders by patronizing anti-social elements, but the people of the area are fed up from the excesses of Pinki and Congress and they would be given a befitting reply by the voters of Ferozepur. In her speech during the SAD event, Bathinda MP Harsimrat alleged that Punjab farmers were being harassed on the roads to arrange diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer while chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was busy with photo sessions. She said farmers were being exploited financially as DAP was being black marketed, mandis were choked with paddy and the Punjab government had stopped procurement on the instance of the Centre. Harsimrat said it would have been better if the CM had gone to the Union ministers in Delhi to ensure availability of fertilizers. Terming the recent announcement by the Channi government as a mere election stunt, Harsimrat said cheap sand, electricity and other announcements made by the Punjab cabinet were nothing, but an attempt to lure the voters in the state. Farmer groups demanded registration of a case against SAD leaders under attempt to murder charges. They accused the leaders of trying to run over the farmers and indulging in firing when they (farmers) wanted to put questions before Harsimrat Kaur Badal. The SKM has given a call for massive protest at Ferozepur on Thursday to press the administration for taking stern action against Akalis. The farmers claimed that one of the SUV being driven by Akali leaders, including Vardev Singh Noni Mann, dragged BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) leader Harnek Singh Mehma for long. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) state president Buta Singh Burjgill said the Akalis in a bid to save MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal from being questioned by the assembled farmers tried to run over them in a huff and even fired some gunshots. The farmers have decided to assemble at Ferozepur in large numbers to hold a protest seeking action against Akalis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shots-fired-at-harsimrat-event-akalis-say-for-scaring-attackers/articleshow/87635499.cms||Dinesh K Sharma
---||Jaipur||Panchayat polls: HC removes stay||Jaipur: After the withdrawal of notification by the state government directing the state election commission (SEC) to conduct elections in the delimited panchayats, the Rajasthan High Court has removed the stay on holding panchayat samiti and zila parishad elections in the remaining four districts including Karauli, Kota, Baran and Ganganagar. As per the high court direction, the state election commission will have to complete elections in these districts by December. “We told the court that since the government has already withdrawn the notification, the writ petition becomes infructuous. The elections will be held in all the panchayats in four districts, except for the newly-created panchayats due to delimitation,” said an official. Earlier, SEC had urge Rajasthan High Court to clear all disputes related to delimitation of panchayats in these districts so that elections to the posts of panchayat samiti members and zila pramukhs in these districts could be conducted without further delay. “The creation of new nagar palikas in Kota, Baran and Karauli districts led to delimitation of several panchayats. However, delimitation of these panchayats were challenged in the court. In Ganganagar too, due to delimitation in Lalgath Jatan nagar palika, the panchayat samiti elections have been postponed,” an SEC official had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panchayat-polls-hc-removes-stay/articleshow/87636044.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Redrawing of Mumbai’s electoral wards won’t delay BMC polls, say officials||MUMBAI: The number of electoral wards in the BMC has not been increased since 2001. In the very first decade of the millennium, the city’s population rose by 3.87%. “As a result, it was necessary to increase the number of representatives,” said a government statement. Asked whether this will cause a delay in the polls, officials said it was unlikely. State election commissioner UPS Madan said it depended on how quickly the BMC re-draws ward boundaries. As a first step, the state will have to issue an ordinance on the decision. “The BMC will then have to present a draft of the new ward boundaries. Suggestions and objections will have to be invited from the public and the draft will also have to be presented to the state election commission for approval,” said Madan. The BMC had on October 26 submitted its final draft of electoral boundaries for Mumbai’s 227 electoral wards to the SEC. “With the decision to increase the seats, the entire exercise will have to be redone. We will be back to square one, but this is unlikely to cause any major delay in the elections,” said a senior civic official. However, election data analyst Hitesh Jain said there could be a slight delay in the polls. “Sitting corporators and aspirants had already begun their campaign and preparations keeping in mind the existing wards. But with nine additional wards, the entire setup will be shaken up and aspirants will have to redraw their strategies too. If the number of wards goes up, the caste and community combination will also change in a big way since this is happening after 20 years,” Jain said. With the change, the number of voters in each ward will reduce. “The average number of voters in each electoral ward currently is 54,000. After the wards increase, the number will reduce to 51,000, with a 10% margin. The voting population in Mumbai is around 1.24 crore,” said a senior civic official. The last time wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. After the 2011 census came out, the BMC had redrawn electoral wards to account for a rise in population in the suburbs and a decline in the island city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-redrawing-of-citys-electoral-wards-wont-delay-bmc-polls-say-officials/articleshow/87634716.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Mumbai||Continue online home delivery of liquor: ISWAI urges Maharashtra government||MUMBAI: The International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI), the apex body of the premium alcobev sector, has urged Maharashtra government to continue to allow ‘online’ home delivery of liquor in order to address low retail density and price arbitrage issues faced by the industry.  These challenges “besides causing revenue loss, are also resulting in smuggling of spurious and counterfeit liquor, thereby compromising public health,” it said in a statement.  The state introduced home delivery in order to plug excise revenue losses during the lockdown. According to ISWAI, home delivery can enable convenience and offer safe buying for women. Members of ISWAI include global leaders like Bacardi, Beam Suntory, Brown Forman, Diageo, Moet Hennessy, Pernod Ricard, and William Grant & Sons.  “A survey by LocalCircles, a community-led platform, has revealed that 95% of consumers of alcoholic beverages in Mumbai called out convenience & social distancing as the two most important reasons for ordering alcohol via home delivery,” the ISWAI said adding 78% women consumers across major Indian cities say they are likely to buy alcohol themselves if online or home delivery service is made available.  Nita Kapoor, CEO, ISWAI said home delivery will improve the purchasing experience and dignity of purchase for women buyers while unlocking potential of an alternate channel for state revenues.  “We request the state government to strengthen and frame standard home delivery norms to ensure that no delivery is done to underage consumers”, she added.  Suresh Menon, secretary-general, ISWAI, said, “Given that the population has increased four times in the last 50 years, the state has not seen much changes in AlcoBev retail store numbers since 1974 or thereabouts, i.e., around 1,700 outlets for spirits, across such a geographically widespread state. A proper home delivery model would ensure equitable access to liquor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/continue-online-home-delivery-liquor-cos/articleshow/87636046.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The man went missing on Monday after he went to fetch fodder for his cattle. The body was found on Wednesday afternoon. Pugmarks of an adult tiger were found at the spot, said forest department officials. Anil Patel, deputy director DTR (buffer), told TOI, “The victim was identified as Asaram from Grunt Daatpur village. The nature of injuries on the body suggests that he was killed by a tiger. But it looks like it was an accidental attack as the tiger did not eat the flesh.” He added that a team would monitor the area to keep a track of the tiger’s movement to prevent another attack, he added. The area is part of a wildlife corridor between Mohammadi range and Mailani range, which has been disturbed due to human encroachment, said foresters. As the area is frequented by tigers, there is always a possibility of man-animal conflict but, no incident had been reported in the recent past, they added. Patel said Asaram’s kin would be provided with Rs 10,000 as immediate compensation from Dudhwa Society and Rs 4 lakh under the state disaster relief fund. “We will send our report to the revenue department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-mauls-man-to-death-near-dudhwa-forest/articleshow/87633830.cms||---

Maruf, who goes by his first name, picked up Vikas Singh, a Delhi University assistant professor, from the Moradabad railway station and dropped him at a bus stop. It was only after Maruf got off the auto-rickshaw to look for another passenger that he noticed the bag. Thinking of ways to get through to the passenger, he decided to open the bag and found a diary containing the contact details of Singh, whom he immediately called, saying the latter had left his bag in the auto-rickshaw. Singh, who had already approached police by then, heaved a sigh of relief after speaking to Maruf and asked him to come to the Galshaheed police station. Police said Singh, who resides in Delhi, was to reach Amroha to drop his wife. SHO, Galshaheed police station, Moradabad, Mohit Chaudhary said, “By the time the passenger reached the police station, the auto-rickshaw driver had contacted him.” Appreciating the driver for his kindness and honesty, the SHO added, “Such incidents rarely happen. Passengers who forget their belongings in public transport hardly get those back. In this case, the passenger had no details of the driver or vehicle. It could’ve been challenging to trace the driver. But the man proved that humanity still exists. As a reward, Maruf has been given Rs 1,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/auto-driver-returns-bag-with-rs-2-5-lakh-to-du-prof/articleshow/87633812.cms||Maria Khan

The university which has adopted new examination software, has failed to announce the results, even two months after the examination was held. The students who have appeared for odd semester examinations are anxiously waiting for the announcement of results. MU had assured to announce the results by the end of October. According to sources from the MU examination section, the evaluation and results have been reportedly delayed due to an error in entering data and mismatch of answer sheets. “Due to this grave mistake, officials are not able to finalise the results. The evaluation is also delayed due to adoption of a new software, which the officials are yet to get their hands on,” a source added. P L Dharma, registrar (evaluation), Mangalore University, said that the results of all the streams will be announced in phases. “If all goes well, we will announce results by the end of this week. We have completed the evaluation of BBA and BCom answer papers and evaluation of papers of other streams are in progress. We have decided to announce results in phases to avoid any errors. Meanwhile, evaluation of the sixth semester examination for both undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses are in progress, and will be completed in a few days,” he added. On the delay, Dharma said that during the examination, some colleges have wrongly entered the data of candidates. “As a result, the officials are not able to match the answer sheets with the code,” he said. “This ate up time in tracing those candidates, and setting it right,” added Dharma. The examination that started in April had to be postponed several times due to various reasons. In April, it had to be postponed due to the second wave of Covid-19 and KSRTC bus strike. It resumed from August, but was stopped for a few days by the district administration, as there was a steep surge in Covid-19 cases. The PG examinations that were planned in April took place in August. Finally, both UG and PG examinations got over in the first week of September. To help final-semester UG and PG students, MU conducted an examination that concluded a few days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-yet-to-announce-odd-semester-exam-results/articleshow/87633836.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Meanwhile, Delhi’s overall air quality improved from the “severe” category on Tuesday to “very poor” category with an AQI of 372. A senior environment department official said special attention would be given to locations that fared the worst and featured regularly in the “severe” category during the period. “The monitoring stations have been divided based on municipal zones. The heads of the corporation have been asked to intensify water sprinkling and use dust suppressants on roads that have seen the maximum number of severe days. Other agencies concerned have been told to step up their actions too,” said the official. North corporation, which has 16 monitoring stations under its jurisdiction, had three stations recording five “severe” days and six stations with four “severe” days. Three stations under East Delhi Municipal Corporation witnessed four “severe” air quality days. With 15 monitoring stations, South Delhi Municipal Corporation had just one that saw four severe days, while New Delhi Municipal Council had no stations recording four or five severe air days. Four new locations turned “severe” between November 1 and 8 — Alipur, ITO, Sonia Vihar and Nehru Nagar. The findings were shared during the review meeting on air pollution chaired by environment minister Gopal Rai with various departments. Delhi recorded three “severe” air quality days between November 1 and 8, while the fourth one was recorded on November 9. The share of stubble burning in PM2.5 remain the same as Tuesday at 27% and the fire count was 5,317.

Air quality is expected to deteriorate for the next two days, but will remain in the upper end of very poor or touch the lower end of severe category intermittently. Air quality is likely to improve on November 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/focus-on-worst-of-hotspots/articleshow/87635022.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Incidentally, the accused had allegedly pulled out similar fraud in the same finance firm a year ago. Thus, the staff grew suspicious and alerted the police.

They had allegedly duped several finance firms in Kottoor, Kariyode and Kuttichal regions for the past one year. They mostly targeted small finance firms that do not have the facility to conduct sophisticated tests to check the purity of the ornaments.

The BJP alleged that the BMC was exposed in altering ward boundaries to favour the Shiv Sena, so the government was now resorting to another way to redraw ward boundaries favourably. “Objections were raised with the state election commission (SEC) regarding illegal ward boundaries. The BMC was caught red handed and the SEC found glaring mistakes. Hence, increasing wards to 236 is another attempt to redraw boundaries. But it can't stand before any court as there is no new census. This is also a futile attempt by the MVA to get favourable ward boundaries drawn,” BJP MLA Ameet Satam said. “Shiv Sena could see defeat due to the corruption it indulged in for the last 25 years. So they made a desperate attempt to redraw ward boundaries to favour their candidates. No matter what they do, BJP is going to win Mumbai,” BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said. —Chaitanya Marpakwar & Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-slams-ruling-alliance-over-increase-in-wards/articleshow/87634742.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sources alleged that because of interference by the legislators, JMC-Heritage was yet to form working committees. Sources said the MLAs were yet to reach at a consensus on giving chairmanship to councillors and besides resolving their internal tussles. “MLA Mahesh Joshi and Rafiq Khan are at loggerheads as both want their councillors be lead the powerful committees like finance, building planning and lights,” said a corporation source. On Wednesday, Congress councillors complained to JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar on interference of MLAs in their day-to-day functioning. “When any civic work is completed by an MLA or an MP, their name is publicised. Then why not councillors’ name are promoted when we work day and night for the public. MLAs have become god like figures in JMC-Heritage and the mayor has no power,” said a Congress councillor. BJP councillors alleged that Congress MLAs don’t let the officials work efficiently in their wards and they face discrimination. BJP councillor Vimal Aggarwal said, “There is excessive interference of Congress MLAs. They have appointed officials for their own suitability. These officials don’t listen to councillors.” Some BJP councillors, however, said though interference of BJP MLAs is not much in JMC-Greater, but that is because their mayor is now a puppet in the hands of the government. “BJP MLAs could have interfered if their government was in power. Although, MLA Ashok Lahoty and Kalicharan Saraf did speak for matters related to their areas, at the time of polls, there was tussle in the BJP for ticket distribution,” a BJP councillor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mlas-interference-affect-civic-bodies-performance/articleshow/87636063.cms||---

The courses include massive open online courses (MOOC), research component and others. The four-year UG course under NEP commenced this week across the district, and all colleges are following the curriculum prescribed by Mangalore University. However, autonomous colleges have decided to add a few short-term courses without diluting the original curriculum. These short-term courses not only give extra credits to the students, but also aim at improving their skills to make them ready for industry. Under NEP’s four-year graduation programme, it has multiple exit options. A candidate on completion of two semesters earns a certificate,on four semesters earns a diploma, degree on completion of six semesters and honours for completing four years or eight semesters. The old UG programme had six semesters, and got over in three years. An official from St Aloysius College shared that without making any changes or diluting the NEP curriculum of four-year courses, the institution has decided to add a few more short-term courses to the full-time course. ‘We will make sure that these add-on courses along with regular courses will not affect the academic bank of credit, in case a candidate wants to shift to another education institution after one or two years of completing the course. The add-on courses will give an edge to students to earn credits as well skills,” the official explained. Another autonomous college in the region, St Agnes College, has been offering add-on courses in its previous UG programmes. The college had been offering the computer literacy course free-of-cost to all students during the old UG programme. However, the NEP has added digital fluency as one of the subjects in one of the semesters. This course is an advancement of computer literacy, said Sr Venissa, principal of the college. “Since NEP has just been implemented, we may add extra courses along with the NEP curriculum in the coming days. Currently, the curriculum has been given only for two semesters,” she added.  “The autonomous colleges have flexibility to add open electives and also make changes in the NEP curriculum from 20% to 40%. However, in anyway it should not kill the spirit of NEP,” said Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/autonomous-colleges-to-add-extra-courses/articleshow/87633875.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The 14 lakh Covaxin doses in the state’s kitty would remain usable till April-May next year, stated Maharashtra’s health officials. The rest 76 lakh are Covishield doses and as per their expiry date, they can be used till August 2022. “The new stock of Covishield doses have nine-month expiry timeframe and for Covaxin, it is six months,” said a senior official of the state health department. A senior official from the Union health ministry told TOI that as many as 16 crore vaccine doses were lying with 28 states and eight Union territories and could be used up to next year. “There is no question of wasting any stock because the expiry date of the current vaccine stock available with the states is not January but April-May, and even later. Doses are administered, and stocks are replenished in a cyclic manner because Covishield has to be administered with a gap of about three months and Covaxin at an interval of over a month,” said the official. The state is planning to clear the pending stock of Covid vaccines through the accelerated “Har Ghar Dastak” programme. Maharashtra will get over 2.21 crore doses of vaccines in November. A stathe health official said, “We are sure to finish the stock at the earliest through our increased and accelerated vaccination programme, which had slightly slowed down during festivities.” Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that the state was proactively approaching the beneficiaries who missed their second doses and those who were yet to get the first dose under the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign. He said the target was to ensure that all eligible population received at least one dose of Covid vaccine by November 30. The state health officials claimed that their goal for the month would be to vaccinate nearly 2 crore beneficiaries not receiving any doses till now. Nearly 75% beneficiaries have received the first dose and 35% the second dose in the state so far. About 5.9 crore beneficiaries in the state are due for their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/90l-pending-covid-vax-doses-in-maha-expiry-date-mid-2022/articleshow/87634765.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Third non-bailable warrant issued against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The 8th metropolitan magistrate court on Wednesday issued a non-bailable warrant against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh in an extortion case. This is the third such non-bailable warrant issued against Singh. A confidential report of the state is believed to have stated that Singh is in Chandigarh. Last month, a Thane court as well as the 37th Metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Singh in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others. The state CID and the Thane police have also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) against Singh suspecting that he may flee the country. In the latest case, police have arrested two persons named Sanjay Punamia and Sunil Jain and two police inspectors Nandkumar Gopale and Asha Korke. Despite three summons, Singh has failed to appear before the state CID or reply to them regarding the case. The warrant will pave the way to declare him an absconder. Singh went on sick leave in May this year citing health issues after he wrote to the chief minister making serious allegations of corruption against the state’s then home minister. He’s been off duty since. Two months later, Marine Drive police in July registered a case of extortion, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde and six cops for allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from a businessman named Shyam Sunder Agarwal. In February 2021, Punamia had filed a complaint against Agarwal accusing him of issuing threats through gangster Chhota Shakeel. A case was registered with Juhu police station. Singh was the Mumbai commissioner of police then and the crime branch was asked to probe the complaint. According to Agarwal’s complaint, officers allegedly at the behest of Singh, pressured him to arrive at a settlement and demanded Rs 50 lakh for it. Meanwhile, an intelligence report has rubbished reports that Singh has left the country and said he is very much in Chandigarh. State CID, Thane police and crime branch have made four visits in search of Singh to Chandigarh. But they could not trace him nor did they receive cooperation from local police to find him. Police officials said they met a doctor who treated Singh who confirmed he was in Chandigarh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-third-non-bailable-warrant-issued-against-ex-mumbai-police-chief/articleshow/87636080.cms||Ahmed Ali

For around 40 minutes, councillors of both BJP and Congress questioned Gurjar regarding civic problems, sanitation issues, street light problems and formation of committees besides demanding a general body meeting of the corporation. Sources at the corporation said the councillors expressed displeasure for not forming the committees even after a year. “Work should be divided between different committee chairmen. We have been demanding it for a long time. BVG Company is not working properly and hoopers are not going to the wards every day. The mayor should look into these problems instead of just sitting like a mute spectator,” said a councillor. According to municipal laws, there should be a general body meeting every two months. But till now, one meeting was convened. Congress councillor Sunita Mahawar said there was a need to look at the functioning of the corporation properly and work on its improvement. She said a general body meeting was the need of the hour where a proper discussion on various issues could be held. BJP councillors alleged that there was discrimination and civic work was not being done in their wards. Ward 73 BJP councillor Amar Gurjar said, “No work has been going on across the city especially in BJP wards. Despite writing letters, meeting officials and number of calls, BJP councillors are always last to get any facility. If there was a call for sewer jetting machine or installation of street lights, BJP councillors were always ignored while Congress wards were given priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/on-heritage-mayors-first-anniv-councillors-grill-her/articleshow/87636070.cms||---

India has been facing a drug-resistant Candida auris crisis which is being dubbed as a global health threat – since 2011. However, the virulent and difficult to diagnose and treat fungal infection caused by Candida auris strains is now being seen in 40% of the fungal infection as against its reported incidence of 5 to 6% prior to the pandemic. “In a nationwide study, only 5-6% of the candida infections in India were caused by Candida auris prior to the pandemic. However, in the last one year, drug resistant Candida auris is the fungal species seen in more than 40% of patients with candida infections in our study. Half of these patients have had Covid in the past, were hospitalized and treated with steroids and multiple drugs,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag, the study’s lead investigator. In addition to the widespread use of steroids, antifungals, and antibiotics in Covid patients, the availability of improved and accurate diagnostics has also contributed to the increased detection rate, experts have said. “We would detect five patients with drug-resistant candida auris every year prior to the pandemic, now we get five such patients every month at our hospital. Almost all of these patients are referred to us from small units for higher treatment after a prolonged hospital stay outside,” Prayag said. To detect Candida auris, sophisticated testing infrastructure such as MALDI-TOF machines are required, which are available at a few centers across the country. “Routine testing methods often fail to identify the drug-resistant strain. Before 2019, the MALDI-TOF machines were available only at a handful of centers. But now it is available at quite a few centers. We have this machine at DMH,” Prayag said. The CDC estimates that 30% to 60% of patients with Candida auris infections have died, but the agency notes that many of those patients have multiple underlying health conditions, making it difficult to determine how much the pathogen is contributing to those deaths. Since being discovered, Candida auris has spread rapidly across the globe, with multiple cases reported in healthcare facilities in more than 30 countries, including the US. “The fungus can survive on dry surfaces for weeks and is hard to kill once it gets on hospital surfaces,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the national Covid task force. Since then, despite implementing contact precautions, using bleach to disinfect surfaces, and decolonizing patients with the antiseptic chlorhexidine, the proportion of hospitalized patients testing positive for Candida auris has gone up significantly over the last two years, Pujari said. Mumbai-based Masina hospital’ s infectious diseases expert Trupti Gilada said, “There has been a steep rise of drug resistant Candida auris during the pandemic which is a potentially fatal infection most often seen in admitted patients.” Prolonged hospital stays, immunity suppressed by steroids, use of broad spectrum antibiotics and in-dwelling catheters makes the patient susceptible to this fungus which can cause infection of blood, wounds, urinary tract, Gilada said. “Candida auris is also been showing resistance to an increasing number of antifungals during the Covid-19 pandemic and the mortality rate in such patients goes very high,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drug-resistant-fungal-infection-cases-rise-most-patients-ncov-cured-study/articleshow/87634780.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The CBIC has issued guidelines in this regard in which it has been made clear that from now on, the officers will not block the ITC without recording “reason to believe” in writing. In these guidelines, which were issued on November 2 by CBIC’s GST policy wing, it has also been instructed that in case an officer blocks the ITC under due procedure, the taxpayer will be informed about the action on GSTN portal along with details of the officer who has blocked it. Besides this, monetary limits of blocking of ITC have also been set according to the designations of the officials. Several tax bar associations and tax professionals from Ludhiana and elsewhere had been taking up the issue of some officials not following the proper procedure when blocking the ITC.NK Thamman, a tax professional, said, “On November 2, CBIC issued guidelines to stop mechanical blocking of ITC. As per these, before blocking ITC, the officer must form an opinion only after considering all facts of the case, amount of ITC involved and whether it was necessary to block it to protect interest of revenue. The officer will record ‘reason to believe’ on the file before proceeding. Further, as per these guidelines, the monetary limit of blocking of ITC has also been fixed. A deputy or assistant commissioner can block ITC up to Rs 1 crore, additional or joint commission above Rs 1 crore but not exceeding Rs 5 crore and principal commissioner or commissioner above Rs 5 crore.”Thamman said, “The taxpayer concerned will be informed about the action along with details of the officer who has blocked the ITC. The taxpayer can approach the officer concerned with his submissions. After the officer is satisfied, he can clear the tax credit. The department has to conclude its proceedings within a year of blocking of the ITC. These all are welcome steps, as these will put certain restrictions on departmental action and officers will not be able to mechanically block the ITC. Earlier, the taxpayers faced many problems and in certain cases blocking was not lifted even after a year.”Narinder Bhamra, president of Fastener Manufacturers’ Association of India, said, “We are grateful to the CBIC for the guidelines. Till now, the procedure as per law was not being followed by some officials, resulting in huge amounts of ITC backlog. But now, genuine taxpayers will certainly get a big relief as their refunds will not be withheld on mere suspicion.According to Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, “The new guidelines will prove to be beneficial to the businessmen, tax professionals and the department as well because now there will be more transparency and accountability. The taxpayers will be able to know why their refund has been blocked and which official has done it.”Reasons to block ITC on material evidencePoint 3.1.4 of CBIC’s guidelines on this subject says, “It is reiterated that the power of disallowing debit of amount from electronic credit ledger must not be exercised in a mechanical manner and careful examination of all the facts of the case is important to determine case(s) fit for exercising power under rules 6A. The remedy of disallowing debit of amount from electronic credit ledger being, by its very nature, extraordinary, has to be resorted to with utmost circumspection and with maximum care and caution. It contemplates an objective determination based on intelligent care and evaluation as distinguished from a purely subjective consideration of suspicion. The reasons are to be on the basis of material evidence available or gathered in relation to fraudulent availment of input tax credit or ineligible input tax credit availed as per the conditions/ grounds under sub rule (l) of rule 86A.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/itc-cannot-be-blocked-on-officers-whim/articleshow/87633894.cms||Mohit Behl

The move came following a TOI report on Monday that cars were being parked on cycle lanes at several places across the township. A pick-up van that was parked, blocking the cycle lane at ‘Atharo tola’ crossing for about two weeks was finally removed after the issue had been raised on the WhatsApp groups of the New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of residents’ forums in New Town. Residents said this monitoring should be a continuous process. “We thank the NKDA for taking a prompt action to remove the pick-up van from the spot and NTFN for raising the issue,” said a local resident. Earlier, auto drivers used to park their vehicles on the cycle lane near Greenfield Heights housing complex. The authorities warned the auto drivers against obstructing the cycle lane by parking their vehicles. The NKDA officials said that they have engaged a team of volunteers to keep tabs on the issue and conduct an awareness drive for the next few weeks to sensitise people about not blocking the cycle lanes by parking their cars. The NKDA set up 17km cycle lanes in different parts of New Town. NTFN chairperson, Samaresh Das, said, “The NKDA should keep cycle lanes on only one side of the road and remove the barriers from the sides of the lanes, which is not serving any purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-starts-removing-parked-vehicles-from-cycle-lanes/articleshow/87634776.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Deputy Mayor P K Raju and chairman of finance standing committee has dues just over Rs 1,000 for his two building numbers in Medical college while parliamentary party leader D R Anil owes corporation dues around Rs 7,000 for three shop building numbers in Medical college. Nearly 100 buildings owned by Thiruvananthapuram development authority owe corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs. It is the top defaulter as per the list made available for Medical college ward. In many cases, single digit dues were reflected against the building number under total arrears which in all probability would have resulted either from erroneous calculation or system error, revenue officials said. This was the third list to be published by the city corporation after a tax list of four wards under Thiruvallom zone was published on Monday. Even while lists for Medical college and Pattom were being finalised, the officials reportedly dealt with glitches in the software during posting. Data uploaded within a span of hours were found missing in the system which was somehow rectified later and updated on the website. LSG minister M V Govindan Master recently told the assembly that manual uploading of data resulted in errors and that all was well with the software being managed by the Information Kerala mission. The dues from private institutions like schools and buildings and government run institutions like TRIDA comprise the major chunk of defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/single-digit-dues-amuses-officials/articleshow/87634787.cms||---

At the Mumbai airport these days, an average of 660 domestic airline flights arrive and depart daily, which is what the airport handled pre-pandemic as well. Besides, the popular destinations to travel to and from Mumbai are also those of the pre-pandemic days. The ongoing ‘airline winter schedule’ of domestic flights, planned up to March 26 next year, is a significant jump from 2020 winter schedule with an average of 435 daily flight movements, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. “But more interestingly, the 2021 average of 660 has surpassed the pre-Covid 2019 average of 657,” said MIAL. Airports Authority of India (AAI) data shows that the Mumbai airport handled an average of 661 domestic flights per day in November 2019 and 658 flights per day in December 2019, which is about the same number of flights that will be operated in these winter months. “Destinations such as Delhi, Goa, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai have been on the top in terms of the highest flight frequency during the 2020 and 2019 winter schedule,” said MIAL. The number of flights in the 2021 winter schedule represents a 35 % jump in flights as compared to this year’s summer schedule, which ran from April to November. For the current schedule, IndiGo led the list with 240 weekly operations, followed by SpiceJet with 120 and Go First with 90, said MIAL. “The 2021 winter numbers are expected to be close to the pre-covid number for IndiGo, SpiceJet (20,400) and Go First (13,200) in terms of the average daily passengers catered to in 2019,” said MIAL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-avg-domestic-air-traffic-crosses-19-pre-pandemic-level/articleshow/87636087.cms||---
---||Madurai||118 arrested in TNPSC group exam scam, CB-CID tells Madras HC||MADURAI: The CB-CID on Wednesday informed the Madras high court that 118 people have been arrested in connection with the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) Group IV exam scam in 2019 where candidates who appeared from exam centres in Ramanathapuram district were involved in malpractices by using vanishing ink. A division bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan was hearing a public interest litigation filed by I Mohamed Razvi in 2020, seeking CBI probe into the scam. In the status report, CB-CID stated that the TNPSC officials had suspicion about malpractices by candidates who appeared from centres at Rameswaram and Keelakarai taluks in Ramanathapuram district. Based on their complaint, the CB-CID had registered a case. The offence was committed by few private individuals in connivance with two TNPSC staff - a record clerk and a typist. The accused with dishonest intention enticed 99 candidates with the promise of securing jobs and collected money for the same. After a comprehensive investigation, the CB-CID brought out the modus operandi of the accused. The main accused had given special pens with vanishing ink to the candidates to fill up the OMR sheets. The objective of using the special pen is that the answers marked with this pen would vanish in two to three hours enabling the accused and his team to fill up the answers later. This scheme was devised as TNPSC in 2019 brought in a system where the supervisors would attest the total number of questions answered in the answer sheets. The malpractice took place when the papers were on transit from Ramanathapuram to Chennai in a van under the supervision of two TNPSC staff and a policeman. Based on instructions given by the main accused, the van was stopped at Melur in Madurai district for dinner. The record clerk then broke open the seal secretly, took the answer sheets of candidates and handed them over to the main accused who along with his team filled up the correct answers. After the work was done, the answer sheets were placed along with the remaining sheets. A total of 118 people, including 98 candidates (one candidate died), two TNPSC staff, driver of the van and the main accused in his team were arrested.Since, there was negligence on part of the TNPSC officials who are supposed to check the seals of the answer sheet covers, disciplinary action was recommended. Incriminating materials such as OMR sheets, mobile phones and laptops were sent for forensic analysis. The investigation is progressing fast and once the lab report is ready, CB-CID would file the final report before the concerned court. The CB-CID further submitted that based on the additional facts emerged during the investigation, malpractices in VAO exam conducted in 2016 and Group II-A exam conducted in 2017 came to light and separate cases have been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/118-arrested-in-tnpsc-group-exam-scam-cb-cid-tells-hc/articleshow/87635534.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Senior officials in Vaigai dam said that in addition to 500 cusecs that was released for irrigation in the Periyar ayacut area and 69 cusecs for drinking water schemes in Theni and Madurai districts, an additional 1,000 cusecs was discharged from Vaigai dam from 10pm on Tuesday. The surplus water was discharged when the third flood warning was issued as water level reached 69 feet against the full reservoir capacity of 71 feet. On Wednesday morning, water level in the dam reached 69.26 feet with storage of 5,639 MCFT. “By Wednesday morning surplus discharge was increased to 3,000 cusecs, taking the total discharge from the dam to 3,569 cusecs,” said a dam official. This was maintained till Wednesday evening by matching the inflow with the outflow. PWD officials said that the surplus water of 3,000 cusecs has reached Peranai bordering Dindigul district – that is 33km from Vaigai dam – around 5.30pm on Wednesday. The flow in the river was 4,500 cusecs late on Wednesday evening after combining the inflow to the river downstream.

Koli was shaken after the incident and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. District collector Himanshu Gupta who met the MP on Wednesday said that her condition was fine. The incident comes barely five months after Koli faced a similar attack in the district in May when unidentified miscreants pelted her car with stones. Earlier in August, Koli had complained about receiving a threat call. District SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said that prima facie the police have not recovered any empty shells to indicate the firing yet, but an intensive probe was underway. District superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said that prima facie the police have not recovered any empty shells to indicate the firing yet, but an intensive probe was underway. The incident took place shortly after 12am on Wednesday when unidentified persons allegedly fired at her house in Bayana town of the district. The accused also pasted a poster with a large photo of Koli, crossed by a blue marker with two cartridges affixed on either side. They also pinned a letter on the poster which warned of dire consequences in the future. Bishnoi said cartridges were recovered from the poster and an FSL examination would be conducted. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot also spoke to Koli over the phone on Wednesday. “The DGP, principal secretary, home department, has been directed to take strict action after (a) thorough investigation of the incident.

The MP reportedly stated that betel nuts can be allowed to be used for other purposes such as religious ceremonies. Campco president A Kishore Kumar Kodgi and managing director H M Krishna Kumar, along with the board of directors, condemned the statement issued by the MP, and will appeal to the Prime Minister of the need for a thorough scientific research on the health benefits of arecanut, and thus maintain the morale of farmers. They said that the MP’s statements were not only misleading, but that they have also hurt the sentiments of arecanut farmers of the region, adding scientists from IISc, Bengaluru in 1974 have reported that arecanut cures cancer. The Supreme Court too has ruled that arecanut is food within the meaning of Section 2 (v) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, Campco maintained. Shampoo from arecanut Entrepreneur and researcher Nivedan Nempe, who has developed several areca byproducts, said the government must support development of alternative use of arecanut. Arecanut has several medicinal properties that can be put to best use, he said. “We are all set to launch shampoo prepared from arecanut. The launch is happening after a lot of research and trials have been completed. In addition, we will soon be developing a face wash from arecanut,” he said.

They feel that the government and residents should take adequate measures to stop spitting in the public. “There are two sections of people — some spit on the road without knowing that it may cause infection while others believe gulping one’s own saliva is injurious to health. And then there are people who do not object to people spitting even if they feel disturbed,” said Odette Katrak, co-founder of the NGO, Beautiful Bengaluru and Beautiful Bharat, who has been leading the #StopIndiaSpitting campaign. Odette said that in Bengal they are going to approach the chief minister Mamata Banerjee as well as the KMC and Kolkata Police to facilitate the campaign and make spitting a punishable offence, especially with the elections approaching that can further amplify Covid 19 in the state like the last assembly election. On Wednesday, Odette launched the Kolkata chapter of the StopIndiaSpitting movement with an aim to work with municipalities and involve schools and NGOs to send out the message of the anti-spitting campaign to rural areas. “If you spit, please stop. If you don’t, request others to stop, that should be the motto,” said Shukla Chattopadhyay of Soroptimist International- South Kolkata, who joined Odette in the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stopindiaspitting-activists-plan-to-take-drive-to-schools/articleshow/87634790.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Now, farmers are alleging that some middlemen had obtained the general power of attorney (GPA) in the name of solar units.Seven farmers have gone to court against the agents and about 30 more are planning a fresh petition, alleging that their land was sold to the company, Aequs Pvt Ltd, without their notice.The senior division court of Yelburga has issued a stay order and told the company not to alienate the land till the suit is disposed of. It means that the company, Aequs Pvt Ltd, cannot conduct any commercial transaction involving the land.Santoshreddy Madinur, the advocate for the seven farmers, said that the court had issued the stay only for a portion of land.“We are representing seven farmers, of whom six are women, who have filed a partition suit. They had given a general power of attorney (GPA) with selling authority to some agents. After a cheating case was reported at Chamarajanagar district, the state government issued an order to the department of stamps and registration on January 30, 2018, instructing that a sale deed should not be done by GPA. As the GPA and sale deeds were in English, our clients could not understand them. Our clients are saying that it was a lease for nine years for a solar company on rental basis and one job assurance for each family,” Madinur said.He stated that agents had procured the land at the cost of Rs 8 lakh per acre just a year ago and now had sold it to the company at Rs 33 lakh per acre. “Certified copies of the sale deed of this land are still unavailable online,” he said.Aequs had purchased 225 acres in Talkal, Bhanapur and Talabal village limits and has started the construction.Shankrappa Chowdki, a farmer in Bhanapur, said that partition aspect was neglected in many land purchase cases. “As disputes are arising among families now, they are approaching the court of law,” he added.Andappa Kolur, president, Karnataka Rajya Rait Sangh, Koppal district, said that many farmers were planning an agitation over the injustice. The farmers will hold a meeting next week at Talkal.Former minister Basavaraj Rayareddy, who hails from Talkal village, said the company has to sit with farmers and resolve the issue amicably.A spokesperson from Aequs said that all the purchases were done as per the law. “We have verified the legality of all purchases and not violated any rule or law of the land,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/land-allotted-for-toy-cluster-in-koppal-mired-in-litigation/articleshow/87633909.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Colleges have now reopened for students with 50% attendance and online classes are also being conducted. Authorities at Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) said that there is no official communication yet from the higher education department on whether the semester exams have to be conducted online or offline. As of now, all colleges in Madurai are holding offline classes for students on rotational basis and hence it is expected for the semester exams to also be conducted offline unlike the previous semester when the exams were conducted in online mode. However, some of the autonomous colleges affiliated to MKU have already decided to hold the semester exams only offline. “Having offline exams will help students get back to normalcy. So far, offline classes have gone smoothly and there has been no issue. While senior students have offline classes currently, first year students have only online classes. But, we will be having offline semester exams for all,” said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. The college is set to start semester exams by November 15. Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, said that the college has planned to hold the semester exams as offline exams as well. “ We already held first internal exams as offline exams and are now holding the second internal exams offline too. We will definitely hold the semester exams too in a similar manner,” he added. Meanwhile, at Lady Doak College, students are having a continuous assessment system with online submissions being made.  “Due to the pandemic, this system is being followed. Instead of having semester exams, there are five rounds of assessments which are continuous so students have accountability to study,” said Dr Christianna Singh, principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/colleges-considering-holding-semester-exams-offline/articleshow/87635555.cms||---

Ramnagesh Akubathini (23), a native of Ranga Reddy in Hyderabad region who quit his job as a software programmer to pursue a PhD, had continuously altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down. Akubathani was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under Indian Penal Code sections 354(A) (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation) and under Information Technology Act sections 67, 67(B) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in the sexually explicit act, in electronic form). He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathani trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-month-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Subsequently, he faced a barrage of online abuse. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profile to make such threats. The cyber team is well equipped to track them,” said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Rashmi Karandikar. The Delhi Commission for Women has also taken suo motu note of the tweet on the basis of media reports and asked New Delhi police to register an FIR and arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/techie-held-for-rape-threats-to-cricketers-baby/articleshow/87636645.cms||V Narayan

---||Ahmedabad||State govt to hold 3-day atmanirbhar gram yatra||Gandhinagar: Before the expected announcement of state-wide village panchayat elections schedule, the Gujarat government has announced a three-day long ‘atmanirbhar gram yatra’ from November 18 to 20. This appears to be an attempt’ by the ruling BJP to reach out to rural masses before the schedule of the village panchayat elections is announced. The state election commission (SEC) is likely to announce the model code of conduct for the panchayat elections after the three-day long village outreach programme of the state government. Around 11,000 village panchayats from a total 14,400 village panchayats will go to elections. This will be a mini assembly election covering all the district and assembly seats in Gujarat. A total of about 93,000 panchayats members and around 11,000 sarpanchs of villages will be selected through this election. About 10 lakh candidates are expected to contest the village panchayat polls. Although the village panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols, both the BJP and Congress are putting all their might to take control of rural local bodies before next year’s assembly election. Jitu Vaghani, state education minister and the state government spokesperson said, “The state government will organise ‘atmanirbhar gram yatra’ in villages to inaugurate village-level public works. Over 23,000 works of nine departments worth around Rs 500 crore will be dedicated during this period. Ministers and government officers will take part in the yatra.” Amit Chavda, state Congress president, said, “BJP has announced the yatra in rural areas just before the election code of conduct announcement for village panchayat elections. We urge the SEC to stop the BJP from organising this yatra as it is attempting to influence voters and is misusing state government machinery.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-to-hold-3-day-atmanirbhar-gram-yatra/articleshow/87634806.cms||---
---||Goa||‘After plant upgrade, panchayats that don’t segregate will be fined’||Panaji: The work of expanding the 100-tonne Saligao waste treatment plant to a capacity of 250 tonnes is nearing completion, and trial runs on the Rs 103 crore facility will begin next month. Once the plant is fully operational from early next year, panchayats and municipalities in North Goa who do not segregate waste and bring it to the plant — and are seen having waste dumped in their jurisdictions — will be fined up to Rs 2 lakh, waste management minister Michael Lobo said on Wednesday. He said that the Goa state pollution control board will be asked to strictly monitor and fine the non-compliant panchayats. Lobo said that once the new facility, along with the South Goa plant, is operational, Goa will be able to move in the direction of banning littering. The plant has used improvised technology and its tipping floor will be underground, which will ensure there is zero stench coming from the facility, said Lobo. “The facility now has two conveyor belts, one for dry waste and the second for wet waste. It means if panchayats send us segregated waste, it can go directly for treatment,” he said. “The plant now also has an effluent treatment plant within the same complex, where the effluents can be treated without being sent outside for treatment. The plant has been completed in record time, with the work having been completed within one year and three months, despite the Covid pandemic and shortage of labour,” said Lobo. Lobo said that panchayats that have good revenue earnings but are using garbage trucks without a leachate tank will also be fined soon, while panchayats with poor income will be assisted through Nabard by the government to replace garbage trucks with those with leachate tanks. The minister said that the Saligao waste treatment plant will also refuse to accept waste brought by trucks without an attached leachate tank. He said that the measures will ensure that Goa becomes a state free of garbage dumping by the road sides, which will be a boost to the tourism industry. Lobo said that his ministry is also working out a subsidy for hospitals to encourage them further to turn in their biomedical waste for treatment. “Goa will soon become a state compliant in all respects as a construction waste and debris plant is coming up in Bicholim. An e-waste treatment plant is also coming up,” said Lobo. Sandip Prabhu Chodnekar of the Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation said that the plant has not copied any other model, and has been made by adopting technology that is suitable to the local environment, in consultation with experts from IIT, BITS-Pilani and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. “At present, we are getting 180 tonnes of waste at the Saligao plant daily, and we are working in three shifts to process the waste. Once the 250-tonne capacity plant is operational, we will complete processing the waste in one and a half shift,” said Lobo. ------------------------||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-plant-upgrade-panchayats-that-dont-segregate-will-be-fined/articleshow/87636096.cms||---

P S Murugan, president, Madurai Central Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, said that the supply of vegetables, especially tomatoes, was affected after rain damaged crops. “The price of tomato has gone up to Rs 100/kg a couple of days ago but now has come down a little to around Rs 60-70/kg,” he said. He also added that other vegetables like brinjal and small bitter gourds were selling for up to more than Rs 100/kg. S Manual Jayaraj, president, Madurai Central Market Vegetable and Perishable Commodities Merchants Coordinated Association, Paravai, also said that supply of tomatoes have declined due to damage caused by rain. “Only the second quality tomatoes are selling for a low price. The price of tubers has also risen to around Rs 35-45/kg due to poor supply,” he added. “Tomato prices have gone up from Rs 40/kg last week to more than Rs 80/kg this week. Prices of most vegetables have increased by around Rs 20-30/kg,” said Ammaiyappan, a retail vegetable trader. Farmers from Manapparai, Vaiyampatty in the Trichy district cultivate tomatoes on around 1,000 acres of land. However, during the rainy season, they opt to raise paddy. Only after the harvest, they cultivate tomatoes and green chillies during the month of January, P Saravanan, a tomato farmer from Vaiyampatti in the district, said. “During the rainy season, it is normal that there would be a dip in yield as the flowers shed. So, it automatically led to poor arrival of vegetables to the market,” M Thangamani, a wholesale vendor from Gandhi market, said. Farmers from Manapparai, Vaiyampatti raise tomatoes and other country vegetables such as brinjal, ladies finger, snake gourd and broad beans. Due to rain, there was a shortage of these country vegetables also, Thangamani added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/prices-of-tomato-other-vegetables-hit-the-roof-as-rain-affects-supply/articleshow/87639258.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||North winds make temperature drop by 3.9 degrees in Pune||PUNE: Cool weather greeted citizens in the early morning hours of Wednesday when the minimum temperature fell 3.9 degrees below the normal in Shivajinagar. The mercury dipped to 11.8° Celsius. Most locations in Maharashtra recorded below normal minimum temperatures on Wednesday, the lowest minimum being 11°C in Jalgaon. Temperature-wise, Pune was cooler than many places in North India where winter is beginning to set in. It was lower than in Delhi (13.4°C) Amritsar (12.4°C), Chandigarh (11.9°C), Dharamsala (12.2°C), Jammu city (12.6°C), Dehradun (12.2°C). Wednesday was the coldest morning of the season so far in Pune. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Shivajinagar had dropped to 12.7°C. Other locations in Pune recorded higher minimums in comparison to Shivajinagar on Wednesday. Pashan recorded 12.6°C, Lohegaon 14.2°C, Chinchwad 17.6°C, Lavale 16.2°C and Magarpatta 18.8°C. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune told TOI, “The northerly component of winds which originate from North India has been reaching North Madhya Maharashtra and its neighbourhood. This is known as cold air advection, a common phenomenon during the November to January period. This is accompanied by a drop in temperatures. The winds are northerly up to the central Indian region, becoming northeasterly over areas of central India and entering as easterlies over North Maharashtra. Some stations in central India are recording minimum temperatures below 10°C and thus, winds coming from those regions to North Madhya Maharashtra are naturally colder and drier.” Kashyapi said that the cool spell may be short-lived in the city because from November 13 morning, a gradual rise in humidity levels in Pune would be experienced due to moisture incursion. “This will cause a rising tendency in the minimum temperature for a couple of days. Chances of clouding/very light to light rain for a few days during that period cannot be ruled out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/north-winds-make-temp-drop-by-3-9-degrees-in-city/articleshow/87634807.cms||Neha Madaan

Cops said the wallet had been kept in the civic volunteer’s rucksack on the bench, where the accused was sitting. The incident happened at Cyber Crime police station on the first floor of Bidhannagar North police station on the evening of Sashthi when the civic police volunteer had gone to the washroom to change his dress. The accused, Abhishek Basu, (31) was arrested from his Salt Lake AD Block home on Tuesday night. Basu was produced in a Salt Lake court and remanded in a three-day police custody. Cops said that Basu had come to the police station on October 11 to lodge a complaint about Rs 9,000 being debited from his account by a food delivery app. He was asked to get the bank statement to verify his claim and was told to write a formal complaint by sitting on a bench outside the duty officers’ room. “However, without completing the complaint, he left the police station in a hurry. The civic police volunteer realised the missing money in his wallet much later and after checking over a few days, he lodged a complaint on October 26 as we started the probe,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops checked the CCTV footage and found Basu picking up the civic volunteer’s wallet and then placing it back after fiddling with it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-held-for-stealing-cops-money/articleshow/87634815.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It has been found that there are some locations where the accidents are more frequent. These locations are called black spots. Different measures are being taken jointly by the police, the civic body, the state PWD and the NHAI, to cut the rate of accidents at these black spots. Senior officials said any site with five or more fatal or grievous injury accidents within 100m on either side over a period of three years is considered a black spot. ACP (traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad said there are at least 14 black-spots in the city. Various works are being taken up to prevent road accidents at these spots. The identified black spots include Chehedigaon Phata in Nashik Road, Datta Mandir signal in Nashik Road, Shinde village, Fame signal, Tarwala Nagar signal, Nandurnaka signal, CBS signal, Mirchi hotel signal in Adgaon, Rau hotel junction under Mhasrool police station, Sharanpur Road signal, Old Gangapur Naka signal, Dwarka circle, and Siddhivinayak junction in Adgaon. Almost all these black spots are either junctions or have sharp road curves that lead to accidents. Rash driving at these places is also a bog reason for the accidents, said ACP Gaikwad. Officials said after the construction of the flyover from KK Wagh to Jatra hotel, the three black spots on the Mumbai-Agra highway — Swaminarayan junction, the stretch opposite KK Wagh College and the Bali Mandir junction — are no longer black spots. Various works like putting up signboards, speed breakers, blinkers etc. have been completed at the spots concerned. However, rash driving and violation of traffic rules lead to accidents, said the traffic officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/14-dangerous-black-spots-in-nashik-city/articleshow/87633028.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The task force members, during a recent meeting, observed that all intensive care units (ICUs) treating Covid patients were potential fire hazards because of the air conditioners, oxygen supply units and flammable sanitizer at the facilities. The task force has in its recommendations told all hospitals to identify the causes leading to fires caused by oxygen and take lessons from the past experiences to improve the prevention and preparedness.  State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “The mix of oxygen, electrical points and equipment in air-conditioned settings creates an environment conducive to fire. Mandatory mock drills and training are needed at all sites. We need to ensure that fire safety audits are a must at the facilities. There should be zero tolerance for the violators.”  State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that these recommendations (see graphic)would be presented in detail at a meeting under the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-recommends-fire-safety-steps-in-icus/articleshow/87634810.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Contempt against top officials over Gandhi museum at Central Park||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday issued contempt notice to chief secretary Niranjan Arya, urban development and housing principal secretary Kunji Lal Meena and Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) commissioner Gaurav Goyal over the planned Mahatma Gandhi museum project inside the Central Park. The Central Park Sangharsh Samiti had alleged that the project was being done in violation of court orders. The samiti objected to institutional and other uses of these properties for building the Mahatma Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences on the land of Hotel Laxmi Vilas and Kanak Bhawan in Central Park. Following this, legal notices were sent to officials by samiti president, Yogesh Yadav. Vimal Chaudhary, the counsel for sangharsh samiti, said, “Three weeks have been given by the court to file a reply. We argued that institutional and other uses of park land for Mahatma Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences were in violation of court orders.” In May 2017, the Rajasthan high court had ordered the state government to take possession of the hotel and Kanak Bhawan land and said that it should only be used for park or garden and not for anything else, the petitioner said. This order was given after hearing a petition filed by Sanjay Tyagi. Following the same order, the JDA took possession of the hotel and building land. The government also recently laid the foundation stone to construct the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences, conceived on the lines of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) and School of Sciences of Governance here. “The sanctity of the park has already been tampered with by the JDA as the influential golf course administration is continuing to carry out construction in the ‘no construction zone’ after cutting trees. The officials are not taking action. The new project will create more disturbance in the park,” Yadav said. For the structural construction of Gandhi museum at Central Park, the JDA had appointed a Jaipur-based firm which is expected to complete the work within nine months, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/contempt-against-top-officials-over-gandhi-museum-at-central-park/articleshow/87635594.cms||---

The data since Diwali shows the AQI for most days has remained above 200, which falls under poor category with possible health impacts as breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.As per the Central Pollution Control Board report, Ludhiana had AQI of 306 on Tuesday evening. It comes under very poor category with possible health impacts as respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Before this, the highest AQI (345) was on November 15 last year. Since the day till October 31 this year, AQI was more than 200 eight times.The data of the ongoing month shows that AQI was 249 on November 1; 166 on November 3; 292 on November 5 (a day after Diwali); and 163 the next day.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials said high pollution levels are because of stubble burning and left-over pollution of Diwali crackers.“Stubble burning picked up recently. Besides, the pollutants that went in air due to bursting of crackers on Diwali have not dissipated, so those have got accumulated in the city’s sky resulting in rise in pollution. The AQI will drop if winds blow or it rains in Ludhiana,” they added.Green activists said required steps need to be taken.“Stubble burning is a policy failure of the government. It is easy to blame farmers, though the government has not given them alternatives. Stubble is a source of energy. It can be used to generate energy as we are facing its shortage. Long-term planning is needed to harness this type of energy. During festivals, use of polluting crackers should be avoided,” said Jaskirat Singh, an activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-breathes-years-poorest-air/articleshow/87633968.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Kolkata||Survey starts for city’s tallest skywalk at Ruby||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has started the process of building the tallest skywalk in the city at the Ruby crossing. On Tuesday, engineers and experts carried out a detailed survey for the proposed 240m-long steel structure that will ensure seamless pedestrian movement in every direction and will also have a link with Hemanta Mukherjee Metro station. State’s urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said: “The project aims at seamless pedestrian movement and easier access to the Metro station. Our officers have started their work, keeping the Metro structure in mind.” It will be the first circular skywalk in the city and the construction cost has been pegged at Rs 50 crore. The skywalk will run 8m above the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor. Once the station becomes operational, the pedestrian load at the crossing is likely to increase manifold. “The circular shape of the skywalk will give it an aesthetic look. The shape of the crossing is such that we need to build a circular skywalk to connect all corners. There will be escalators and elevators to attract people for a hassle-free use of the skywalk,” said a KMDA engineer. The project has already received a go-ahead from the finance department. KMDA and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) have already conducted a joint inspection to have a look at two underground water lines — of 800mm and 1,100mm diameter – that run through a portion of the crossing from where some of the piers of the skywalk are supposed to rise. The water lines come out of the Dhapa water treatment plant and run under EM Bypass to supply potable water to areas further south and off the Bypass. Trial pits will be dug at multiple locations between Calcutta International School and Metro Cash & Carry to have a thorough understanding of the alignment of the water pipes. KMC has prepared a cost estimate to shift the water lines and will hand it over to the KMDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/survey-starts-for-citys-tallest-skywalk-at-ruby/articleshow/87634820.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

He has been called on Friday again. Sajnani told the media outside the NCB office that he has been falsely arrested as the so-called contraband found in his possession was herbal tobacco. Sajnani also said that he has written letters to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the ‘false’ allegations made against him. After the questioning session, Sajnani told the media that the SIT is doing a fair job and they asked him only relevant questions pertaining to the case. He said the SIT were keen on understanding the nature of the products seized, how the herbal products were marketed and where the packaging material came from. The SIT asked Sajnani whether Samir Khan is a part of his business, which he denied. Sajnani told the SIT that Khan has been his friend for 25 years. On January 9, the NCB had raided Sajnani’s Khar house, seized drugs and arrested him, Rahila Furniturewala and her sister Shaista.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt has lukewarm approach towards climate change: Oppn||Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition charged that the intergovernmental panel report on climatic changes that warned of serious impact on Kerala is being ignored by the state government, and it is still going ahead with projects like the semi high-speed rail project that will have serious impact on the ecology. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion regarding the alarming situation that can arise due to climate change, a first on the subject in the assembly’s history, MLA PC Vishnunath said that the IPCC report made serious observations about the state. Of the 12 cities that could be engulfed by water across the world, one is Kochi. Also, there have been repeated natural disasters across the state since 2018, including Ockhi, floods, cloud bursts, landslides, cyclonic circulation, etc. “Despite these, the state could not finalise the action plan on climate change and submit it to the Centre, the draft of which was prepared in 2018 itself,” he said. He also said that the centre for climatic studies in Kottayam has a sanctioned strength for 12 scientists, but none has been appointed. Government is also sitting over the inter-disciplinary committee report prepared after the floods that hit the state. All these show the state’s lukewarm approach on this matter, he said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who agreed that the matter is serious and should be discussed on a broader canvas and not on a short notice, said that the government is doing all possible steps to address the issues. He said that the government is thinking of appointing a nodal agency for making the state carbon-neutral. He said that the government is also considering conducting an international conclave on the subject with experts from all over the world, in the capital. The government believes in balancing developmental activities with environmental conservation. He also listed out government’s several initiatives, including the Rebuild Kerala Initiative, the paddy-land and wetland act, electric vehicles policy, waste-to-energy programme, among others as some of the government’s steps with an eye on environment conservation. Opposition leader VD Satheesan, however, said that the government is still lagging far behind in taking concrete steps to address the serious issues that are cited in the IPCC report. He said that there are families residing in relief camps for as long as six years, and the government is yet to rehabilitate them. “The state has become a place which is susceptible to drastic climatic changes since 2015. It is yet to learn and take the necessary steps despite thousands of landslides have been reported from Western Ghats. Even after the 2018 floods, the government sanctioned more than 200 quarries in the state,” he said. At the same time, the government is going ahead with projects like the SilverLine project, that will divide the state vertically with a 30-feet high embankment. The government has not even conducted an environmental impact study for the project, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-has-lukewarm-approach-towards-climate-change-oppn/articleshow/87634849.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The five hectares of land was cultivated with ‘Uma’, a high yielding paddy variety. The paddy cultivation in the municipality started in the year 2017. For this purpose, a farmers’ association was formed. The association includes 22 agriculturalists from the region. The land that has been barren for 18 years was converted into paddy fields by the farmers with the help of machineries. The municipality has decided to provide the rice to the civil supplies corporation after giving it to the locals. The rice will be sold at an amount of Rs 28 per kg. After 120 days of nurturing, the crop was harvested with the help of modern machineries. “We have been cultivating paddy for the last four years and we have seen a regular increase in the yield every year,” said Prabha B L, the agricultural officer of Attingal. As part of the ‘subhiksha Keralam’ project, the Attingal municipality and the padashekara samithy have started paddy cultivation in its barren lands. The municipality is in the process of converting more barren lands into agricultural lands. The harvesting was done under the guidance of municipality vice chairman G Thulaseedharan Pillai, ward councillor Sangeetharani, members from padasekhara samithy, including Girijan, Narayana Pillai, Balan Pillai, Prabhakaran, Ramachandran Nair, Sreerangan, Sreekumar, Raghunathan, Murukan and Sasidharan Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/barren-land-now-yields-25000kg-paddy/articleshow/87634837.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||City bizmen seek alms for PM, Centre||Ludhiana: In a unique protest held in the city on Wednesday, industrialists begged for alms from the general public on Gill Road near the office of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers’ Association (UCPMA). The industrialists with steel bowls in their hands stopped commuters and requested for alms so that they could send these to the Centre and the Prime Minister for combating inflation. It was part of an ongoing chain of protests by businessmen against the sharp rise in the rates of steel raw material due to which their cost of production has skyrocketed.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), said, “Wednesday was the ninth day of our protest against the Central government and the BJP leaders. Dozens of businessmen joined us from different sectors to beg for alms to be sent to the Centre to help it combat inflation and take action against steel manufacturing plants and companies so that they lower the rates. We got great response from the residents as everyone who stopped over praised us for the peaceful protest and also expressed support in this cause.”Garment and textile sector businessmen also joined the protest, which till now was mainly being led by the representatives of the bicycle industry. Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, said, “Manufacturers across all industry segments, including bicycle, sewing machine, auto parts, garment and textile, are bearing the brunt of the Centre turning a blind eye to the problem of rise in the rates of raw material of all kinds. We are fed up of contacting the Union ministers and departments again and again. Therefore, we were forced to hit the roads and beg because the day is not far when factories will be shut down because of the government's apathy. Our protest will not stop till the rates of raw materials are reduced and the government forms a regulator for monitoring and controlling prices.”According to Charanjiv Singh, another garment and textile sector industrialist, “Rates of yarn, chemicals and dyes have increased by high proportions and as a result our cost of production has risen to such levels that we will not be able to break-even at the existing selling prices. Because of this, businesses of most of the micro, small and medium-scale textile and garment units have come to a standstill. If the Centre wants the businesses to function smoothly, it should take some steps to lower raw material rates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-bizmen-seek-alms-for-pm-centre/articleshow/87633985.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh among top 4 states with higher petrol costs per litre||HYDERABAD: The Centre may have decreased petrol prices, but the twin Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana still stand third and fourth in the country with higher costs per litre because of existing VAT. There are several other states in the country where price of petrol is still higher than Rs 105. Despite state and central government price cuts, Rajasthan has the highest per litre fuel price in the country at Rs 111.10. The desert state is followed by Maharashtra (Rs 109.98), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 109.05), and Telangana (Rs 108.20). Apart from these states, the price of petrol in Madhya Pradesh (Rs 107.23), Kerala (Rs 106.36), Bihar (Rs 105.90), and Punjab (Rs 105.02) are higher than Rs 105 per litre. After the Centre dropped prices, all states and union territories, regardless of their cuts, saw a decrease in price ranging from Rs 6 to Rs 17. Petrol rates in Telangana reduced by Rs 6.29 and in Andhra Pradesh by Rs 6.10. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala have not reduced their state VAT on petrol prices. The Petrol Pump Owners Association believes that the Telangana government should proceed with caution, at least in terms of diesel costs, by lowering VAT. “In the case of diesel, there is a price difference of roughly Rs 8 between Karnataka (Rs 85.01) and Telangana. Many transport vehicles will go to border areas along roads and fill their tanks, resulting in significant sales losses. It is, therefore, preferable to decrease VAT in order to promote sales,” Consortium of Indian Petrol Dealers joint secretary Rajiv Amaram said. Mizoram had the largest cut of Rs 17. 62, with prices falling to Rs 94. 94 from Rs 107. 12. While all states saw price cuts ranging from Rs 11 to Rs 17 after the Centre decreased rates (some states reduced VAT while others did not), Andhra Pradesh has second-highest diesel cost at Rs 95. 18 and Telangana third with a price of Rs 94. 62 per litre diesel. Rajasthan again has the highest diesel price, at Rs 95.71. Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Bihar and MP have diesel price per litre still above Rs 90.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-among-top-4-states-with-higher-petrol-costs-per-litre/articleshow/87634842.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The main attraction of the event is 45 Aagam chhod which has been inked in gold that was kept on display for devotees along with kalpsutra that was carved on seashell by an Odiya artist. “On the occasion of Gyan Panchmi, we put different auspicious religious things including 45 Aagam chhod, which were handwritten with gold ink by a Muslim artist from Surendranagar district a decade ago. Sadly, the artist passed away last year after suffering from Covid-19,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji told TOI, adding that the invaluable religious scripture now enjoys approximately Rs 5 crore in market value at present. Shubhmangal foundation had gifted a gold written Bhagwat Gita to a Hindu foundation along with a Sikshapatri to Vadtal Swaminarayan trust. In return, the trust had gifted the gold written kalpsutra to Shubhmangal foundation, he explained. Along with this, handwritten kapsutra on seashell by an Odiya artist, wood print of Saraswati devi by Rajasthani artist, idol of lord Parshwanath made from a single wood trunk, an ivory Bhandar, Astlakshmi made from shreeparn wood and many more are kept on display, he said. Talking about the event, the acharya said that 300 devotees from different parts of the country are observing Updhan fast under the supervision of acharya Abhayadev Surishwarji. “We are going to celebrate the Mokshamala vidhi on December 8, the day on which Abhayadev Surishwarji will also complete 60 years of Diksha,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji added. He said that of the 300 devotees observing fast, 150 are aged between 7 and 14 years. The 47-day long Updhan fast is a very tough ordeal which demands total dedication, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gold-inked-scriptures-shine-on-gyan-panchmi/articleshow/87634014.cms||Mehul Jani

In both incidents, the targets were bus passengers. Two persons have been arrested. “We believe an old, organized racket is behind the snatching attempts,” said a police officer. Police presence in the area has been strengthened. According to the traffic department, the first incident was reported around 11am on Wednesday. “Sergeant Amal Prasad was on duty at Exide crossing when he noticed commotion inside a bus plying on route 230 (Alipore Zoo-Kamarhati). Three women passengers were shouting for help. Prasad quickly realized that one of their mobile phones had been snatched and the snatcher was trying to flee. He tried to stop him but he fled further towards the east of AJC Bose Road and entered Lord Sinha Road. Civic volunteer Mrinal Harijan — on duty at the AJC Bose Road-Lord Sinha Road crossing — got a transmission from Prasad. Harijan chased him down from Lord Sinha Road for another 100m before nabbing the accused. Barely two hours later, Anshuman Das of South traffic guard was on duty when he noticed that one person travelling in a minibus screaming for help. A gang was trying to snatch his belongings and the man had managed to catch hold of one of them. Das immediately got inside the bus and nabbed the accused, later identified as Asghar Hussain. The complainant — Ratikanta Barik — said the accused was trying to snatch his costly mobile phone.

Another 542 ST workers were suspended on Wednesday for being part of the strike, taking the total number of suspended staff to 918. A protest with held at Mankhurd as the strike entered its 14th dayThackeray said: “ST workers, you are one of us... The state government is trying hard to resolve demands you’ve raised... Following directions of the HC, we have set up a committee to consider the issue and find a solution. I appeal to you with folded hands not to conduct an agitation that holds the common man to ransom. For the last two years, we have been battling the pandemic...” The strike, however, continued for the 14th day across the state, with MSRTC incurring over Rs 80 crore losses in the past two weeks. On Wednesday, all 250 bus depots were completely shut and bus services across the state had come to a standstill. BJP leaders joined the protests with ST workers on Wednesday, taking part in protests. Former MP Kirit Somaiya and MLA Gopichand Padalkar and a few MSRTC staff were detained by police outside Mantralaya as they planned to participate in a satyagraha protest. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis flayed MVA ministers for not fulfilling demands of ST staff. Speaking to the media on his arrival at Nagpur airport, the former CM termed the the Thackeray-led government as “insensitive”. Parab, who is also MSRTC chairman, said: “I appeal to ST workers not to get provoked by political parties. Finally, the damage will be faced by workers as we have already suspended some protesters.... Political parties are capitalising on the strike but workers will have to face loss of pay for not coming to work. Will political parties take responsibility for salary lost... ST workers’ demand to be considered as government staff can’t be considered in a day or two.” Thackeray added : “I also appeal to political parties provoking poor ST workers for political gain, to not do so. It’s not the time for politics.” With no ST buses, 10 private buses were deployed at three Thane depots for Pune and Nashik. At Vashi, the police detained 68 ST staff who came from other districts to join a protest in Mumbai.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana has not imposed additional cess on petrol||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has declared a war on the Centre, stating that cess imposed by it on petrol and diesel contributes to high fuel prices. Data obtained by TOI on state taxes shows that 14 states, including Telangana, are not imposing any additional cess. However, the rest, including some Union territories, impose cess either as a percentage (per litre or kilolitre) or flat rate (in terms of rupees). Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh along with Telangana do not impose their own cess. Jharkhand, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh levy cess (as a per cent or in rupees), while certain states like West Bengal and Sikkim impose general cess per kilolitre. Some states levy cess for road development and maintenance like Andhra Pradesh (Rs 1), Nagaland, Tripura, Rajasthan and Tripura. However, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have unique cess and taxes. Delhi has no additional cess on petrol, but levies a specific air ambience fee of Rs 250 per kilolitre on diesel. Jammu & Kashmir imposes a Rs 5 per litre cess for employment, while Ladakh extracts Rs 5 per litre on petrol and Rs 1 per litre on diesel for employment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, Gujarat, levies a town rate cess of 4% per litre, while Meghalaya, like Delhi, levies a pollution fee of Rs 0.10 per litre. And, Goa is the only state that imposes a green cess of 0.5%. According to experts, cess collection does not fall under the purview of the common pool of taxes. “Cess must be imposed under certain conditions. However, any collection of cess will go directly to respective state government or the Centre, if it is imposed. As there is no sharing of cess between the Centre and the states, all governments are using this as a source of income,” Dr Krishna Reddy Chittedi, assistant professor, school of economics, University of Hyderabad, explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-not-imposed-additional-cess-on-petrol/articleshow/87634854.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Sacked vidya volunteers left in the cold by Telangana government||HYDERABAD: It is not just the private schools, but government too is hesitant to rehire teachers (vidya volunteers) whose contracts were terminated. There were 12,000 vidya volunteers (VV) in government schools before the pandemic, but now none. This despite the strength in government schools in the state having increased by over1.25 lakh this year. According to government teachers themselves, there is a need for at least 15,000 VVs in the state as many have retired. While the state has renewed contracts of teachers working on hourly basis and outsourced teachers in residential schools, it has shown no interest in renewing contracts of VVs, said N Ramesh, who used to teach Telugu as a VV at a government school in the city for four years. Ramesh now works as a painter on a daily wage of Rs 800. “We have submitted several representations to officials to renew our contracts. But no one has responded. It’s as if the government wants to see if the newly enrolled students will go back to private schools once conditions improve. The state is not making any efforts to retain them either,” Ramesh added. United Teachers’ Federation general secretary Chava Ravi, a government teacher, also echoed Ramesh’s fears. The state, he said, appeared to have no interest in rehiring VVs for this academic year. “In many schools, there are no subject teachers. The state is using services of primary/upper primary teachers in high schools as attendance percentage in lower classes is comparatively less,” said Ravi. Sources from the school education department, meanwhile, claimed that the state might think about VVs once regularisation was over as they would then know the exact requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sacked-vidya-volunteers-left-in-the-cold-by-state/articleshow/87634859.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Collector Suraj Mandhare said the sub-committee comprising five MLAs, collector and other officials, which will be headed by district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, was likely to meet in some time and decide upon the issue. “The committee will soon decide about the demands and decide upon the same,” said Mandhare. The sub-committee formed has been allotted the powers to decide upon the equitable distribution of funds to all talukas for their development. Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of the civil hospital, has requested for funds of Rs 7.5 crore, which are required to upgrade the firefighting systems in the civil hospital, the sub-district and rural hospitals in the district. The demand assumes significance in the backdrop of the fire that broke out in the ICU of the civil hospital in Ahmednagar claiming the lives of 12 people undergoing treatment there. The fire audit of the civil hospital was carried out by the authorities immediately after a mishap in Bhandara civil hospital, where the fire broke out in the sick and newborn care unit (SNCU) in January claiming 10 lives. The fire department has proposed a ‘dry riser’ for the civil hospital and the buildings of the other hospitals under the state health department across the district. ‘Riser’ is a network of pipes raised so that that there is a vent at every floor of the building and has a hose attached to the same. In the event of a fire, water can be pumped through the pipes and using the hose, it can be aimed at the base of the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-likely-to-allot-funds-for-fire-equipment/articleshow/87765378.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused Narendrakumar Pal had applied for bail on October 30 on the grounds that his name is nowhere mentioned in the FIR. Pal further claimed that he had contacted the other accused to legally adopt the baby and not to purchase the baby boy. Opposing Pal’s bail plea, police submitted an affidavit in the court. Police argued that Pal and other accused had planned the conspiracy to abduct a child and later sell it to him as he and his wife were childless. “The infant had to suffer because of the greed of a child of the childless couple and greed of money of other co-accused. It was also argued that the accused had a direct role in the crime and he may jump the bail and hamper the investigation,” said additional public prosecutor C G Patel. The court of additional sessions judge A J Kanani upheld the arguments and denied bail to Pal. Pal had purchased a six-day old baby boy for Rs 4 lakh from Kalpesh Rathod, a man living in Kalol. Rathod had asked other accused in Vadodara city and Waghodiya to find a child for Pal. One of the accused named Kalidas alias Kaliyo had abducted the infant on October 20 and handed it over to Rathod, who sold it off to Pal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/army-man-accused-of-purchasing-infant-denied-bail/articleshow/87633907.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Consequently, many teachers, especially from kindergarten to class 3, were still out of work as managements have not asked them to resume duties. “Of the total 2.5 lakh teachers in the state, at least half of them are still out of work,” said B Shivaraj, state vice-president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). In most schools, services of high school teachers were being utilised, while in a few others upper primary or middle school teachers were also working. He said many schools had reduced teachers by 50% in high schools during the current academic year. “The most affected ones are pre-primary and primary teachers,” he said, adding those working, including new recruits, were being paid only 50% of salaries. Private teachers said hardly 50% high school students were attending physical classes every day, while it was 20-30% for primary and upper primary. The managements, meanwhile, were worried about many students not paying fees despite schools having started physical classes. “Only after January we will know the exact situation. We have decided not to ask fees until then as students may stop attending physical classes if we ask for dues,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association. He confirmed that a few budget schools were not calling teachers of KG to class 3 as most haven’t begun offline classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/primary-teachers-struggleas-schools-deny-work-pay/articleshow/87634868.cms||---

The hassle to get permissions, experts say, is what is making applicants hesitant. Telangana government and oil companies have eased rules for setting up petrol pumps. While applicants in neighbouring GHMC areas have been getting licences and other permissions, in Cantonment a new petrol pump is not on the horizon. Currently, there are only 12 petrol outlets, opened four decades ago. Confirming that there are no requisitions regarding opening of a petrol outlet, deputy CEO, Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB), Vijaykumar Balan Nair told TOI: “The Union defence ministry has to give clearance regarding allotment of a retail outlet (petrol & diesel) in Cantonment jurisdiction. That is why applicants may not come forward to apply as it is a lengthy process.” Telangana Petroleum Dealers Association’s president, Amarender Reddy said, “Lack of land in Cantonment, and stringent MoD rules regarding land lease rights are main reasons for applicants hesitating.” Reddy said, “Though applicants face some hurdles in getting permissions in GHMC, officials clear files within five months.” Once civil areas are merged into the civic body, Cantonment applicants to can get permissions hassle-free, said Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-new-petrol-pump-in-cantt-in-decades/articleshow/87634869.cms||Sunil Mungara

It proves that even elected women representatives are not safe in the state.” He argued that this was a reason that crimes against women were on rising in the state. Quoting NCRB data, he said that Rajasthan was leading in the country in terms of crimes against women. “The law and order situation is worsening in the state and it appears that CM Ashok Gehlot is not able to control the situation,” said Rathore.

Chief minister’s statement in the assembly on Wednesday came in the wake of incidents of Youth Congress activists protesting against and blocking film shooting in the state, in connection with the controversy involving actor Joju George. Responding to a submission by MLA M Mukesh in the matter, the chief minister said that the government will not allow anyone to take law into their hands. The encroachment into the creative freedom of the artists will be dealt with firmly by the government. Dictating what others should eat or wear is a Fascist approach.  There are people in the country who are involved in such practices. We call them uncivilized anti-socials, he said. He said that the attack on creative freedom has been happening in the state too and no force can deter anyone from practicing one’s profession without fear. The government will take strong action against anyone who tries to do so, he said. Without naming Joju, Vijayan said that the attack against the actor is not an isolated incident, and there are indications of a planned decision behind this. Without naming Youth Congress activists either, he said that it was surprising that the group of people behind such attacks are taking the cover of democracy for their deeds. He warned that they should realise that the soil is not fertile for Fascist practices and they should give up their beliefs that they can use muscle power. Opposition leader VD Satheesan criticised the Youth Congress way of protest and said that blocking film shootings is not justifiable and the protest of Congress is not against film personalities, but against fuel price hike. He said that the party will take action against anyone who resorts to such practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-action-against-attack-on-creative-freedom-cm/articleshow/87634883.cms||---

The intermediate first year exams for the 2020-21 batch were conducted between October 25 and November 3. Over 4.5 lakh students had appeared for the exams. The spot valuation for the recently concluded intermediate first year exams began on November 6. The board has roped in junior lecturers from government and private colleges with experience for spot valuation duties duly instructing colleges to relieve individuals by reorganising classes. Despite directing colleges to reorganise classes and relieve the individuals as and when required, many failed to report to valuation duties. TSBIE secretary Syed Omer Jaleel said that they would not hesitate to initiate stringent action against all defaulter junior lecturers/managements if they don’t report to duty by Thursday morning. “In Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts alone, we issued 99 notices,” Jaleel told TOI, adding that all centrers put together, about 2,000 junior lecturers, mostly from corporate colleges, failed to report to spot valuation duties. He said that apart from imposing a penalty on managements, the board could also cancel the affiliation of the college for violating norms. “Necessary disciplinary/penal action shall follow immediately if lecturers fail to report by tomorrow morning,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2k-teachersface-heat-forskipping-interevaluations/articleshow/87634877.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Hope for Covid and mucormycosis-hit patients in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: For 40-year-old priest from Vijayawada, Covid-19, which he had contracted early this year, proved to be a double whammy, leaving him completely shaken. Barely had he recovered from a severe bout of the infection, the dreaded black fungus hit him. The priest’s condition worsened as he visited hospital after hospital in vain and by the time he could receive some medical aid, he had completely lost his upper jaw and teeth to the infection. The black fungus (mucormycosis) left him with a completely distorted facial structure. He lost his ability to speak. “Although I could not chew and was completely on liquids, what affected me most was that I was unable to even recite mantras and prayers, which are most essential part of my life. It left me compeltley shattered and as I went from one hospital to another looking for treatment, I went into depression. It was only after the doctor who treated me reassured me that he will make me chant mantras again that I became hopeful,” said the priest, chanting ‘Om namah Shivaya’ to denote the Kartik masam puja. “Some cases demand upper jaw resection (cheek bones, palate, base of eye, soft tissue, etc.) and with the advantage of 3D CT facial bones reconstruction, 3D-milled titanium implant plates, designed specifically for each patient, prosthetic functional reconstruction of lost structures, including the teeth. Thereafter, the patient’s speech, chewing efficiency and aesthetics are improved. The treatment given and the expert care taken resulted in a tremendous improvement in the quality of the patients’ lives,” said Dr C Sharath Babu, department of dental and maxillofacial, Medicover Hospitals, where two patients underwent successful jaw reconstruction and rehabilitation. A middle-aged LIC agent from Guntur was also left with a functional oral disability post recovery from dual infections. “Talking is my profession and once I could not do it, it was like I was gasping for breath. It took me more than three months to get back my speech, but I want all patients of mucormycosis, who suffered disability, to not lose hope as there are options available now,” he added. The uniqueness of this infection and the large defective area it creates have proven to be very difficult to treat, not to mention the psychological, emotional, and functional loss that the patients incur as a result of oral defects and facial disfiguration . “Some cases demand upper jaw resection (cheek bones, palate, base of eye, soft tissue, etc.) and with the advantage of 3D CT facial bones reconstruction, 3D-milled titanium implant plates, designed specifically for each patient, prosthetic functional reconstruction of lost structures, including the teeth.

Before the onset of second wave of Covid-19 in Mumbai, passengers were able to book season tickets as vaccination was only restricted to health care workers. Later state government came up with guidelines that permitted only fully vaccinated people to travel on local trains. The state government developed a UPS which is linked to COWIN platform that helps validate those citizens who have taken both doses of the vaccine with a gap of 14 days after the second jab. Railway board chairman Suneet Sharma, who was on a two-day visit to Mumbai, asked railway officials to coordinate with the state government so that UPS data gets synced with UTS on a mobile app, thus allowing eligible people to buy tickets online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-soon-cr-and-wr-tickets-on-mobile-app/articleshow/87635666.cms||Manthan K Mehta

Principals and teachers opine that commercial establishments, including tea shops or small eateries, should not be allowed near the school premises as there is a chance that children can consume unhygienic food and these places can become an ‘adda’ (a hangout place). “A few days ago, a tea shop was opened near the school. We got it closed with the help of officials keeping student’s health in mind,” said Varalakshmi M, principal, Jubilee Hills Public School adding that if such establishments come up near the premises, they make it a point to get them removed legally. In Jubilee Hills, there are over 15 pubs constantly buzzing with activity on Road numbers 36, 45, and 10. Apart from blocking the road traffic, noise pollution is the biggest issue when such establishments are located in residential areas. Most vehicles are parked on road in front of these establishments as they don’t have parking, residents complain. “In a 2-km radius from our school, there are at least five to six pubs,” said R Praveen Rao, a Telugu teacher at a school in Jubilee Hills. “Many students pass these pubs to reach school and back home. It is common for them to see someone passing out on the roadside, sleeping in the car, empty or broken liquor bottles on roads, or witnessing rash driving. It is wrong to have such establishments near schools.” School staff also point out that there of many bars and pubs in Jubilee Hills. “We stay right in the heart of residential area and I feel bars, pubs, or other commercial establishments should not be allowed in the area,” said a principal of another school in Jubilee Hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-do-not-want-bars-pubs-near-premises/articleshow/87634894.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

They were also released from prison on Wednesday evening. Apart from Chammany, Congress leaders Manu Jacob, Jerges Jacob, Joseph Maliyekal and Shereef Buhari were granted bail. The accused should execute a bond for Rs 50,000 with two sureties each for the amount. The court also ordered to deposit a sum of Rs 37,500 each in court or together furnish bank guarantee for a sum of Rs 1,87,500 as per Section 8 of the Kerala Prevention of Damage to Private Property and Payment of Compensation Act. The court will consider bail petitions by the other accused, including PY Shahjahan, Arun Varghese and PG Joseph, on Friday. The case pertains to the incidents that occurred during the Congress blockade of Edappally-Vyttila bypass on November 1, protesting the rise in fuel prices. Actor Joju George, who was stuck in the traffic block due to the Congress blockade, had protested against it, inviting the ire of Congress workers who vandalized his car. George was injured and the rear windshield of his car was broken. Congress workers gathered outside the prison to welcome the leaders when they were released. Earlier in the day, Mahila Congress activists held a march to Maradu police station alleging that the police did not register a case against the actor based on their complaint. Municipal chairperson in movie shooting row Meanwhile, Thrikkakara municipality chairperson Ajitha Thankappan on Tuesday reportedly denied permission to shoot a Malayalam movie.

But, Thankappan denied the reports. She said that she had simply registered her protest as her colleagues and fellow party workers are behind the bars just because of the actor’s complaint. She said that permission was given to the film crew on the same day of submitting the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/five-congress-leaders-granted-bail/articleshow/87634908.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jodhpur||2 armed robbers loot Rs 12 lakh from bank near Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Two armed robbers looted Rs 12 lakh from a bank in Gangani village near Jodhpur on Wednesday morning. They entered the bank barely after it was opened in the morning and fled with the money in just 10 minutes. Both the accused had their faces wrapped with hankies to hide their identity. One of them had a pistol in his hand, while the other had a knife with him to threaten the bank staff. Police have begun a hunt for the accused based on the video grabs captured by the cameras in the bank and have set up nakabandi at different routes. According to ACP Rajendra Prasad Diwakar, the incident took place in a branch of SBI in village Gangani on Jodhpur-Nagaur highway at about 10.45am on Wednesday barely sometime after the doors of the bank were opened for the day. “Bank had just opened at about 10am and the staff members were about to begin their day when two persons with their faces wrapped with hankies and one of them wielding a pistol and other waving a knife, barged into the bank and locked entire staff including the guard, who was present in one of the chambers,” said Diwakar. They also threatened a few customers, who had come to withdraw cash and one of them headed straight to the cashier and threatened him with the knife, while the one with the pistol kept watch around waving his pistol. “At cashier’s chamber, he picked all the cash available there and stuffed the entire money into a bag, which they had brought with them,” said Diwakar. They executed the loot in just 10-15 minutes and fled from the bank with the cash on a motorcycle. Total amount looted was later counted as Rs 11.95 lakh. Diwakar said that the police have filed a case on the complaint of the bank manager and have been trying to identify both of them. “We have initiated a search operation to hunt them and have set up nakabandi in entire area. Besides, we are also checking the CCTV footage from the cameras around,” he said. In past one month, this is the third such incident where the banks have been looted in similar manner by the persons with similar appearance. In the two previous incidents also, the targets were the small branches from rural areas, which included SBI branch in village Khandap in Barmer and village Roon in Nagaur. While a sum of Rs 5.23 lakh had been looted in the former incident, Rs 94,000 were looted in the later incident. Police have not achieved any breakthrough in any of these incidents either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/2-armed-robbers-loot-rs-12l-from-bank-near-jodhpur/articleshow/87635624.cms||---

But upending the narrative, a district collector went straight to a government hospital for his wife’s delivery. The message to the masses is hopefully delivered too. In the wee hours of Wednesday, Bhadradri Kothagudem collector Anudeep Durishetty’s wife gave birth to a boy at the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam. This was the second such instance in just over two weeks, with Khammam additional collector Snehalatha Mogili giving birth at a government hospital on October 24. “The government hospital has all the facilities,” said collector Durishetty, who is the UPSC topper of 2017. The couple’s decision is now the talk of the town. Finance and health minister T Harish Rao and transport minister Puvvada Nageshwara Rao, while congratulating the couple, lauded them for opting for a government hospital. Earlier in October, additional collector Mogili, a 2017 batch IAS officer, had opted to get admitted at the Matha Sishu Kendram at the Government Hospital in Khammam district headquarters. Mogili’s husband Dr P Subharish, a 2017 batch IPS officer serving as assistant superintendent of police in Manuguru in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, had said that they had consciously decided for the delivery at a government hospital. In 2017, the then collector of Jayashankar Bhoopalpalli, Akunuri Murali, had also admitted his daughter in a government hospital for her delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collector-delivers-message-takes-wife-to-govt-hospital-for-delivery/articleshow/87634904.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Fifa plans for World Cup every two years make sense for India, Sunil Chhetri tells Arsene Wenger||Panaji: Sunil Chhetri had just finished expressing his views on plans to alter the World Cup cycle from four years to two, when Arsene Wenger put his hand up. The former Arsenal manager, now Fifa’s Chief of Global Football Development, is leading a feasibility study into the practicalities of a new international calendar. During an online video call with national captains, Wenger listened to Chhetri and then posed a question of his own. “When will India play at the World Cup,” Wenger asked Chhetri. “Hopefully soon. It’s our dream,” prompt came the reply from the India captain. Should Fifa go ahead with plans to have the World Cup every two years, countries like India – ranked 107 -- will have more opportunities to get closer to the biggest sporting spectacle on earth. Whether the team is good enough to navigate its way through fierce competition is a different story. “During the meeting (with Wenger) I said having the World Cup every two years will always be welcomed by teams like us, who either have not played, narrowly miss out, or need more chances. “Also, one part of me thinks the World Cup is very sacred. It’s a huge tournament and the wait (of four years) makes it wonderful. But that’s the old school fan in me. The player in me, and the Indian football fan in me, knows if qualifiers happen every two years, we will have more opportunities,” said Chhetri, who has scored 80 international goals, the same as Argentina star Lionel Messi. At the meeting, Wenger argued that increasing the regularity of World Cups will boost all aspects of the game. The former Arsenal manager also proposed two international breaks -- in March and October -- which provides more time together for national teams and less disruption from international fixtures for clubs. It’s something that Chhetri knows will do Indian football a world of good. “I did say having a specified international gap will help us. We keep complaining that we don’t get enough time, there is a problem with the calendar and stuff like that. If there is an uniform calendar where one or two months are dedicated to the national team, no matter what, it really helps us,” said Chhetri. When Wenger spoke to captains, Chhetri was busy with the national team, helping India win the SAFF Championship in Maldives. The team was together for a longer period, and the results were there for all to see. “We were together for almost 26 days,” said Chhetri. “For a national team like ours, it makes a little bit more sense. Because every time there is a Fifa window, we are either unable to utilise the window or don’t get the teams to play against. When we have a unified month, we know exactly what to do. The planning can be better.” Chhetri, 37, said the new plans may not be ideal for big guns like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who play more than 60 plus games in a season for club and country. For India, though, it’s win-win. “The World Cup is a huge tournament. FIfa is already increasing the teams (from 32 since 1998 to 48 in 2026), which is good in a holistic way. But if it happens every two years, the charm might be lost. As the national team captain, India would love to have it every two years, since it gives us more chances,” said Chhetri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fifa-plans-for-world-cup-every-two-years-make-sense-for-india-sunil-chhetri-tells-arsene-wenger/articleshow/87654722.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The money was reportedly returned to Dadlani as NCB witness, K P Gosavi, who promised help, was a cheat. Police had issued Dadlani summons but she declined citing ill health. Meanwhile, legal experts said if there is information of a cognisable offence taking place, police can, on its own, file a case and carry out a probe. “Crimin-al cases are registered based on information. Existence of a formal complaint is not necessary. If there is credible information that money was transacted to fix an NCB case, then police can suo motu register an FIR where both the giver and the taker of money can be arrested,” said former IPS officer-turned-lawyer Y P Singh. An SIT officer said they want Dadlani’s statement about her alleged meeting with Gosavi and Sam D’Souza at Lower Parel on October 3. Subsequent to this meeting, it is alleged that money exchanged hands. Despite summons, if Dadlani does not appear before the SIT, it can move court seeking a non-bailable warrant against her, another lawyer said. He added that if she gives a statement denying paying money to Gosavi and if they suspect that she is lying, they can seek her custodial interrogation. An official said they have CCTV footage of her arriving in a blue Mercedes and talking with Gosavi and D’Souza. When TOI phoned Dadlani, she cut the call. An officer said they will wait till this weekend for Dadlani to appear before the SIT else they might visit her place or record her statement via videoconference. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-can-take-suo-motu-action-in-extortion-case-against-ncb/articleshow/87636134.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Surat||Surat: Local cops nab Rajasthan millionaire for smuggling poppy capsules||SURAT: A millionaire businessman from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, who owns malls and a petrol pump, was caught by the city police for his alleged involvement in smuggling of poppy capsules. The accused, 44-year-old Bhagwati Prasad alias Bhairath Jani alias Bhagi Joraram Bishnoi was named in at least four cases filed under The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Following specific leads, Bishnoi was caught by a team of Special Operation Group (SOG) as soon as he came out of the Surat railway station. The accused had a government license to deal in poppy straw powder from 2002 to 2015. Bishnoi used to sell the poppy straw powder to small traders. In 2015 the Rajasthan government discontinued issuing dealership licenses after which Bishnoi started his illegal trade. He was booked in Chittorgarh, Jaisalmer and Kota districts in multiple cases of narcotics smuggling. “Bishnoi was on the run for a long time. But as part of the city police’s ‘No Drugs In Surat’ drive, we nabbed him. He is one of the kingpins involved in smuggling of ‘posht’, a type of poppy,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. Police investigation revealed that Bishnoi owns two malls, a petrol pump, agriculture land and several other properties. “He was running a successful business when he had the license. After discontinuation of the license he took to smuggling. He made crores of rupees through the legal and then illegal business of poppy capsules,” said an SOG officer. Bishnoi was handed over to Rajasthan police. Police suspect that due to his money power he used to source poppy capsules illegally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/millionaire-nabbed-for-smuggling/articleshow/87634070.cms||---

Both the accused have been identified, but are yet to be nabbed. The deceased was identified as class 12 student Rajkumar Sharma, son of Om Prakesh Sharma of Keshavpura area under Mahavir Nagar police station here.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad had high Covid infection rate, finds study||HYDERABAD: Urban districts like Hyderabad, which have large working population recorded high Covid-19 infection rate, revealed a study by Delhi-based Centre for the Study of Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University. The study shows how each district in the country was impacted by Covid-19. Metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kamrup Metropolitan, South Goa, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad were most affected by Covid-19. About 80% of infected cases and 61% deaths were observed in nine states, including AP and Telangana, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu. The study was published in Plos One journal with the tile ‘District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India during March-October 2020’ by researchers Vandana Tamrakar, Ankita Srivastava, Nandita Saikia , Mukesh C Parmar, Sudheer Kumar Shukla, Shewli Shabnam, Bandita Boro, Apala Saha and Benjamin Debbarma. The results revealed that the infection rate was 42.8 per hundred thousand population. Kerala reported highest infection rate with 259 and the lowest in Bihar 6.5. Researchers found that, with an increasing percentage of literacy, there was a lower infection ratio. “The infection ratio is more in districts with a higher working-age population, higher population density, a more urban population, and vigorous testing, and a higher level of stunted children. The findings are crucial information for policy discourse, emphasizing the vulnerability of the highly urbanized and densely populated areas,” opined researchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-had-high-covid-infection-rate-finds-study/articleshow/87634909.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cabinet expansion to take place in February||HYDERABAD: Despite strong speculations about a possible cabinet expansion after Huzurabad bypoll, it is unlikely to happen, sources said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dropped enough hints that he won’t expand his team immediately by his action of handing over the crucial health portfolio to his trusted lieutenant and finance minister T Harish Rao. Sources in TRS and government said the reshuffle will only happen after the MLC vacancies were filled in January. Since there are no auspicious days, the cabinet expansion is likely to take place in February. As of now, there is one vacancy in the cabinet after the removal of Eatala Rajender in April this year. The CM is considering a rejig of his entire council of ministers apart from filling up the one vacancy. In view of this, he did not give the health portfolio to other ministers and kept it with him till now. The Election Commission issued two notifications for filling up 18 vacancies in the legislative council. While polling for six vacancies from MLA quota will be held on November 29, elections for another 12 vacancies in local authorities constituencies will be held on December 10. The 12 MLCs will take oath only after January 4. Party sources said KCR may drop a couple of ministers whose performance is considered to be poor. He will also be considering caste equations. There were rumours that the CM assured former legislative council chariman Gutha Sukender Reddy a place in his cabinet. He is likely to be renominated from the legislative council. Since one BC minister Eatala was removed from the cabinet, another BC minister will be inducted in the cabinet. Former Telangana TDP chief and ex-minister L Ramana, who is from the weaver community and hails from erstwhile Karimnagar district, may get a chance. Under SC quota, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari whose MLC term got expired in June this year along with five other MLCs is likely to get a second chance now. He may also find a place in the cabinet and be rewarded with irrigation portfolio, which he held in Chandrababu Naidu’s cabinet in unified AP. Under the same SC quota, the government is reportedly considering Chennur MLA Balka Suman, who worked for the party in Nagarjuna Sagar and Huzurabad bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-expansion-to-take-place-in-feb/articleshow/87634915.cms||Koride Mahesh

I calculated the rise in petrol prices at an interval of seven years since then. I found that in the seven years of the Modi government, the price of petrol has increased less than the increase in any previous seven years,” Puri told the Times Now Summit 2021.

Today it is $84-85 (per barrel). Fuel prices are rising because of the market conditions,” he said. Asked if the timing of the excise cut was dictated by the forthcoming assembly election in UP and it could have come earlier, Puri said there was always some election somewhere in the country.

Shah also inaugurated the Times NowHe explained that the duty cut could not have come earlier because the economy was hit by the pandemic and the government needed money to fund vaccination as well as welfare measures such as free food for the poor.

Speaking at the Times Now summit, Rijiju said“Now the focus has shifted on livelihood and the economy is firing on all cylinders. Consumption (of fuels) is higher than the pre-pandemic period. Revenue collections have stabilised. There is confidence (to cut duty)... The (Modi) government has always had its heart in giving relief to consumers. It (duty cut) is an excellent move by the PM and finance minister that will create pressure on states to reduce VAT,” he said. On the fairness of last year’s excise duty hike, Puri said, “The economy had shut down and the focus was on life.” Excise duty has been fixed. But states charge VAT as per cent... there is a killing (made) there.” On the strategic sale of Air India, he said the national carrier was financially sick in spite of being a “first-class asset”. “The debate was simply whether to sell or close down the airline,” Puri said. Describing the nationalisation of Air India and Bharat Petroleum (among others) by the Congress government (under Indira Gandhi), Puri expressed happiness that even the second bid for Air India was higher than the reserve price, which proved detractors of the disinvestment wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-prevented-duty-cut-earlier-petroleum-and-urban-development-minister-hardeep-puri/articleshow/87636471.cms||---

The study found that while the overall patient burden increased by 41.4% during the lockdown as compared to 2019, this torrent of patients also brought with them a 12.7% increase in cases of attempted self-harm and a staggering increase of 95% in victims of violence who were admitted to the ED. Researchers told TOI that this was a significant increase suggesting that the larger number of cases in 2020 was not a mere coincidence, hence could be attributed to the strong restrictive measures during the Covid-19 lockdown that led to unemployment, loneliness, cash crunch among families, which may have worsened the existing mental health problems. Dr Ishan Lamba,  researcher from Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre told TOI, “Among those studied, sanitiser consumption, previously unseen in the 2019 dataset, accounted for 8% of all self-poisonings reported at the hospital ED in 2020, while violence was noted as the predominant mode of injury during the lockdown period, comprising 82.7% (486 admissions) in 2020, as compared to 73.3% (176 admissions) in 2019.” The study is slated to be published in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Dr Varsha S Shinde, professor, Emergency Medicine Department at the hospital, said, “An increase in violence by known individuals was seen - from 68.8% of total cases of violence presented at the ED in 2019 to 78% in the lockdown period. Intimate partner violence also increased from 4% to 7% among the presented cases. Blunt weapons (in 355 cases in 2020) were most commonly used, but there was an increase in usage of sharp weapons from the 9% of total assault cases in 2019 to 16.2% of the total assault cases presented to the ED in 2020.” Dr Suhrith Bhattaram, lead researcher from Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, said self-harm cases accounted for 17.3% (102) of all the study subjects in 2020, as compared to 26.7% (64) in 2019. “There was, however, a decrease in self-poisoning among the cases studied in 2019 in comparison to the lockdown period: from 84.4% to 69.6%, respectively. The decrease was greater in consumption of pharmaceuticals, than non-pharmaceutical agents. Hanging also saw an increase from 3.1% to 7.8%. Sanitiser or rubbing alcohol consumption, unseen in the 2019 dataset, accounted for 12.67% of all consumption during the lockdown,” he said. The study also found a notable increase from 10.9% (7 cases in 2019) to 38.2% (39 cases during the lockdown) in the use of alcohol before an act of self-harm. In cases of violence, use of alcohol before the act increased from 22.7% (40 cases in 2019) to 43% (209 cases during the lockdown). The study also stated that emergency department admissions at the hospital rose by 41.4% during the lockdown period. A total of 12,238 patients were admitted to the hospital ED during March 24-June 30, 2020 (lockdown period) as against 8,654 during March 24-June 30, 2019, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/self-harm-and-violence-cases-rose-drastically-during-lockdown-study/articleshow/87634943.cms||Neha Madaan

CPM’s attempts to paint the protests against certain individuals who tried to thwart the public protest against fuel price increase as the attack against the cinema field will not succeed, Sudhakaran told reporters on Wednesday. He said the state unit of Congress would organise protest programmes against the state and central governments in all assembly segments on November 18. The protest is planned to press the central and state governments to take immediate steps to make the fuel price affordable. The protest programmes, he said, would take place at 280 spots, spread across 140 assembly segments in the state. “One block committee of Congress party in a particular assembly segment would hold a march to a central government office and stage a sit-in there. While the second block committee of the state assembly constituency would march to a state government office and observe a dharna in front of that office. Such a protest programme is planned in view of the KPCC’s clear understanding that both the state and central governments are equally responsible for the unreasonable fuel prices. Congress would also construct a human chain from the Secretariat to Raj Bhavan, raising the demand for fuel price reduction,” Sudhakaran said. Sudhakaran said the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s attitude to fuel prices was arrogant. The state government, he said, has no qualms in sharing the booty extracted by the central government by levying unreasonable tax on petroleum products. The government will have to concede to the demand for tax reduction, a reasonable demand by the people, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/instructed-party-workers-not-to-disrupt-film-shoots-kpcc-chief/articleshow/87634945.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The strike by a section of MSRTC employees has paralysed bus services across the state. The government has allowed the private operators to use the MSRTC depots to ferry passengers. Pandey held a meeting with the agitating employees on Wednesday. “The representatives of the agitating employees were told that the government has decided to ply private buses during the strike. The members were told that they should not obstruct the operations of the private buses from the ST depots at any cost.” He told TOI that the members were informed that the industrial tribunal had deemed “the strike is illegal.” The officers in charge of all the police stations in the city have been told to deploy appropriate bandobast in their respective areas. “At the same time, there should be effective patrolling by the beat marshals and other patrolling teams of every police station,” he said. Meanwhile, he also instructed the police officials concerned to take necessary legal action if any person was posing a challenge to the law and order. Meanwhile, senior officials of the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) conducted a meeting with private bus operators, school bus operators, etc. and asked them to deploy as many vehicles as possible so that the passengers do not have to face inconvenience. Nashik RTO Pradeep Shinde said, “We have also deployed a motor vehicle inspector at every depot of the district to coordinate with the transporters, who are willing to ferry the passengers. The transporters can take passengers from any place since the MSRTC buses are not plying. However, they should not be charging exorbitant fares from the passengers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cops-warns-msrtc-staff-against-blocking-pvt-buses/articleshow/87633104.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Criticising chief minister M K Stalin’s ‘Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural’ (Stalin’s voice towards the dawn) campaign before the assembly election, the opposition leaders alleged that the DMK government has led the farmers ‘towards frustration’ (Virakthiyai Nokki) by remaining tight-lipped over the poll promises. The AIADMK recalled the DMK’s promise of increasing the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal and of Sugarcane to Rs 4,000 per tonne. After six months of DMK rule, the MSP of paddy stood at Rs 2,015 per quintal for 2021-22 and Rs 2,900 for a tonne of sugarcane with a sugar content recovery rate of 10%. The MSP of sugarcane with a sugar content recovery rate below 10% is Rs 2,755. The opposition leaders also raked up the issue of paddy getting drenched in direct procurement centres in the Cauvery delta districts. “Paddy brought to the DPCs by the farmers and the paddy procured by the government has been spoiled due to the rain,” said the statement quoting the complaints from the farmers. The limited procurement of 700 sacks and 1,000 sacks of paddy per day is the reason for the mess. The AIADMK demanded the chief minister to keep his poll promise on MSP and to take steps to ensure quick procurement of paddy by DPCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/keep-poll-promise-on-hiking-msp-of-paddy-sugarcane/articleshow/87635656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At least initially, one student will stay in one hostel room. “In the first phase, final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing lab-based subjects will be called to the campus. Since ours is a residential college, we are being very cautious,” said Swami Mahaprajnananda,vice-principal of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur. The college had started with online classes from April 2020 soon after educational institutes were shut due to the pandemic. As a large part of theory subjects have been completed online, the college wants to focus on practical-based subjects so that students can return to the campus and can work in the lab. All the RKM colleges have decided to continue with online lessons till the classes fully shift to campuses. “We have already started calling students in small groups and they are being quarantined for three days. Most of them have received two doses of the vaccine. For those who are yet to get their second doses, we are making arrangements. Gradually we will call students from other years, too. We will keep monitoring and evaluating the Covid situation before calling more students to the campus. The online classes will continue till the entire transition is made to offline,” an official said. At Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, too, authorities are looking at phased reopening. “Most of our students have been vaccinated,” said an official at the college. At Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, authorities want to call students with practical-based subjects first. “Our teachers have finished a very big part of theory portions through online mode. So, we have decided that we will call only students pursuing lab-based subjects in the first phase. Each day will be set aside for students from a particular semester. Not more than 60-70 students will be called on a day so that social distancing can be maintained. They have missed out on using the labs and so, they will be provided enough time to catch up and learn,” said Swami Kamalasthananda, principal at the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rkm-college-hostels-keep-numbers-low-play-it-safe/articleshow/87634928.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Kolkata||Calcutta University colleges plan shifts, odd-even formula to call freshers to campus||KOLKATA: Several Calcutta University-affiliated colleges have decided to allow freshers to go to campuses from November 16 for offline lessons, but they will have to follow either an odd-even formula or will attend classes in different shifts. These institutes feel first-semester undergraduate students need to get a feel of their campuses to start off their college life. But most of these institutes pointed out that in-person classes notwithstanding, online lessons will continue. A day earlier on Tuesday, most of the state-run universities in the city — Jadavpur University, Calcutta University and Rabindra Bharati University — said they did not want to call first-years immediately and rather, their focus was on older batches. Bethune College is one of the CU institutes that plan to call freshers in the first phase. “We will call first-semester students for physical classes as they are eager to see the college building and experience the atmosphere of the campus,” said Krishna Roy, principal at Bethune. The college will hold offline classes in two shifts, the first one from 11am to 2pm and the second from 2pm to 4.30pm-5pm. While Arts students will attend classes in the first half and science students will come in the second slot. Postgraduate students will also attend classes in two shifts for three days a week. However, online lessons will also continue as the institute plans to hold hybrid classes till November 26, after which a decision will be taken, based on the situation. Lady Brabourne College has decided to call UG first-, third- and fifth-semester science students and PG first- and third-semester students on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Arts students on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. “Online and offline classes will continue in alternative manner. Teachers will take classes from campuses and students will attend online or offline classes, according to the schedule,” said Siuli Sarkar, Lady Brabourne College principal. Asutosh College and New Alipore College will also call first-semester students, but for two days a week. While they will attend classes on Mondays and Thursdays, third-semester students will attend on Tuesdays and Fridays and fifth-semester students on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Practical classes will be held on a new schedule. New Alipore college principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Online and offline classes will be on simultaneously.” Surendranath College has divided classes according to semesters. First-year students will attend physical classes on Fridays and Saturdays, fifth-semester on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the third-semesteron Wednesdays and Thursdays. Principal Indranil Kar said, “Students will enter the campus through the main gate and the exit will be through another gate to avoid crowding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cu-colleges-plan-shifts-odd-even-formula-to-call-freshers-to-campus/articleshow/87634916.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation sets up help desk at every ward for voters||PUNE: The civic administration has set up help desks at 15 ward offices to assist citizens in enrolling their names in the voters’ list and check details of the existing voters. A special drive has been launched ahead of the forthcoming civic polls, which will continue till November 30. The voter list is also available online for voters to check details and submit applications. A meeting was conveyed by the election department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday to discuss various initiatives planned under the special drive. Leaders of political parties in PMC urged the administration to take necessary steps to avoid lapses like missing and duplication of names while preparing the final draft of the list. Prashant Jagtap, head of the NCP’s city unit, said, “The administration should prepare the voter list with minimum errors. This will avoid confusion among voters. Also, there should not be duplication of names. The authorities must rule out inclusion of names with addresses other than Pune city.” Jagtap said that some leaders had demanded that registration of new voters be accepted online as well as offline. “We also want the administration to allot the voter identity card to maximum voters before the polling day,” Jagtap said. The elections are likely to be held in February next year. The state government has taken the preliminary step of drafting of panels. Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar said that since boundaries of all existing panels were undergoing revision for the forthcoming polls, chances of confusion among voters could not be ruled out. The administration should draft the voter list based on revised panels to avoid confusion and chaos. Aba Bagul, the leader of the Congress, said, “We have suggested that natural boundaries be considered while drafting the panels. Also, the entire exercise should be done well in advance so that citizens would be able to understand revised panels. Every voter should receive identity card before the polls”. City-based civic organisations have said that the authorities should reach maximum voters during the special drive to make the draft list error-free. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “Missing of names is a common complaint. Voters also face difficulties in finding polling booths. Also, in many cases, names appear in adjacent wards. The administration must act now to restrict such instances on the day of voting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-sets-up-help-desk-at-every-ward-for-voters/articleshow/87634921.cms||---

Around 110 health department teams of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) were involved in the drive on Wednesday.  SMC is focussing on those areas where the overall vaccination has remained low compared to other localities. Till Wednesday, 61% of the targeted population had been vaccinated. “The teams conducted surveys of residential societies to find out the number of unvaccinated people. Through the survey, we could identify the societies,” said a health official. SMC earlier started the ‘Knock the Door’ campaign in which health teams used to visit residential societies on call where more than 10 persons were available for vaccination. The campaign received good response in mobilising people and encouraging those who did not take vaccines earlier. “The teams were formed at each health centre level. Large number of people are not coming forward for second dose and this drive will help in vaccinating them,” said the health official.  Against the targeted population, total 36.36 lakh people were vaccinated for the first dose while 20.94 lakh for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1700-vaccinated-at-home-in-surat/articleshow/87634108.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Have you verified social media documents, Bombay high court to Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday questioned state minister Nawab Malik if he had verified documents against NCB officer Sameer Wankhede and his family before uploading them on to social media. “Have you verified as a responsible citizen and as spokesperson of a national political party?” asked Justice Madhav Jamdar, directing Malik to file an affidavit stating so. The judge is hearing a defamation suit filed by Dhyandev Wankhede (72), Sameer Wankhede’s father, against Malik. Justice Jamdar also directed Wankhede to point out “that the tweets or material annexed to his plaint, which are tweeted by the defendant (Malik), is false.” Wankhede’s advocate Arshad Shaikh argued for an injunction against Malik from making further remarks. He referred to Malik’s reply that if Sameer Wankhede’s birth certificate showing he is Muslim is false, he must provide a correct certificate. “Why am I supposed to justify my stand to an individual who may be an MLA but not a court or quasijudicial authority?” he asked. He said Wankhede is trying to protect his blood and family. “When you say you wanted to expose Sameer Wankhede, why (have) you attacked his father?” Shaikh asked. But Justice Jamdar said he must concentrate on the aspect that Malik’s tweets are false. “Forget about technicalities. You have to show prima facie those tweets are false. Your son is a public servant. His actions can be examined by any member of public,” he added. Senior advocate Atul Damle, for Malik, said Wankhede has accepted the uploads are from family’s social media accounts. “He accepts these are uploaded by son and daughter on Instagram, Facebook… Where is the question of creating documents falsely? I have not posted in the air,” said Damle, adding whether documents are right or wrong may be seen during trial. Justice Jamdar pointed to the way “Samir” appeared on the birth certificate. Damle said it was issued by BMC. It was then that HC asked, “Is it not your duty to verify?” Asked if Malik’s reply has a statement on verification, Damle said there is no specific statement except that the admissibility and authenticity of evidence can be decided at trial stage. “Admissibility is (a) different aspect. Whether it is authentic, it is your responsibility. You will have to file a reply and verify the truthfulness,” said Justice Jamdar. The judge said he will hear only on ad-interim relief for injunction on Friday. When Damle said relief sought is also against Malik’s party members and all acting on his instructions, Justice Jamdar said, “I am not going to pass a gag order. He is also (a) citizen of India and is seeking damages. Even if it is his son, ultimately he is also defamed,” HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-malik-if-hed-verified-docus-he-put-on-social-media/articleshow/87636145.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: N-S Metro to start operation at 7am from Monday to help students||KOLKATA: Metro would advance its timings by half-an-hour from Monday to cater to school and college students, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said at the first meeting of the Metro Railway Users Consultative Committee (MRUCC) on Tuesday. From Monday, Joshi said, the first trains on the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor would leave terminal stations at 7am instead of 7.30am as educational institutes would reopen their campuses from the next day. TOI had reported on November 5 that the carrier was likely to start operations at 7am instead of 7.30am along the north-south corridor. Joshi had then said, “We are not increasing the number of trains yet since morning and evening peak-our services are already at the maximum 5min frequency. But we may start half-an-hour early in the morning for the benefit of students.” Metro now operates from 7.30am to 10.30pm, with 266 trains, against the pre-Covid fleet of 288 services. Presiding over Tuesday’s MRUCC meeting, Joshi said tokens would be back as soon as Covid cases reduced significantly. The newly constituted Metro users’ committee has nine members, including Union minister Shantanu Thakur, Lok Sabha MP Mala Roy, Rajya Sabha MP Rupa Ganguly and two senior Bengal government officials. The GM, who is the chairman of MRUCC, was responding to a question by Shankar Das, nominated member of Railway Board, as to why only smart cards were allowed to board a Metro train. The GM explained that tokens would add to the risk of coronavirus transmission. Metro had earlier announced re-issuance of tokens from March 15, but deferred its decision as Bengal’s daily Covid count rose to 700-plus. “We shall examine the feasibility of suggestions given by every MRUCC member and explain if they are found non-implementable,” said Protyush Ghosh, deputy general manager, Metro Railway. He and other senior officers attended Tuesday’s meeting. Joshi briefed the members about the various initiatives and the progress of on-going Metro extension projects. MP Ganguly called for keeping the areas outside the Metro stations clean. She also urged the authorities to facilitate the extension projects and commission the various corridors at the earliest. Das asked if an escalator could be installed betw-een the second and third platforms of Park Street Metro station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/n-s-metro-to-start-op-at-7am-from-mon-to-help-students/articleshow/87634939.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Ahmednagar civil hospital staff start indefinite strike||NASHIK: All the 50 doctors and the entire team of 180 nurses along with all paramedical staff of the civil hospital started an indefinite strike on Wednesday, paralysing OPD services and elective surgeries. Only the emergency services were rendered by the doctors and nurses at the hospital. There is an outrage among the medical fraternity of Ahmednagar following the arrest of medical officer Dr Vishaka Shinde and three staff nurses — Sapna Pathare, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant — of the Ahmednagar civil hospital in connection with the death of 11 Covid-19 patients at the hospital’s ICU following a fire on November 6. Inspector of the Tofkhana police station Jyoti Gadkari said the arrested suspects were produced in the local court on Wednesday, which remanded them in police custody for two days. The Ahmednagar unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also decided to keep the OPD and IPD services shut in about 300 private hospitals and clinics for a day on Thursday to express their solidarity with the arrested doctor and the three nurses. District collector Rajendra Bhosale told TOI that he held a meeting with a delegation of doctors, nurses and IMA on Wednesday evening and appealed to them to withdraw the strike. “They have demanded the release of the arrested doctor and nurses. I have told them that the state government would be informed of their demand. I have requested them to start their work so that patients do not suffer,” added Bhosale. The senior medical officer of Ahmednagar civil hospital, Dr Prasad Saigaonkar, said that it would be difficult to withdraw the stir as there is huge resentment among all civil hospital officials and employees. But he assured that the emergency services would continue unhindered and no patient would be inconvenienced due to the stir. “The investigations are still on and the arrests were made based on the CCTV footage from the ICU. Our doctor and nurses were not responsible for the outbreak of the fire that led to the deaths. Yet, criminal cases were filed against them. Such acts are demoralising for the medical fraternity,” he sad. President of the Maharashtra State Health Nurses Association Surekha Andhale warned of a statewide agitation if the arrested medical workers are not released soon. “We had written to the state government to roll back the disciplinary action taken against the nurses after the incident. Instead of paying heed to our demand, the government has toughened its stand. We will also not take things lying down,” she added. IMA Ahmednagar secretary Dr Sachin Vahadane said that OPDs and IPDs of all 300 private hospitals and clinics in Ahmednagar city would remain closed for 24 hours from Thursday morning. “The doctors and nurses have been made scapegoats in the incident, which was due to a technical reason,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-civil-hospital-staff-start-indefinite-strike/articleshow/87633128.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ram Mandir bridge reopened for traffic||MUMBAI: The Ram Mandir bridge over a nullah on SV Road in the western suburbs, whose surface was washed away following torrential rains of July 17-18 midnight this year (also the day when two landslides were reported in Mumbai at Vikhroli and Mahul), reopened for vehicular movements on Wednesday. BMC officials said that after July’s incessant rains washed away the bridge’s asphalt surface and exposed the concrete slab, it had to be repaired. Chief engineer bridges Satish Thosar said, “A concrete slab which was cast on site has been laid over the stretch. Simultaneously, works are underway for increasing the width of the entire stretch. Currently, only light motor vehicles are being allowed to use it.” Locals said that the suspension of the bridge was causing traffic jams in the locality as the alternative access was single lane road and a detour of almost two kilometres. The bridge is a crucial connector especially for entry and exit into Goregaon and also for motorists from Lokandwala, Oshiwara wanting to head northbound towards Malad, Kandivali. Local corporator Sandeep Patel of the BJP said, “The bridge remaining shut was hampering traffic movement for the past several months. This was also putting a lot of load on the Veer Savarkar flyover at Goregaon West as vehicles would have to use the same, wasting 20-15 minutes of time. While the bridge was not safe to use , there was also a need to open it up sooner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ram-mandir-bridge-reopened-for-traffic/articleshow/87635681.cms||Richa Pinto

Telangana Southern (TSSPDCL) and Northern (TSNPDCL) discoms, which have been going through a rough financial crisis, are planning to enhance the tariffs for all categories of consumers, including domestic and nondomestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Sources in the government said since the hike in power tariff was being taken up after five years, the minimum increase will be Re 1 per unit for domestic and Rs 6-7 per unit for the industrial sector. The discoms are expecting Rs 3,000 crore additional revenue through the hike. The government wants to increase the charges for this category of consumers but it will be between 50 paise and Re 1 per unit, sources said. The CM is expected to take a decision whether the increase in tariffs would be applicable to consumers of less than 100 units. “The exercise on revising the power tariffs has begun and will be completed soon. The aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) will be filed with the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) before November 30 after taking permission from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao,” a senior official of TSSPDCL told TOI. “In the past five years, the discoms and power utilities have spent over Rs 30,000 crore on improving power infrastructure and power arrears.

---||Goa||To curb crimes against women, Goa CM moots pink police force||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that the state is contemplating a ‘pink police force’ to tackle crimes against women. “We are thinking of creating a pink female force, especially for women and women’s safety. We are thinking about how to introduce this,” Sawant told senior policemen of the state. He said though Goa has the best track record in solving crimes in the country, police must also make an effort to prevent crime, particularly against women. Of the various crimes against women, incidents of rape have been the highest in Goa over the past six years, with 387 cases reported in the state since January 2016, as per data tabled in the assembly. A minimum of 60 rape cases have been reported every year in Goa since 2016 “I had a meeting with the DGP and SP (crime) and discussed what precautions we need to take and what new initiatives we need to adopt, especially for the safety of women. Within a short span, we are taking some major steps,” Sawant said at the function organised by the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development. DGP Mukesh Kumar Meena said women police personnel will be deployed at certain vulnerable locations to ensure the safety and security of women, and that women’s help desks at all police stations will be strengthened. “If a woman complainant comes in, she can give her complaint to the women personnel,” he said. “We are making a chart of all the women police personnel that we have, and we are going to send them to public places to talk to women. Women feel comfortable talking to women,” he said. Meena said the CM has issued instructions for all precautionary and preventive measures to be taken to reduce the number of crimes against women. “Besides detection of cases, attention also needs to be given to prevention of crimes. For this, we have increased patrolling. I have asked each police station to identify points where police presence is required around the clock. We have identified these points and deployed personnel,” Meena said. Speaking about the 60-day training programme for police officers who have been promoted to the rank of SP, Meena said the training will help the senior police officers keep abreast of new laws, guidelines and court judgments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-curb-crimes-against-women-cm-moots-pink-police-force/articleshow/87635679.cms||---

Over 9,500 teachers posts of the total 34,531 were vacant since May 2017, when government stayed recruitment. Colleges since then have been managing with ad hoc appointments even as positions went vacant after teachers retired. Higher & technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday posted on social media that government had given its nod for filling teachers’ vacant positions and a go-ahead to recruit 2,088 teachers in first phase. A government resolution will be released in two days, he added.Overall, 9,511 positions are vacant in aided colleges and universities. In Mumbai, 20% of the 3,118 positions in aided colleges are vacant. After new reservations had to be applied, government approved filling in 40% of these vacant positions only 3,580 of the 9,511 posts. Subsequently, before the pandemic, between 2018 and May 2020, 1,492 teachers were recruited. The remaining 2,088 will be now be appointed once the GR is out. Other vacant positions too will be filled, the minister indicated. Many aided colleges have been running the show with ad hoc appointments. Mumbai University’s department has nearly 40% vacant positions. In fact, MHRD’s Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan had urged government to fill vacant posts to get funding under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govt-gives-go-ahead-to-recruit-2100-teachers/articleshow/87636146.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Ministers contradict each other, opposition targets chief minister||Thiruvananthapuram: Contrary to its earlier claim, the state government on Wednesday said forest department officials of Kerala and Tamil Nadu had jointly examined the Mullaperiyar dam site on June 11 as directed by the Supreme Court-appointed supervisory committee in a meeting in February 2021. It also said the forests department had given permission to fell 15 trees on the basis of a formal online application from Tamil Nadu and a letter from the deputy director of Periyar tiger reserve (east division) on October 30, 2021. Power minister K Krishnankutty made these statements in the assembly while replying to a submission from opposition leader VD Satheesan on behalf of water resources minister Roshy Augustine. Forest minister AK Saseendran had earlier told the assembly that there was no joint inspection in Mullaperiyar and the permit for felling trees was issued without the knowledge of the political leadership. Krishnankutty said the supervisory committee had asked the water resources department to make the necessary preparations for the joint examination of the dam site. Additional chief secretary TK Jose represents the state in the committee. Also, in another meeting held on September 17, 2021, it has been recorded that Tamil Nadu had sought permission to fell 15 trees, instead of 23, and the matter is under the consideration of the state forests and wildlife department, the minister said. Further, a letter sent by the supervisory committee chairman to the additional chief secretary (water resources) on September 3, 2021 said the joint inspection had been conducted and 15 trees identified. It also said an application to fell trees had been submitted online and the process should be expedited, he said. The joint secretary in Union ministry of water resources had also written to the state that strengthening of the baby dam, earthen dam and ghat road were necessary for the safety of Mullaperiyar dam, he said. Satheesan said the forest and water resources ministers were giving conflicting answers on the matter and alleged that the decision had been taken with the knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The forest minister had misled the assembly and made a mockery of the public. The additional chief secretary (water resources) also holds the charge of additional chief secretary (home and vigilance), which is under the chief minister. It cannot be believed that the order was issued without the knowledge of the chief minister,” he said, adding that it would adversely affect the state’s demand for a new dam in the apex court. The opposition later staged a walkout in protest against the government’s stand on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ministers-contradict-each-other-opposition-targets-chief-minister/articleshow/87634966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The district health office authorities said there were at least 275 such villages. Abhay Tidke, additional district health officer, Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP), told TOI, “Some villages are just a few beneficiaries away from recording the 100% vaccination with the first dose. We are microplanning such villages and beneficiaries amid our efforts to boost the vaccination in rural areas.” According to Tidke, at least 200-300 vaccination sessions are held every day in Pune rural. They are hoping to increase it once the first vaccination dose completion is recorded across all the talukas. “We also aim to spread awareness among the unvaccinated beneficiaries in rural areas through ‘Har Ghar Dastak’,” he said. The Pune rural has estimated target beneficiaries of 35.75 lakh, of which over 32 lakh have been vaccinated with the first dose and over 17 lakh been inoculated with the second dose. On Wednesday, a total of 25,468 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the Pune district in over 500 vaccination sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/250-villages-record-100-first-shot/articleshow/87634960.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad-IITian behind rape tweet threat to cricketer’s kid||HYDERABAD: Until his arrest by the Mumbai police on Wednesday, Ramnagesh Akubathini was following an almost stereotypical path for a young Telugu man. The 23-year-old software engineer, who tweeted a rape threat to a top cricket star’s daughter, graduated from IITHyderabad about two years ago. He had been working with one of India’s top food delivery apps headquartered in Bangalore with an annual pay package of around Rs 24 lakh, but he left the job to pursue a master’s degree in a US university for which he was preparing. Everything seemed to be falling in place for the young man until he tweeted the rape threat. Now, he is on his way to a jail in Mumbai, leaving his friends and family stunned. Ramnagesh’s father Srinivas works as a fitter in Ordnance Factory, Medak at Yeddumailaram which manufactures armoured vehicles for the Indian army. The upset father told TOI, “My son is just a cricket lover and usually very sober in his reactions. When I found out what he had done, I told him that if India had lost to Pakistan, he should have tweeted about the cricket star and should never have mentioned the daughter. I can’t understand why he did this.” Srinivas, along with his friend Krishna Murthy, accompanied the cops to Mumbai after the arrest. Krishna Murthy claimed that the rape threat tweet was an accident. “Ramnagesh had been chatting online after India lost to Pakistan in the T20 World Cup,” he said. “In frustration, he typed an angry message which he did not intend to tweet. At the same time, the phone slipped out of his hand. By the time he tried to do some damage control, the message had already gone viral. Since that day he was living in fear.” He claimed that no one in family knew about tweet until the police knocked on their door on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iitian-behind-rape-tweet-threat-to-cricketers-kid/articleshow/87634963.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Moved by the plight of the adivasis, Ashok Menon, past-president, Rotary club of Panaji-Midtown, and Baylon Gomes of the Hands of Hope Foundation coordinated with a supplier of water storage tanks at Verna and ensured that they were immediately delivered to the site. The two 750L tanks arrived at the settlement at Nirankal, Ponda, on Wednesday evening, much to the joy of the tribals. However, the two tanks only partially resolve the issue, as more still need to be installed to meet the water requirements of the nearly 100 persons living in the settlement. “Thanks to all the individuals and associations for the first response for helping address the issue partly. Hope a long-lasting solution will come from the government, as they have set the target of har ghar jal,” Dr Sachin Tendulkar, agro researcher and social worker, who has been relentlessly pursuing the cause of the Makadmares, said. TOI’s Wednesday report pointed out that with the two water tanks installed by PWD near the settlement five years ago now damaged, the tribals could soon be facing water woes. “I am glad we could be of some small help to the needy,” Menon said.  “President of the club Sunil Mone and secretary Sanjeev Dessai took the initiative to help the Makadmares by providing the water tanks, a proposal that was supported by all the members,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-samaritans-donate-2-tanks-to-makadmares/articleshow/87635684.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The state government on Wednesday issued the notification for the election in which the new chairperson will elected from amongst the newly-appointed eight members of the Board. The post was lying vacant for over 18 months. As per the notification issued by UP minority welfare and waqf department, the election will be held at 4pm on November 15 at the office of the department’s principal secretary.

Amid protests, accusations and legal cases, the constitution of Shia Waqf Board had been a bone of contention among the members and clerics. Waseem Rizvi had invited investigation for alleged corruption and the ire of the community especially for his controversial remarks on madrassas, the Quran and Islamic teachings. Several clerics had led protests against Rizvi but he managed to remain the chairperson of the Board for two terms of five years each. Rizvi’s second tenure as chairperson ended this year after which he was elected the member of the Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shia-board-chief-election-on-nov-15/articleshow/87635687.cms||Yusra Husain

As a result, there has been a manifold increase in prices of petroleum products, following which prices of essential commodities have increased too,” Patole said. He said that while there is a steady decline in fuel prices in the international market, in India, they have increased prices by Rs 35 per liter in a year. On the allegations against Fadnavis and Nawab Malik, Patole said since both are senior politicians and hold important positions, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should order a high-level probe into the allegations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-start-week-long-stir-from-nov-14-against-rising-fuel-prices/articleshow/87636149.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: In a 1st, biodiversity, climate change to be in Class IX, X portion||PANAJI: In possibly a first in the country, Class IX and X students from 400 high schools in the state are set to learn about biodiversity and climate change as part of their school curriculum from next academic year. The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB), through the state environment ministry, and the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education entered into an MoU on Wednesday to promote awareness about biodiversity and the importance of preserving the environment to human well-being. “The MoU will see awareness about biodiversity being raised among students from 400 high schools and later on, extended to students of 105 higher secondary schools affiliated to the Goa Board. This will mean at least 1 lakh students will be impacted. These students will later enter the colleges under Goa University and would help in starting a discourse on biodiversity at all these levels, which is very important in this age of global warming and climate change,” environment minister Nilesh Cabral said. He said it is expected that the curriculum will eventually help 191 biodiversity management committees operating at the village panchayat level and 13 operating at the municipal level in their conservation efforts. Besides this, high school and higher secondary school teachers will also be exposed to the curriculum on biodiversity in the process, the environment minister said. “The MoU was the outcome of my resolution as member of the executive council of the Goa Board. The resolution was passed unanimously, but it took nine months for things to materialise as the Board was engaged with the Class X and XII public exam work at the time,” Goa Board member Nandakumar Kamat said. GSBB member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam, state environment secretary Kunal and Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye were present at the signing of the MoU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biodiversity-climate-change-to-be-part-of-class-ix-x-curriculum/articleshow/87635691.cms||---
---||Kochi||TN didn’t consider shift in rain pattern, say experts||Idukki: Even as the state has urged the Supreme Court to reduce the maximum permissible water level in the Mullaperiyar dam, experts have pointed out that Tamil Nadu, which prepared the rule curve for the reservoir in consultation with Central Water Commission (CWC), did so without taking into account India meteorological department’s (IMD) revised rainfall data. They said after the 2018 floods, the state’s rainfall pattern has seen a big shift and one reason for the state to oppose the rule curve was that it was fixed without considering the changes in rainfall behaviour. “If we follow the present rainfall pattern, we can’t allow a rule curve above 136ft. Mullaperiyar has a huge catchment area of 625sq km while its storage capacity is only 12 thousand million cubic feet (tmc). During extremely heavy rainfall the water level in the dam can rise quickly. In the 2018 floods, the catchment area received heavy downpour leading to the sudden opening of all spillway shutters,” said an official with Mullaperiyar dam. “What is important is that the water should not go above 142ft during northeast and southwest monsoons. If the shutters are opened suddenly it will cause extreme damage in downstream areas,” said former Mullaperiyar special cell chairman MK Parameshwaran Nair. “The state has raised an objection before CWC about the issue. Torrential rains in the catchment areas can raise the water level by five or six feet within a day. In 2018, TN released 30,000cusecs of water that led to large-scale damage,” said Nair. The water level in the dam was steady and stood at 138.70ft on Wednesday. Tamil Nadu was drawing 1,867 cusecs of water, at the same level of the inflow. The state opened Vaigai dam on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tn-didnt-consider-shift-in-rain-pattern-say-experts/articleshow/87634994.cms||Sandeep Thomas

To accommodate other homeless labourers, the seven community halls would be used.Suresh Itnal, the commissioner of HDMC, said these community halls were not used for several years and would be used “to shelter the urban homeless labourers”. Two such halls are in Dharwad and five in Hubballi, he said.Ramesh Noolvi, a National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) official at HDMC, said the halls would be equipped with necessary essential services under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-NULM.The HDMC has prepared a detailed report on the development of community halls, such as strengthening of the rooves, painting and providing basic facilities to the labourers. Itnal said that after approval from the government, the development of the community halls will start and is expected to be over by the end of December.Noolvi added that the livelihood mission would address the concerns of urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security and skills for accessing emerging market opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-plans-shelters-for-homeless-labourers/articleshow/87633154.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Goa||My words ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ saw Goa through many challenges: CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that his phrase ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ (there is no need to fear) — even though widely criticised — helped the state get through difficult times over the past year and a half. “From the time I became CM, there were many challenges before me — from the Covid pandemic to Cyclone Tauktae to floods — but I kept saying just one thing, ‘bhivpachi garaz na’. Yes, there is no need to fear. Many criticised me saying ‘what is the CM saying’. But when I am working as CM of this state, should I tell my colleagues and the people of Goa to keep walking ahead in fear?” Sawant said, speaking at the inaugural of the National Youth Parliament. “That is why I said ‘bhivpachi garaz na’. And so, we kept on overcoming the challenges, from the pandemic to the cyclone to the floods, and we kept providing assistance to the people. And when overcoming these challenges, we saw that Goa was not left behind on any parameter,” said Sawant. Sawant also paid tribute to former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, stating that it was Parrikar who kept providing him opportunities despite the former having little political experience at the time. “If anyone has given encouragement to youth, it is Padma Bhushan awardee Manohar-bhai Parrikar. Many ask me how you reached the position of chief minister. Many do not know the story behind it. When I became an MLA, my father was not an MLA. So many ask me how did you become an MLA then. I started working in the social sector after completing my graduation in 1998. I was working as a Class-I gazetted officer, and in 2007, Manohar-bhai asked me if I would contest an election,” said Sawant. He said that many told him that he was making a mistake by resigning from his stable job, but Parrikar showed belief in his abilities. “Never had a simple MLA become GSIDC chairman. Only CMs had become chairmen of GSIDC. But Manohar-bhai gave me the opportunity to be chairman. In 2017, when I got elected yet again, it was Manohar-bhai Parrikar who gave me the respect and put me in the chair of the legislative assembly speaker at a young age. When Manohar-bhai Parrikar was no more, I was given the opportunity by the party to become the CM though I was young and with little experience,” said Sawant. Taking a jibe at Trinamool Congress, Sawant said that Goa needs no navi sakaal (referring to TMC’s ‘Goa’s new dawn’ slogan). He said the state is already ahead of most states in the country on many parameters. “Goa is pollution-free, we get the purest water supply in the country and our youth are capable of protecting our culture. There is no need for there to be a navi sakaal,” said Sawant. The CM said that his government has ensured that no benefits under state schemes were halted during the pandemic. “While going through the Covid pandemic, cyclone Tauktae and floods, we did not stop benefits under any schemes, in fact, we introduced new schemes for the youth. Even though Goa’s financial position was difficult, we granted Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia to families of those who lost their lives due to Covid,” Sawant said. He said that the work of carrying out recruitment to 80% of government vacancies has started at present. Mopa international airport will also be made operational by August 15, 2022, said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/my-words-bhivpachi-garaz-na-saw-goa-through-many-challenges-sawant/articleshow/87635702.cms||---

The entrance was conducted by National Testing Authority (NTA) and result was expected by October-end. Candidates who applied only for the central university are now in a fix as admissions in other institutes are about to close. “I wanted to study at the central university. Now, I have no choice but to submit fees at LU which is in its last phase of PG admissions,” said Sanjana Agarwal from Kanpur. Another candidate from Ambedkarnagar, Arjun Singh, said, “I had no choice but to submit fee at a private college in my hometown. BBAU was my first priority but entrance results have not been announced. Now, if I make it to BBAU, the fee I have submitted will go waste.” BBAU started the admission process for its UG and PG courses on August 13. NTA had invited applications for university’s 27 bachelor’s courses, 42 master’s courses, one diploma course and seven courses offered at BBAU satellite campus and the entrance test was conducted in September. “The new academic session begins in July but due to the pandemic, the session was delayed. Now, it has been further hit due to delay in completion of the admission process,” a BBAU official said. BBAU admission coordinator Prof Kaman Singh said, “The admission process is in its last phase and the results of entrance test are likely to be declared this week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bbau-entrance-result-late-aspirants-in-a-fix/articleshow/87635698.cms||---

In the last two days alone, four farmers were arrested in Zoz and Kawant and marijuana stock worth over Rs 97 lakh was seized. On Tuesday, Kawant police raided a farm and a house of a farmer identified as Anklesh Rathwa in Kasarvav village. Police found 196kg of marijuana crops grown by Rathwa in the backyard of his house while over 66kg of crops were found from his farm. Rathwa was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and arrested. In another incident, Zoz police arrested three farmers named Raman Nayka, Shankar Nayka and Sursing Nayka from Mithibor village on November 8. Police said that the trio had grown 4,732 plants of marijuana worth Rs 70.9 lakh in their backyard. “Most of these marijuana growers are found in the interior areas of the district. Preliminary investigation has revealed that these growers sell the stock to dealers from the neighbouring districts,” said superintendent of Chhota Udepur police Dharmendra Sharma. “We are also investigating further about the source of seeds and who others are involved in buying the crops from these farmers,” he added. Another police official said that so far, the farmers have not given any satisfactory answer about who had sold the seeds to them. “We have got their custody from the court on Wednesday so we will be able to unearth some information from them soon,” the police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmers-held-for-growing-marijuana/articleshow/87633938.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||‘It’s hard to get ex gratia sans Covid report’||Lucknow: Tragedy struck Swapnil Rastogi in April this year when he lost his 59-year-old father during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Months later, he is trying to claim the Rs 50,000 ex gratia that the government has announced for the families of Covid-19 victims following the Supreme Court directives. However, he is facing a tough time as he does not have documentary proof like RT-PCR or CT scan report, his father’s Aadhaar card or mention of Covid in writing in prescription, even though the death certificate clearly mentions Covid as the cause of death. “The application for claiming ex-gratia requires RT-PCR/antigen/CT scan report as Covid proof. Death certificate with Covid as the cause of death mentioned on it and Aadhaar card details of the deceased are also required. In my father’s case, I do not have test report in writing to prove Covid nor do I have his Aadhaar card, which we have lost,” said Swapnil. He said his father was first admitted to a private hospital in Balaganj when he experienced Covid symptoms. However, instead of getting an RT-PCR test, the facility only got D-Dimer test and X-rays done to diagnose Covid and started treatment on its basis. The facility did not confirm Covid-19 in writing, Swapnil added. “After his condition deteriorated, we admitted him to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) without an RT-PCR since testing facilities were abysmal during the peak of pandemic. The hospital allotment was done by the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) which was clearly for a Covid hospital and the treatment was undertaken in Covid ward. His death certificate also notes the cause of death as Covid and cardiorespiratory failure,” he said. In the absence of test report and Aadhaar, Swapnil is unable to submit the form though he has death certificate and other proof. Not just Swapnil, many others like him are also facing difficulties as Covid patients in their families could not be tested during the pandemic peak. Tarannum Hasan’s mother-in-law was also one such victim. “We tried everything but could not get her Covid test done when she first showed the signs of the disease. Labs were refusing to take samples from home and she was not in a condition to be taken out of the house. Hospital was also not allotted to her because there was no RT-PCR test. She had all the symptoms of Covid,” said Tarannum. “I read about the ex gratia but we don’t have the required proof to process the claim as my mother-in-law died at home,” she said. “What is the alternative for such people who don’t have test report and Aadhaar details of the deceased? The government should accept other proofs too, especially since testing was not available during the second peak,” added Swapnil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/its-hard-to-get-ex-gratia-sans-covid-report/articleshow/87635743.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court discharges Rakeysh Mehra||Aurangabad: A magisterial court has discharged film director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra from a copyright infringement criminal case initiated by a script writer in 2008. Writer Mustaq Mohsin had named Mehra and film producer Rohinton Screwvala in his complaint, accusing them of using his script titled ‘Inquilab’ for their film ‘Rang De Basanti’, which was released in 2006. Mohsin then claimed that he had discussed the script with Mehra, for developing the film. He also claimed that he gave the entire literature of the film to Mehra.Mohsin was surprised to see the same was used in ‘Rang De Basanti’ film and this, he said, amounted to copyright violation/infringement. Judicial magistrate first class V H Khedkar, however, relied on an earlier order by the Aurangabad sessions court that discharged film producer Screwvala from the case. Mehra had moved his discharge plea before the magistrate soon after the sessions court’s order in Screwvala’s matter. Khedkar observed that the sessions court had allowed Screwvala’s revision plea without “distinguishing the role of accused no.2 (Screwvala) from present accused (Mehra)” and that order had not been challenged in a high court. Hence, the observations made the sessions court were binding on the lower court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-discharges-rakeysh-mehra/articleshow/87636170.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This was the highest daily tally of cases for the state since July 11. The last time the state had crossed the 40-case mark was on July 14, at 41. Experts say this spike could be due to the Diwali festival, but added that one must keep vigil for the next couple of days to ascertain whether this is a sustained trend. In 2020, the state witnessed its first wave after the Diwali festivities. This time around, vaccination coverage may reduce the impact, they added. While daily cases doubled from 20 to 42 in Gujarat, in Ahmedabad there was a four times increase from 4 to 16. This represented a 129-day high in daily cases for Ahmedabad.  The city accounted for 38%, more than a third of the daily cases. In all, municipal corporation areas contributed 28 cases or two-thirds of the state’s cases. Apart from Ahmedabad, the new cases included five each from Surat city and Valsad, four from Vadodara city, two each from Rajkot city, Junagadh and Morbi, and one each from Jamnagar city, Anand, Bharuch, Gir Somnath, Kutch and Tapi. With the discharge of 36 patients, the state’s active cases increased by six to 215. Of these, eight patients are on ventilators, the state health department bulletin said. The state administered 4.09 lakh doses of vaccines, taking the total number of doses administered to 7.28 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-covid-cases-at-122-day-high/articleshow/87635062.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why biomass burning needs to be taken head on||NEW DELHI: Over 630 complaints regarding open biomass burning were addressed by the agencies concerned in the past 12 days. Data compiled by the environment department shows that during the same period, over 1,000 challans were issued to violators for open burning of biomass, garbage and garden or plastic waste. Around 34,486 metric tonnes of biomass/garbage and 10,026 tonnes of plastic waste were collected between October 29 and November 8. As Delhi government begins a campaign against open biomass burning on Thursday, experts said such incidents increased during winter and it was one of the major sources of pollution in the city. A study conducted by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which showed the PM2.5 contribution of various sectors to Delhi’s air in winter 2020, stated that emissions from waste burning contributed 8.7% to Delhi’s PM2.5 between October 15 and November 15, 2020. The share of waste burning rose to 10% from November 15 to December 15, 2020 and 9.2% between December 15 and January 15, 2021. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, CEEW, said, “Our analysis suggests that biomass burning for heating constitutes a significant share of Delhi’s pollution burden between mid-November to mid-January.” “The Graded Response Action Plan already requires RWAs and individual home owners to provide electric heaters to security staff. Efforts should be made to understand why night shelters that could cater to the homeless run at low occupancy during winters,” added Ganguly. Anju Goel, fellow, earth science and climate change, The Energy and Resources Institute, said, “Biomass is used for cooking or for heating. A Teri study conducted in 2016 said 1.2 lakh households in Delhi-NCR used biomass for cooking. The authorities should ensure an adequate supply of cleaner fuels to reduce the use of biomass for cooking.” According to the Decision Support System developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune to forecast the sources of local and regional pollution, the contribution of waste burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was around 2-3% for the next four days. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The authorities should strengthen municipal services with focus on 100% collection, segregation and recycling of waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-biomass-burning-needs-to-be-taken-head-on/articleshow/87635040.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Edu dept circular hints at corruption in varsities||Ahmedabad: Gujarat education department’s recent circular that could curtail powers of state universities has created quite a stir with members of the Congress party strongly opposing the decision. Also, questions are being raised about the need to come out with such a circular especially at a time when allegations of rampant corruption and illegal recruitments are being raised at various universities of the state. “Saurashtra University, Sardar Patel University at Vallabh Vidyanagar, M S University, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University and Hemchandracharya University at Patan are under the scanner for various issues including recruitment of faculty members,” said sources in the state government. The education department on November 9 issued a directive for all state universities to seek government approval before hiring faculty or any ad-hoc appointments in the university. Also, the universities have to get government clearance before undertaking any major projects at the campus. Some academicians ask how corruption and scams can be prevented, when chancellors of universities are also appointed on the basis of recommendation and favouritism. Reacting strongly to the decision of the state government to curtail the powers of the vice-chancellors and authorities of the university, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said the circular is an acknowledgement by state government that the chancellors and syndicate members appointed by the BJP are involved in malpractices and financial irregularities. “If the chancellor is appointed by the ruling BJP government, then why does it not accept responsibility for the financial irregularities, nepotism and scams committed at universities? It is a matter of concern that Gujarat is constantly falling behind in higher education,” said Doshi. Recently, there was an uproar after allegations were levelled against BJP syndicate members and the chancellor being involved in recruitment process for the post of faculty at Saurashtra University in Rajkot. Similarly, there have been allegations of illegal recruitment at M S University for past some years now, said sources. Gujarat University has also recently launched an inquiry into the issue of financial expenditures, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/edu-dept-circular-hints-at-corruption-in-varsities/articleshow/87635058.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court sets aside order barring sale of Vijaypat Singhania's book||MUMBAI: A two-judge bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday set aside an order of a single-judge bench that had last week restrained publishers and distributors of ‘An Incomplete Life’—an autobiography of Vijaypat Singhania, the chairperson emeritus of Raymond Group, from its printing, sale and distribution.A vacation court bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja, granting relief to Pan Macmillan Publishing India Pvt Ltd, observed that the single judge while putting a hold on sale of the book was under an “erroneous impress-ion” of there being an existing stay. The publisher had filed an appeal to challenge the interim November 4 order in a contempt petition filed by Raymond Ltd against Singhania in a pending dispute. The company had alleged that the book was published despite a stay by Thane district court and was also offered for sale through Amazon India. It hence, sought a stay on printing and sale, of both digital and physical copies. Raymond counsel Tushad Cooper had said that the company had filed a civil suit in a Thane court against Singhania and the erstwhile publisher (Penguin Random House) in 2018 and in April 2019, the court had restrained the then publisher from publishing the purported autobiography, pending its appeal in a chequered legal battle that had travelled by then to HC and back to the Thane local court. Staying its printing and sale, the single judge had posted the contempt petition to November 25. But lawyers Siddhesh Bhole and Yakshay Chheda, for Pan Macmillan, said the stay order was “erroneous, perverse and without any jurisdiction” and unless set aside “would set a wrong precedent…” in exceeding contempt jurisdiction. They said Raymond Ltd “indulged in forum shopping” as Pan Macmillan was not a party to any proceedings filed in Thane, which was a ‘pre-publication’ proceeding. Raymond had asserted a right to privacy and its right to confidentiality, alleging both were violated. The publisher said right to privacy “is not available to a corporate person” and the company was invoking “right to confidentiality of information without even identifying or specifying the relevant information that has allegedly been disclosed”. After hearing Bhole, Cooper and for Singhania, advocate Vibhav Krishna, the bench said the, “single judge has passed the impugned order...under an erroneous impression that the district court at Thane has passed the order ...against the erstwhile publisher from publishing the book...was to continue until the pendency of the appeal filed by (Raymond)…” Vacation judge Justice Madhav Jamdar is now scheduled to hear the contempt plea afresh on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-sets-aside-order-barring-sale-of-singhania-book/articleshow/87635748.cms||Swati Deshpande

As part of this drive, an NMC squad led by additional commissioner Suresh Khade, director of civic solid waste department Avesh Palod and other senior officials visited various departments of the NMC in the Rajiv Gandhi Bhavan. During inspection, the team found 12 employees without masks and fined them Rs 500 each, recovering a total amount of Rs 6,000. An NMC official said action has been take as per directive of the state government regarding mandatory use of masks in government, semi-government, private and industrial establishments. “Such a drive is now to be conducted regularly at six divisional offices of the civic body — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Panchavati, Cidco and Satpur,” the official said. Apart from the staff, visitors not wearing maks will also be penalized. The civic administration has already started a drive against erring residents who are found without masks in public. During the last week, the NMC slapped a fine of Rs 200 each to over 150 erring city residents who were found without masks. “There has been a drop in new Covid cases in the city during the last three-four months, but there is still a possibility of the third wave if people do not follow the Covid norms.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In 3 months, 6k drivers fined Rs 500 to Rs 1k each for cutting E-way lanes||Pune: The Highway Safety Patrol (HSP)’s Pune unit cracked down on unsafe driving on a portion of the Pune-Mumbai Expressway during a three-month-long special drive. The HSP fined 6,255 heavy vehicles Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 each for lane-cutting and 69,000 motorists—mainly car and light commercial vehicle drivers—for speeding. Lane-cutting invites a fine of Rs 500, but the HSP tacked on a charge of rash driving as drivers often cut lanes without a signal. The extra charge attracts a fine of Rs 500, HSP officials said. The drive, held from August to October, focused on enforcing lane discipline and punishing errant drivers on the 40km stretch between Kiwale and Amrutanjan bridge.An official from Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which controls the Expressway, said 55,000-60,000 vehicles use it daily, 55% of which are light vehicles. “The number of heavy vehicles fined for lane-cutting may appear small in the overall context of those using the Expressway daily, but these are often responsible for causing accidents or endangering the lives of others as they move from one lane to another without giving any signal or observing lane discipline,” said Sanjay Jadhav, Pune HSP’s superintendent of police. Jadhav said it was not possible for HSP to post personnel throughout the high-speed corridor but said there will be sustained action against errant drivers. Heavy vehicles are supposed to drive on the third—or left — lane of the Expressway and cannot move to the middle or the first lane. However, drivers often flout this norm. Following the drive, HSP has stepped up monitoring by its mobile teams at Khandala and Wadgaon, and announcements are being made through the PA system at toll plazas, said Jadhav. Light and heavy vehicles must adhere to a speed limit of 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively. Violation attracts a fine of Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-3-months-6k-drivers-fined-rs-500-to-rs-1k-each-for-cutting-e-way-lanes/articleshow/87636194.cms||---

Four wards under Thiruvallom zone for which the list was published on Monday also show a set of individuals and institutions; private schools, government schools, hotels and resorts which had skipped payment of property tax continuously for five years. Arrears ranging between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh are being reported for some of the resorts coming under the Thiruvallom zone and the list also brings to light default in tax payment by some private schools. Considering the fact that an individual or an institution failing to pay tax for the first half of 2021-22 would still be included in the defaulters’ list, the data released by the Thiruvallam zonal office shows that major defaulters have failed to pay the tax dating from 2016-17. Three years ago, the revenue wing had initiated a campaign to pick defaulters among private educational institutions in the city with regard to tax dues. According to a report prepared by the corporation's revenue wing, about 12 prominent city schools then owed the city corporation tax dues worth Rs 4 crores. The report was submitted following the decision of the finance standing committee to collect dues from educational institutions, especially the private schools in the city. The revenue wing has, however, been battling a few technical hassles in collection of tax from the private schools in the city. According to corporation officials, until 2011, the schools were assessed on a common slab like non-residential buildings. A circular issued in the year 2012 empowered civic bodies to determine separate tax for educational institutions. Accordingly the council had approved Rs 20 per sq.m as tax for educational institutions in the city. However, the circular also added that the tax determined for educational institutions before January, 13, 2011 be exempted and in case tax had been determined based on annual rental value before January, 14, 2011 and if the tax had been paid, this shall be refunded or adjusted in future payments. The revenue wing had earlier tabulated data on assessment of private schools in the city and to find out other major defaulters in the city. In the coming days, defaulters in other wards among private schools and institutions will also come to the forefront. The corporation had prepared a list in 2019 focusing on major tax defaulters; however, the attempts to levy tax in a timely manner had not been fruitful. The list published by the Thiruvallam zone also includes some government schools among the defaulters list. The presence of government institutions in the defaulters’ list is likely to increase as the list from other wards will be published in the coming days once the data updation process is finished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/updated-tax-data-list-lays-bare-habitual-defaulters/articleshow/87613700.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Patel, who has cleared NEET PG, the results of which were declared one and a half month ago, says he had to let go of a job offer from a private hospital that wanted him to join as a resident doctor. There are about 2,200 PG medical seats in the state that are yet to be allotted as the admissions are running about six months behind schedule due to multiple reasons. The MBBS graduates who join PG medical courses serve as resident doctors at medical college hospitals. This year about 2,200 doctors are yet to join duty as the admission process is not completed so far. The NEET PG exams are usually held in April but they got delayed till August this year due to Coronavirus pandemic. “Last year, the candidates had joined first-year of PG programme in the month of May. These students have finished their first-year studies and moved on to the next year. As a result, about 2,200 doctors who are all ready to join the PG courses and serve in hospitals, cannot do so as the admission process is stuck,” according to a medical faculty in one of the government-run colleges in the state. The admission committee on Wednesday announced that the online registration process for admissions to MD, MS programmes will start from November 12. “The admission process is stuck due to an ongoing case in the Supreme Court regarding admission for economically weaker section (EWS) category. Also, the admissions at the state level can only be held once two rounds of admissions are completed under All India Quota,” said an academic expert from the medical field. Online registration for NEET PG from November 12 The Admission Committee for Professional Postgraduate Medical Educational Courses (ACPPGMEC) on Wednesday announced that the online registration for admissions to MD and MS programmes will be held from November 12 to November 16. Candidates who have cleared NEET PG-2021 are eligible to apply for admissions. On Wednesday, instructions were given by video-conferencing, regarding document verification process and submission of documents. Though the committee announced the date for online registration, experts said that the admissions cannot start immediately due to a case in the Supreme Court in connection with admission to PG medical for EWS category. Also, the admissions at the state-level can only be held once two rounds are completed under all-India quota, according to an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pg-admission-delay-2200-mbbs-doctors-kept-in-limbo/articleshow/87635053.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityThe cumulative count of farm fires of Haryana between September 1 and November 10 this year was higher than 2020 and 2019. Experts said the fire counts were likely to surpass last year’s figure in Punjab soon. Stubble burning, which usually picks up by October-end, got deferred this year due to rain. The fires were now rising and the peak season had got slightly shifted to the second week of November. Gufran Beig, founder project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, said, “The fire counts in November (11 days) are 42,099, which is the highest in the past four years during this period. However, farm fires were lowest in October in 2021 in the past four years.” SAFAR data showed 5,317 stubble burning counts on Wednesday, but in 2020 it was around 2,000. Officials said stubble burning numbers fluctuate due to the multiplicity of ways to measure satellite data. In Haryana, 7,232 cases of active paddy burning residue was recorded between September 1 and November 10. It was higher than the last two years — 4,542 farm fires in 2020 and 5,410 in 2019. Punjab recorded 55,076 farm fires from September 1 to November 10 against 65,900 last year. However, only 39,290 farm fires were observed in Punjab in 2019. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences, Universities Space Research Association, Nasa, said, “If the same burning rate continues for two-three days, Punjab will surpass last year’s fire counts.” LS Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW, said, “The cumulative number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana more than tripled from 20,723 until October 31 to 62,308 in the first 10 days of November. The shift in trend was attributable to the delayed harvest due to delayed monsoon withdrawal. With winds blowing from the northwest, farm fires are forecast to intensify the pollution levels in Delhi and surrounding areas. Taking a cue from historical trends, we can expect a decrease in farm fires in the coming days.” Earlier this season, fires were predominantly observed in the northwestern districts, such as Amritsar and Tarn Taran in Punjab. But in the last few weeks, fires progressed over the southern districts, including Sangrur, Patiala, Firozpur, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Faridkot and Bhatinda. In Haryana, fires were mostly seen in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Jind and Fatehabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-10-days-of-november-farm-fire-count-twice-the-october-burden/articleshow/87654836.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The property tax defaulters with dues over Rs 50,000 and water tax defaulters with dues over Rs 25,000 are being targeted under this initiative. “In the last 15 days, NMC squads have visited the houses of 150 water tax defaulters and snapped water connections of 30 defaulters and collected partly and fully tax payment amounting to Rs 90 lakh from 120 water tax defaulters,” said NMC officials. Apart from water tax defaulters, NMC squads have also started visiting the houses of property tax defaulters after Diwali. During the last three to four days, they have visited the houses of 20 tax defaulters urging them to clear their dues at the earliest or face action like confiscation of properties. The revenue of the civic body through property and water taxes have been badly affected due to the pandemic. The NMC administration has introduced an amnesty scheme for the property tax defaulters, but the property tax collection had not yet increased. NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore for the current financial year, but it could collect only Rs 86 crore so far. The officials said warrants will be issued to the big property tax defaulters if they avoid paying their dues during their visit to the homes NMC had set the water tax collection target of Rs 150 crore for the current fiscal, which includes Rs 60 crore tax of the current financial year and the remaining Rs 90 crore are the dues pending for the past few years. Hence, the NMC administration has decided to visit the houses of big water tax defaulters and snap their water connections if they avoid paying tax dues.  Meanwhile, there will be no water supply in ward no 3 in the Panchavati division of Nashik city on Friday as the water supply department of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) will be undertaking repair work at the major water supply lines in the area. Water will be supplied with low-pressure the next day on Saturday.

The complainant had gone to his native place for Diwali, when the burglars broke into his house. The complainant, who did not wish to reveal his identity, said, “The stolen ornaments included 12 gold rings, five gold chains and a pair of earrings, besides the jewellery of my parents kept in my house as their cupboard lock had issues.” The accounts professional informed that on the Laxmi Pujan day, he had taken out the ornaments and kept them back after the ‘puja’. “The following day, I locked my house and went to my native place for some days,” he said. The complainant said on Sunday night, his sister-in-law, who is also his neighbour, informed him about the broken door and the broken cupboard. “My father noticed it (the broken door). On Monday, when I returned home, the Sangvi police had already started the investigations,” he said. When the complainant checked the cupboard, he found gold ornaments and cash, totally worth Rs 9.7 lakh, missing. “During the last eight days, we did not notice any unknown person near our houses,” the complainant said. Sub-inspector Bharat Gosavi of the Sangvi police station told TOI that the complainant stayed in a single-storeyed chawl block. “We checked the CCTV cameras in the area but it did not yield any results so far. Our probe is on,” Gosavi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jewellery-worth-rs-9l-stolen-from-sangvi-chawl/articleshow/87613744.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The two-hour long surgery was performed on November 3 under the guidance of department head Prof J D Rawat, Dr Piyush Kumar, Dr Sudhir Singh and Dr Anand Pandey. Doctors performed the intricate surgery and separated the abortive twin, who had two legs, hands and back but no head, from the fully formed child. “On August 25, a woman in Sitapur had given birth to a child having a mass, legs and hands attached to its back. The family got worried over the abnormal growth and rushed the newborn to the local hospital from where they were referred to KGMU,” said Prof Rawat. “The MRI showed that the mass was an abortive twin attached to the child’s back over the lumbar spine and spinal cord. The child was successfully freed from the burden of the mass growing on its back and is doing well,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-docs-remove-babys-unborn-twin-in-a-2-hour-surgery/articleshow/87635763.cms||---
---||Kochi||Rehabilitation of dams on with World Bank funds||Kochi: While Mullaperiyar continues to be a controversial issue, many Indian states are carrying out dam rehabilitation (strengthening) projects with the help of the World Bank. Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand are the states that are currently using the World Bank funds for this purpose. The World Bank-funded dam rehabilitation and improvement project (DRIP) includes investments in selected 223 dams in six states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttarakhand), in addition to dams managed by the Damodar Valley Corporation in Jharkhand. The interventions are being implemented by 10 implementing agencies: central water commission (CWC) under the ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation (MoWR, RD&GR); Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC); Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (UJVNL); Odisha water resources department; Tamil Nadu water resources department; Tamil Nadu generation and distribution corporation (TANGEDCO); Karnataka water resources development organization; Madhya Pradesh water resources department; Kerala water resources department; and Kerala state electricity board. According to the World Bank report on dam rehabilitation, many dams are ageing (605 dams are over 50 years old and another 3,095 dams are over 25 years old) and exhibit various structural deficiencies and shortcomings in operation and monitoring facilities. “In most states, budget allocations for dam operations and maintenance are part of overall irrigation system maintenance budgets, which are typically decided based on irrigated area rather than on preventative and scheduled,” it said. “Over the last 65 years, India has invested heavily in infrastructure to store surface runoff in reservoirs formed by large, medium, and small dams with associated appurtenances. According to the national register for large dam (NRLD 2018), there were about 5,264 completed large dams in India, and another 437 under construction. The total storage capacity of these dams is about 304 billion cubic metres,” said the report. “As a result of population growth and development in downstream areas of dams, existing flood protection measures are often below acceptable standards and pose serious risks. Additionally, in most cases there has been minimal investment in operations and maintenance of structures since dam commissioning. High safety standards for large dams are imperative to prevent failure, which may cause devastating damage to environment and property, leading to economic hardship, and, in extreme cases, loss of life. An ever-increasing number of people are living and working in areas that would face sudden and severe flooding in the event of a dam failure,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rehabilitation-of-dams-on-with-world-bank-funds/articleshow/87635066.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Pair of Indian rock pythons rescued & released||AURANGABAD: Two Indian rock pythons were released into the wild by experts near Shendra industrial area on Wednesday after the reptiles were rescued from a farm at Bandewadi on the outskirts of the city on Monday. Snake rescuer Nitesh Jadhav said a farmer, Deepak Hiwarale, had contacted him after spotting the snakes in his farm. “After reaching the spot, we found a male and a female Indian rock pythons in close proximity to each other. The reptiles might have strayed into the human areas after getting attracted to each other,” Jadhav said. The female is nearly 7.5 feet in length, while the male is 5.6 feet long. They were rescued by Jadhav and his team comprising Sharad Dabhade, Ankush Rajput, Nitin Chauhan, Mangesh Dudhane and Amol Pattekar. “Even if non-venomous, Indian rock pythons are powerful snakes known for their nasty bites. We required a group of experts to overpower both the snakes during the resuce,” Jadhav said. The Indian rock python usually breeds on the face of Monsoon season after the female releases a special hormone to attract a mating partner. Listed as ‘Near threatened’ under IUCN Red List, Indian rock python is witnessing decline in populatio.due to various reasons. “Like other snakes and reptiles, Indian rock python plays a crucial role in the foodchain. The reptile feeds on small mammals, birds and other reptiles. Large rodents who are a menace to the farms are also part of the pythons diet. Therefore, the creature is also helpful for the farmers,” honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-pair-of-indian-rock-pythons-rescued-released/articleshow/87633261.cms||---
---||Kochi||Western Ghats destruction noted since 1866||KOCHI: As early as 1866, the famous British geographer and explorer Sir Clements Robert Markham had noted the environmental impact of the widespread practice of developing plantations on the Western Ghats of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Perhaps his account could be one of the earliest critical documentation on the effects of the destruction of nature in Kerala. “One obvious consequence of the destruction of forests is an increased rapidity of surface-drainage, giving rise to sudden and destructive floods at the outlet on the plains — The floods caused by the monsoon rains are yearly increasing in size and violence,” wrote Markham, who was then the secretary of Royal Geographical Society. “The destruction of forests has been one of the chief agents in effecting changes in the earth's surface, and the best methods of counteracting evils which may be caused by these extensive clearances is one of the most important questions that occupy the attention of physical geographers. This agency is now at work in the Western Ghats of India, those rich and beautiful mountain-districts forming the backbone of the Indian peninsula, and containing the sources of a water-supply, on which the prosperity - indeed, the very existence - of millions depends,” Markham wrote in his report titled “On the Effects of the Destruction of Forests in the Western Ghats of India on Water-Supply”. Markham notes that coffee planting had commenced in Wayanad in about 1840. “Now there are 192 coffee estates, of which 9,865 acres belong to Europeans, and 4,748 to natives, actually planted,” he noted. He had crossed Periyar in the high ranges of Idukki by foot in December 1865. While crossing the river, he noted: “Although this was nearly the lowest season, the river was 30 yards across, and we found by the marks that during the monsoon it rises 8 feet higher. The whole of this immense volume of water now runs to waste in the Cochin backwater. But there has long been a project to build a dam across, at a point 13 miles south of where we crossed, and to make a cutting, so as to throw the river into the Madura district”. “The settlement of planters on the hills has given rise to wide-spread destruction of the primeval forest. The planters are occupied chiefly in the cultivation of coffee, to which have been recently added tea, and the quinine-yielding cinchona of South America. These three products give rise to the felling and clearing of forests, in the formation of plantations,” Markham noted. He gives the extent of the destruction as 16,000 acres in Wayanad, 600 acres in Anamalais, 1,200 acres in Nelliampathy, 625 acres in Peermade - altogether little short of 60,000 acres, including the Coorg side too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/western-ghats-destruction-noted-since-1866/articleshow/87635130.cms||Shenoy Karun

---||Delhi||Severe smog in Delhi-NCR may last 2 more days||NEW DELHI: With the first severe smog episode hitting Delhi-NCR, an analysis done by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) says it is expected to last another two days. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, “The season’s first smog episode has been triggered by the combined effect of unfavourable weather conditions (cool and calm winds and inversion), stubble burning and firecrackers. Though the seasonal smog is intense, the average daily contribution of smoke from farm fires from the middle of October to November 8 has been the lowest in the last four years. Its contribution peaked and reached 48% on November 7. It is still elevated.” The analysis said average intensity of the smog so far was 329 ug/m3 per day, which was lower than 2020 by 7% and 2019 by 3%. It was more intense than the 2018 smog by about 9%. “Lingering on of smog for a longer duration this year despite relatively windier local conditions might be due to the lack of pollution control measures,” it added. Ozone levels continued to breach the standards at hotspots even during the peak smog episodes. Levels were higher pre- and post-peak smog days. CO was also found to be exceeding the standard. SO2 levels mimicked the trend of PM2.5, but didn’t breach the standard. NO2 bucked the trend and was seen to drop in concentrations when PM2.5 peaked. Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager, Urban Lab, CSE, said, “While very high concentrations of PM2.5 have hogged attention, the levels of gases — ozone, CO or NO2 — have remained elevated during this smog episode. Also, the ratio of SO2 to NO2 increased on Diwali night, indicating increased pollution load from firecrackers. The PM2.5 concentration on Diwali night (8pm to 8am) was the most intense since 2017.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/severe-smog-in-delhi-ncr-may-last-2-more-days/articleshow/87635093.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Nail that WFH posture||AHMEDABAD: The chair is a symbol of power. Though if not used not used properly, it can cause pain in all the wrong places! Due to work from home and prolonged time spent on digital devices including mobile phones, laptops, desktops and tablets over the past one and a half years, several young professionals are lining up outside offices of physiotherapists in the city. “In majority of the cases, the root cause of their pain — be it stiff upper back, neck pain, tingling in forearms or fingers, or difficulty in sitting straight – lies in their work posture,” said Dr Nehal Shah, principal of SBB College of Physiotherapy. “In contrast to working at an office at a workstation, at home, professionals used improper chair, sofa, dining table, etc. to work on their devices. Prolonged practice in such an environment affected their health.” Two recent works from the college highlighted the impact of work environment and impact of bad posture on various joints. A work by Yoginakumari Rathva, a PG student, along with lecturer Payal Gahlot studied the workplace musculoskeletal discomfort (WMSD) with respect to the office objects they interacted with. Workstation specifics (chair, height, armrest and back support), computer (monitor, mouse, keyboard), telephone use and duration of spending time in each posture were taken into consideration. ROSA scale (1 for lowest risk and 8+ for highest risk) was applied to the individuals. All participants were between 25 and 50 years of age. “We found that 49% of the respondents were working for 8-9 hours on a computer and 18% for 10 hours and more. Out of total, 54% had low to moderate and 46% had high to very high risk of WMSD,” said Gahlot. “Chair and phone were found to be two major items which resulted in WMSD. We recommended the proper height of the chair and not to use the phone by holding it between cheek and shoulder.” ‘Neck and upper back pain most common’A study, conducted by Dr Nehal Shah and PG student Virti Shah got people to submit digital questionnaires on work-from-home posture along with their photographs. Shah said that neck and upper back pain were found to be prevalent in 35% of the respondents each. “About 28% complained of shoulder pain, 20% upper arm pain, 15% forearm pain, 10% wrist pain, and 15% each hip pain and knee pain. About 80% of respondents used laptops, and 20% desktops. Two-thirds of the participants used computers for over six hours a day,” said Virti Shah. “About 40% of the participants said that the pain, if persisted, interferes in their work.” Dr Shah said that more importantly, the study highlighted that about 20% had no pain but their posture was wrong. “They would often sit in the same wrong posture for long, which can cause damage first to muscles – resulting in pain, inflammation, tearing or stiffness – and later to bones. Out of those, about 27% were found to be at risk of developing complications,” she said, adding that it’s the reason many companies are now hiring ergonomists to assess the workplace environment and suggest changes to reduce workplace injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nail-that-wfh-posture/articleshow/87635102.cms||Parth Shastri

He was critical on August 3, 2015 when he got a new lease on life after a 42-year-old brain dead woman’s family agreed to donate her heart For a year thereafter, Anwar didn’t step out and had to stay put in a second flat that had been leased by his family for the period of his recovery. Unfortunately for him, his first girlfriend who was immensely supportive during his transplant, gave in to her family pressure and got married elsewhere. After that, Anwar’s family members started looking for a match for him, but were dejected as many families rejected his proposal on hearing about the transplant. “Many people believe a heart transplant patient cannot survive long, but I would like to tell such people to change their perception,” he said. While heart transplants are relatively new in India and Mumbai, they are routine in the West with most patients enjoying a long survival. The parents of his bride-to-be, Shazia, agreed to the alliance only after they met him and put him through a long interrogation. “Shazia’s family visited me at my father’s scrapyard while we were working and also saw me doing workouts at the gymnasium before they gained some confidence about my fitness,” said Anwar. Anwar added, “I have to forget my past and start afresh. I would also like to appeal to others who have gone through a heart transplant to enjoy life without fear.” Anwar has completed his graduation and plans to take up a job in the IT industry. On November 30, Anwar wants the entire transplant team, including transplant surgeon Anvay Mulay, to be present at the wedding and shower their blessings on him and Shazia. It will be a double wedding in the family as Anwar’s elder brother, Shoeb, too, will wed on the same day. Anwar’s parents are ecstatic that he is going to get married and start a new life. His father, Jameel Khan, told TOI, “I don’t have words to express my happiness at this moment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/want-to-show-heart-transplant-patient-can-live-long-in-mumbai/articleshow/87635778.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||Aurangabad||Authorities remain mute spectators as tourists visiting Ajanta Caves suffer||Aurangabad: As the scores of tourists visiting the Ajanta Caves have been hit by the ongoing MSRTC strike, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and other authorities continue to remain mute spectators to the hardships faced by the visitors. While the shuttle bus service on the 4 km route between Fardapur T-point and Ajanta Caves continues to be suspended due to the strike, several tourists complained that local bullock cart owners are charging exorbitant fares. “We have come to see Ajanta Caves from Rajasthan. As buses are not plying up to the caves, bullock cart owners are asking us to pay Rs 1,600 per trip, which is very high. We cannot reach the site by walking,” said a tourist. The Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation, a forum of different stakeholders from the local tourism and hospitality industry, has accused the MTDC of acting irresponsibly by not protecting the interest of tourists. “It is painful to see that MTDC and other authorities are not making alternative arrangements for tourists. Many people have no option other than to travel from Fardapur on bullock carts by paying a huge amount or walking to the destination. Children and elderly are among the worst hit,” foundation president Jaswant Singh said. “Unfortunately, though the MTDC has a regional office in Aurangabad, permanent employees have not been stationed here. The staff that is present here is not bothered about the ground realities. They specifically said that MTDC’s role is only to look after the resorts and nothing else.” In a letter addressed to Aaditya Thackeray, Maharashtra tourism minister, the stakeholders have demanded immediate official intervention to end the tourists' ordeal. MTDC regional manager Moushani Kose said, a letter has been sent to the district administration seeking the arrangement of private buses to reach Ajanta Caves from the Fardapur t-point. “We do not have power to start an alternative shuttle bus service. The SDM–level official has been requested to make the necessary arrangements,” she said. As per the official data, a total of 10,645 Indian and 53 foreign tourists visited Ajanta Caves in October. The number has reached 9,748 (9,675 Indian, 73 foreigners) between November 1 to 8 during Diwali vacations. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached out for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/authorities-remain-mute-spectators-as-tourists-visiting-ajanta-caves-suffer/articleshow/87633313.cms||Prasad Joshi

Hence, by calling this meeting as soon as possible, I hope the right measures will be taken to control the increasing pollution,” Rai said. Conducting a surprise inspection at Ghazipur landfill in east Delhi, Rai added that he had directed the civic body to present an action plan for a full-proof fire control mechanism to avoid future instances of fires at landfill. He said the current progress of landfill disposal was poor and impractical and the municipal corporation was severely lacking in its work. Marking the beginning of anti-burning campaign, Rai said, “Today we have carried out a thorough inspection to understand how to avoid instances of fire in the future. Starting Thursday, day and night patrolling and inspections will be conducted throughout Delhi in the various localities under this anti-burning campaign.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court acquits two businessmen of attacking bus driver in Chembur||Mumbai: Observing that their false implication was evident, a sessions court acquitted two city businessmen accused of attacking a BEST driver after a stationary van, purported to be theirs, was rammed into at Chembur in 2012.Acquitting Amit Koli (44) and Manoj Vaiti (33), judge B V Wagh said, “There is no independent witness to support the prosecution in the light of a self-interested version of the informant (BEST driver). In view of contradictory evidence, possibility of false implication of accused is evident. The accused deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt.” The court said it was not proved that the van belonged to the duo. The prosecution said on December 17, 2012, Sahebrao Nawale was driving the bus from Navi Mumbai to Kurla depot. At 11.45am, when it was near a stop in Chembur Camp, a rickshaw came from the left of the bus and dashed the van parked there. The accused allegedly abused the bus driver. They allegedly caught hold of his collar, manhandled and threatened to get him sacked. The BEST driver reportedly tried to tell them that it was not his mistake, but they did not pay heed. Police came to the spot after a commuter called them and the accused were arrested. The driver was taken to hospital. The accused were booked under IPC sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from duty). Among the witnesses were the driver, conductor, ticket checker, investigating officer and doctor who examined the bus driver. The court noted that there was discrepancy in evidence of the bus driver and conductor on the role of the accused. The court said while the driver claimed the accused caught hold of his collar, manhandled and threatened him, the conductor said they had beaten him. “Thus, the vital anomaly crept in evidence of the witnesses is of great concern, which affects the core of prosecution,” the court said.

The company added 87% said they now plan to work while travelling or living elsewhere while 48% see travel as an integrated part of their life. “As travel restrictions in India loosen, new research demonstrates a shift towards an increased demand for flexible travel, nearby stays, and longer trips that allow guests to combine work and leisure and ultimately, to live anywhere,” it said. “A trend prevalent since the beginning of the pandemic, travel within 300km of home continues to drive demand for Indian travellers, with 42% of respondents saying that they would continue to look at nearby stays,” said Airbnb, the company that commissioned the survey. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-blended-leisure-work-travel-is-a-key-trend/articleshow/87635804.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Don’t drag defence forces into Char Dham rd project’||Dehradun: At the Supreme Court’s hearing on the all-weather Char Dham road project, whose hearing is to be continued on Thursday, locals and environmentalists have expressed dismay at the dragging of defence forcesinto a “tourism-oriented” project. They say they wish to have “only the existing road to be broadened scientifically, and that, too, in an environment-friendly” way. “The all-weather road project was planned and executed with the vision to give movement freedom to tourists visiting Uttarakhand. It was never launched as an ‘all-weather defence road’ to facilitate movement of our forces,” said Sushila Bhandari, an environmentalist from Rudraprayag. Speaking to TOI, local activists said that the government first needs to save the Himalayas, which will in turn shield it from enemies. “Broaden roads only up to 7m with 1.5m footpath on both sides, which can protect Himalayas rather than attempting and experimenting broad roads on fragile Himalayas, which is leading to endless landslides and rock felling,” said Suresh Bhai, a native of Uttarkashi and founder of Rakshasutra Andolan of Uttarakhand.  "The case is not defence versus environment. The issue is that excessive road widening needs vertical cuts which destabilises the slopes and results in landslides. Chronic landslides on all the defence-related roads are detrimental to national security," said environmentalist Mallika Bhanot. Locals are of the view that the state doesn’t have space for such broad roads andtherefore, forceful construction on the pretext of defence requirement would cost both locals and forces dear. “We had asked for hospitals, good government schools, jobs for our local youth, which never happened in 61 years since we got the road in 1960. We never wanted a broad road, all we had asked for was better facilities and good roads,” added Matwal. The 889-km all-weather Char Dham road was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for boosting tourism in the state by connecting all the four Chr Dham shrines – Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. Meanwhile fake photographs of the members of the NGO, Citizens for Green Doon, complainant in the all-weather case had been trending on Twitter with incorrect name of their lawyer and morphed photos of its members, against which a police complainant was filed by the NGO in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dont-drag-defence-forces-into-char-dham-rd-project/articleshow/87634243.cms||Shivani Azad

Congratulations to Ishika. Her father (12th pass) runs a stationery shop while her mother (10th pass) is a housewife.” Both these students are from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV). Garg is from Kishanganj, while Jain is from Surajmal Vihar. The two students are not sure about getting into AIIMS, but they are confident of securing a seat at Maulana Azad Medical College. This was their second attempt at clearing the exam. Both dropped a year and studied for the entrance test. Last year, 569 Delhi government school students had cleared the exam. Of them, around 10% had scored the necessary cutoff for admission in government colleges under the general category. Also, 18 of them had scored 580 and above in 2020. There are around 1,100 seats in government medical colleges in Delhi. “I had got free coaching from Dakshini Foundation after clearing their qualifying exam. I was expecting to get around 680 marks, but 700 is a surprise for me,” said Garg, a resident of Shastri Nagar. Jain said, “If had taken admission last year, I would have had to go out of Delhi and hence, I thought I should try again. I enrolled for a coaching but it was fully online due to the Covid-induced lockdown. I studied for five to six hours a day as there was nothing else to do.” She has scored 360 out of 360 in the Biology paper. Last year, her total score was 559. While 51 students from a Delhi government school in Yamuna Vihar have qualified the NEET, 28 of the successful candidates are from a government school in Paschim Vihar. Sixteen students from IP Extension school, 15 each from Loni Road and Molarband schools and 14 from a Delhi government school in Rohini have qualified the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/496-students-from-delhi-govt-schools-clear-neet-two-score-700-out-of-720/articleshow/87635118.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||My responsibility to clean Yamuna, will do so: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel may soon become cheaper in the capital with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing on Wednesday that Delhi government would reduce the value added tax on fuel. After the Centre cut excise on petrol and diesel, several states complemented this by reducing VAT. Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, Kejriwal also acknowledged the raging politics over the pollution of the Yamuna river and conceded that the buck stopped with him. He said the AAP government would clean the river over the next five years. While announcing his government’s intention to reduce VAT, Kejriwal indirectly hit out at the Centre for what he described as “a minor decrease in fuel prices” after such a huge rise in prices over a long period. Asked about the Yamuna’s toxic and frothy water and his promise to clean the river, Kejriwal countered, “The problem has been created over 70 years. It cannot be solved in a few days. I will not pass the buck to other states. It is my responsibility to clean the Yamuna and I will do it.” Kejriwal also blamed harvest stubble burning for the air pollution. “Delhi is not to blame for air pollution. Throughout the year the air quality index remains below 100, and the air starts deteriorating only around October 10 because of stubble burning in neighbouring states,” the CM said. “No farmer wants to burn the harvest remains, but only the government can provide a solution to them. With Pusa Institute, we developed a cheap compound that decomposes the stubble. If Delhi government could have it sprayed for free, why can’t the Punjab government?” Kejriwal rued that his efforts to convince the governments of the neighbouring states and the Centre to direct the use of the decomposer hadn’t been successful. “Stubble is currently a liability when it can turn into gold, be used to generate power, coal, cardboard, CNG. Why can’t we open factories to consume stubble?” asked the CM. The AAP leader also strongly defended his image of a cribber during the oxygen crisis at the peak of the second Covid wave. Kejriwal said the AAP government managed to resolve the problem only by making a hue and cry over it. “Even the mother does not feed a baby that does not cry,” Kejriwal said, blaming the Centre for the oxygen scarcity across the country. “Delhi has huge potential, as does India,” Kejriwal concluded, listing garbage management, water supply and Yamuna cleaning as focus areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-cut-vat-on-fuel-cm/articleshow/87635138.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Aurangabad||Court discharges film’s director in ‘Rang De Basanti’ copyright case||Aurangabad: A magisterial court here has discharged film director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra from a copyright infringement criminal case initiated by a script writer in 2008. Writer Mustaq Mohsin had named Mehra and film producer Rohinton Screwvala in his complaint, accusing them of using his script titled `Inquilab’ for their film ‘Rang De Basanti’, which was released in 2006. Mohsin had claimed that he had discussed the script with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, for developing the film, at a place called ABC Ltd office, and said that he gave the entire literature of the film to Mehra, who had gone through the same. Later, he (Mohsin) was surprised to see the same was used in ‘Rang De Basanti’ film and this amounted to copyright violation/infringement, Mohsin claimed. Judicial magistrate first class VH Khedkar, however, relied on an earlier order by the Aurangabad sessions court that discharged the film’s producer Screwvala from the same case. The sessions court, while setting aside a chief judicial magistrate’s issue process order against Screwvala, had observed, the “criminal proceeding itself was not tenable as the story (Inquilab) was not registered and there was no prima facie material to prove the offenses punishable under the Copyright Act.” Mehra had moved his discharge plea before the magistrate soon after the sessions court’s order in Screwvala’s matter. Khedkar observed that the sessions court had allowed Screwvala’s revision plea without “distinguishing the role of accused no.2 (Screwvala) from present accused (Mehra)” and that order had not been challenged in a high court. Hence, the observations made the sessions court were binding on the lower court. The magistrate cited the sessions court’s observation that the present criminal proceeding itself was not tenable as the story was not registered and there was no material to issue process for the offence punishable under Section 51, 63 and 65 of the Copyright Act. “In such circumstance, if the charge is framed, it will be groundless charge. Therefore, it is proper to discharge accused No. 2 (Mehra) vide Section 245(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the magistrate said. When contacted, Mohsin told TOI that he was out of station and will take a call on exercising his further legal remedies once he returns to Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/court-discharges-films-director-in-rang-de-basanti-copyright-case/articleshow/87633329.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp to conduct tax adalat from November 22||Thiruvananthapuram: The tax adalat to address issues regarding dues of property tax will begin from November 22. The city corporation will organise a month long tax adalat here to address issues regarding property tax payment in the city following allegations of fund fraud in zonal offices. While addressing the special council meeting held in October Mayor Arya Rajendran said that data updation of 4.5 lakh tax assessments would be completed within a month following which the adalat would be held. The corporation has also decided to offer a platform for residents to raise complaints online if they find irregularities in tax dues which are being published for each ward. In case of irregularity or cases where additional amount has been levied, the corporation will facilitate adjustment of the amount for upcoming fiscals or repayment based on request filed by the resident. While the list is being published for each ward, the officials are not certain of an error free list mainly because of inaccuracies in the basic data being handled by the corporation. The adalat will be held from November 22 to December 17 here covering all zonal offices and the main office. Adalats will be held on four days for the main office. Mayor Arya Rajendran had earlier said that after the posting and adalat, all the complaints regarding tax payment will be resolved. Earlier BJP Parliamentary party leader M R Gopan cited his own example to highlight the lapses in data updation. He said that his payment of around Rs 20,000 as tax was yet to be reflected on the website. The mayor responded to his statement and said that as soon as the complaint was received, the updation was completed. M R Gopan however said that the mayor was setting a wrong precedent by expecting all those with complaints to turn up to the office so that discrepancies in tax payment could be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-conduct-tax-adalat-from-november-22/articleshow/87613803.cms||---
---||Lucknow||CM to shower cash rewards on Paralympic achievers today||Lucknow: To boost the morale of players who brought honour to the country in the Tokyo Paralympics (August 24-September 5), Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will shower monetary rewards on them in a glittering ceremony at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technical in Meerut on Thursday. For medal winners from Uttar Pradesh, the state government has announced Rs 6 crore for gold, Rs 4 crore from silver and Rs 2 crore for bronze. Medallists from other states will get Rs 2 crore for gold, Rs 1.5 crore for silver and Rs 1 crore for bronze. Two UP players, Suhas LY (para-badminton) and Pravin Kumar (para-jumping), bagged silver in Paralympics and will get Rs 4 crore each. Remaining six participants from Uttar Pradesh – Varun Singh Bhati of Gautam Budh Nagar (para-athletics), Ajit Singh of Etawah (para-athletics), Deepender Singh of Sambhal (para-shooting), Akash of Baghpat (para-shooting), Vivek Chikara of Meerut (para-archery), and Jyoti of Muzaffarnagar (para-archery) – will receive Rs 25 lakh each. Total 17 medallists from across the country, including two from UP, will receive the total prize money of Rs 31 crore. Director, sports, RP Singh said specially-abled players from all the districts, coaches and representatives of various sports associations had been invited to attend the felicitation function. Unlike the function organised at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium in Lucknow, coaches will not be felicitated. “We have extended an open invitation to all players, coaches and sports bodies to attend the function. However, only the Paralympic medallists and participants from Uttar Pradesh will be honoured with cash reward,” Singh said. Sportspersons from outside UP who will be felicitated are gold medallists Avani Lekhara (shooting-Rajasthan), Sumit Antil (javelin throw-Haryana), Manish Narwal (shooting-Haryana), Pramod Bhagat (badminton-Odisha), Krishna Nagar (badminton-Rajasthan), silver medallists Bhavina Patel (table tennis-Gujarat), Nishad Kumar (high jump-Himachal Pradesh), Devendra Jhajaria (javelin throw-Rajasthan), Yogesh Kathunia (discus throw-Haryana), Mariyappan Thangavelu (high jump-TN), Singhraj Adhana (shooting-Haryana), and bronze medallists Sundar Singh Gurjar (javelin throw-Rajasthan), Sharad Kumar (high jump-Bihar), Harvindar Singh (archery-Haryana) and Manoj Sarkar (badminton-Uttarakhand). Meanwhile, coaches rued the government’s decision of not felicitating them and not even extending formal invitation. Para-badminton head national coach Gaurav Khanna said, “Para-badminton players from across the country were being trained in our academy for the last five years. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the achievements of our players in the Paralympics. I will not attend the function as I have not received any formal invitation. It is unfortunate that we are not being given due respect in our home state.” A member of the support staff who went to Tokyo with the team claimed that the names of coaches were on the list of people to be felicitated. However, their names were excluded at the last moment, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-to-shower-cash-rewards-on-paralympic-achievers-today/articleshow/87635808.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Goa||Mapusa municipality must be fined for waste dumping: Lobo||Panaji: A day after exuding confidence that Congress’ Sudhir Kandolkar would win the Mapusa seat in the 2022 polls, minister for waste management Michael Lobo, on Wednesday hit out at Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) for failing to resolve the issue of garbage dumping within its jurisdiction. MMC is controlled by BJP supporters. Lobo said that a fine of Rs five to 10 lakh should be imposed on the council and that its officials should get the stick from the court for neglecting their duties. “Today if you go around the Mapusa municipality area, you will spot garbage dumped 24x7. They are not serious on this issue. The municipality should be fined Rs five to 10 lakh to get them to act. Someone will have to go to court and say that they are not doing any work. The chairperson, vice-chairperson and councillors should ‘get the stick’ for not doing any work,” said Lobo. He said any municipality which claims to be treating its own waste is bluffing. “If anyone is saying they are treating waste in their municipality, it is not true. They bring machines, inaugurate them and then the machines are lying unused. We have seen such machines for ourselves,” the minister said. He also hit out at the tourism ministry for interfering in collection of waste from the beaches. “Tourism department has given a contract to someone to collect waste and they are ultimately bringing the waste to our Saligao waste treatment plant itself for processing. Tourism department made the dramatic announcement that they will do beach cleaning. Not a single officer of the department has gone on the beaches to check because they are not interested, they have forcibly interfered in it. The minister has to be dedicated. Since we have a waste management ministry, all waste should come under us. This will change in 2022,” said the ports miniter . Lobo said that many panchayats are also still not serious about segregating their waste. “If we had not set up this plant, what would be the fate of these panchayats? They would be only filing affidavits in the court in the ongoing case and even some sarpanchs would be disqualified for dereliction of duty under the Panchayati Raj Act. Some are only collecting 30% of the wet waste. They are not collecting 100% segregated waste. In some panchayats, they are dumping waste by roadsides,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-municipality-must-be-fined-for-waste-dumping-lobo/articleshow/87635129.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Gold price surges to Rs 50,000 mark after three months||AHMEDABAD: As markets resumed in Ahmedabad after the Diwali break, gold prices once again zoomed to Rs 50,000 per 10 grams on Wednesday. The last time gold price was at this level was on July 30. Analysts and bullion traders attribute the surge in gold price to the firming up of the US dollar against the Indian rupee. The US dollar rate stood at 74.4 against the Indian rupee on Wednesday. “Gold price has increased due to a marginal surge in international prices of gold. In the international market, the demand for gold has gone up which caused prices to increase. Moreover, as the Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar, the effective price of gold in the Indian market will be higher,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Even though spot gold price fell marginally to $1,825.6 (Rs 1.36 lakh approx) per ounce around 6.30pm on Wednesday according to World Gold Council, prices in the local markets firmed up. Despite the surge in prices, jewellers anticipate good demand in days to come. “As soon as markets resumed operations during Labh Pancham, the demand remained upbeat as people came in to buy bullion on account of the muhurat. Customer footfalls at jewellery stores have remained good in the wake of the wedding season and people are making high-value purchases in a big way,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). Overall, the festive season sales remained good for jewellers across Gujarat. An estimated 750kg gold was traded on Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras muhurats ahead of Diwali, backed by buoyant muhurat purchases. “People have realised the importance of gold as an asset class during the pandemic and despite better returns in other asset classes be it equities or mutual funds, the faith of investors has remained intact in gold,” Soni further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-surges-to-rs-50k-mark-after-three-months/articleshow/87635134.cms||---

The report -- to be prepared by the Survey of India -- should assess the state of water and air quality and the measure of forest land in the state, said the court. The direction came as the court was hearing a petition — filed by social worker Ajay Narayan Sharma — alleging illegal encroachment of river land in Dehradun. Meanwhile, secretary of the urban development department, who was present in the high court for the hearing of the plea, informed the bench that such a survey has not been conducted in the state since 1964. The court has also asked the administrations of Dehradun and Nainital to furnish a report on urbanisation and how urban development can be achieved without harming the environment after every two years. In addition, Chief Justice RS Chauhan asked DM Dehradun to tell the court, by December 14, how many complaints of encroachments have been received in his office. The HC bench also asked state authorities — including secretary of revenue department, chief municipal commissioner, vice-president of Mussoorie Doon Development Authority and others — to undertake works according to a master plan and include facilities like hospitals, offices, schools, residential areas and commercial areas in every zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/submit-environmental-assessment-report-after-every-three-years-hc/articleshow/87634252.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Oppn leaders competing to praise Jinnah’||Lucknow: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Wednesday said the opposition leaders are competing to praise Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Singh’s remark came hours after SBSP chief and SP ally O P Rajbhar said the country’s partition wouldn’t have happened had Jinnah been made the first Prime Minister of India. Without taking Rajbhar’s name, Singh said the opposition leaders have become victims of ‘mental bankruptcy’ due to their appeasement politics ahead of UP elections. Earlier, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had ignited the controversy by comparing Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and found himself in the cross hairs of the saffron party. BJP state unit chief said the comparison was an insult to the freedom fighters and backward classes who consider Sardar Patel as their ideal and draw inspiration from him. “Till now, only Akhilesh Yadav had compared Jinnah with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, now his allies are calling Jinnah as the frontline leader of the freedom struggle. While doing this they forget that Jinnah had first formed the party on religious lines and eventually got the country divided,” he said. Singh said those who are chanting Jinnah’s name have always been dividing the society on the basis of caste, religion and opinion. Accusing the opposition of conspiring to spoil the social harmony in the state, he said, “They do not want social harmony and brotherhood in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-leaders-competing-to-praise-jinnah/articleshow/87635812.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC spent Rs 3,000 crore on fight against Covid since 2020||MUMBAI: BMC has spent over Rs 3,000 crore on Mumbai’s fight against Covid-19 since 2020, data has shown. In the last seven months, BMC spent Rs.1,219.50 crore. In the last financial year, it spent Rs 1,809.95 crore. While there is no break-up on expenses corporators have repeatedly demanded that the civic body come out with a white paper on expenses made during Covid-19, especially as most proposals tabled before statutory committees would be passed without much discussion during the peak of the first and second waves, as there was a pandemic. BJP’s nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat, who is also party spokesperson, said BMC must come out with a ward-wise break-up on Covid expenses. “Many Covid-related purchases were made by BMC at inflated costs, so there is a need for a white paper detailing expenses,” said Shirsat. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja emphasized that now with statutory committee meetings like standing committee in BMC taking place physically, it was the right time for the civic body to come out with a white paper. “BMC received a lot of funds via CSR during the pandemic, which also needs to be accounted for. The Rs 3,000 crore-plus expenses are finally taxpayers’ money and hence the break-up should be put in public domain,” he said. Civic officials said in the initial months of Covid-19 maximum expenditure was made for setting up Covid-19 health infrastructure, especially field hospitals, providing food to patients at these facilities, distribution of food packets, expenditure towards hotel bills for accommodation of frontline staff, along with recruiting staff on contract basis. “Following the national lockdown in March 2020, BMC had also started sending out lakhs of food packets daily for beggars, stranded labourers and migrants across the city,” said an official, adding that other expenses made were on medical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks, 3-ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body bags, protective eye-wear and sanitizers, followed by purchasing injections, including Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Vinod Mishra (BJP) said funds for work like roads were diverted in the name of Covid. “Expenditure is likely to be more as they used funds from other departments in the name of Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-spent-rs-3k-cr-on-fight-against-covid-since-2020/articleshow/87635811.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Delhi||Mission impossible: How gangs are luring targets with WFH jobs||NEW DELHI: Work-from-home employment offered by job portals could cause you much woe. Delhi Police has found several fake portals offering positions for such work and then giving the recruits targets they can’t meet, in lieu of which the latter then are made to pay heavy penalties. Explaining the modus operandi of such portals, the cops said on Wednesday that they collected resumes of people looking for employment from home such as data entry work. Offering them jobs, the fraudsters made the hired people sign legal agreements with a penalty clause if they failed to meet work deadlines. “The fake employers then gave the recruits impossible tasks to complete. They then extorted large sums as penalty for their failures,” said an investigator. While explaining what some such ‘impossible tasks’ were, another policeman said the newly hired people were given a voluminous task of data analysis to be completed, say, in 15 days. "Even if the new employees completed the work in the given time, the website staff would tell them that the work did not meet their expectations and that they had to prepare a fresh report in a new time frame,” the officer said. “In this manner, they ensured that the person never completed the work in time and had to pay the penalty.” Elaborating, the police officer said that in some instances, the recruit would be told to make a report running into 10,000 pages in five or 10 days. “After failing to complete such a task, the applicant paid the fees due under the agreement. However, the fake company kept on demanding more money, causing them to buckle by serving a legal notice,” the officer said. The victims signed the legal agreement online without realising that they were being forced into a tight corner. "We also established that the legal notices served to the victims were fake. In several cases, people paid large sums just to be freed from facing any legal action,” an investigating officer added. According to the investigators, a search was conducted on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal to list similar complaints from all over India. This exercise revealed that there were more than 50 complaints with similar allegations lodged by people in different places. During the probe, the cops found that most of the victims were already employed but had wanted to earn extra money through part-time jobs. But there were many others, first time job seekers, who were defrauded. “While trawling the internet for jobs, they came across such websites offering them handsome salaries for part-time work,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mission-impossible-how-gangs-are-luring-targets-with-wfh-jobs/articleshow/87635153.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MACT awards Rs 70 lakh payout to kin of Goregaon man killed in accident||MUMBAI: Nine years after a 28-year-old Goregaon man, father of two, was killed after the bike he was riding was hit by a jeep driver, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) awarded his family a compensation of around Rs 70 lakh (with interest). The victim, Baban Sangale, was self-employed. Considering his SSC marks of 56% and the fact that he had completed a Dairy Administration and Animal Husbandry diploma, the tribunal pegged his notional income at Rs 20,000. Sangale’s wife, two minor children and mother moved the tribunal in 2013, against the jeep owner Raju Lahane and New India Assurance Co Ltd. It was submitted that on December 24, 2012, at about 5.30 pm, Sangale was riding his bike with his friend in Ahmednagar when the jeep allegedly came from the opposite direction and rammed into the bike. Due to the impact, Sangale fell and sustained serious head and other injuries. He was shifted to a local hospital first and later to another one in Nashik. However, he died on January 2, 2013. The family had sought a compensation of Rs 94 lakh but the jeep owner did not come before the tribunal. The insurance company claimed the accident occurred due to Sangale’s negligence. It submitted that the claim application itself is devoid of merit and substance and prayed for its dismissal with costs. Sangale’s wife deposed before the tribunal and iterated the version given in the plea. The tribunal said police papers supported her version. “Though the insurance company alleged the accident occurred only due to sole negligence of the deceased, …no evidence at all is brought on record by it. The fact of accidental death of the deceased and involvement of the offending vehicle is not at all denied by the insurance company,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mact-awards-rs-70l-payout-to-kin-of-man-killed-in-accident/articleshow/87636223.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A large number of police personnel were deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. The residents have been facing irregular water supply since the last few years. In fact, just last week, many of them had staged a protest at the public works department (PWD) office at Mapusa and warned that they would block the road if water supply is not restored. Despite repeated correspondence and complaints to all the authorities concerned, and a face-to-face meeting with PWD officials, locals said all they received were verbal assurances that the problem would be resolved. After meetings, water supply would resume for two days, and then become irregular again. However, they were left outraged when the PWD stopped supplying water for the past few days citing that the tanker was out of order. Agitated locals said the water supply lines in the area are nearly 40-years-old and that they need to be replaced as the pipes are blocked in many places and many valves have sprung leaks too. Further, they said that if these problems are reported, they are not repaired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vagator-residents-block-road-over-lack-of-water-supply/articleshow/87635155.cms||---

The largest public hospital in Kolhapur is facing a staff crunch. As against the requirement of 700 nurses, the CPR Hospital has just 400. Of them, 300 are available on any given day. The nurses have claimed that owing to the shortage of staff, they are overburdened with several tasks. The hospital has over 20 departments and the nurses have to render their duties to multiple departments every day. Hashmat Haveri, head of the nursing staff said, "Unfortunately, we are blamed if something goes wrong. We have to work under tremendous pressure and look after multiple patients at a time. We are the first to face the anger of relatives and patients. Therefore, we have demanded recruitment of 400 nursing staff immediately." The nurses sat on the hunger strike on rotation without skipping their duties. Haveri said that the nurses never compromised on the service and thereby patient care even after being overburdened. "We met the authorities and sought written assurance regarding fulfilment of our demands. The other demands are improving safety measures, granting the pending dues for extra work and granting pending leaves. The authorities have agreed to do so and address our concerns within a month, hence we have called off the hunger strike," said Haveri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cpr-hospital-nurses-sit-on-one-day-hunger-strike/articleshow/87633355.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal: Following Lord Ram’s conduct is true Hindutva||NEW DELHI: Taking on critics who accuse him of adopting a ‘soft Hindutva’ approach to woo Hindu votes with acts such as public pujas, Ayodhya visits and recitation of Hanuman Chalisa on national TV, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Hindutva meant following the conduct, promises and life of Lord Ram, not communal riots, social media trolling or atrocities against Dalits. Speaking on a range of issues, including the national ambitions of Aam Aadmi Party, at Times Now Summit 2021 on Wednesday, Kejriwal said, “If visiting temples or celebrating Diwali is soft Hindutva, then crores of people in this country are indulging in soft Hindutva too.” He noted how he was attacked by BJP and Congress when he went to Ayodhya and chanted Hanuman Chalisa. “Connecting 130 crore people of the country is Hindutva, not dividing them. Hindutva connects, doesn’t divide,” the CM asserted. The AAP leader said his party would present the Delhi model of quality education, good hospitals and healthcare and free electricity to other states. Commenting on AAP’s intention to fight the elections in Goa, Kejriwal said, “The people there want this governance model.” He also announced that AAP would contest all 402 assembly seats in UP. Taking a dig at Congress over the infighting in the party’s Punjab unit, Kejriwal said the state was grappling with big problems, but the ruling party was busy with internecine conflicts. “People are disappointed with Akali Dal and people do not believe that Congress infighting will stop. They connect with Delhi and want AAP’s government in Punjab,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal rejected outright the rumours that he would become the CM of Punjab if AAP formed the government there. Saying AAP would announce its Punjab CM face before the assembly polls, he said, “I will not become Punjab CM. I am Delhi’s son. I will never break the trust Delhiites have in me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-following-lord-rams-conduct-is-true-hindutva/articleshow/87635164.cms||AlokKNMishra

The development assumes significance amid BJP amplifying its developmental narrative, especially in the once socio-economically impoverished east UP region, ahead of UP assembly elections. Confirming the development, CEO, UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), Avanish Awasthi, said the state government has identified areas that can be developed as industrial hot spots. “We will start the process of developing them from December,” he told TOI. Awasthi said, the expressway itself has been completed in 36 months, which is a “record” for any project of such a magnitude, despite restrictions posed by Covid-19 pandemic. The state government started the Rs 22,497crore project in October 2018. “Just a few patches on the expressway have been affected by waterlogging because of heavy rains,” he said. The Purvanchal expressway, which will be linked to Yamuna expressway (connecting Agra with Delhi) via Lucknow-Agra expressway, will complete the economic lifeline to boost development in Uttar Pradesh, said Awasthi. Industrial areas which will be part of Purvanchal Expressway Industrial Corridor (PEIC) will comprise 12 districts, including eight districts of Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh and Mau through which the expressway will cut through before culminating in Ghazipur. The other four districts which will come in the ambit of the PEIC include CM Yogi Adityanath political backyard of Gorakhpur, Jaunpur (neighbouring PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi), Ballia and Sant Kabir Nagar. In all, 21 sites with a combined area of 9,171 hectares have been identified for being developed as part of PEIC. While two sites each have been identified in Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, Ambedkarnagar, one site each is proposed to be developed as industrial area in Mau, Ayodhya and Ballia. The biggest industrial land parcel of 1,234 hectares has been identified in Ghazipur, followed by 949 hectares in Gorakhpur. Amethi represented by Union minister Smriti Irani will witness an industrial area coming up in an area of 855 hectares, while in Azamgarh, the parliamentary seat of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, the state government has identified 854 hectares under PEIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/purvanchal-e-way-industrial-rollout-after-pm-green-signal/articleshow/87635842.cms||Pankaj Shah

At first, Delhi Jal Board ran nine boats on the river's surface to clear the layer of froth, said an official. Workers on the boats tried to push away the white foam, which did not provide the required results. Later in the day, the irrigation and flood department of Delhi government put up barricades made out of bamboo in the water, along with green trampoline nets, to stop the froth from coming near the bank. “We have been given directions to put up the barricades to stop the froth from reaching near the bank on a stretch of around 400 metres. This kind of froth is a regular thing, I do not understand why is it making so much news this time,” said an official from the flood and irrigation department at Kalindi Kunj. The government had also deployed officials along with Delhi Police at Kalindi Kunj who were seen directing many devotees to go towards the Uttar Pradesh side of the river bank to celebrate the Puja as it is not allowed in the capital. On the other UP side, a huge crowd was seen at the Yamuna Ghat, with the administration making arrangements of tents, lighting and chairs for the devotees. Several reports early on Wednesday said that workers also sprayed water over the froth to dissipate it, but there was no such activity going on when this reporter visited the area during the day. For the last two days a thick layer of froth on Yamuna river has been observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barricades-at-yamuna-to-keep-toxic-froth-away/articleshow/87635178.cms||---

The decision to oppose the road widening was taken on Sunday during a meeting called by the 35 families who stand to be affected. These families are located between the police station and town border, which is a 500m stretch. “We will not allow work to commence. This is a residential area. Some old houses are touching the road. The government has neither acquired our land nor has it taken us into confidence,” resident Clive Colaco said. The widening work of the 4-km long road commenced earlier this month and is expected to be completed within six months. There is no issue with the work except along the 500-mt stretch. Kavlekar had said that the 500m stretch will be widened by 1.5m on either side since all residents had given their approval for the project. “I have a horticulture shop in my ancestral house and since the road is touching my house, my shop has to be demolished even if I give 1.5m for road widening. How can PWD issued the tender and commence work without land acquisition?” Vallabh Prabhudessai, a resident, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-locals-protest-road-widening-for-4-lane-project/articleshow/87635167.cms||---

Colva sarpanch Johnson Coelho informed that in October, he wrote to the tourism official about “the nuisance being created for tourists by hawkers” and urged him to initiate action. “Massages, tattoos, bracelets, tricklets, beach wear, wrap around towels, photography, etc, are all being carried out migrants on commercial basis on the beaches,” said the sarpanch. Colva police inspector Tukaram Chavan said police are already present on the beach stretch in his jurisdiction, and added that he will now seek directions from his superiors on how to go about tackling the hawker nuisance. Despite being prevalent on the beach stretches for decades, authorities have failed to tackle the hawkers. Even tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar had said that there would be a crack down on anyone who creates nuisance to tourists on the beaches. In 2019, Benaulim villagers had adopted a resolution to stop hawking on the beach stretch. They had decided to form committees of villagers to rid their beach of hawkers. The committees worked for some days, after which the hawkers were back in action. Police constables who patrol the beach disclose that if they stop the hawkers at one spot, they quickly move to another place. “We do not have much personnel to continuously patrol the entire beach stretch in the Colva police jurisdictio,” said one policeman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-dept-urges-police-to-step-up-efforts-against-hawkers/articleshow/87635182.cms||---

A team of environmental science department led by head of department Asawari Jadhav collected the data of noise levels at 22 locations — four in silent zone, six in residential zone, ten in commercial zone and two in industrial zone. The maximum limit of decibel fixed for each zone by Central Pollution Control Board is — 40, 45, 55 and 70, respectively. The team collected the data on noise levels at night and in early morning hours, when firecrackers are burst. According to the findings, except for two industrial locations (Udyam Nagar and Y P Powar Nagar), the decibel levels remained much higher than the permitted levels at 20 locations in the city. Also, the noise levels in residential and commercial zones surpassed the levels recorded last year. For instance Papachi Tickti, a location from commercial zone which recorded 68.78 dB last Diwali, recorded 72.78 dB this Diwali. The noise level at Papachi Tickti recorded was highest in the city. The locality is a major trading place located in the vicinity of Mahalaxmi temple and famous Kolhapuri Chhapal Lane. Jadhav said, “Last year, due to the Covid situation, there was a check on the celebrations. This time, there was no check and the markets were abuzz. Also, this time, Lakshmi Pujan and Narak Chaturdashi fell on the same day and therefore the crackers were burnt in large numbers on the same day.” Among residential areas, Shivaji Peth location recorded highest 66.01 dB noise level. In 2020, the noise levels here were 58.68 decibels, while in 2019, it was 55.56 decibels. It is one of the old city areas. The relatives, who usually work in Mumbai and Pune, arrived in Kolhapur this year to celebrate the festival with near and dear ones. Interestingly in silent zones, the noise levels this time went down in comparison to last year's Diwali. The locations from silent zones where the noise levels measured are- CPR Hospital, Collectors Office, District Court and Shivaji University. Last year, decibel recorded at Collectors Office was 56.37 dB, which came down to 56.26 dB this year. Shivaji University recorded least noise level of 49.71 dB in the city, though it was higher than the permissible limit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/diwali-crackers-break-noise-norms-louder-than-2019-too/articleshow/87633379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Landge, the Pune police had arrested Nemooye on August 18, 2018, from Delhi for cheating a city-based man by promising him foreign currency at a cheaper rate. “A a local court sentenced him to three years in jail. He was released in September after he completed his jail term,” said Landge. Nemooye told TOI, “When I came out of the prison, there were no flights to Nigeria. I was placed under restrictive orders and my passport had lapsed. I cannot move out of the police station. I sleep, eat and drink in the police station. The authorities of both countries should help me.” Nemooye said he came to India on a business visa from Nigeria. “I landed in Delhi and met my countrymates there. I wanted to do garment business,” he said. “I was staying in Delhi when suddenly the police from Pune came and arrested me. My friends managed to run away,” he said. “My family members are poor and cannot arrange for my air tickets. My friends are collecting money to buy a ticket for me,” he said. A senior officer with the Special Branch said, “We have written to the Nigerian high commission. However, they are yet to process the ETC and his passport.” When asked if more such foreigners were staying at police city stations with restrictive orders, the SB officer said, “As of now, he is the only one”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nigerian-lives-in-police-station-after-3-yrs-in-jail/articleshow/87613845.cms||---

The scooter might have been trailing behind the bus too close, leading to the accident, the police said, adding that the exact cause of the accident is being probed. Thumba sub inspector Ashok said that since the KSRTC bus driver did not seem to be at fault from prima facie evidence, they have not invoked any charges against him yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/father-5-yr-old-killed-as-scooter-rams-ksrtc-bus/articleshow/87613853.cms||---

If the proposal is approved, the civic body stands to lose a revenue of Rs1.25 crore. The civic administration claims that the rent is being waived because the facilities were kept closed during the lockdown. The proposal states that the rent waiver is for the six months from March-September 2020. While the proposal is tabled before the standing committee, a decision on it will be taken next week. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “We want some clarity on which contractors will get the waiver. Some operators were blacklisted and appear to have re-entered the contract with different names. These details must be explained.” “The move is not correct if a blanket waiver is given. Why should defaulters, who have not paid rents earlier, get this benefit? Even errant operators, who overcharged the public, should not. If they are all included in this scheme, it gives out a wrong message to society,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-rs-1-2cr-waiver-to-parking-contractors/articleshow/87613854.cms||---

All the furniture shops and godowns located in the area are made up of tin-sheets, including the unit that was gutted, Bhilare said. “The exact cause of the fire is still not known. The furniture and some cleaning and chemical polish added fuel to the fire. Further investigation is on,” Bhilare said, adding that fire officials ensured that the blaze did not reach several neighbouring shops. Bhilare said it was fortunate that the shop that was affected has open spaces on all four sides. “We covered the godown from all sides and sprayed water continuously.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Tihar Jail in ‘sorry’ state, says SC; pulls up MHA for not taking remedial action||NEW DELHI: Referring to the death of a Tihar Jail inmate under mysterious circumstances and also of reports of criminals operating from inside the prison, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said that a sorry state of affairs prevails in the “maximum security prison”, warranting immediate remedial action. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah pulled up the ministry of home affairs for not taking any action despite several recommendations made by Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Ashthana to improve the prison management. Asthana had conducted a probe and filed a report on the direction of the apex court after it was alleged that the Unitech Group’s erstwhile promoters, Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, had managed to run their business from inside the prison in connivance with jail officials. TimesViewIt is unfortunate that the court had to intervene in this matter. Convicts shouldn't be allowed to have a free run of jails. The Delhi Police should have been prompt in taking action; it's laxity is regrettable.“Necessary remedial steps shall be taken immediately and an action plan shall be drawn up which shall be placed before the court for implementing the suggestions and recommendations. This shall be complied with within a period of four weeks. A plan of action shall be submitted to this court, though the process of compliance shall not be delayed on that ground,” the court had directed the home ministry on October 6. As the court’s order was not complied with and no action plan was placed before it, the bench said that this was not acceptable and the governemnt should not wait for any other untoward incident to take action and ordered fresh direction to the government. Meanwhile, Delhi Police informed the bench that an FIR has been lodged against 37 persons, including the Chandra brothers, and jail officials who helped the siblings to carry out their operations from jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-jail-in-a-sorry-state-says-sc-pulls-up-mha-for-not-taking-remedial-action/articleshow/87635191.cms||---

---||Delhi||Plea against 7-year jail for Ansals: Reply sought from Delhi govt, victims’ group||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday sought response from the Delhi government and Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) on appeals filed by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal against an order by which they were convicted and sentenced to 7-year jail term for tampering with evidence in the Uphaar fire tragedy. Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil issued notice on the plea filed by the Ansal brothers. The court also sought a report from the medical superintendent of Tihar Jail after it was submitted that Gopal Ansal was suffering from certain ailments. During the hearing, the accused objected to the locus of AVUT. A magistrate court had on November 8 sentenced the Ansals to seven years in jail for tampering with evidence in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case, saying the circumstances during which the instant crime was committed show the deep disrespect which the convicts had for the law, judicial process and victims. The court had further said that the case was not only related to prosecution and AVUT but the sentencing in this case must also respond to the cry of the society. The court imposed a fine of over Rs 2.2 crore each on the Ansals. The court had also sentenced former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma, PP Batra and Anoop Singh to seven years of imprisonment in the case. It imposed a fine of Rs 3 lakh each on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-against-7-year-jail-for-ansals-reply-sought-from-delhi-govt-victims-group/articleshow/87635202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was no ordinary canine — it was the pet of an additional district judge (ADJ). And the accused, who was booked for reckless driving, was the wife of a provincial civil services officer. Police said, an FIR was lodged on a written complaint by the ADJ’s son, Neelesh, and investigations were underway. The incident took place near the Officer’s Colony, Sitapur. SHO, Kotwali, Tej Prakash Singh, said, Neelesh alleged in his complaint that the wife of an officer residing at Officer’s Colony deliberately ran her car over his pet, injuring it critically.

---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP targets AAP govt for ban on Chhath along Yamuna||NEW DELHI: BJP president for the state unit Adesh Gupta and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on Wednesday hit out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over pollution in the Yamuna and claimed that AAP government banned Chhath puja celebrations on Yamuna riverbanks to hide its failure to clean Yamuna. Though DDMA, chaired by the lieutenant governor, banned Chhath on riverbanks, the BJP functionaries said Kejriwal is responsible as he is a DDMA member. Gupta said AAP government blames Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for Yamuna’s pollution, but the sorry state of the river is due to AAP’s ineffective governance. “The Centre gave Delhi government Rs 2,418 crore about 5-6 years ago for setting up 13 STPs in the capital. But neither the STPs were installed, nor is there any word on where that amount has gone,” Gupta alleged. Tiwari said it was a wrong decision to ban Chhath Puja on Yamuna riverbanks. “For Chhath Puja, devotees do not litter the riverbanks or pollute the river. The government is stopping devotees from going to riverbanks so that the shortcomings of the government in cleaning Yamuna are not exposed,” said Tiwari. CM Arvind Kejriwal, who offered prayers at a Chhath ghat in Kidwai Nagar on Wednesday, said the this is not the time for politics and everyone irrespective of political allegiances should celebrate Chhath puja. “I pray for the wellbeing of everyone including my political rivals,” Kejriwal said when asked to reply to BJP’s charges. No reaction to the charges was available from AAP despite TOI’s attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-govt-for-ban-on-chhath-along-yamuna/articleshow/87635200.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 40 years after tying knot, couple in HC for certificate||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Thursday sought the Aam Aadmi Party government’s reply on a plea by a couple who married 40 years ago but are unable to get their marriage registered. The plea says that the software used to register marriages online is not accepting their application as they were underage at the time of their marriage in 1981. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the authorities and asked the sub-divisional magistrate of Alipur and district magistrate of North West Delhi to respond to the petition, which seeks to register the couple’s marriage. The high court gave the authorities two weeks’ time and listed the matter for hearing on December 23. The plea said the couple approached the SDM, Alipur for registering their marriage with all relevant documents, but it could not be done as the software did not accept their application for the reason that the man was below 21 years and the woman was below the age of 18 years, at the time of their marriage on May 28, 1981. The couple claimed that they fulfil all the conditions for registration of marriage as prescribed under the law as they have completed the age of 21 years at the time of registration and their marriage was conducted in May 1981 as per Hindu vedic rites and ceremonies. The petitioners added that since the date of their marriage, they are running their family life as husband and wife and have four children but the legal validity of getting their marriage registered has not happened yet. Their plea said the authorities had neither rectified the software nor registered the couple’s marriage so far by any other mode, which was unjust, arbitrary and illegal, being violative of their fundamental rights and non-compliance of the law. Even though they fulfil all the conditions for registration of marriage as prescribed in Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 as they have completed the age of 21 years at the time of registration and the marriage of the petitioners was conducted on May 28, 1981 as per Hindu Vedic rites and ceremonies, they have been unable to get the wedding registered, it complained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/40-yrs-after-tying-knot-couple-in-hc-for-certificate/articleshow/87654970.cms||---
---||Nagpur||With over 60 more votes, it’s advantage BJP in MLC polls||Nagpur: Even as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has made its intentions clear to fight the forthcoming MLC polls from Nagpur district, BJP seems to have an upper hand due to its greater representation in the local bodies. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) corporators, Zilla Parishad members, chairpersons of panchayat samitis, members of municipal councils and nominated members on all these local bodies in the district, can exercise their franchise in these elections to be held on December 10. The results would be declared on December 14. Of the over 600 such public representatives in Nagpur, a majority are from the saffron party. Top office-bearers from the party, including city BJP president Pravin Datke told TOI that they have an advantage of about 65 votes over combined strength of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents – Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. The MVA office-bearers too acknowledged this while speaking unofficially to TOI. Though the names of BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule and former chairman of NMC health committee Virendra Kukreja are doing the rounds, the BJP leadership is not yet revealing the contestant. Though the MVA constituents are keeping their cards to the chest, the name of former minister Rajendra Mulak is at the forefront. Leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, said that the name would be finalized by party’s headquarters in Delhi. “Our state election committee will meet soon to decide the contestant. We will then send the names to our parliamentary board in Delhi. The board would finalise the contestant in consultation with party president JP Nadda,” he said. Quoting sources, TOI had earlier reported that Bawankule, who is former state energy minister, would be a frontrunner for the post after being denied ticket during the 2019 assembly polls. District collector R Vimala, who is also the returning officer for MLC elections, has already enforced the ‘code of conduct’ in the district. Speaking with the media on Wednesday, she said the district administration has a list of 614 voters from Nagpur, which would be finalised by Thursday. “Out of 156 NMC corporators, 151 are elected and five are nominated ones, while one was disqualified for want of caste certificate. The Zilla Parishad has 58 members. The district has 20 municipal councils of which 15 are governed by the public representatives while the rest are under administrator. In these 15 local bodies, 336 voters are registered. Of them, 304 are elected and 32 are nominated,” she said. The collector said that no party or the government can launch any projects or lay foundation stone till the completion of the election process. “There would be no policy announcements and even the government vehicles would be withdrawn. There will be no transfer of the state employees,” she said. The administration would be appointing a special authority to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are strictly followed during the process. “We would also monitor the advertisements and messages,” said the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-over-60-more-votes-its-advantage-bjp-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87634322.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Jakhau drug haul: Alleged recipient denied discharge||Ahmedabad: A special NIA court has refused to discharge the suspected recipient of 330kg heroin off the Jakhau coast from a Pakistani boat in 2019, with the observation that the accused could not explain satisfactorily why he responded to the signal sent by Pakistani fishermen on a particular VHF channel and why his boat was drifting near the location of the Pakistani boat on the day of the alleged delivery of the contraband. The discharge application was filed by Ramjhan Palani, who was arrested on the charge that he was to receive the drug consignment from the Pakistani fishing boat, Al Madina, on May 26. However, as the Indian Coast Guard ship intercepted the Pakistani ship, its captain and five crew members threw 194 packets of heroin weighing 217.8kg into the water. The coast guard recovered seven bags and found 194 packets in them. A few days later, 17 more packets were found floating on the Kutch coast. The security agency recovered a total of 236.6kg of heroin in 211 packets. After arresting six Pakistani fishermen, the coast guard traced Palani to his boat, Fezane Kirmani, some 8-9 nautical miles away from the location of the Pakistani boat. He responded to the message sent from the Pakistani boat and was arrested on charges that the drug consignment was to be delivered to him. After their arrests, the investigation was taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). All seven accused are lodged in Palara Jail near Bhuj since then. Palani sought discharge claiming innocence and claimed that the probe agency did not find any evidence connecting him to the offence and he was wrongly arraigned in this case. Palani’s discharge plea was vehemently opposed by NIA’s special prosecutor, Amit Nair, who pointed out the evidence the investigators have gathered against Palani. After hearing the case, special judge Shubhada Baxi rejected Palani’s discharge plea and said that he could not give an explanation about his boat drifting near the Pakistani boat on the day of its interception. Moreover, he could not explain why his boat was drifting on the same location on May 16 and 17, 2019, when the Pakistani boat made its first trip. He also could not explain why he responded to VHF channel No. 8 instead of VHF channel No. 16, which is earmarked for communication with fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jakhau-drug-haul-alleged-recipient-denied-discharge/articleshow/87634314.cms||---

In a trend that has stayed consistent for the last couple of months, the tally (1,094) is higher on a Wednesday than on the previous weekdays. In Mumbai, where cases have been below 300 since November 4, the tally on Wednesday was 339. However, the number of tests was also higher (38,661) than in the last couple of days. “The daily positivity rate is still below 0.9%,’’ said a civic official. At the state level, 11 districts, including Pune, Sindhudurg, Amravati, Palghar and Parbhani, are a matter of concern as they have a weekly positivity rate higher than the state average of 1.4%. The number of active cases (12,410) continues to drop across the state, and only five districts — Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Ahmednagar and Raigad — account for 80% of the cases. Twenty-two districts have less than 100 active cases each, with Nandurbar at the lowest end with 1 active case and Ratnagiri the highest with 78. In Mumbai, the number of symptomatic patients is less than 1,000 (959). The BMC dashboard showed that 93% of the city’s 17,493 Covid beds are vacant and only 522 out of 7,921 oxygen-supported beds are in use. A senior official said with many experts stating a spurt in cases is likely in the next 15 days, the BMC doesn’t want to reduce the number of Covid beds now. There are 403 patients in the Covid ICU in the city. Covid’s average weekly growth rate in the city has dropped to 0.03%, with H West ward (Bandra) having the highest rate (0.06%) while R South (Kandivli) has the lowest at 0.02%. The doubling rate in the city has improved to 2,194 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wednesday-bump-in-covid-cases-in-state-mumbai-city/articleshow/87635888.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Not naming accused in FIR doesn’t discredit case’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and arson against four people in two separate northeast Delhi riots cases, saying FIR is not an encyclopedia but the beginning point of investigation and not naming accused in FIR does not discredit the case of the prosecution at all. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges against Suraj, Yogender Singh, Ajay and Gorav for the offences under sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC. They were charged for burning the shops of Javed Khan and Gulfam during the riots on February 25 last year. “On the basis of the contents of the chargesheet duly supported by the statement of the witnesses, it has come on record that riotous mob consisting of 100-150 people armed with lathis and danda and including the accused people had entered into the shop of the complainant Javed Khan and committed mischief and destruction by fire of the said shop by the unlawful assembly in prosecution of common object,” the court said earlier. It further said that the contention of the accused that witnesses cannot be believed or their statements as recorded late, hence cannot be relied upon, cannot be a basis for discharge as it is a matter of trial. “Moreover, the submissions that the police witnesses are not independent witnesses but interested for a ground of disregarding their statement, are without a legal basis,” it added. The court further said there was video footage showing Suraj and Yogender near the place of the incident. It noted that beat officers, who were deputed on duty on February 25, 2020, had also identified them as part of the rioters. It said that witnesses have also described the incident involving more than 100-200 rioters armed with rods and danda, and hence, there was a common object that can be ascribed to the accused people in committing the said offence of rioting and mischief. It added that “a public witness has specifically identified accused Ajay and Gorav as part of the riotous mob, which ransacked and burnt the shops of the complainants.” “Thus, on the basis of the material on record, I am of the opinion that there are grounds for presuming that the accused people namely Suraj, Yogender Singh, Ajay and Gorav have committed offences under sections 147,148, 427,436,188 IPC read with Section 149 IPC,” the judge said. The accused had claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-naming-accused-in-fir-doesnt-discredit-case/articleshow/87635206.cms||Usha Das
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Ex-MP DP Yadav acquitted in 1992 Ghaziabad MLA murder case||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday acquitted former Lok Sabha MP and UP strongman D P Yadav in the 1992 murder of BJP legislator from Ghaziabad, Mahendra Singh Bhati. The HC set aside the conviction order of a special CBI court and said there was no 'concrete evidence' against Yadav to establish guilt. The CBI court had in February 2015 sentenced Yadav, along with three others-- Parneet Bhati, Karan Yadav, and Pal Singh alias Lakkar Pala -- to life imprisonment. All four had subsequently appealed against the verdict. A division bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while setting aside the lower court's conviction of the former MP, reserved its judgment on the other three accused. Yadav was already out of jail on interim bail on health grounds. He had received several such bail extensions this year. Bhati was shot dead at the Dadri railway crossing in September 1992. He was once regarded as Yadav's mentor in the liquor business in the region. The murder case in the lower court was transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Dehradun in 2000 on the directions of the Supreme Court, which said Yadav's political influence in UP might hamper a fair trial. Meanwhile, Bhati’s family said that they will appeal in the Supreme Court against the verdict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-30-yrs-former-mp-dp-yadav-acquitted-in-mla-murder-case-by-uttarakhand-hc-for-lack-of-concrete-evidence/articleshow/87634312.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops keep lakes out of bounds as ponds, rooftops ease Chhath load||Kolkata: Natural water bodies, artificial ponds constructed in multiple neighbourhoods and swimming pools in housing complexes helped reduce the Chhath load on the Hooghly ghats on Wednesday evening. Still, police and civic staff struggled to ensure distancing and finally gave up as several lakh devotees descended on the river bank before sunset. Two large water bodies — Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarboar — that were declared off limits for Chhath rituals by the Calcutta High Court last year, remained undisturbed as devotees made no attempts to break through the police barricades as they had done in previous years. According to conservative estimates, the crowding at the ghats was down by nearly 30% against 2019 with many devotees opting to perform the rituals at alternative locations. In an attempt to attract Chhath devotees from the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt, state ministers Chandrima Bhattacharya and Aroop Biswas inaugurated a makeshift ghat at a waterbody in Patuli. Sources said the ghat was used by over 5,000 devotees. Similarly, large water bodies along EM Bypass, Ranikuthi, Behala, Cossipore and Dum Dum areas witnessed thousands of devotees performing the rituals. Artificially-created ponds in Tentultala ground off Panditiya Road, Ballygunge, Jhaldar math in Tollygunge, Deshapran Sashmal Road and at other locations in the Narkeldanga-Beliaghata belt also drew a fair share of devotees. Several hundreds more celebrated the festival in their housing complexes or on the roof of their homes. Residents of high-rises and standalone buildings that have a sizable Bihari population used the swimming pools to take the dip and offer prayers. Some also used inflatable tubs on terraces. “We are glad that a sizable population of our community respected our call and has refrained from heading to the river or lakes and also avoided congregation. The pandemic is still there and we didn’t want the celebrations to become a cause for mourning,” said Munna Singh, the president of Rashtriya Bihari Samaj. Environment activist Subhas Datta visited the Lake in the afternoon and expressed happiness over the measures taken by KMDA and police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-keep-lakes-out-of-bounds-as-ponds-rooftops-ease-chhath-load/articleshow/87634332.cms||---

With as many schemes in 13 revenue villages near Amer and Delhi Road falling under the ESZ, locals have been demanding lease deeds. However, at a meeting chaired by the district collector on Wednesday, where forest and JDA officials were also present, a decision was taken to issue lease deeds only after implementation of ESZ zonal master plan. The state forest department has declared 79.356 sqkm area as ESZ of Nahargarh (WLS) where several activities were prohibited. The central government had notified an area to an extent varying from 0 to 13km round the boundary of Nahargarh WLS as ESZ.Assistant conservator of forests Ghanzansar Ali Zaidi said, “The final notification to declare ESZ of Nahargarh WLS was released on March 11, 2019. Now, within two years, the state government had to prepare ESZ zonal master plan in consultation with all departments including environment and forest, urban development, tourism, municipal, revenue, agriculture and others.”Sources said the master plan shall not impose any restrictions on the approved existing land use, infrastructure and activities, unless so specified in this notification and the zonal master plan shall factor in improvement of all infrastructure and activities to be more efficient and eco-friendlier. With this, many new activities including hotel, farmhouses, resorts will not be allowed within a one-km area. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lease-deeds-in-nahargarh-eco-zone-only-after-zonal-master-plan-is-made/articleshow/87635872.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP MP celebrates Chhath at Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Keeping aside Covid-appropriate behaviour, scores of devotees thronged the Yamuna bank near ITO crossing on Wednesday to celebrate Chhath with fervour. Police and civil defence volunteers tried to disperse the crowd during the day, but the numbers of devotees swelled later in the evening. BJP MP Pravesh Verma also took part in the celebrations. At almost 10 metres away from the river bank, a large artificial pond was created where devotees performed rituals at sunset. CRPF was deployed at the bank near the site to keep a tight vigil. “The DDMA's guidelines are being followed at this site. No one is allowed to carry out puja in the river,” said a police officer. However, in Sonia Vihar, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta along with BJP MP Manoj Tiwari celebrated Chhath Puja at the river bank. Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri also celebrated the festival with the residents in his own constituency. “Efforts should have been made to clean the toxic froth from the river instead of banning devotees from entering the river. Kejriwal’s inefficiency and negligence stands exposed,” said Tiwari. Hitting back, Aam Aadmi Party’s national spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that BJP is disrupting the Chhath arrangements by Delhi government. “All arrangements for the Puja are being handled by Delhi government. Agitated BJP functionaries are trying to stifle the government’s efforts to disturb the festivities,” said Bhardwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-mp-celebrates-chhath-at-yamuna/articleshow/87635209.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Health workers’ additional strides behind Uttar Pradesh’s vaccination milestone||LUCKNOW: While UP is already on top when it comes to total number of doses administered, it became the only state in the country to have more than 10 crore partially vaccinated people on Wednesday. As per data from the Cowin portal, the total number of partially vaccinated persons in UP reached 10.01 crore till 6 pm. A key factor in UP’s effort to boost Covid-19 vaccination is unmatched commitment of those in the field, especially in farflung areas of the state.  Meet Archana and Karishma, the ANMs posted in Mahasi village under the Tambaur Community Health Centre of Sitapur district. The two courageous frontline workers undertook extensive awareness drives in households allotted to them. They also worked hard to ensure that all kinds of myths and rumours around vaccination were quelled. “They remained committed to their work despite unfavourable conditions including flood in surrounding villages. On one sunny day, with floodwater at the feet, both ANMs collected the vaccine vials from Sirsira primary health center, went to Mahasi village and vaccinated around 40 people in the 45 plus category,” recalled Dr Sanjay Kumar, medical officer in-charge at CHC Tambaur. Block community process manager, Poonam Verma was pleasantly surprised by the exemplary zeal displayed by the two women. “When we asked them why they risked their life in the flooded area, they told us that no one is safe till every eligible one is vaccinated,” she said. The sentiment is shared by people across various levels. In Mirpur, a backward block in UP’s farthest district Sonbhadra, acquiring Covid-19 infection from the vaccine was the biggest fear of many in about 100 villages. The locals were so scared that they ran away upon seeing health workers approaching. Medical officer Dr Shishir Srivastava was quick to realise that an intensified campaign to dispel misinformation was needed. But considering the terrain of the region, available resources were not enough. Accordingly, he mobilised the support of companies in Renukoot to organise localised awareness activities such as street plays, puppet shows, munadi, miking besides holding meetings with men, women and community to bust the myths. The efforts translated into a six-fold increase in the number of vaccinations. In all, 47 sessions of vaccination were held in which 8,497 persons were inoculated. Health officials said that the two cases exemplify the kind of effort which is being put in to make UP achieve milestones one after another. “Everything is in place when it comes to the vaccination campaign in UP. The right strategy, a trained and motivated workforce, leadership, monitoring and feedback mechanism and proper coordination between all stakeholders,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef UP and member, UP State Task Force on Covid-19 vaccination. With eyes set on boosting the second dose coverage, the state health department is on a mission to re-energise the workforce. “The team has worked against all odds over the past few months. The focus is now being shifted to the second dose coverage for which the ‘har ghar dastak’ campaign has been launched ” said Dr Manoj Shukla, general manager, immunisation, National Health Mission, UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/health-workers-additional-strides-behind-ups-vaccination-milestone/articleshow/87635877.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Olympian’s help held for theft, cops find LED TV, modular kitchen at her home||KOLKATA: A domestic help employed at the New Town home of Olympian Joydeep Karmakar was arrested for stealing more than Rs 3.5 lakh from his home as cops probing into the case found a 43-inch LED TV, a king-size hydraulic bed and a modular kitchen at her shanty in a New Town slum and close to Rs 1 lakh in her bank account, which she allegedly confessed to have stolen from the 41-year-old Olympics shooter’s bedroom. Considered a trusted maid who “cooks and speaks very well” for the last four years, Mumtaz Bibi (33) was caught stealing Rs 18,000 from Karmakar’s sons’ piggy bank last year but the shooter hadn’t lodged a complaint then and had opted for giving the woman a second chance. However, when he realised a large sum of cash was missing from his home again, he lodged a police complaint this time. “When we grilled the woman, she initially denied but later confessed to having stolen a small sum of money from his wallet. But when we visited her shanty near Eco Park, we found, although it was shabby from outside, the interiors all decked up with a large LED TV, a king-sized modern storage bed and a modular kitchen. We checked her bank account and found Rs 93,000 in it, deposited in the last few months,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops said they will be freezing the account and are checking if she had bought anything else with the stolen money. According to Karmakar, the woman was possibly stealing the money over a period of four months but the theft came to light only on Monday night when he was looking for some cash to buy some machines for his shooting academy. “I found the bags lighter and at least Rs 3.5 lakh was missing. We had no one else to suspect other than the domestic help. So I called up the police commissioner for his suggestion. The commissioner immediately asked me to lodge a complaint at Eco Park police station,” said Karmakar. Karmakar added the woman initially confessed to have stolen Rs 30,000 from my wallet. But later on, she confessed before the cops to having stolen at least three times in the last four months. “But I guess she must have stolen at least six times since August. But she was so neat in her work and used to keep the keys and the money packets in the same positions that we didn’t doubt her,” he said. During Durga Puja last year, they had found Rs 18,000 saved by his teenage sons to buy a guitar and some other stuff stolen. “She was the only outsider who used to frequent our home. When we questioned her, she finally confessed but had begged before us not to lodge a police complaint. She had also agreed to repay us the stolen amount by deducting Rs 1,000 from her salary of Rs 6,500 every month. She was a good cook and seemed like a nice woman. So we gave her a chance but it is unfortunate that this is how she reciprocated,” Karmakar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/olympians-help-held-for-theft-cops-find-led-tv-modular-kitchen-at-her-home/articleshow/87634378.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ahmedabad||Harassment victim is severely depressed||Ahmedabad: Cybercrime police had to rope in a counsellor as the woman harassed by deputy collector Mayank Patel — who allegedly sent obscene pictures of her to her ten-year-old son — is in a severe state of depression. She lodged a complaint only after Patel sent these images to her son. Cybercrime police said they have a special team for counselling such victims, who are depressed after such offences. Officials said the special counselling team has been trained by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore. The officer said that Patel had sent obscene photographs of the victim to her son and later deleted them. The officials said that when Patel tried to pressure the victim by involving her son, she approached cybercrime police. The cops said Patel had also sent obscene photographs to the victim’s husband and her father-in-law but when she did not react at the time. Cops said they have found the laptop and mobile phones used by Patel and have also got digital evidence to prove that the complaint has substance. Cybercrime police had on Monday arrested Patel, a deputy collector working at Modasa town in Arvalli district, for allegedly harassing the woman, a Class 2 government officer, over a long period of time with sexual remarks, threats and sending obscene pictures to her family members. Patel met the complainant first in 2016 during a state government event and they later met off and on for work purposes. When they met, Patel was a deputy mamlatdar in Nadiad and was preparing for the deputy collector’s exam. Patel threatened to slander the complainant and even threatened to commit suicide after killing her family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/harassment-victim-is-severely-depressed/articleshow/87634381.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Inquiry ordered against cop for laxity in 17-year-old girl’s ‘murder case’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has initiated departmental inquiry against police for “maliciously” converting a case of suicide into that of culpable homicide amounting to murder and falsely implicating two men in a 2016 murder and sexual assault case involving a 17-year old girl. The court acquitted two men in the case, saying the prosecution has not been successful in building the case of murder and sexual assault against them. Additional sessions judge Nevjeet Budhiraja initiated an inquiry against the investigating officer, mother and friend of the deceased girl, senior scientific officer (biology) of FSL Rohini and the police officer who helmed the investigation at later stages for “malicious prosecution and false deposition”. “I would be failing in my duty if I chose to shut my eyes as regards to the gross misconduct on part of the investigating agency, which has acted maliciously by converting the case of suicide into that of culpable homicide amounting to murder and falsely implicating the accused people,” the judge said in an order passed on October 29. The court further said, “There is ample material in the form of delay in registration of FIR, tainted testimony of eyewitnesses, and medical and FSL reports being contrary to the version of all eyewitnesses, which suggest their involvement in setting up a false case against the accused.” It added that then in-charge of the case, failed to get the FIR registered at the earliest and later got registered the “concocted” FIR in “ connivance with the family members of the victim”. The court also said that the prosecution case has been found to “suffer from prevarications”. It said that when the in-charge of the investigation met the mother of the deceased after reaching the hospital, it was expected that the FIR about the commission of the offence was to be registered with promptitude at that time. However, that did not happen as… (investigating officer) claimed in his testimony that the mother was found to be in a depressive mood,” it noted. The FIR was registered the next morning.

---||Delhi||Postpone survey on learning gaps: Manish Sisodia to Centre||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has requested Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to postpone National Achievement Survey (NAS) scheduled on Friday. Arguing that the schools have just opened after 19 months and all children are yet to return, Sisodia wrote that holding such a survey won’t reflect the actual situation. NAS will be conducted in 733 districts of the 36 states and Union territories covering 1.3 lakh schools and 39 lakh students of classes III, V, VIII and X. It will measure learning gaps among children caused due to Covid-19 by testing them in key subjects. Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, wrote, “In Delhi, we reopened the schools till Class VIII only from November 1. Children have returned to school after a gap of 19 months. Moreover, for now, only 50% of the strength of students is being called, and in many private schools, the primary children have not even been called.” He added, “As per media reports, the situation is similar in other states... In this situation, the learning gap that the survey intends to collect will be far from the real situation.” With the students returning to school after a long gap, the focus should be on addressing their social, emotional and mental well-being, Sisodia said. The focus must be on getting all children back to school rather than “conducting a half-hearted survey and bring out a policy based on it”, he added. Holding the survey now will be a waste of time and money, the minister underlined. “If any policy is formulated... on the basis of the survey, its results will be even more damaging,” said Sisodia. However, sample schools have made the required preparation. At The Indian School, Class X students will be part of the survey. “They have asked for 30 students, so the batch that is coming to school on Friday will be part of it,” said principal Tania Joshi. Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Ambedkar Nagar’s Sector IV is also a sample institute for Class X. Aruna Anand, its principal, said, “I have called the entire Class X batch and the required 30 will be chosen from among them. Teachers will also be randomly selected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/postpone-survey-on-learning-gaps-sisodia-to-centre/articleshow/87655011.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Global Dreamshala to make 10k kids literate||Lucknow: Around 10,000 out-of-school children across the state will now achieve literacy. For a non-profit group DEVI Sansthan has collaborated with the SBI Foundation to provide education to such children under their Global Dreamshala Literacy project. The one-year project aims to impact around 10,000 kids by making them literate in Hindi at the foundational level. Under the project, 10,000 volunteers will be trained using a web app to teach literacy. The organisation will partner with schools across UP with focus in Lucknow to impart lessons. Each volunteer will have free access to the app and will adopt an illiterate learner. The volunteers will register their learner on the app and conduct a pre-test. They will then conduct daily 15-minute learning sessions with their learners using the course content in the app. On completion, the volunteer will conduct a post-test to confirm if the learner is able to read and write at grade 3 level. Citing figures CEO of DEVI Sansthan, Sunita Gandhi, said, “We want to tap into the idealism of the young students to be agents of change for literacy. Many children in our country have lost foundational literacy skills during the pandemic and are out of school. If every student adopts an illiterate learner, India can become fully literate in five years and not 50.” The Global Dreamshaala app has videos and interactive games that help learners pick up reading skills in a very short time and in an enjoyable way. “Students can find someone in their home or neighbourhood who is unable to read and get going. It could also be someone who works at their home. The learning is mostly self-lead by the learner. The volunteer has to be there as a facilitator and motivator,” Gandhi added. Expressing happiness on the collaboration, SBI Foundation’s managing director and CEO Manjula Kalayansundaram said, “We hope to improve literacy rates through the Global Dream Toolkit that has a comprehensive set of features to accelerate easy learning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/global-dreamshala-to-make-10k-kids-literate/articleshow/87635905.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petitioner, Haridwar-resident Ramesh Chandra Sharma, has alleged that Mahendra Giri-led Niranjani Akhara “illegally” sanctioned the construction of 30 rooms, warehouses, shops and storehouses in the temple premises. The constructions, according to the petitioner, make the area more landslide-prone.

---||Pune||Private buses in Maharashtra bring temporary relief to hassled commuters||PUNE: Private buses made their way to state transport (ST) depots and started ferrying passengers on Wednesday, giving temporary relief to the latter amid the ongoing Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) staffers’ strike. Private bus operators claimed that around 1,500 buses from Pune and close to 10,000 buses from across the state replaced the MSRTC fleet. Meanwhile, agitating employees took to the traditional ‘gondhal’ folk music to protest and vent their frustration. “It is a relief. I have been stuck in Pune for two days. I tried to go to Kolhapur on Monday, but fares were too high. On Wednesday, found private buses lined up at Swargate depot. Instead of Rs900, which I was asked for on Monday, I paid Rs450 — which is still high,” said Dayanand Phatke, a smalltime farmer. At the Swargate depot, several commuters were seen arguing with the transporters over fare. “I have to travel to Dombivali and usually pay between Rs150 and Rs200 on an MSRTC bus. Now, with only private buses from Pune to Thane, the charge is Rs600. I have been looking for cheaper fare for the last two hours,” said Pune resident Sundar Philip Rathore (65). Transporters refuted that in most cases, the fares were at par with MSRTC. “Different buses have been pressed into service, including luxury AC ones. Instructions have been given to us not to charge high fares, and we are following them. Fares of almost all buses are the same as their MSRTC counterparts,” said Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Goods and Passengers Transport Association. Senior MSRTC officials told TOI that they were helping private operators in all possible ways. “Space has been provided to them in depots and the fare chart of different routes and buses of MSRTC has been given to them. RTO officials are keeping an eye on overcharging. For now, private buses are plying on routes with a maximum distance of 250km, to destinations like Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Mumbai and more. Stress is on ensuring that the buses complete at least one or two trips to benefit more commuters,” said Dyaneshwar Ranavare, traffic manager of Pune MSRTC division. On Monday, RTO officials had also said the number of private buses at depots will be increased as per availability. Protesting employees, who chose to sing and dance at the depots for their agitation, said, “It is not good to see private buses plying from here. However, our demands are genuine. To save ourselves from any confrontation or frustration, we are singing and dancing,” one such employee told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-buses-bring-temporary-relief-to-hassled-commuters/articleshow/87634410.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Doctors using sonography to identify early complications in dengue||JAIPUR: Just like high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) played an instrumental role in diagnosing Covid or assessing the level of involvement of lungs, sonography, also known as ultrasound, an another diagnostic imaging technique, is now becoming a popular tool for doctors to identify early complications in dengue. Since dengue is causing more deaths this year, doctors are using sonography to find out if there is any fluid leakage in cavities around lungs and abdomen of patients and its effect on liver and other internal organs such as gallbladder wall thickening. On the basis of the amount of leakage of fluids, doctors are ascertaining the severity of dengue. “Utrasound findings can be detected in early and milder form of dengue fever including gallbladder wall thickening, peri gallbladder edema, minimal ascites (plasma leakage in abdomen cavity), pleural effusion (plasma leakage in cavity around lungs) and hepato-splenomegaly,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, who has also made its mention in state’s dengue management protocol. Since sonogprahy provides just a corroborative finding and require other tests not only to diagnose dengue but also to identify its severity, doctors are using certain blood tests too. “We are using hematocrit test, dengue test and complete blood count along with sonography for diagnosing and for finding out the severity of dengue. Raised levels of hematocrit indicates capillary leak and sonography provides us real picture about the quantity of leakage from capillaries,” said Dr Mukesh Sarna, professor (medicine) at a private medical college in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-using-sonography-to-identify-complications-early/articleshow/87635901.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

NMC had recruited around 1,000 health employees on a temporary basis in February and March to provide treatment to Covid patients during the second wave. This includes ward boys, nurses, medical officers and other staffers. NMC had still retained these temporary health staff since July considering the expected third wave of Covid. Earlier, a third wave was projected in August and September, but the new cases continued to drop and there is no spike in cases yet.NMC officials said there has been a rise in the number of people being vaccinated and many people have already been infected. “Moreover, the infectivity of the virus has become mild and the positivity rate has also reduced below 0.5%. This is the reason the daily Covid cases have reduced significantly,” said the officials.As the new cases are continuously dropping in the city, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav has instructed the health officials not to give extensions to temporary Covid health staff after November 30. Considering the third wave of the pandemic, the NMC administration had conducted walk-in interviews to recruit various medical staffers on a temporary basis and selected 340 candidates for various posts. But NMC had put a hold on the appointments of all 340 candidates due to continuous drop in new cases and finally cancelled their recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-release-temporary-health-workers/articleshow/87632646.cms||Tushar Pawar

We strongly oppose this order and will soon launch an agitation against the government if the order is not withdrawn”.Deswal, who was the Lok Sabha candidate from Rohtak Seat for the JJP party in 2019 polls, also questioned the appointment of Rohtak’s MDU vice-chancellor Prof Rajbir Singh by challenging his educational qualification and Ph.d degree. “The scrutiny of education records of the vice-chancellor has revealed that he had obtained degrees through dubious means and by showing false experience certificates,” Deswal alleged.Producing the documents before the media, he said that the vice-chancellor had pursued a master degree (MA) in the year 2000, while surprisingly he had done his PhD in the year 1999.“Apart from this, the educational experience certificates used by him for his appointment as professor are also wrong and apparently fake,” he said.Giving an example of his teaching experience, the INSO president said that the VC had mentioned in the records that he had worked as a teacher in the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology (GJUST) in Hisar, holding classes of students of MA journalism and mass communication, but in reality, he was a government employee holding the post of DPRO in Haryana government during that time.“His teaching record has itself exposed his false claim as it is not possible for a government officer to simultaneously work as a teacher in a university. Significantly, Rajbir Singh himself was holding a MA degree in journalism and mass communication when he was teaching the students in the GJUST”, Deswal stated. The INSO national president alleged that educational qualifications and degree of Rajbir Singh seemed to have been obtained in a dubious and doubtful way.“If such ineligible persons continue to hold such posts, then education and educational institutions are bound suffer,” he maintained.Asking the state government to institute an inquiry about the vice chancellor and remove him from the post, the INSO leader said the chief minister should immediately intervene in the matter. However, MDU VC Prof Rajbir Singh could not be contacted as his office staff maintained that he was out of station and busy in meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jjp-students-wing-questions-hry-govt-over-recruitment-in-varsities/articleshow/87635254.cms||---

The investigation was launched on Tuesday after the deputy superintendent of police, CB-CID (incharge) Muralidharan issued an order on Monday to a team headed by inspector Palraj to probe into the issue. Chief minister M K Stalin had earlier forwarded a petition that he had received in this regard from an activist to director general of police (CB-CID) Mohammed Shakeel Akhtar to look into the issue. The DGP had subsequently forwarded the petition to the district CB-CID. Talking to TOI, activist A Radhakrishnan, who petitioned Stalin, said the illegal red sand and stone mining had been happening on more than 60 acres land that falls under the limits of Salem main and west tahsildar offices for the past several years. “Illegal mining is also happening in several other places, including Mettur, Vazhapadi, Attur and Yercaud, in the district.” The activist said he had visited the affected areas on October 31 after the residents raised the issue with him. “A few people have obtained licence from the Tamil Nadu Geology and Mines Department and they have been misusing the same to carry out mining activities in areas where such activities are not permitted. There are also several others who are mining red sand and stones without obtaining licence from the department.” He said the illegal miners were enjoying the support of bureaucrats and elected representatives. “Why haven’t the mining department and revenue department officials taken any action against them for many years?” When contacted, the DGP (CB-CID) refused to comment on this issue and said a probe in this connection was already on. L Nirmal Raj, director, Tamil Nadu Geology and Mining Department, said he had directed the officials in the district to initiate an inquiry. “I have constituted a team to gather details about the minerals mined from the area. Strict action will be initiated against the people, who are found guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/cb-cid-initiates-inquiry-into-illegal-sand-mining-in-salem/articleshow/87635256.cms||---

Shinde had some days ago claimed to have received a threatening letter from the Maoists, vowing to eliminate him to avenge the relentless deaths of their cadres and also some of the key leaders. The threat was issued through a letter allegedly sent by Bhamragarh area committee. The case is now under investigation by Thane city police. Clarifying their stand, Maoists’ western regional bureau spokesperson Shrinivas has stated through the press communication that the minister has resorted to the claims of threat for publicity. Hitting out at the minister and Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the Maoists claimed the leaders are merely ‘brokers’ of the mining company which is facing tumultuous mass protests at Surjagarh. The Maoists also claimed that leaders like Shinde and his cabinet colleague Vijay Wadettiwar cannot face the masses now for opposing the move of the masses, who have now taken a stand against mining in the district. A senior police official from Thane city police said on condition of anonymity that the investigation is presently underway, and is with the anti-extortion cell of Thane crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoists-deny-issuing-threats-to-guardian-minister-shinde/articleshow/87634429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Nearly 250 employees of erstwhile gram panchayats in these villages have not been given a paycheck for the last five months, and have even been denied their special Diwali bonus right now. These staffers were to be absorbed into various civic services and get the status of PMC employees. However, civic officials claim the payments are delayed due to legal issues. Requesting anonymity, a senior PMC official told TOI, “After the merger, some cases of illegal appointment of staff members surfaced, leading to inquiries and criminal investigations. The issue is still pending with the courts. Unless it is resolved, PMC will not be able to rope in new staff members and disburse their salaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-salary-for-workers-after-merger-in-pmc/articleshow/87634421.cms||---

The portable testing kits will enable village women to check whether the water is fit for drinking or not. The aim of the scheme is to reduce health hazards due to unsafe water. In every village, five women will get training on how to use the testing kits to ensure only safe water is consumed. The FTK gives an indicative result but is very important to ascertain whether a water supplier is providing safe water or treated water. “The testing of water is to be done by five persons, preferably women from every village. They will undergo special training to use the kits,” said a government official. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Wednesday the programme will help check spread of diseases through contaminated water. “It will empower women to take care of family,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/field-testing-kits-distributed-in-villages-to-check-water-quality/articleshow/87635906.cms||---

This section is part of the fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor. Officials said they would speed up work on the remainder of the civil work at these stations — RTO, Pune Station, Ruby Hall, Bund Garden, Yerawada, Kalyaninagar and Ramwadi. A total of 140 pier arms have been installed for these stations. MahaMetro officials further said traffic congestion along this section will abate now that the pier arms have been installed. “The station work is divided in two parts. The initial stage includes construction of piers, pier arms and launch of pier arm caps. This work requires space so traffic blockages or re-routing of traffic was proposed to assist the work. But now these works are almost over,” an official said. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “The road closures are being done during the night hours as per the requirements, mainly to unload heavy material or launch segments. The work of seven stations on Civil Court-Ramwadi routes, construction of piers and launch of segments have seen significant progress in the past few months.” Sonawane said the Metro station at Pune railway station has been designed in such a way to allow movement of Metro and railway passengers between the two facilities. According to MahaMetro, about 90% of the pillars and 70% segments on the route are now ready. The remaining work is expected to get over in the next few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/work-speeds-up-at-seven-elevated-metro-stations/articleshow/87634428.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nawab Malik's charges a ‘nawabi’ low in politics, says BJP MLA Ashish Shelar||MUMBAI: BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Wednesday hit out at NCP minister Nawab Malik over the allegations he made against opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. “Malik has made bogus allegations against Devendra Fadnavis. By dropping names and making claims of an international racket, calls from abroad and extortion, he tried to create a false narrative, but his attempts have failed. Malik had said he would detonate a hydrogen bomb, but it was a fused firecracker that did not burst. Forget hydrogen, I think Malik might need oxygen,” Shelar said. At a presser, Shelar said all appointments made by the Fadnavis-led government were legal and none of those appointed had any criminal cases against them. “Malik has taken the names of Haider Azam, Imran Alam Shaikh, younger brother of Haji Arfaz Shaikh, and Munna Yadav. None of them had any criminal cases. Munna Yadav had political cases against him, and he will speak out about it himself soon. The MVA government has been in power for two years but could not register any case against these people. Malik spoke about Riyaz Bhati too. There is no connection of Riyaz Bhati and the Prime Minister or PMO,” Shelar said. Mumbai drugs case: Nawab Malik alleges links between Devendra Fadnavis, criminalsShelar showed photos of Riyaz Bhati with Congress and NCP leaders like Prithviraj Chavan, Ajit Pawar and with CM Uddhav Thackeray. “We don’t want to show photos and defame senior leaders. Taking names, showing photos of senior leaders and creating a sensation is not the tradition of our party. But see the photos and ask yourself who is seen with whom. It looks like Nawab Malik has lost his mental balance. He has stooped to the lowest level in politics. We can now say that this new low in politics can be called a ‘Nawabi low’”, Shelar said. Shelar alleged that it was the MVA government that was protecting Bhati. “Malik said Bhati is absconding, but it seems the MVA government has taken him to a safe place and is protecting him. Some top leaders of MVA had even given him protection in cricket politics. Malik has been dragging names of all minority community members and leaders. He dragged the name of Shah Rukh Khan and Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh of Congress. He is also dragging in other upcoming leaders of the minority community. It seems Malik wants to target leaders from the minority community,” Shelar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maliks-charges-a-nawabi-low-in-politics-bjp-mla/articleshow/87635917.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

They said that parts of the structure, made of stone and lime, break off and fall at regular intervals. A senior Archaeological Survey of India official told TOI, “We have received a report in this regard from the locals. Our team is going to inspect the fallen structure. Based on our findings, we will carry out the necessary work at the site.” On the closure of the fort, the official said, “We have yet to take a decison on it. We will decide once we complete the inspection.” Around 1,000 visitors visit the fort, located close to the Lonavala hill station, daily. Maximum tourists come from Pune and Mumbai. Shivaji Maharaj had captured the fort for the first time in 1648 from the Mughals. The fort is one of the favourite destinations of trekkers and visitors due to its picturesque location and historical importance. Another famous fort is situated opposite to it. Nagesh Margale, sarpanch, Lohgad village, said, “Some portions of the security wall of the steps have become weak. Stones fall at some locations. A big stone has fallen on the passage near the main door of the fort. Moreover, stones of Ganesh Darwaja have fallen already. The wall of the Lakshmikothi has become weak. The Archaeological Survey of India needs to carry out the work at the earliest considering the increasing footfall of tourists after the reopening of the fort last month.” A section of the villagers said that there are seven security guards at the fort. “However, they are unable to control the crowd on the fort. Many tourists click selfies, photos, and shoot videos. One cannot rule out accidents. So, appointing more guards is necessary at the fort,” said Santosh Margale, another villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/concerned-residents-seek-repair-of-ganesh-darwaja-at-lohagad-fort/articleshow/87634444.cms||Sandip Dighe

The initiative, which started last month, is aimed at bringing citizens together to beautify the city. Participating in this campaign, volunteers, in collaboration with Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative, are removing posters and repainting the pillars of the flyover every Sunday for three hours in the morning. Wing Commander Puneet Sharma, founder, Swachh Pune Swachh Bharat, said, “We are taking the help of workers of Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative to apply base paint on all the 26 pillars of the Magarpatta flyover. Along with our volunteers, we are also requesting creative and artistically-inclined citizens to make the pillars their canvas. Even those who do not have any experience in painting are welcome to join us.” He said, “Due to the pandemic, we have been able to paint only one to two pillars every Sunday. With local residents extending support, we hope to complete the project by the end of December this year.” Core committee member Sathya Narayan said, “We figured out that the best way to keep the pillars clean and discourage people from spitting is through beautification.” Anuja Yadav, member of the citizens’ group, said, “Whoever wants to join our team can follow our Facebook page and get regular updates. All materials such as paints and brushes are provided at the venue. All you have to bring is your skill, energy and enthusiasm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/magarpatta-flyover-gets-a-colourful-makeover-through-citizen-initiative/articleshow/87634438.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Sources in the industry department said most of the MoUs would be in petrochemical sectors, which is being pushed to leverage opportunities emerging out of the Rs 43,000 crore refinery project being developed by HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd, a joint venture of the state government HPCL. Minerals would be another sector where MoUs are also expected to be signed during the visit. The state industries department is reaching out to the global investors coming to Dubai expo and sign MoUs there in advance as part of the ‘Invest Rajasthan’ investors’ summit.It is not clear if the investors, who will sign MoUs, would be attending the two-day summit in Jaipur. A source in the industries department said, “Since Dubai is a hub for investors in the petrochemical sector, the state government has chosen the expo as the occasion to showcase the opportunities for possible investments and ink MoUs.”The delegation will spend close to a week in Dubai and will engage with the investors. The source said that while MoUs worth Rs 5,000 crore has been finalized, efforts are on to convince more companies to come on board. A senior official in the industries department had told TOI that they are wary of giving out the proposed investment figures as often it has been experienced that they don’t get materialized on the ground.“We know the figures make good headline but we are trying to be realistic on the outcome. That why, besides MoUs, we will also ensure that groundbreaking events of projects take place during the investors’ summit in January.” RIICO is setting up a petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) in the vicinity of the Pachpadra oil refinery project in Barmer district. The PCPIR has the potential to catalyse investments of about Rs 15,000 crore in industries like polypropylene, thermoplastic polymer, butadiene, benzene and toluene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/14-member-raj-team-will-visit-dubai-likely-to-ink-pacts-of-up-to-rs-10k-crore/articleshow/87635909.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid impacting mental well-being||Lucknow: Covid-19 not only impacted the physical health but also the mental well-being of people worldwide. Even after several months since the second Covid wave, many people are still experiencing anxiety, stress and other forms of psychological distress as a long term impact of the viral disease. This, the psychologists insist, is appearing in people with or without real time triggers as the subconscious mind has become a platform for deep-seated anxiety and stress. And while some of these patients have had a history of mental health issues, others are those who experienced psychological disturbance only during Covid, which is continuing even after recovery. “A woman (30) revisited us with anxiety. The husband and wife had contracted Covid earlier in April-May and their two children were looked after by relatives at that time, which caused the wife anxiety. Now, after several months she deems herself incapable of taking care of the family when her husband is getting transferred to a new place for work. She has gone through similar situations previously and Covid induced anxiety has re-triggered after a gap,” said KGMU psychiatry department faculty Dr Adarsh Tripathi. He added that such behaviours are recurring in people even without an identifiable trigger . As per counselling psychologist Dr Neha Anand, a large percentage of the population is going through some or the other form of Post Covid Stress Disorder (PCSD) against the previously known Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). “The pandemic has caused chemical imbalance in the four most important neurochemicals of our brain. Endorphin, which is released with exercise, was cut down when our lives became sedentary. Oxytocin which gives us happiness with purpose and meaningfulness in life was affected. Serotonin, the mood stabilizer, was impacted with no social interactions and dopamine which is also a mix of the three happiness quotients was disrupted,” said Dr Anand. “The uncertainty of the pandemic has taken a toll. We all don’t follow the same timeline for physiological manifestations of these psychological changes which is true for those who feel they don’t see a current trigger to their anxiety, mood, palpitations or unexplained headaches etc,” she said. Joint director, State Mental Health unit, Dr Sunil Pandey added, “Between March 2020 and July 2020, we counselled over 60,000 people around similar issues. And the situation is true for even those who did not get Covid themselves, but also children not going to school, elderly who were not moving out and the young facing unemployment during the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-impacting-mental-well-being/articleshow/87635914.cms||Yusra Husain

No casualty was reported in the incident, said fire department officials, adding that cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. According to officials, the fire broke out at around 11.50pm at Sai Shraddha Apartment. The first two floors of the building, including the ground floor, were being used for commercial purposes. The ground floor has two establishments — one footwear shop owned by Ram Ramesh Bhoyar and another eating joint owned by Krushikesh Patel. Fire might have started from the ground floor which engulfed the first floor and then damaged the residential flats on second and third floors, said officials. Bhoyar’s footwear shop was completely gutted and the loss was estimated to be around Rs15 lakh. The food joint too caught fire and the loss was pegged at Rs30,000. However, the firefighters succeeded in containing the fire. The blaze also caught the bakery on the first floor. Refrigerator, bakery equipment, oven, computer, laptops and raw material worth Rs25 lakh were gutted. Before the fire gutted household items inside the flats, fire personnel succeeded in controlling the blaze. The firefighters of NMC’s fire and emergency services department also attended three more fire calls, including at two houses near Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station on Hingna Road, near Sadar Azad Chowk and a decoration firm in Navi Shukrawari on Tuesday night. The first fire erupted due to leakage in gas cylinders, second due to electric fault and the third because of bursting of firecrackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fire-at-building-destroys-property-worth-rs40l/articleshow/87634450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Over 6,000 drivers fined for lane-cutting on Pune-Mumbai expressway||PUNE: The Pune unit of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) cracked down on unsafe driving on the Pune-Mumbai expressway during a three-month-long special drive. The drive, held from August to October, focused on enforcing lane discipline and punishing errant drivers on the 40km stretch between Kiwale and Amrutanjan bridge. During the drive, the HSP fined 6,255 heavy vehicles Rs1,000 each for lane-cutting and 69,000 motorists — mainly car and light commercial vehicle drivers — for speeding. Lane-cutting invites a fine of Rs500, but the HSP tacked on a charge of rash driving as the drivers often cut lanes without a signal. The extra charge attracts a fine of Rs500, HSP officials said. An official from Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which controls the expressway, said 55,000-60,000 vehicles use the expressway per day and that 55% of these are light motor vehicles. “The number of heavy vehicles fined for lane-cutting may appear small in the overall context of the number using the expressway each day, but these are often responsible for causing accidents or endangering the lives of other expressway users as they move from one lane to other without giving any signal or observing lane discipline,” Sanjay Jadhav, Pune HSP’s superintendent of police, said. Jadhav said it was not possible for the HSP to post personnel throughout the high-speed corridor but said there will be sustained action against errant drivers. Heavy vehicles are supposed to drive on the third — or left — lane of the expressway and cannot move to the middle or the first lane. However, drivers often flout this norm and cause traffic snarls and accidents. Following the special drive, HSP has stepped up monitoring by its mobile teams at Khandala and Wadgaon, and announcements are being made through the PA system at toll plazas, said Jadhav. Light motor vehicles and heavy vehicles are supposed to adhere to the speed limit of 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively. A violation attracts a fine of Rs1,000. “If lane discipline is not followed, it will invite accidents and traffic jams. We found that smaller vehicles, like cars and SUVs, change lanes on spotting heavy vehicles on the first or second lane. Sometimes, cars and SUVs even go onto the shoulder lanes to overtake heavy vehicles. This is not acceptable in any situation,” he said. “Shoulder lanes can be used by motorists only if the vehicle breaks down or in case of deflated tyres. Many accidents have occurred on shoulder lanes involving cars and SUVs as they crash into stationary vehicles while overtaking heavy vehicles which occupy all three lanes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-6000-drivers-fined-for-lane-cutting-on-eway/articleshow/87634443.cms||---

The six-yearly election has been announced as the tenure of sitting MLC Satej Patil is set to end. The code of conduct has come into effect and the voting will be taking place on December 10. The elected members of local bodies forms the electorate for legislative council's local body constituency. Patil is going to be candidate of the Mahavikas Aghadi. After winning the Gokul dairy election recently, the confidence of MVA leaders is high. However, BJP is unlikely to make the election a cake walk for Patil, though the numbers are currently on his side. As many as 406 members of the local bodies will be eligible to cast vote. Since most of the local bodies have MVA in power, Patil expects it to win easily. A senior BJP leader, whose name is under discussion to fight the election, said on the condition of anonymity, “We are meeting on Thursday to discuss and find suitable candidate for the election. It is for sure that the candidate will contest on BJP symbol unlike the last time when we had an independent candidate supported by BJP. A strong candidate, in all sense, will be pitted against Patil.” The names which are doing rounds for the election from BJP camp are state vice-president Suresh Halvankar, Shoumika Mahadik, district president of Mahila Morcha the BJP's women wing, Rahul Awade, son of sitting independent MLA of Ichalkaranji Prakash Awade and three time MLC Mahadevrao Mahadik, who was defeated in last election by Patil.

Bote’s office released a report stating paddy harvest covering over 34 hectares, held by 221 farmers, in seven villages near BhimaShankar in Ambegaon taluka was destroyed in the recent rains. “As per the state government policy, farmers can receive compensation if rainfall is over 65mm. In this case, Ambegaon has recorded 13.8mm rainfall. So, the farmers are not eligible for the state government compensation. The rainfall has not crossed the 65mm mark anywhere in the district. The maximum rainfall of 30mm occurred in Khed tehsil,” said Bote. Bote said only farmers who have subscribed to crop insurance will get compensation. “We have told the tehsil agriculture staff to find out how many farmers have subscribed to the crop insurance policy,” he added. Officials from the Ambegaon agriculture office said paddy growers do not subscribe to crop insurance policy. “We do not have the capital to invest in crop policy. The government should consider this and give us compensation,” said Shankar Langhi, a paddy grower from Ahupe village. “It was our annual crop. We do not know how we will manage throughout the year,” said Sachin Lembe, another grower from Malin village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/insured-farmers-to-get-compensation/articleshow/87634451.cms||Sandip Dighe

Dubbed the 'Nazir Hoosein Memorial Drive' after the founder member of the Indian Automotive Racing Club, the rally started from Greater Noida on November 8 and will be following the same route as the Himalayan Car Rally of the 1980s. The rally set off from Mussoorie for its next leg on Wednesday. Motorists were flagged off by Uttarakhand tourism minister, Satpal Maharaj, from Welcomhotel The Savoy at Gandhi Chowk. The last rally that the hill station had witnessed was in the early 1980s. “We are glad that this rally is back on track after 40 years. It will go a long way in promoting tourism in the state. Our government will extend all possible support to ensure that this rally is a regular feature,” Maharaj said. A few motorists who had been associated with the rally 40 years back and are also a part of the current drive nostalgically remembered the experience of being in Mussoorie. “I was here for the rally in 1981. Although I could not participate in it back then, I am here 40 years later to relive those memories,” remarked Harish Samtani, a motorist. “We at The Savoy are delighted to host the rally after 40 years. Savoy was a regular pit stop on the Himalayan car rally route and we hope that the rally will continue for years to come,” said Nikki Gupta, director of the hotel. Several older residents of the town also recalled with fondness the joy of seeing cars from across the country converging at The Savoy during the 80s. Paralympian Deepa Malik, a member of Women in Motorsport Commission of India, who is also participating in the drive, said, “I am participating in this drive to celebrate the legacy of the Himalayan rally that was organised here 40 years ago. I am also here to encourage women to explore career options in motorsports.” Motorists will be following the same route as that of the 1980s rally. They had their first stopover at Lansdowne on Monday, followed by a halt at The Savoy on Tuesday. They headed toward Kufri on Wednesday and on Thursday, will traverse the Jalorie Pass before stopping at Manali. Thereafter, they will cross over the Rohtang Pass before concluding the drive at Manali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/car-rally-passes-through-mussoorie-after-40-yrs-90-vehicles-flagged-off-by-ukhand-tourism-minister/articleshow/87634455.cms||Anmol Jain

The complainant is Dishant Patel, 25, a resident of Gota. His complaint was filed on Tuesday. Patel said he has been in contact with Soni for two years. Soni claimed that he organized tours and had an office in Naroda. Soni had sent some people from Patel’s village on a pilgrimage. Patel said that Ghyanshyam Patel, his cousin, is to be married on November 29 in Goa. Patel had asked Soni to book air tickets for a group from Ahmedabad to Goa. The payment of Rs 3 lakh was made in May for the bookings and in June Soni asked for another Rs 60,000 which Ghyanshyam paid. Patel said in June Soni told him that he was organizing a tour to Maldives and the charge was Rs 35,000 per person. Patel and eight of his friends booked spots in the tour and paid Rs 15,000 in advance. Soni assured them that the trip could be made anytime within a year. Patel said Rs 1.35 lakh was paid to Soni for 17 persons. But Soni never gave a receipt though Patel and his friends continually asked for it. Soni claimed that a couple he had sent to Goa were so satisfied with the organization of the holiday that they paid him Rs 6.03 lakh for the Maldives experience. When Soni finally gave Patel and his friends the tickets, they realized all the bookings were bogus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/baiting-with-beach-rs-13l-con-over-goa-maldives-trips/articleshow/87634453.cms||---

The Kovilpalayam police said the shop was run by V Sunitha, a resident of Ganapathy in the city. A police officer said Sunitha’s son Amarnath was an accused in a murder case that was reported at Gandhi Maa Nagar recently. “He was part of the gang that murdered K Ashok Kumar over a previous enmity last week. We suspect Kumar’s friends would have hurled the crude bomb at the shop to threaten his family members.” The officer said CCTV cameras in the area had captured the footage of two bike-borne men hurling the petrol bomb at the shop and speeding away. “A few clothes caught fire in the incident and the shop employees put out the fire immediately and alerted us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/petrol-bomb-hurled-at-textile-shop-probe-on/articleshow/87635270.cms||---

Patient had accidentally consumed acid and had his food pipe damaged badly. According to doctors at AIIMS, this is the first instance in the world where a complete robotic surgery was successfully done for damaged food pipe by acid intake. Due to precise robotic technique and control, the patient had less bleeding during surgery and less pain after surgery. He started being given food four days after the surgery and was discharged six days after the surgery. Doctors removed the damaged food pipe robotically and replaced it with a new food pipe created from the stomach, called as ‘Ivor-Lewis’ operation in medical terms. This complicated surgery was done by only four 8mm incisions at the department of surgical gastroenterology. Professor M K Garg, the medical superintendent of AIIMS, said that the person had consumed acid nine months back leading to damage of food pipe. “Due to this damage, he was unable to eat and was being fed through a tube inserted into abdomen,” Garg said. Commonly, the surgery for this condition is done by long incisions at neck, chest and abdomen which cause significant pain causing slow recovery from surgery and long unsightly scars after surgery. Garg said that the idea to do the case completely using a robot was made by the surgical team of the department of surgical gastroenterology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/robotic-surgery-helps-repair-food-pipe-at-aiims-jodhpur/articleshow/87635920.cms||---

This would be the sixth time that a woman has led the parade since the inception of the police academy. National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval would be the chief guest at the parade of 149 probationers, which includes 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees, SVPNPA director Atul Karwal told a press conference on Wednesday. Punjab cadre Dr Darpan Ahluwalia would be leading the parade as she was the overall topper of basic course phase-I training. In all, there were 27 women IPS officers and 4 women foreign officer trainees in the probationers’ batch of 2020. This batch would be sent to France as part of the training programme, Karwal said. SVPNPA authorities were also in talks with officials in the United States to enable training for IPS probationers there. Following the phase-I training and the passing-out parade, these probationers would be given charge of a police station for three months. Subsequently, they would return to the academy after the first-hand experience for phase-2 of training. This was the scheme of things till 2014 and the academy returned to this pattern again this year. From 2015-2020, the parade used to be held after probationers completed both phases of training. During their on field work at the academy, they were trained on AK-47, sniper shooting and rocket launchers. About 90% passed out as sharpshooters. Khaki in their family spurred them to dream:The khaki dream took wings for some of these IPS probationers at home itself.

An offence under nine different sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at Pundalik nagar police station against the suspects, including complainant Hirasingh Jadhav’s three relatives. Jadhav said that after being duped earlier this year in January, he made several rounds of the police station and met senior police officers, but in vain. “The retired police officer was compelled to move court for getting his FIR registered against the suspects as the police officers across the hierarchy in the city failed to take cognizance of his complaint,” Jadhav’s lawyer Prashant Nagargoje said. Police said that based on the directives of judicial magistrate first class DS Wamne issued on Monday, an offence against the suspects was registered. Jadhav in his complaint has stated that his land was acquired by National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) for ‘Nagpur Tuljapur’ national highway. Against this acquisition, he was awarded a sum of Rs 2.11 crore as compensation. According to Jadhav, his relatives had come to his N-4 based residence in January during which they obtained his signatures on some documents on the pretext of completing some procedure. Later the suspect relatives, which include a serving police constable, allegedly with the help of two advocates allegedly forged the documents including notary documents and used the same for withdrawing the money. The complaint has also made allegations against police officers for failing to register a criminal offence despite complainant taking a follow-up with the senior police officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/5-booked-for-usurping-retired-cops-rs-2-1cr-land-compensation/articleshow/87632694.cms||---
---||Pune||No takers for 81k minority pre-matric scholarships||Pune: Change in schools, migration and also benefit of other government scholarships has found few takers for the pre-matric scholarship scheme provided by the state directorate of adult and minority education. About 81,000 scholarships were not applied to by the students this year. An amount of less than Rs 500 is transferred directly to the beneficiary’s bank account once the student is eligible for the scholarship, but the change in school as a result of migration to native place has been the major cause for poor application. The adult and minorities education department has reported that nearly 81,695 beneficiaries have not opted for the scholarship this year. Director of the department, Dinkar Temkar, said, “Due to the pandemic and online schooling many students moved to their home towns. So, these students have changed their schools or their applications were not received.” The scholarship at pre-matric level has been introduced by the Union ministry of minority affairs to encourage parents from minority communities to send their school going children to school. The scheme will form the foundation for their educational attainment and provide a level playing field in the competitive employment arena. Empowerment through education, which is one of the objectives of this scheme, has the potential to lead to upliftment of the socio economic conditions of the minority communities. Temkar said, “Some schools are only till Std V or VIII, so to pursue further education students have to change their schools. Once they change schools, students tend to take advantage of some other scholarship scheme.” Scholarship is awarded to the students who have secured 50% marks in the previous final exam and annual income of from all sources does not exceed Rs 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-takers-for-81k-minority-pre-matric-scholarships/articleshow/87634470.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Passengers relieved as pvt buses ply on ST routes||Nagpur: As the strike by MSRTC employees across the state entered 14th day, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) on Wednesday operated private buses on several routes including Gondia, Bhandara, Katol, Amravati, Chandrapur, Wardha, Gadchiroli and other places. Total 350 buses ferried 10,000 passengers, as per officiating regional transport officer Ravindra Bhuyar. Amid heavy police bandobast, the RTO team led by motor vehicle inspector Anand Mohod resumed the bus service from outside the ST depot in Ganeshpeth, bringing relief to passengers, especially those travelling to rural areas and interior places from Nagpur. Initially, the RTO launched the operations from outside the Ganeshpeth depot. However, citing high court’s order not allowing private bus operation within the periphery of 200m from ST stand, the Nagpur city police led by senior PI (traffic) Hanmant Urlagondawar shifted the operations to nearby roads. The move caused some inconvenience to commuters who had to walk a longer distance to board a bus. Passengers welcomed the move to ply private buses on MSRTC routes but pointed out that the service should have resumed from inside the Ganeshpeth bus depot. TOI spotted passengers facing difficulty in locating the buses and even the police and transport department employees seemed helpless. No control room or helpline centre was found at the ST stand. The private buses engaged by RTO were also ferrying passengers on routes like Butibori, Koradi, Kamptee, where Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is providing Aapli Bus service. Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said he has directed the local office to look into the matter, but till late evening no decision. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar too assured to resolve the issue. Though the RTO is monitoring movement of private buses, many operators allegedly fleeced the passengers. Many passengers told TOI that the operators are charging exorbitant fares on routes like Bhandara, Gondia and Wardha. ST employees said that they would continue with their strike until their demands are met. ST driver Pravin Ghughe, who is among those leading the agitation, said that they would not take law and order in their hands while ruling out opposition to ply private buses. The employees are hopeful that the state government will fulfil their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/passengers-relieved-as-pvt-buses-ply-on-st-routes/articleshow/87634483.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Pune||Proposal tabled to give civic jobs to relatives of missing officials||Pune: A proposal was recently tabled before the Pune Municipal Corporation’s general body to make relatives of “missing” civic staffers eligible for jobs in the civic administration. If any staff member remains absent from work for five years, s/he is declared a “missing official”. The family members of these employees will be able to approach the PMC for a suitable job after the policy is approved. A decision in this direction was taken to give some relief to the missing employees’ relatives, who were suffering from losing the family member and also the bread winner. The policy regarding recruiting the relatives of missing staffers was approved by the law committee and the standing committee. The general body’s (GB) nod was awaited now. Shivaji Daundkar, a senior official of the PMC’s labour department, said, “The proposal has been tabled before the GB for the final nod. The policy would be implemented once the GB gives a green signal. The pending recruitment cases can be speeded up after its approval.” The draft policy stated the relatives would have to make sure that they comply with certain norms. Documents proving the relationship between the missing staff and the job applicant were a must. The defination of missing person is considered as per the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. After seven years, a missing person is considered to be dead and a death certificate is issued on their name. It can be used for applying for jobs in the PMC under compassionate grounds by his/her descendents. The PMC’s policy states the missing staffer’s family should file an FIR within one month of the employee missing. Daundkar said 22 civic employees have gone missing in recent years. Their family members have been following up for jobs. Their files can be cleared once the policy is approved. According to the policy, the family members aged between 18 and 45 years would be eligible for the job. If the employee has three children (even if one is born after December 31, 2001), then those missing employees’ kin would not be considered for the scheme. “A minimum service period before retirement” has been made mandatory to be eligible for the scheme. When the employee goes missing, if the service period remaining for their retirement is less than two years, then his relatives will not be included in the scheme, stated the policy document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proposal-tabled-to-give-civic-jobs-to-relatives-of-missing-officials/articleshow/87634457.cms||---
---||Pune||Demand to implement tax waiver scheme||Pune: A group of ex-servicemen demanded that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s property discount scheme, introduced for them, should be implemented at the earliest. The group — Soldiers Independent Rehabilitation Foundation (SIRF) — conducted a press conference on Wednesday pressing for their demand. “All municipal corporations across the state are giving this scheme’s benefits, except PMC. It is very unbecoming. The ex-serviceman housing federation is trying to take constant follow up, but is not getting any response from the authorities,” said Sumedha Chithade, secretary of SIRF. The government had announced the scheme, “Balasaheb Thackeray Maji Sainik Sanman Yojana”, to give property tax discount on houses owned by ex-servicemen and war widows. The PMC’s GB in June approved the tax waiver proposal to ex-servicemen with added benefits. As per state’s proposal, a discount was proposed only in general tax section of the property tax. But elected members unanimously decided to give total waiver. So effectively, beneficiaries will not have any tax now. The officials said some of the tax collected by PMC goes to state. So, if PMC has to give total tax discount, clearance from the state would be needed. “The process of getting the clearance is under way. It will be completed soon and the scheme would be implemented accordingly,” said Vilas Kanade, head of PMC’s property tax department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-to-implement-tax-waiver-scheme/articleshow/87634460.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot meets Central leaders amid buzz of cabinet rejig||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot holding discussion with AICC leaders in New Delhi on Wednesday has heightened the expectations of an imminent cabinet expansion and state-level political appointments. A long three-hour meeting was held at the residence of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the evening. It was attended by chief minister Gehlot, AICC general secretary organisation K C Venugopal, state general secretary incharge Ajay Maken and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. Maken said, “the meeting discussed the overall political situation in the state and a road map ahead for the party towards retaining power in the state (in 2023).” He said a lot of clarity had been achieved after the meeting. Maken, however, evaded a direct reply on the cabinet reshuffle saying “the good news will come soon.” He said the meeting also discussed the bypoll results and much expected cabinet expansion and political appointments in detail. According to sources, the expansion was likely to take place next week once governor Kalraj Mishra returns to the state after attending the governors’ conference in Delhi. Meanwhile, Sachin Pilot said he had met Venugopal, Maken in Delhi on Wednesday and apprised them of the political situation in the state. He expressed hope that the much-needed cabinet reshuffle and political appointments would happen soon. He claimed Congress workers who had toiled hard to bring back the party back to power in the state should get respect and recognition as there is hardly two years left for the government to complete its term. Currently, there are nine vacancies to be filled in the council of ministers, while two more may arise if the recently appointed AICC in-charges of poll-bound Gujarat and Punjab are dropped from the Gehlot cabinet. Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary were recently appointed as party incharges of poll bound Gujarat and Punjab, respectively.

District collector G S Sameeran said the holiday was announced only for schools, and colleges would function as usual. Schoolteachers also need not go to the schools on the day, he said. Sameeran said they had set up a war room at the district collectorate and that would function round the clock to tackle the rain-related issues. The collector said they had identified 21 vulnerable places that require attention, if heavy rain were to lash the district. “We have established contacts with the people there and dispatched ration materials in advance. We have also identified and deployed 1,858 first responders to act swiftly, if the situation calls for rescue measures.” Dr Darez Ahamed, monitoring officer for the district, said the administration was well prepared to face any eventuality. “Emergency contact numbers have been established for the people to contact for any help. We will inspect all vulnerable areas, including the ones at Valparai.” City corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, meanwhile, said electric motors and men were deployed at places such as Avinashi Road flyover, where waterlogging is usually reported, to drain out water immediately. “We have identified 65 low-lying areas in the city limits and set up as many relief camps to shift people, if required.” He said the waterlogging issue at Ramanathapuram Junction on Trichy Road was addressed by facilitating free flow of Valankulam surplus water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-to-remain-shut-today-as-well/articleshow/87635280.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra districts asked to use social media to boost Covid-19 vaccination||MUMBAI: With 26% of Maharashtra's eligible population yet to get a single shot, districts have been asked to proceed at full throttle in the next 20 days by roping in sports personalities, celebrities, army personnel or any local influencer who can motivate people to take their jabs. They have also been asked to target the weekly local bazaars in a big way to build awareness and deploy Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp to tackle any myths and misconceptions ahead of drives. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, dashed a letter to districts on Tuesday asking them to activate the ‘Mission Indradhanush Approach’, an intensified strategy that was adopted nationally in pre-Covid times to cover every left out women and children who failed to get immunised against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases. The same strategy will be used now to knock on doors and vaccinate people against Covid, Dr Vyas said. The state has set a target to vaccinate the remaining eligible population of 2.3 crore people with at least one shot by November 30. Outlining what districts must do, the letter has specified that district immunization officers will create micro-plans based on details of unvaccinated individuals. Smaller teams composed of ASHAs, auxiliary nurses and midwives (ANMs), line workers and other support staff will be handed out the lists of people who have not taken the first dose. The names of those who have skipped the second dose too will be extracted from Co-Win and given to the teams. These teams would reach out to the families, register and vaccinate them. For a wider reach, districts have been asked to target weekly bazaars both for creating awareness and vaccinating people. The state has also asked districts to deploy all popular social media channels, including Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and Facebook to quash any misconceptions against vaccination or to tackle rumours ahead of drives. “These mediums must also be used to share the positive experiences of persons who are vaccinated already,” Vyas said. The letter to districts comes days after Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to states asking them to initiate the Har Ghar Dastak Campaign from November 3 till November 30. In addition to creating 'vaccination tolis', Bhushan suggested intra-state competitions to be held between teams to motivate them. He said states could develop a ranking mechanism of identifying the best performers and felicitate them. Vyas, however, cautioned that vaccine wastage should be minimal. “While going house-to-house, it should be ensured that vaccine wastage is minimal and all protocols related to maintenance of cold chain, prescribed temperature, safe injections, waste disposal, and reporting of adverse effects are followed diligently,” he said. Recently, it was observed that vaccinate wastage rates had gone up in several districts in the range of 3-12%. Maharashtra completed administering 10 crore doses on Tuesday. It has given at least one dose to 74% and both doses to 35% of its eligible population of 9.14 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-districts-asked-to-use-social-media-to-boost-vaccination/articleshow/87635956.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The transporters claimed that despite the excise duty being reduced, fuel prices in the state continue to be highest in the country because of which they are finding it tough to run the trade. The transporters wrote that if VAT were not reduced, they would go on a statewide strike. The letter by Rajasthan Transport Association president Anil Arora said that as compared to neighbouring states, the fuel prices in Rajasthan is very high due to which they are getting doubly effected as previously the lockdown had brought heavy losses in their business and now the diesel cost is adding to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cut-vat-on-fuel-prices-transporters-tell-gehlot/articleshow/87635935.cms||---

Yadav, who was experiencing stomach pain after the beating, went to Nashik Road’s Bytco Hospital. The next day, he was referred to the Nashik civil hospital but succumbed to his injuries the same day. Mainkar said the police on Tuesday registered an offence against the flat-owner and his two relatives. They would soon be arrested, he said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 21-year-old stalker held for attacking woman with blade||NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly attacking a woman with a shaving blade and snatching her cellphone in north Delhi’s Timarpur. The youth was stalking the woman for sometime and trying to force her to befriend him. He had also injured her in April this year. The arrested man, Sushil alias Ponta, is a resident of Wazirabad. Police are verifying his criminal antecedents. On Tuesday, the complainant was going to drop off her two children for tuition at Nehru Vihar when Sushil reached there on a motorcycle and forced her to ride pillion. “The woman said she accompanied him due to fear. Sushil then took her to a lonely stretch where, following an argument, he attacked her with a shaving blade and injured her on the neck. As she shouted for help, locals gathered and Sushil ran away. He even snatched her phone before fleeing,” said a senior police officer. A case of stalking, theft and attempt to murder was registered against Sushil on the woman’s complaint. A police team then started technical investigation and questioned informers to get clues about the suspect. “Acting on a tip-off, Sushil was arrested from Gopalpur on Wednesday. A motorcycle, the shaving blade used in the crime and the cellphone of the victim was seized from him. During interrogation, he said he was friendly with the woman, but for the last few months she had been ignoring him. This annoyed him. This is why he had attacked her in April. When she continued to ignore him, he assaulted her again and tried to kill her,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/21-year-old-stalker-held-for-attacking-woman-with-blade/articleshow/87655079.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Green fuel to power entire Kolkata public vehicle fleet by 2030||KOLKATA: The city’s entire public transport will run on clean fuel — electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) — by 2030, said state’s transport minister Firhad Hakim on Wednesday. By public transport, he meant the bus fleet — both private and state transport undertakings (STUs), taxis and autos. This is certainly an ambitious departure from his earlier stance, when he set a 2030 target for the entire STU fleet to be EV only. Hakim was speaking at a panel discussion on accelerating electric mobility with green jobs and gender parity organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. While detailing the success story of e-vehicles in public transport, Hakim said, “100 electric buses are plying in the city. STUs will be acquiring 1,000 more e-buses shortly, besides the only surviving tram network which has been operational since 1880. Also, 300 STU diesel buses are being converted into dedicated CNG buses.” The possibility of CNG supply through a pipeline has gained momentum after intervention of the National Green Tribunal. “We will also convert the entire fleet of private buses to dedicated CNG buses in a phased manner.” Significantly, the state is actively thinking of giving financial aid for facilitating the shift from diesel to CNG. The promised shift will do enormous good to the city’s environment, as well to India’s commitment to keep global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial level and to secure net-zero emission by 2050. The state has set an ambitious target to be among the top three best states in India in terms of electric mobility penetration by 2030. Director general of International Solar Alliance Ajay Mathur appreciated the state’s ambitious move towards cleaner fuel and said, “Adoption of electric vehicles will generate jobs double that of IC engine vehicle manufacturing and it will facilitate higher mobility of women.” The Bengal government in its EV policy targeted 10 lakh EVs combined across all segments by 2030 with 1 lakh charging stations. In the EV policy, Kolkata, Asansol, Darjeeling and Howrah have already been declared model EM cities with phase-wise goals to adopt EV charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and new EV-enabling building codes, where at 20% parking must be earmarked for EVs. The policy declared the intercity electrification of green routes with a target to promote intercity electric mobility penetration for Kolkata-Asansol and Kolkata-Digha routes. Rapid chargers will be deployed at an average distance of 25km, catering to electric buses and heavy-duty vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/green-fuel-to-power-entire-city-public-vehicle-fleet-by-2030/articleshow/87634489.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Bhate said, “The conservation reserves namely Chandgad, Dodamarg-Amboli, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gagan Bawda, Panhalgad, Vishalgad, Jor-Jambhali and Mayani will strengthen wildlife corridor between Kali Tiger Reserve in Karnataka to Bhimashankar in Maharashtra.” He added, “These reserves in Kolhapur forest division need to be moved from territorial wing to wildlife wing and to reorganize the ranges in the region so that the pending STPF deployment in the region can be feasible. This will also bring the entire region under the protection and guarding of SPTF. This in turn will control wildlife crime and illegal bauxite mining.” Meanwhile, Khamkar, while talking to TOI, said, “The move will greatly help in preserving the corridor between Kali and Sahyadri tiger reserves. As all the conservation reserves will come under the purview of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, it would be appropriate to transfer the areas from the territorial wing to wildlife wing. This will help in the unified control of the entire corridor area which will be beneficial in the management of the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/former-honorary-wildlife-warden-writes-to-uddhav/articleshow/87632713.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Smart valves at New Town reservoirs to stop wastage||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is starting a scheme to install smart valves on an experimental basis in some of the underground water reservoirs in New Town to stop overflowing to prevent wastage of water — something that is a concern to the authorities. Explaining how the smart valves will work, NKDA officials said once the reservoirs get full, the valves will receive a signal through the sensors and close to stop water from entering the reservoirs. Once the reservoir water is pumped out for supply and the level reduces to half, the valves will again receive a signal and reopen to allow water to flow in. Officials said that an experiment has already been carried out on this as a pilot project to see how the system works. “It has been noticed that about 34% of water is being saved by using this method. The water pressure is also increasing as it is properly getting supplied to the other reservoirs as well. The project is to be rolled out soon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smart-valves-at-new-town-reservoirs-to-stop-wastage/articleshow/87634473.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Ramnagesh Akubathini (23), a native of Ranga Reddy district who worked with a Bengaluru-based startup, had continuously altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down. Akubathini’s father said his son passed out of IIT Hyderabad two years ago. He was in his hometown at the time of the arrest as his employer had allowed him to work from home during the pandemic. Akubathini was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under Indian Penal Code sections 354(A) (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation) and under Information Technology Act sections 67, 67(B) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in the sexually explicit act, in electronic form). He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathini trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-year-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profiles. Cyber team is equipped to track them," said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. Delhi Commission for Women has taken suo motu note of tweet and asked cops to file FIR and arrest accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-techie-held-for-rape-threats-to-star-cricketers-daughter/articleshow/87636295.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The number of cases too have risen to 13,059. In 2019, when the state reported 13,709 dengue cases, it was a major outbreak in a decade. In 2021, the dengue outbreak is set to surpass the 2019 figures. In five days (November 4 to 8), the state added 1,146 more cases, taking the overall tally to 13,059. During the same period, three more dengue deaths happened, taking the toll to 31 in 2021. Jaipur, Kota and Jodhpur and Alwar are among the districts which have reported 496 new dengue cases from November 4 to 8, and accounted for 43% of the total cases reported in the same duration. The health department teams are focusing on the districts which are reporting more cases for containing the spread of dengue. Despite the intensified activities, the vector-borne menace in different parts of the state is still continuing. However, the health authorities claimed that the cases of dengue have started declining and that it is now not being reported in the numbers which it was reporting few days ago. A health department official said that they are conducting anti-larvae activities and also taking measures for preventing breeding of mosquitoes. The health department has also been expanding its facilities for diagnosing dengue. The health teams visiting door-to-door in areas marked as highly-sensitive areas for dengue are also taking blood samples of the people who are suffering from fever. Timely treatment is the key to preventing complications, and for this purpose, separate orders have been issued by the health department for collecting blood samples of those who have fever, during door-to-door surveys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dengue-death-toll-rises-to-31-in-raj-cases-breach-13k-mark/articleshow/87635945.cms||---

The diesel prices in the city have come down from Rs 107 per litre to Rs 94 per litre in the last few weeks. Until a month ago, one kg of lady’s finger, tomatoes, carrot and brinjal cost close to Rs 60 and above. Now, the prices of these vegetables have dropped below Rs 50 a kg, giving much-needed relief to consumers. “Earlier, I was not able to sell the entire stock by the end of the day because consumers were purchasing limited vegetables. Now, I am able to sell almost 90 per cent of my stock with only a bit of wastage,” said Venu Gopal, a vegetable vendor at Kapra. Green vegetables such as spinach and fenugreek, which suffered the biggest casualties of incessant rains, have also made a comeback to the city markets. Even cauliflower, which was extinct from the Rythu Bazaars, is being sold now. “Not only are more variety of vegetables available in the market, the quality has also slightly improved in the last two weeks,” said Annapurna C, a resident of AC Guards in Masab Tank. According to officials, the vegetables are set to come down further by December as new crops from various districts in Telangana are set to flood the city markets. “Currently, close to 60 per cent of the vegetables are arriving from other states such as Karnataka, Maharashtra among others. We can expect more vegetables to arrive from nearby districts in the next few weeks,” said an official from the agriculture marketing department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dip-in-diesel-rates-brings-down-veggie-prices/articleshow/87635292.cms||---

The Public Works Department (PWD) is trying to finish the residual work of the bridge with shifting of the railway quarters being underway. The railway quarters fell in the path of the ramp of the bridge linking Cossipore Road.Ghatak said the state had already released Rs 11 crore for the relocation of the staff quarters a few months ago. The Railways has started the work of relocation and work is now on track “We are hopeful of completing the work by March,” Ghatak said. Atin Ghosh, an MLA from Cossipore-Belgachhia, raised the issue of delay in construction at the state Assembly on Tuesday and sought Ghatak’s intervention at his level in taking up the matter with the Eastern Railway authorities. In reply, Ghatak assured fast-track completion of the bridge which involves a cost of Rs 350 crore. Ghatak said construction had been stuck for the last few months because of the 38 railway quarters that had come in the way. The entire staff quarters needs to be relocated for PWD to start its construction work. The new bridge will have a wider and longer ramp to connect Cossipore Road with the upcoming Tallah Bridge for smooth movement of vehicles from Shyambazar to Dunlop.A crucial 240-metre section of the 750m new bridge will stand over the Tallah tracks in the ER zone. ER’s chief bridge engineer has already passed the design and drawings relating to the girder launching. PWD had been expecting the girder launching to start this month.Initially, there was a delay in getting permission from the Commissioner of Railway Safety regarding construction of pillars for the project. At present, steel girders made by Larsen & Toubro at Panagarh are awaiting the clearance of the ER authorities so that they can be commissioned at the site. “Work will be delayed unless we get the nod from ER,” said Ghosh.The dismantling work of the 57-year-old Tallah Bridge, which was a crucial link between Kolkata and the northern fringes, had begun in February 2020 after RITES and, most importantly, Bridge and Cons-truction expert V K Raina recommended pulling down the structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-keep-to-mar-apr-tallah-reopening-deadline-min/articleshow/87634504.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Nagpur||Munna Yadav to file Re1 defamation case against Malik for calling him ‘goonda’||Nagpur: Former chairman of Maharashtra Buildings and Other Construction Worker’s Welfare Board (MBOCWWB) Omprakash Munna Yadav has shot back at state minister Nawab Malik referring to him as a ‘notorious criminal’ and a ‘close aide’ of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis.Hours after NCP spokesperson Malik’s press meet in Mumbai on Wednesday morning, where he accused former chief minister Fadnavis for shielding goons like Yadav, the latter warned that he would file a defamation case against Malik. “I would be speaking to Fadnavis and then file a defamation suit of Re1 against the minister, as per his standard, within a couple of days. I have already spoken to city chief Pravin Datke in this regard and would be taking an appointment with my lawyer.”Malik had accused Fadnavis of going out of the way to elevate Yadav, who faces several criminal charges, to the top post of labour board, which is equivalent to a state minister’s rank. Yadav was absconding for six months in 2018 after he and his family, including wife and two sons, were booked for allegedly attacking his brother’s family in October 2017. He came back only after the Supreme Court granted him anticipatory bail.Challenging Maharashtra skill development minister Malik to prove the charges levelled by him, Yadav said he would take retirement from politics if they were proved, but the latter should resign if he fails to prove them. “Malik has become restless after Fadnavis dropped the bomb and exposed badly his links with the underworld. He definitely has links with terrorist groups. His so-called hydrogen bomb turned out to be a farce. If proper inquiry is conducted against him on charges levelled by Fadnavis, he would soon find himself behind bars.”On Malik’s charge of offences were lodged against him, Yadav said all of those were either related to political demonstrations or family feuds. “There are no offences against me of looting, dacoity or molestation. There’s no denying the fact that I am close to Fadnavis, as I have been working with the BJP for the last 25 years and he is our leader from the area. Me and my wife were both corporators from the area for the last two decades, and it is obvious that we are in regular touch with him.”Asserting that he had no connection with the underworld, Yadav targetted Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s former ministers. “Malik does not have any right to defame me when NCP’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh is behind bars while another minister Sanjay Rathod was forced to resign. He is misusing my name to target Fadnavis. As far as offences lodged against me, they were registered when my rivals in civic polls attacked me. Then my supporters had clashed with his supporters.”Speaking of his stint with MBOCWWB, Yadav said he helped the board reach new heights, as it was relatively unknown before he took over. “Due to my efforts, crores of rupees were directly deposited into labourers accounts. We distributed labour kits to thousands of them. We helped them financially in educating their wards and during delivery of their wives. In my tenure, the labour registrations jumped to 19 lakh from two lakh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/munna-yadav-to-file-re1-defamation-case-against-malik-for-calling-him-goonda/articleshow/87633570.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On Tuesday morning, vegetable trader Jesinh Solanki had lodged a complaint with Morbi police that he was looted of Rs 6.1 lakh at knife-point. He also said the looted money was meant to purchase onions from the market. Police said that Solanki has admitted that he had planned the robbery as he had to pay money to several people. During investigation, police became suspicious because of Solanki’s behaviour and his response to questions posed by cops. When cops continued asking him tricky questions, Solanki’s lie was exposed and he admitted that his nephew Praful alias Pappu Solanki had robbed him along with his friend. Solanki told police that he had to repay money to several people as he had suffered a loss in business. His pick-up van too was mortgaged so to avoid paying money to people, Solanki hatched the robbery plan. As per the plan, Solanki deliberately parked his vehicle outside a hotel where a CCTV camera was installed and Praful and his friend could be seen taking money from him at knife-point. On Wednesday, Solanki was booked for giving false information to police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/robbery-on-vegetable-trader-turns-out-to-be-fake/articleshow/87633583.cms||---

The face was burnt with petrol to prevent us from identifying the victim, who is aged around 35-40 years” He said they were collecting details of the people who went missing over the past few days to zero in on the identity of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-found-murdered-in-tirupur-dist/articleshow/87635304.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Migration turns 60 villages into ‘ghost villages’ in Pithoragarh||PITHORAGARH: Owing to large-scale migration, almost 60 villages in Pithoragarh, which shares a border with Nepal and China, have transformed into ‘ghost villages’. There was a time when these villages had a sizable number of residents with agriculture being the backbone of their economy. Now, according to the land records available in the revenue department, almost every tehsil of the hill district has a ghost village. Harish Giri, district land record officer, told TOI, “The eight development blocks in the district are made up of 1,400 villages. Among these blocks, the maximum of 14 ghost villages is located in Gangolihat, followed by 13 ghost villages each in Berinag and Munakot, six in Didihat, four each in Munsyari and Dharchula, three in Kanalichhina, and two in Bin.” When asked about the reasons behind migration from these villages, Gopal Giri Goswami, district development officer, Pithoragarh, said, “Lack of road connectivity and employment opportunities are the major causes driving people out of these villages.” Echoing similar sentiments, Prakesh Pande, a resident of the district's Bhatad village said, “People have been migrating to other parts of the state and outside in search of better infrastructure and job opportunities. Besides, the lack of health and education facilities is also prompting locals to move to urban centres.” He added that agricultural lands have become barren in these villages and wild animals like leopards can often be found roaming around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/migration-turns-60-villages-into-ghost-villages-in-border-district-of-pithoragarh/articleshow/87634513.cms||Prem Punetha

Goud was the handler of Jollu Shiva during the alleged encounter in Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. He told the panel that as per ACP V Surender’s orders he was holding Shiva’s left hand with his right when the accused picked up soil with his right, threw it in his eyes, pushed and attacked with a stick multiple times before escaping. When asked if it was correct to say he had failed to discharge his duty as the accused managed to escape, Goud responded: “At that time I had soil in my eyes. I was injured in my hand. I tried to catch the accused and did not permit him to escape voluntarily.” “I had received a strong blow to my left shoulder. I was also hit on my head. I had heard firing sound for the first time. I did not know what was happening. I felt my head spinning and I lost consciousness,” Goud added. On his condition subsequently, Goud said he didn’t know what the doctors wrote at the hospital when the commission’s advocate asked if it was correct that “at 9am on December 6 the doctors had noted you were conscious, coherent and stable?”. He was also asked about the Call Data Record (CDR) of his mobile showing no incoming or outgoing calls on December 5. “Does it not appear strange?” the commission asked and Goud replied: “I can’t say.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-lapse-accused-escapedafter-attacking-says-cop/articleshow/87635308.cms||Mahesh Buddi

To mark the moment, an event was organised at National Gallery of Modern Art. Brought back with the help of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the idol would be placed inside Kashi Vishwanath temple. After crossing Aligarh on November 11, Kannauj on November 12 and Ayodhya on November 14, it would finally reach Varanasi on November 15. “The idol, illegally lifted by Canadian art collector and lawyer Norman MacKenzie from a Kashi temple 108 years ago, was returned to India on October 15,” a senior official at ASI’s headquarters Dharohar Bhavan at Tilak Marg, where the idol was kept before being returned to UP, told TOI. ASI said the statue was returned with the help of the Consulate General office in Canada. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the return of this idol from Canada in his “Mann Ki Baat” on November 29, 2020. Two years ago, Canada-based artist Divya Mehra noticed a sculpture at MacKenzie Art Gallery at University of Regina represented as Lord Vishnu while researching on the collection and it struck her as a female, holding a bowl of rice. When she checked the records, she found that the same sculpture was stolen from a temple in Kashi in 1913. Union culture minister G Kishan Reddy applauded ASI for the feat and said, “Soon, the central government will hand over two idols to Tamil Nadu, one to Andhra Pradesh and one to Rajasthan.” MoS for external affairs and culture Meenakshi Lekhi and ASI officials were also present at the event to officially hand over the statue to UP. Meanwhile, of the 157 Indian heritage artefacts and antiquities handed over to the PM during his recent visit to the US, 63 were returned to India late on Tuesday. ASI officials told TOI that the artefacts would stay in their custody unless some would need to be returned to the states from where they were stolen. They added that 94 other artefacts handed over to the PM by the US government would return to India within a month. Sources said the stolen or smuggled artefacts and antiquities included a 10th century 1.5m bas relief panel of Revanta in sandstone, a 12th century bronze Nataraj figure, 56 terracotta pieces, bronze figurines and copper objects, and an 18th century sword in its sheath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/annapurna-idol-stolen-from-up-back-from-canada-after-108-yrs/articleshow/87655132.cms||Zumbish

The judge said this after going through a cabinet note furnished by the state government in a sealed cover. He asked the advocates representing the state government to go through the note and argue their case on the next date of hearing. The judge was hearing a petition filed by Vasireddy Ravikanth and Nandyala Prabhakar Rao of Khammam district challenging the state excise policy to this effect. Their counsel P V Ramana said that a 15 percent reservation was given to the Goud community in the allotment of the liquor shops. Though SCs and STs too were given 10 per cent and 5 per cent reservations respectively, Gouds alone were considered in the BCs. “This is a caste-based reservation and we are questioning this,” the counsel said. The case will come up for hearing on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plea-on-liquor-shops-quota-in-hc/articleshow/87635321.cms||---
---||Nagpur||8-yr-old kids mandated to appear for NAS exam||Nagpur: Children as young as 8 years old are being asked to come to school on November 12 to appear for a test, which is part of the central government’s National Achievement Survey (NAS). In Maharashtra, around 2.34 lakh students of Std III, V, VIII and X will have to compulsorily attend school on that day and appear for a 90-minute exam.These schools are chosen randomly by NAS and state governments implement the test through their officials. The test is conducted at the same time and date across India to ensure uniformity.Even though physical classes for Std III are not permitted in Maharashtra, these kids will have no choice but to be in classroom on that day. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The same concern was raised by us in the meeting with the Centre, but they stressed the importance of NAS as it will help ascertain the learning gaps/progress at the national level. In fact, in some states schools have not opened to the extent that we have done, still there too the NAS will go ahead.”In Nagpur district, around 7,000 students from 232 schools will appear for the exam. A local education official said, “All care will be taken so there is no chance of Covid-19 safety guidelines being flouted. Also, in the entire district, only randomly chosen kids will appear for the test. So, there’s no question of crowding on campus.”The 232 schools chosen include a mix of private CBSE and state board schools, along with those managed by local bodies.A teacher, who did not wish to identified, said, “My concern is for Std III kids. They are hardly eight or nine years old and shall be in class from 8am till 2pm. That’s an extremely long period to keep such small kids on campus. The exam will be held from 10.30am to 12 noon, but then the buffer timing is to ensure that all paperwork is done properly.”Since school canteens will be closed, all kids will have to bring their own tiffins. A teacher said, “Half an hour break will be given for lunch but mostly, the kids will be in class. They are not used to sitting at one place for such a long time.”Another issue before teachers is how to convince parents to send their kids to school on that day. An official notification makes it clear that attendance is mandatory and that teachers must remind parents a day before. “All we can do is remind and let them know about the seriousness of the issue. But frankly, if a parent does not wish to send his/her child, then I wonder what can be done legally. It’s only the soft pressure tactics which will work, not force,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/8-yr-old-kids-mandated-to-appear-for-nas-exam/articleshow/87633587.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Insurance top-up gets tougher for Covid recovered||Nagpur: Experiences during the pandemic may have increased demand for medical insurance but those recovered from Covid are finding it tough to enhance the cover now. The post-Covid health disorders are also hampering their insurability.Insurance companies are discouraging enhancement of cover under existing insurance schemes for Covid recovered patients. Enhancement is an addition over and above the old policy. Although separate insurance policies can be taken, it is done only after a thorough scrutiny, said sources in the insurance advisory business. The fresh policies are triggered when the existing one is exhausted and cashless facility is generally not available. In cases of severe Covid, some insurance companies are also denying applications for a separate insurance cover, said sources. There are some exceptions with liberal approach too.It is a standard practice for insurance companies to delay an insurance for a year or six months after any major illness. This is also being applied in cases of severe Covid. However, Covid cases have their own complications.Each of the post-Covid cases are also being thoroughly examined with special emphasis on the health conditions developed due to Covid. Patients have ended up with complications like high sugar levels, hypertension and even joint pain. These conditions are being taken as underlying diseases and excluded in the insurance policies. This means the diseases will not be covered for the first three to four years.Manoj Aya of GNTL Financial Services said that the customers have to give a self-declaration that they did not have Covid. After that a thorough investigation begins. Not only the discharge summary but even the in-patient department report with day to day account of hospital stay is being studied. If a person was on ventilator or other oxygen support, there is a likelihood that insurance may be even denied.In some cases certain diseases considered as a co-morbidity under the Covid protocol have become a reason for rejection. The grounds are that it can become a serious complication in case a person gets Covid.“My parents’ application for an insurance cover was rejected as they had high sugar levels. In the normal course they could have got insured along with the exclusion clause. They were not infected with Covid at any time though” said Prasanna Dani, an insurance advisor himself.Patients with joint pain post Covid are likely to get a policy with exclusion of knee replacement treatment cover, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/insurance-top-up-gets-tougher-for-covid-recovered/articleshow/87633597.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||My tweet is an answer to Malik’s charges: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis refused to comment on NCP minister Nawab Malik’s counter charges against him alleging latter’s links with the criminal elements and underworld.Flaying the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers for not fulfilling demands of thousands of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees demands, the former chief minister termed the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government as “insensitive” and reiterated BJP’s full support to them.Speaking to the media after his arrival at the airport, the senior BJP leader said his tweet was an apt answer on all charges labelled against him by Malik.Quoting George Bernad Shaw, the South West Nagpur MLA tweeted, “I learned long ago not to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, besides the pig likes it.”After engaging in a bitter war of words with the skill development minister, Fadnavis said there was no need to grant any weightage to the latter’s allegations and even BJP Mumbai chief Ashish Shelar had clarified on it.For their various demands, including merger of MSRTC with the state government, the former’s employees have been on an indefinite strike since October 28, which crippled the transport services across Maharashtra since last week.“The government is acting like a dictator by sacking the striking employees. Such an attitude would only deteriorate the situation. The solution can be found only through dialogue and discussions. It is high time the government should wake up and increase employees’ wages, to stop their spate of suicides. The BJP leaders would continue to support the striking employees and many of our leaders have joined them in the protest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/my-tweet-is-an-answer-to-maliks-charges-fadnavis/articleshow/87633579.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy gave this direction while hearing a PIL filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) general secretary Jaya Vindhyala seeking a probe into the death of Mariamma, who died in police custody on June 18, 2021. Mariamma was brought to Addagudur police station along with her son in connection with a theft case. The bench went through the first post-mortem report, judicial first class magistrate report and the second post-mortem report. The bench also saw the photos furnished by the petitioner showing injuries suffered by the son of Mariamma, who was allegedly beaten up brutally by Addagudur cops. Addagudur falls under Rachakonda police commisionerate. The bench noted the difference between the findings given in two post-mortem reports and said this was a fit case for a CBI probe. The bench also asked the petitioner to implead both the CBI and the Union of India as parties to the case. The high court had earlier found fault with the state government for getting the matter inquired through a tahsildar and, instead, ordered an inquiry through a judicial magistrate. It was this sealed cover report furnished by the judicial magistrate that had reached the high court now. When advocate general BS Prasad sought a copy of the report, the bench said it would be handed over to the CBI SP. To a submission made by the AG that the government took prompt action against the errant cops, the bench sought to know from him whether all such efforts would bring back the life of the hapless woman. The court asked the counsel for the Centre also to be present before it on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mariamma-death-case-fit-for-cbi-probe-hc/articleshow/87635315.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Education department extends Diwali vacation; city schools to reopen on November 22||MUMBAI: Schools in Mumbai not participating in the nation-wide survey of students’ learning achievements can continue their Diwali vacation till November 22, stated an education department circular issued on Wednesday. However, the 292 schools in Mumbai that have been selected for the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 will reopen on Thursday. The state had curtailed the vacation and directed schools to reopen on Thursday—a day before the survey to be conducted on Friday.  Across the state, though, confusion over reopening continued till late on Wednesday. Earlier, in a circular dated November 3, the state had left it to schools to adjust the pending Diwali holidays with Christmas or summer vacations. “It made no sense to reopen schools not participating in the survey,” said Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Samiti, who was fighting for the Diwali vacation. With schools being told to ensure 100% attendance for the survey, parents are being pressured to send children to school. In the state, though, schools had reopened for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and 8 to 12 in urban with parental consent. For the survey, parents are being told it is mandatory to be in school on Thursday and Friday. “We got a call saying my daughter has to come to school, else it will result in an adverse remark on her academic calendar,” said a parent of a Class 10 student in Bandra. The students have to be in school on Friday from 8am to 3pm. They have to carry their tiffin and water. The state has permitted students to travel by train for the survey. The person accompanying the student need not be fully vaccinated. School heads said the response of parents in sending their children to school was poor. “They are refusing to send children to school for just two days,” said a principal, who has to bring in classes 3 and 8. Selected schools have to gather 30 students for the survey per standard. For instance, a school selected to survey classes 5 and 10 will have to call all the students. Among them, 30 each of the two classes will be randomly selected with chits. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday requested schools and parents to participate in the survey and keep Maharashtra on the top in overall ranking. While the survey, in the form of a written test in languages, maths and science, is for 39 lakh students from 1.25 lakh schools in the country, the final number will be known on Friday. UP has the maximum of 15,302 participating schools, followed by MP with 9,499 and Maharashtra 7,330.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-edu-dept-extends-diwali-vacation-city-schools-to-reopen-on-nov-22/articleshow/87634562.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan Patuli suicide||Kolkata: A 53-year-old man who had lost his job last year during the pandemic and was under mental stress for a number of reasons, allegedly died by suicide at his rented accommodation in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The victim has been identified as Amit Jyoti Banerjee, a resident of a complex located close to Garia under Patuli police station. Police said his wife (37) and son (11) were staying with a relative and were busy house hunting when the incident took place. “Prima facie, the family has stated that Banerjee was upset over his financial crisis. However, there might be a number of other personal issues involved. We have ordered an inquest to ascertain the details,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. “On November 10, around 12.10am, Patuli police received information over telephone regarding no response from a family residing in the complex. A police team arrived at the spot and found that Luna Sarkar, the landlady residing on the first floor and four neighbours were standing in front of the flat. They said that Banerjee who has been residing there for the past six years, was not opening the door since the past few hours. Cops broke open the main door and found Banerjee hanging from the ceiling fan hook in his house with a white dupatta. His wife along with other relatives of the deceased also arrived at the spot sometime later. He was taken to Baghajatin State General Hospital where he was declared dead,” said Khan. “During enquiry, it was revealed that he was an employee of a private firm and had lost his job during the pandemic in 2020. We came to know that he wanted a fixed source of income. No foul play has been detected as yet. No complaint has also been received from any corner so far,” added khan. Neighbours told police that the family often went out and ordered food from outside. “It was impossible to know in the past few months what Banerjee was going through,” a neighbour told the investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-patuli-suicide/articleshow/87634564.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||‘Raw material prices forcing foundries to shut operations’||Ahmedabad: Reeling from extreme cost pressures with rise in prices of coal as well as pig iron – a key raw material for manufacturing metal castings, foundries are being forced to curtail or shut production. Estimates by Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF) – a pan India association for the foundries, suggest that most foundries in Gujarat are yet to resume production after Diwali, as they are facing acute working captial shortage. Coal is a key input material for foundries to operate, whose prices have doubled. That apart, pig iron which is a basic raw material has become costlier by at least 45%. Since most foundry units are dependent on coal for manufacturing processes, the input costs have dramatically shot up by at least 25%. “Most foundries are micro small and medium enterprises, which do not have adequate working capital to buy costlier raw materials. At the same time, timely availability of raw material is another constraint,” said Subodh Panchal, past president, IIF. Making matters worse, foundries are unable to cash-in on fresh order volumes due to supply-side bottlenecks triggered by uncertain supply and rising cost of raw material. This is making foundry operations unviable and lot of small units are on the verge of closure, according to IIF. IIF estimates suggest that Gujarat is home to at least 2,500 foundries which are mainly concentrated in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot and have a cumulative installed capacity of some 5-lakh tonne per month. Metal castings are widely used in manufacturing of automobiles, engineering goods, railway and windmills, among others. Metals and castings industry saw a steep rise in commodity prices over the past one year including that for coke, pig iron, cast iron, steel scrap, cast iron borings, HR sheet, CR sheet, ferro alloys, chemicals for core making and coatings, consumables for foundry units, copper, brass and aluminum in the range of 60-150%. IIF has sought that the government revokes the import duty on key raw materials used in casting production. “Most raw materials are imported and therefore, cutting down the import duty will help bring down cost of production,” said Devendra Jain, president, IIF. IIF members held that foundries need to implement monthly price revision of raw materials based on national price index for ferrous, non-ferrous, steel finished products and the customers need to be prepared for such a revision because it is the only way doing business will remain viable. “Monthly pricing index can be a solution till normalcy is restored. This will be helpful to the castings buyers as well as suppliers,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raw-material-prices-forcing-foundries-to-shut-operations/articleshow/87634558.cms||---

The officials are calling the beneficiaries who took their first dose in Nagpur district centres and didn't turn up for the second even after passage of the requisite gap period.Over 2 lakh people are due for the second dose in the district. When asked to take the second dose, the beneficiaries informed the officials that they had taken both doses but got certificate of partially vaccinated.Officials said the Co-Win system too allows the beneficiaries to merge their certificates procured from two different centres using different IDs. “Our centres help those who are not aware of the feature on the Co-Win or don’t know how to do it themselves,” he said.The beneficiaries need to fill up the dates and details of IDs in the system to generate fully vaccinated certificate.Civic officials said daily over 300 calls are made to people who have taken their first dose in last three months but still their second dose is shown as due. “About 5,000 people have been found to have taken their second dose using a different ID,” they said.Asked how were beneficiaries allowed to take the second dose using a different IDs, officials said many of these people had taken their doses in panic. “They belong to the batches when we used to have shortage of doses and the drive used to come to a halt. Also, due to longer span, they somehow fail to recall which ID they had used before. Some also would refuse to cooperate and wouldn’t disclose if they had been jabbed earlier or which ID they had registered the first time,” they said.Officials said some also had preferred other districts like Bhandara where doses would remain available in a bid to complete their doses early.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/registered-with-different-ids-vax-beneficiaries-get-certificates-merged/articleshow/87633610.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The woman died on Wednesday morning after her nephew allegedly fed her poison on November 8. Police said that Parvati Sakariya was taken to a farm by her nephew Arjun Sakariya where he tied her to a tree and forcibly fed her poison. Arjun had borrowed Rs 20,000 from Parvati and on November 8 when she was shopping in a market at Jasdan, Arjun bumped into her. When Parvati asked him to return the money, Arjun asked her to come along with him on his bike. Since Parvati did not suspect any danger, she went along with him. On reaching a farm on the outskirts of Jasdan, Arjun tied Parvati to a tree and allegedly fed her poison. Later in the evening, when Parvati’s cousin Bhavesh called her, she told him about what had transpired. Bhavesh informed her son Zaver and husband Vithal and the trio rushed to her help. By the time they reached the farm, Parvati had become unconscious. They took her to a hospital in Jasdan from where she was referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital. She succumbed during treatment on Wednesday morning. “We have registered a case of accidental death as of now. We will register an offence once we get a complaint from the woman’s family,” said sub-inspector N J Jadeja of Jasdan police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-forced-to-take-poison-dies/articleshow/87633616.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Three arrested with imported marijuana worth Rs 35 lakh||NEW DELHI: Three men were arrested on Wednesday and imported marijuana worth Rs 35 lakh was seized from them. The drug was bought via Darknet and payment was made in Bitcoin. The accused have been identified as Karan Sajnani (24), Priyansh (22) and Sanjeev Midha (39). Around 11.15am on Monday, a Crime Branch team raided a flat in Shalimar Bagh and caught the trio and seized 1,873 grams of fine quality Canadian ganja. “The selling price of the seized consignment is Rs 40,000-50,000 for each ounce (28 grams) depending upon the paying capacity of the buyer. In USA, it costs about 600 dollars per ounce,” said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner (Crime). During interrogation, it was found that Sajnani had a family business of car sale and purchase. “Priyansh is his friend. Their common friend, Pankaj Davar, was engaged in procuring marijuana from the US by courier to sell it in Delhi. About four months ago, Sajnani and Davar procured approximately 1.5kg of the drug. Three months ago, they had procured another consignment in the same manner. This time, Davar cheated Sajnani by not sharing the profit equitably. Sajnani then decided to work without him,” said the joint commissioner. Kumar said about two months ago, Sajnani and Priyansh procured around 1kg marijuana and sold it to two men, Golu and Vicky, in Paschim Vihar. They had ordered the recent consignment a week ago, which was intercepted by the Crime Branch. Police also found that the trio used to chat with people abroad using a special app in which the conversation was automatically deleted after three days. “The seller was traced on the Darkweb through an onion browser, which directs internet traffic through a free, worldwide volunteer overlay network consisting of more than 6,000 relays. After striking a deal, payment was made in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. Priyansh paid for the consignment using his bitcoin wallet. The drug parcels were sent through an international courier, package delivery or express mail service and sold to buyers in Delhi,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-arrested-with-imported-marijuana-worth-rs-35-lakh/articleshow/87634721.cms||---

Kempty falls sees heavy tourist footfall through the year and officials allege that there is massive waste generation from the place. Locals believe the problem of garbage generation is going unchecked. “The problem was highlighted and officials took stock of the situation. We worked with administration and forest department to make this happen. Traders’ association identified the space where the plant could be set up and we will provide all necessary support to keep this running smoothly,” said Sunder Singh Rawat, president, Kempty falls traders’ association. The plant is located 1km ahead of the falls. Officials said that as it is a pilot project, they are starting off at a smaller level. “We have begun with a budget of Rs 10 lakh, for now. Nearly 4 tonnes of plastic waste, constituting mostly PET bottles, will be procured on a daily basis and upgraded at the facility into granules,” said Kahkashan Nassem, district forest officer, Mussoorie. Officials believe they can use the local waste for the project and the final product can then be sold off to private companies. The profits will be utilised by the business association to expand and even generate employment opportunities at the plant. “The staff strength, including a security guard, is 10, at present. The collection, segregation and processing will all happen here. Our aim is to eventually create refurbished tiles and construction material, and finally generate agricultural grade fuel at the facility,” said the DFO. The facility will become operational on November 15. Stakeholders are working on arranging vehicles that will ferry the waste to the plant from areas around the facility. Forest department and administration also aim to start at least 60 composting pits in the area that will use up to 10 tonnes of biodegradable waste per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/upgraded-plastic-unit-to-make-kempty-falls-litter-free/articleshow/87634559.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Vehicular movement has witnessed a steady rise over the years as the town is the headquarters of Quepem taluka with numerous government offices, including those of the deputy collector and mamlatdar, located here. In the absence of a proper parking system, severe traffic congestions are a frequent sight. Vehicles are mostly found parked on both sides of the road from the main Quepem junction to the temporary fish market, thereby disrupting the flow of traffic Areas near the buildings of the RTO office, deputy collector and around the fuel station are the most congested due to parking scarcity. A few years ago, as per the notification issued by the South Goa collector, Quepem municipality with the assistance of traffic police had erected parking signboards with painted markings at various locations in the town. However, the signages have disappeared since then. “There is no control over the traffic as people park their four-wheelers on the road for the entire day. Some areas which were allotted for two-wheelers are now used for parking four-wheelers as well,” said a resident Filomeno Pereira. Traffic police expressed helplessness in issuing challans for improper parking owing to the lack of designated markings and signboards at parking lots. As per the collector’s notification, a stretch of around six metres parking space along the roadside in front of the RTO building office was reserved for differently abled persons. However, the entire stretch is now being used for routine parking as authorities failed to erect signboards. Speaking to TOI, deputy collector Nilesh Daigodkar expressed concern over the issue and said that he will call the municipality’s chief officer and the police inspector of traffic cell to his office to discuss the implementation of a parking system in the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-town-in-urgent-need-of-parking-plan/articleshow/87635976.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The mishap occurred at SRP3 & 3A incline underground mine at Srirampur in Mancherial district and the four workers were buried under a heap of debris. “The workers were engaged in roof stitching work in the underground mine. Suddenly part of the roof fell at 10.30 am. The collapsed roof was six metres long and three metres wide with a height of two metres,” an official from Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) said. “The four workers were trapped below it and lost their lives,” the SCCL official said. While an internal probe was ordered by SCCL chairman and managing director N Sridhar to find out reasons behind the roof collapse, families of miners protested demanding more safety measures for their kin. The deceased workers were identified as B Laxmaiah (60), V Krishna Reddy (57), G Satyanarayana Raju (32) and R Chandrasekhar (32), all hailing from neighbouring areas. Witnesses said there were about 21 workers, including miners and the supporting staff in the mine, raising apprehension that more people could be trapped inside the mine. However, by evening it was clear that all other workers were safe. “Only four died in the accident. No other workers got trapped in the mine. We were informed that the rest of the workers came out of the mine after the incident. One body has been retrieved and efforts are on to take out the other three bodies,” Jaipur ACP G Narender said. After learning about the mishap, senior officials of SCCL and police rushed to the spot. Family members of the workers as well as worker's union representatives staged a protest demanding that the SCCL authorities must step up safety measures to ensure that such mishaps don’t recur. SCCL authorities pacified the protesters assuring that one member of the deceased employee's family will be provided a job at the place of their choice and will also be given a compensation between Rs 70 lakh and Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/four-singareni-workers-killed-in-underground-mine-roof-collapse/articleshow/87636327.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Kolkata||Prithvi weather||TNN Kolkata: The city is set to receive light to moderate rain this weekend under the impact of a low pressure over southeast Bay of Bengal. A cloud cover may appear over Kolkata from Thursday as easterly winds start flowing in, carrying moisture from the sea. It may start drizzling in Kolkata from Friday night and the rain may continue till Monday. It could get moderate on Sunday even as the city remains cloudy. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 19.7 degree Celsius on Wednesday. The minimum temperature may rise above 20 degrees from Thursday. The maximum, though may slide marginally below 30 degrees, said the Met office. "It will get marginally warmer as the mercury rises. But we expect drizzles from Friday night. The rain could continue on Saturday and get more frequent and marginally heavier on Sunday. Once the cloud cover recedes and the rain stops, the minimum temperature is set to drop again. But it will be a gradual slide and winter chill is still far away," said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. Meanwhile, the low pressure system has moved towards the Tamil Nadu coast. "Even though there will be no direct impact of the system on south Bengal, the moisture and the wind are set to trigger clouds and rain. It won't last till the weekend, though," added Das. Meanwhile, a low pressure trough is set to form between Odisha and Bangladesh that will converge with the low pressure system as it hits land on Friday night. "This will trigger the rain this weekend," said Das. The mercury had said to 18 degree Celsius earlier this week as chilly westerly winds blew into south bengal. It was unusual for the temperature to slide below 20 degrees in early November, said weatherman. "This, however, does not indicate an early onset of winter. The minimum temperature must remain below 15 degrees for three consecutive days for winter to set in. It rarely happens in Kolkata before mid-December, " said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prithvi-weather/articleshow/87634581.cms||---

---||Delhi||Why dengue patients should not ignore abdominal pain, discomfort||NEW DELHI: At least nine patients have been admitted to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) due to acute liver failure caused by dengue fever in the last three months. At Holy Family hospital, doctors say, nearly 30% of dengue patients who require ICU admission have liver-related complications. Similar cases of liver dysfunction in dengue patients have been reported in other hospitals also. “Dengue is a systemic illness. It affects all organs. But the liver is among the most affected organs. We have seen at least nine dengue patients coming with acute liver failure in the last three months,” Dr S K Sarin, vice-chancellor of ILBS, said. He added that management of such patients isn’t easy as other organs such as the kidney are also involved. According to Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family hospital, liver dysfunction in dengue patients can be caused directly due to cell damage and indirectly due to capillary leak, which is a known complication of the viral illness. “In dengue, people focus mostly on fall in platelet count. But, the real warning sign is abdominal discomfort or pain. It is reflective of capillary leak – escape of blood plasma through minute blood vessels called the capillaries – which can damage the organs. Timely medical intervention in such cases can help reduce complications and, therefore, save lives,” he added. This year, as on November 6, Delhi has recorded 2,708 cases and nine deaths due dengue which is the highest since 2017. Public health experts say the overall number of dengue cases is high and that has led to a proportionate increase in severe cases also. Also, the experts say, there is a predominance of type II strain of the dengue virus. Dengue virus strains are of four types. Type I causes classic dengue fever, type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, dengue III causes fever without shock and dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. People suffering from chronic kidney disease, heart diseases and pregnant women among others are at higher risk to develop complications if they get the disease. They should take extra precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, says Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket said dengue cases may start reducing once the winter sets in. “People have to be alert and take all precautions to prevent mosquito bite. If there is persistent fever, it is better to get tested and see a doctor so the symptoms are managed in time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-dengue-patients-should-not-ignore-abdominal-pain-discomfort/articleshow/87634584.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis shielded man caught with Rs 15 crore fake notes: Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday made charges against leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, saying that the former BJP chief minister had links with Riyaz Bhati, considered to be a henchman of gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Malik also alleged that during Fadnavis’s tenure as CM, persons with criminal backgrounds were appointed on state-run boards and corporations and given the status of cabinet minister or minister of state. Malik claimed Fadnavis had taken the lead in criminalisation of politics and shielded criminals involved in the fake currency scam which allegedly took place after demonetisation in 2016. He also alleged Fadnavis was making all attempts to divert attention from the controversy surrounding NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who carried out, in Malik’s words, a “fake” raid on a cruise ship on October 2. The NCP minister alleged Fadnavis had protected a person who had been caught with fake currency notes worth Rs 14.56 crore in the BKC area. A few persons were then arrested from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune, he said. “The PM had on November 8, 2016 declared demonetisation to stop fake currency coming in from neigbouring countries, particularly Pakistan. In most states, massive fake currency was seized. On October 8, 2017, DRI seized fake currency worth Rs 14.56 crore, but the case was suppressed with the blessings of Fadnavis. Notes with a face walue of Rs 8.8 lakh were then shown as sezure. At that time, Sameer Wankhede was in charge of DRI,” Malik claimed. Fadnavis, he alleged, appointed Hazi Arafat Shaikh, elder brother of one of the accused in the fake currency case, Imran Alam Shaikh, as chairman of the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. Another controversial person, Hyder Azam, was appointed chairman of the Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Corporation, he said. Azam had been accused of illegally bringing in people from Bangladesh to Mumbai, and his second wife is a citizen of Bangladesh, Malik claimed. Malad police were probing her antecedents, but all cases were suppressed on Fadnavis’s instructions, the minister alleged. Munna Yadav from Nagpur, alleged to have a criminal background, was appointed chairman of Constructions Workers’ Board and given the rank of minister of state, Malik added. Fadanvis did not comment on the allegations but tweeted after Malik’s presser, “Thought for the day: I learned long ago. Never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides the pig likes it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-shielded-man-caught-with-rs-15-crore-fake-notes-malik/articleshow/87635973.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The expertise in braille and determination to excel in academics motivated her to score 87% in distinction in graduation, the results of which were announced last week. Dethroning the long lineage of sighted students that came before her, Khan is the topper in her batch, this year. “It was challenging when we shifted to online classes due to the pandemic. However, once I was able to adjust to the medium, there was no looking back and I was able to complete my studies,” Khan said. She is now aiming for IAS preparation so that she can uplift people from the underprivileged and rural areas. “I want to ensure that others get the same opportunities that I did,” she said. Saish Salkar, 23, a visually impaired student from Old Goa, also graduated with 80% in his graduation course. He is now pursuing a masters degree in English literature at Goa University. “Shifting to virtual examinations was the toughest challenge since verbally saying our answers on Google Meet was something we had never been exposed to. However, I was determined to excel since I want to further prepare for UPSC,” he said. The duo’s achievement has made their teachers at NAB extremely proud. Theirs is not just yet another success story to come from the institute, but also an achievement wherein the students have performed against their sighted counterparts in a regular college, instead of a special one. “They cannot come out of schools as leaders if they do not learn to be a part of regular society early on. We, therefore, follow an integrated regulated programme as part of which students can go to regular schools instead of special schools. Here, the students compete with the sighted students and emerge as successful while overcoming all challenges,” said NAB president Rozendo Mendonsa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-blind-students-graduate-with-distinction/articleshow/87636023.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Amritsar||Over 98% paddy procured: Ashu; 15% yet to reach mandis: Farmers||Bathinda: Refuting claims of farmer groups and opposition parties where they have said that a considerable amount of paddy is still to be procured, Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has made it clear that the state government has procured nearly 98% paddy, and mandis will be closed in a day or two. Afterwards, a small window will remain open for farmers and the procurement will be made only after fully verifying the details about paddy and no purchase will be made for arhtiyas and rice millers. Speaking to TOI, Ashu said, “As much as 179 lakh metric tonne paddy had arrived in mandis till evening of November 9, out of which 178 lakh MT has been procured. We expect 5-6 lakh MT more in the two days before mandis are closed for procurement. The claims of 15-20% paddy is yet to arrive are not as per ground reality. We feel only up to 2% paddy might not have come to mandis, but not more than that.” Last year, a record 203 lakh MT paddy was procured in Punjab. Ashu said a lot of hue and cry was made over how this much of paddy came to Punjab and this time “we have put a lot of checks against bogus billing.” He said though there is no any issue of payments, it has been stopped for a couple of days to verify various details and it will be released after checking the same. The farmer groups are making claims that over 15% paddy is still to arrive in mandis as a big part out of it has not been harvested yet. They have decided to raise the issue with the chief minister and also to hold protests if mandis are closed. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan and BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said a lot of paddy is still to reach mandis and to be procured, so closing the mandis is totally unjustified. They will raise the matter with the CM and if no solution is found, they will hold protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/over-98-paddy-procured-ashu-15-yet-to-reach-mandis-farmers/articleshow/87636439.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Delhi HC nixes plea against DDMA's Chhath order||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday dismissed a plea challenging the DDMA's decision prohibiting devotees from performing Chhath Puja on the banks of the Yamuna. "This is just a publicity interest petition. Covid 19 hasnt totally vanished its still there..it is a misconceived petition.." Justice Rekha Palli said, pointing out that the petitioners were unable to show that devotees are entitled to or can insist to perform the puja only on the Yamuna banks. "They have not given any explanation as to why they did not approach the respondents if they were desirous of having additional designated sites in the area even after the list of designated sites was made public," the court said. It said the petitioner society, which claim to organise various social and religious functions, were free to approach the Delhi government to earmark additional sites in Sonia Vihar and Wazirabad area but even after November 6, when list in their sites was made public, they made no move. Infringement of right of worship, says plea in HCChhath Puja has already commenced today and even otherwise no orders for alternative sites at this stage can be passed," the court observed, underlining that the AAP government's decisions "to take care of religious sentiments of all devotees." "Even though Covid-19 has still not fully disappeared, the government has taken steps to ensure that devotees can perform Chathh Puja." The petitioner organisations challenged the Delhi Disaster Management Authority's October 29 order, which permitted the Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi but certain restrictions were imposed. According to the petitioner, authorities unreasonably prohibited the devotees from performing Chhat Puja on the banks of the Yamuna without assigning any reason in their notifications/orders. Delhi government told the court that 800 designated sites are created in the national capital for performing puja and there are seven designated sites in the vicinity of where the petitioners wish to perform the rituals. The petitioners - Chhath Puja Samaj Sudhar Samiti, Sonia Vihar, and Bihar Mitra Sangathan, Karwal Nagar - said that notifications have caused infringement to their fundamental right of worship. The petition said the environmentalists have claimed that the festival of Chhath is one of the most eco-friendly religious festivals that should be used to spread "the message of nature conservation".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-nixes-plea-against-ddmas-chhath-order/articleshow/87636961.cms||Abhinav Garg

All this came to light when the Haryana government decided to provide personal security officers (PSOs) to such administrative secretaries, director-level officers and other senior bureaucrats who have been assigned various duties as special magistrates or incharges of districts for Covid-related tasks. “Many administrative secretaries and HoDs have informed me about the difficulties they have faced in the discharge of duties assigned to them in view of the agitation which has resulted into road jams, picketing at toll plazas and agitations at government offices in the districts. These senior officials while travelling have to negotiate such hotspots,” the chief secretary said in his communication to the home department and Haryana DGP. The chief secretary has asked DGP P K Agrawal to provide PSOs to such officers with immediate effect to ensure their safety while travelling. Notably, Additional Chief Secretary (home) Rajeev Arora has been assigned the work to negotiate with farmers over the opening of borders. Similarly, Additional Chief Secretary Devender Singh was the one who negotiated with farmers at Karnal. Most of the head of the departments, administrative secretaries have been given two districts each for the Covid management issues. Besides, those handling special projects are learned to be visiting various project sites in the state. “The problem surfaces when farmers comes out on roads after seeing escort guards and cars with beacon. They leave the way only after they realise that officers are sitting in vehicles. Sometimes they give way on their own and sometimes it take time. Though there is no such incidence of attack on bureaucrats by agitatators, the move on PSOs is just for precaution,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/feeling-heat-due-to-farmers-protest-hry-top-babus-to-get-psos/articleshow/87636440.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Nagpur||No restrictions, NMC lays out red carpet for Chhath puja at lakes||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) not only violated its own guidelines but also those issued by the state government for Chhath puja celebrations. On Wednesday, instead of imposing restrictions and taking action, the civic body made arrangements for the puja at a few lakes by spending from its own coffers. The government had strictly prohibited rituals at the water bodies citing Covid-19 pandemic. But the city police remained mere spectator even as a large number of devotees thronged the water bodies and violated Covid guidelines. In the guidelines issued on November 3, the state’s home department had restricted the Chhath puja celebrations to home. “People should perform the puja in a simple manner at their houses and avoid coming together to the banks of lakes, rivers and sea. Also, no mandap should be erected,” the department had said. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi on November 8 issued a circular for implementation of the government guidelines. As per information available from the NMC officials, the same day the civic body opened quotations invited for executing works to allow devotees on the banks of lakes. The quotation process had started from the beginning of November. The works were done on the banks of Sonegaon, Ambazari, Futala, Police Line Takli, Gorewada etc in just two days. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and Joshi confirmed that NMC executed the works through tender process. “Government should have issued the guidelines well in advance but the delay caused confusion. Like every year, NMC started the arrangements. I planned to perform bhoomipuja on November 6 as the NMC officials confirmed that there are no restrictions from the government,” said Tiwari. The mayor claimed he also directed the NMC officials to cross-check after receiving information about the guidelines from a section of media. “By the time officials learnt about the government order of November 8, works had already started,” he said. Joshi said that NMC carried out some works to avoid any untoward incident at the lakes. A large number of devotees across age groups performed the puja at Ambazari, Fulata, Sonegaon and Gorewada lakes while ignoring Covid norms like wearing mask and following physical distancing. Traffic police managed traffic on roads leading to the lakes while police personnel were deployed on security bandobast. None of the devotees was stopped from approaching the lakes. The NMC officials were also not to be seen. According to CP Amitesh Kumar, police ensured compliance of all guidelines issued by the government. Umakant Agnihotri from Uttar Bhartiya Sabha said there was no reason to impose restrictions for the puja as it is performed only for a few hours at the banks of water bodies. “All the guidelines were followed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-restrictions-nmc-lays-out-red-carpet-for-chhath-puja-at-lakes/articleshow/87635028.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||TMC takes stock of its expansion plans in state||Panaji: Reviewing the work it has done in the state in the past over a month, All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) deliberated on the roadmap for the party’s expansion in Goa, membership in remote areas, and social media engagement, at a meeting held on Wednesday. Former Goa chief minister and present TMC national vice-president Luizinho Faleiro held the meeting with party functionaries including Leander Paes, Yatish Naik, Antonio Clovis, Swati Kerkar, Pratibha Borkar and Francis de Tuem. “We will take up hard issues like water, women’s safety, mining and we take them head-on,” Paes said as he addressed party members. Paes said that TMC will start campaigning in Goa from Thursday in order to prove to voters that it is not in Goa to divide the anti-BJP votes, but to provide a political alternative. Sources said that the hype over TMC’s entry into Goa has calmed down as no political bigwigs have joined the party recently. TMC said it has launched a digital campaign in response to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s “audacious demand asking people to thank him for doing his job”. On Saturday, Sawant had complained that the media had not thanked him and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for slashing fuel prices. In a fitting reply, Goans have decided to congratulate Sawant for destroying Goa, in their own unique way. From law and order, unemployment, corruption, potholes, or complete destruction of the economy, Goans are making sure that Sawant gets his due. As TMC continues to build its presence in Goa, the Bengal-based outfit continues to poach former Congress functionaries. On Wednesday, former Congress general secretary from North Goa district, Socorro Menezes joined TMC . A few days earlier, Carmona sarpanch Allwyn Jorge also joined TMC along with 200 people from his village and Benaulim constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-takes-stock-of-its-expansion-plans-in-state/articleshow/87635738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Lobo joining Cong will boost my chances, says Kandolkar||Panaji: A day after ports minister Michael Lobo-backed councillor Sudhir Kandolkar to win the Mapusa assembly seat in the upcoming state elections, Kandolkar said he would contest the polls on a Congress ticket, and said his prospects would increase if Lobo too joined Congress. His statements are likely to add fuel to speculations that Lobo is cosying up to Congress ahead of the polls. Lobo has said that he has been approached by several parties including Congress for the 2022 polls and that he would take a call depending on the situation. He had also said that he would leave BJP if the party didn't want him. Kandolkar, a former BJP karyakarta, described Lobo as an efficient minister and a helpful friend. “As a minister, he has always been helpful. He entertains everyone and he shows results, so he will definitely win the next election. His style of working is good,” said Kandolkar. When Kandolkar was asked if he would leave Congress, he said that doing so would hurt his political reputation and cause voters to distance themselves from him. “I will contest the coming elections as a Congress candidate,” said Kandolkar. “If Lobo joins Congress, it will benefit me as I will get additional support in Mapusa, and there will be more development for Mapusa.” Mapusa has been represented by BJP since former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza joined the party in 2000. After his death in 2019, his son Joshua was elected. Kandolkar, a one-time close aide of Francis, was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket in the 2019 byelection, but after he was denied a ticket, Kandolkar switched to Congress. “If I change parties, the people will lose faith in me. I got 10,000 votes in the last byelection. By going from this side to that side, it will be a betrayal of the people’s trust,” said Kandolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-joining-cong-will-boost-my-chances-says-kandolkar/articleshow/87635745.cms||---
---||Goa||In Calangute, Congmen say no to Lobo in party||Calangute: Former Calangute MLA and Goa Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Agnelo Fernandes has reiterated his opposition to the entry of ports minister and Calangute BJP MLA Michael Lobo into the party. Following reports that Lobo may join Congress and contest on its ticket from Calangute constituency in the coming assembly election, Fernandes along with other aspiring candidates from Calangute, Joseph Sequeira and Anthony Menezes, both former Calangute sarpanchs, and Calangute Congress block committee convener Benedict Lobo, held a meeting at Candolim on Wednesday to discuss the issue. “We held a meeting to develop a strategy in case Lobo is admitted into Congress and given the ticket from Calangute. We will not allow that to happen,” Fernandes said. Fernandes said that Lobo knows that he will lose in the coming election. “Lobo thinks that he can win if he contests on the Congress ticket by banking on the groundwork that we party workers have been doing,” Fernandes said. Fernandes, along with Sequeira and Menezes, have already started a door-to-door campaign, even though the party has not declared the candidate for the constituency. Aspiring Congress candidates from Siolim and Mapusa were also supposed to attend the meeting after Lobo announced that he would be fielding his candidates from those constituencies. However, they were not present. Congress central observer P Chidambaram is scheduled to chair a meeting of the Calangute Congress block committee on Friday at Candolim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-calangute-congmen-say-no-to-lobo-in-party/articleshow/87635750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Resolve Zuari bridge traffic woes in 3 days: Cong to govt||Panaji: After three consecutive days of traffic snarls along the Panaji-Cortalim stretch, Congress on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to the state government to resolve the traffic congestion within three days or face a protest. State Congress president Girish Chodankar accused the state government of using kid gloves with the highway contractor. “Congress, along with the affected travellers, will hold a massive protest march on the Zuari bridge, if the problem is not solved in next three days,” Chodankar said. “It is the failure to take the contractor to task due to which the huge traffic jams are witnessed every day on both the sides of the bridge.” He said that people travelling to their offices and tourists heading for Goa airport are caught up in traffic jams and as a result they reach their destinations late. He also said that several ambulances are stuck in the traffic endangering the lives of patients. “Traffic congestion on both the sides of the Zuari bridge has made life of travellers hell and all this is only because the BJP contractor has failed to abide by the conditions,” he alleged. The state and the Centre have allowed the highway contractor to flout all the rules from the book, the state Congress president alleged. “It is the duty of the contractor to ensure smooth flow of traffic even when construction of the road or Zuari bridge is taken up. People are left stranded in traffic during the day. Travel time between Margao and Panaji has been increased, at least, by an hour,” he said. Chodankar said that the government has taken people for granted and is not bothered to even sit and work out a solution for this problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resolve-zuari-bridge-traffic-woes-in-3-days-cong-to-govt/articleshow/87635756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As many as 19 packets of drugs worth Rs 88 lakh were seized in the morning while another 47 packets were found later. The drugs were brought from the sea route from Pakistan to be smuggled into Gujarat from the coastal areas of Dwarka, a police officer said. Police sources said that based on specific information, they detained Sajjad Dhosi (44), a resident of Mumbra of Thane district in Maharashtra and found drug packets concealed in his bags. He was carrying 6.6 kg methamphetamine and 11.4kg heroin in three bags, including luggage and school bag. This seizure is valued at Rs 88.2 crore. During interrogation, Dhosi, a vegetable vendor, said he got drugs from Salim Yakub Kara and Ali Yakub Kara, both natives of Salaya town near Jamnagar. When police raided their residences, they found another 47 packets of drugs, contents of which were being verified by the forensic team. “Dhosi had gone to jail in a murder case earlier and Salim Kara had been arrested in the past in NDPS, fake currency and Arms Act cases,” Rajkot range IG Sandeep Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drugs-from-pakistan-worth-300-crore-seized-in-gujarats-dwarka-district/articleshow/87636990.cms||---
---||Goa||AAP alleges `70L scam in Iffi tenders||Panaji: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the government of fixing tenders of the international film festival of India (Iffi). The party alleged that painting work worth Rs 70 lakh that was tendered has already been completed and demanded an investigation. “PWD had put a work order of external painting worth Rs 70 lakh. The tenders were to have been submitted by 3pm on Tuesday and opened on Wednesday, at 11am. But the problem here is that all the work of external painting has been completed. Our simple question is, what is the work left for money to be spent on,” vice president Valmiki Naik said. The party urged the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), which is a state agency of Iffi, to cancel the tenders. “Iffi venues, which are government property, are painted completely without the work order. Surprisingly, the vice chairman, managing director and CEO are not aware of this,” Naik said. AAP has demanded an investigation into the matter and an answer within 24 hours, failing which it has threatened to hold a dharna in front of the chief minister’s house. Taleigao assembly incharge, Cecille Rodrigues said, “Rules are only for common people. The government is blatantly using their power.” AAP joint secretary Sunil Signapurkar said, “This incident proved the former governor of Goa Satyapal Malik’s statement about the corruption in the state government. I request PWD officers to cancel the tenders.” Meanwhile, AAP office in Calangute was inaugurated on Tuesday by the party’s state convener Rahul Mhambre along with Calangute in-charge Manuel Cardozo, panchayat member Sudesh Mayekar and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-alleges-70l-scam-in-iffi-tenders/articleshow/87635780.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||All of Delhi except Lutyens’ is now a vending zone: HC||NEW DELHI: All of Delhi except the Lutyens’ part has become a vending zone today, an anguished Delhi high court said on Wednesday, adding that there was “no political or executive will” to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the city’s streets. “Why spare Lutyens' zone? Why should we be exempted? Let them come to Prithviraj Road, let them be in front of President’s House, the high court. Why leave this area, we all should face it,” an annoyed HC remarked when Delhi Police claimed it was the sheer numbers of hawkers/vendors in Chandni Chowk that overwhelmed its best efforts to remove them from no vending zones. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which was examining if the Street Vendors Act, 2014 unduly favoured vendors, was monitoring steps taken by the authorities to finish redevelopment work in Chandni Chowk. “If there is no political and executive will, then let it go the way it has to. Why should we be bothered? We are getting a feeling of complete defeat in this matter,” observed the court, while pulling up police and telling its counsel the reason why vendors were not being removed was because they must be paying “hafta”. The court was hearing a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking directions to the authorities to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from no-hawking and no-squatting areas. “We have too many loose ends in the scheme, too many loose ends on the ground. We need to find a permanent solution,” it added. The bench noted, “People have become habituated to hawking even though it is a no-hawking and no-vending zone. A large population is unemployed and they find it easier to hawk and vend to meet their livelihood needs.” It added that vending was recognised as a fundamental right. “But it has to be regulated, so there is no littering, pedestrians get right of way on pavements and hawking ceases to be a nuisance, which it is currently,” it stated. North Delhi Municipal Corporation was directed to immediately start the process of preparation of the street vending plan for which experts from the field of planning should be involved, including from School of Planning and Architecture, IIT, PWD and other bodies. The municipality was asked to file a status report indicating the steps taken in this regard. The court made it clear that the civic body’s commissioner shall be personally responsible for complying with this direction and listed the matter for hearing on December 6. Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli informed the court that despite repeated directions for installation of 330 cameras, not a single one has been installed by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-of-delhi-except-lutyens-is-now-a-vending-zone-hc/articleshow/87634542.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Goa||Goa: Calangute panchayat launches app for locals||PANAJI: With the Calangute panchayat launching a smartphone app, villagers can now get their day-to-day panchayat-related works done on a button click. With it, the civic body has become the only panchayat to develop it own app. From house tax payments to registration of new business establishments, the app currently caters to the village residents and businesspersons’ needs. It will soon have features like maps and store locators for the benefit of tourists. Other panchayats have websites. The app was conceptualised by sarpanch Shawn Martins and software developer Benedict Lobo. “Besides the various services of the panchayat, users can also pay their electricity bills and other financial services. We have tied up with a payment gateway of HDFC bank to ensure smooth tractions. Alerts and announcements about the village panchayat events are also notified via the app,” Lobo said. The Calangute website and the app feature the same information. The platform also features the number of houses, number of business establishments and the status of payment for services such as garbage pick-up, renewal of taxes, and the number of days due for payment renewal. Attempts will also be made to digitise the trade licences of the various business establishments. The IT team will upgrade the app, following a green signal from the panchayat, to develop unique QR codes for each business establishment in the jurisdiction, which will be pasted in the form of a sticker. The panch inspectors will, therefore, be able to check the licence by scanning the QR code and verifying the business’ trade licence. “This will also help legalise all the shops unregistered with the panchayat and allow the panchayat to collect a higher revenue. Once we get an ‘okay’ from them, we will be able to add this feature,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-panchayat-launches-app-for-locals/articleshow/87635800.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Goa||‘New entrants to Congress should not get tickets’||Margao: South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on Wednesday reiterated his stance that Congress should give tickets for the 2022 assembly elections to only those party workers who have worked for the party, and not to new entrants. “Anybody is free to join, but they shouldn’t be given the tickets. These are the aspirations of the party workers. I am sure the high command will take a decision (about ticket allocation) in the interest of the party and its workers,” Sardinha said. His statement came in response to a query over reports about several legislators planning to join Congress. Over the issue of Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) insisting on its NOC for setting up beach shacks, he said, “It’s very unfortunate. Let them mind their own business of running the port and nothing else.” Sardinha said that the government’s assurance of restarting mining in the state was yet another false promise. “Mining dependents were happy during the Congress government. BJP is giving only false assurances,” he said. He congratulated the government for lowering the prices of petrol and diesel, but said it was “unfortunate” that the LPG gas rates weren’t dropped. “The government opened its eyes too late, only after Congress and opposition parties protested,” he said. He slammed the chief minister for his failure to live up to his assurance of removing all potholes by November 1. “I want to tell the CM, you are doing a favour to none. It’s your duty to get the roads repaired as people are paying road taxes. It is the right of the people to get good roads. Goa is a tourist state, and we want tourists to return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-entrants-to-congress-should-not-get-tickets/articleshow/87635805.cms||---
---||World||US Capitol rioter gets 41 months in prison, longest sentence imposed||WASHINGTON: A former mixed martial artist filmed punching a police officer during the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol received a 41-month prison sentence on Wednesday, the stiffest punishment yet in the almost 700 criminal cases stemming from the siege. US District Judge Royce Lamberth cited the seriousness of New Jersey gym owner Scott Fairlamb's conduct when he sentenced him. Fairlamb was captured screaming at officers by their body-worn cameras before shoving one and then punching him in the face and pleaded guilty in August. "Had you gone to trial, I don't think there's any jury that could have acquitted you," the judge told Fairlamb. Fairlamb was the first rioter sentenced for violence against police during the attack. Lamberth noted that his sentence will be a benchmark for the more than 120 defendants charged with attacking police during the Capitol assault by thousands of Donald Trump supporters trying to overturn his election defeat. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after the riot and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. About 140 police officers were injured. Fairlamb's lawyer had asked Lamberth to "take into consideration the approximate 11 months his client has already served in custody" and not add additional time. An emotional Fairlamb addressed the judge during the hearing, saying he brought shame upon his family's name. "I have nothing but remorse," Fairlamb said, later adding: "I just hope you show some mercy on me, sir." Federal prosecutors had recommended a 44-month sentence. Justice Department lawyer Leslie Goemaat highlighted Fairlamb's martial arts training during Wednesday's hearing, as well as earlier run-ins with the law. "He was trained to throw a punch and was well aware of the injury he could cause," Goemaat said. Goemaat also mentioned a video Fairlamb recorded during the riots in which he said: “What Patriots do? We fuckin’ disarm them and then we storm the fuckin’ Capitol!” "The defendant's own statements on that day suggest that he came prepared for violence," Goemaat said. 'Qanon Shaman' sentencing next week Most of the guilty pleas in Jan. 6 prosecutions have been in cases involving non-violent misdemeanors, but government lawyers are now seeking prison sentences for some defendants facing more serious felony charges. Prosecutors in a late-night court filing recommended a four-year, three-month sentence for Jacob Chansley, the participant in the Jan. 6 riots nicknamed the "QAnon Shaman." Lamberth, who is also handling Chansley's case, will sentence him on Nov. 17. Chansley’s attorney, Albert Watkins, said in a Tuesday court filing that Chansley should be released "as soon as possible," noting that he will have spent more than 10 months in pretrial detention. "I can say with confidence that Mr. Chansley is in dire need of mental health treatment," Watkins said in the filing, adding that further time behind bars "jeopardizes his mental stability." Some 210 people have been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police officers or employees during the attack, the Justice Department said. Four people have pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement. The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech in which Trump repeated his false claims that his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump's own administration have rejected those claims as unfounded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-capitol-rioter-gets-41-months-in-prison-longest-sentence-imposed/articleshow/87634791.cms||---

"What is the reason behind Government of India's silence on this? Rahul Gandhi had asked to constitute a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) so if there is no foul play then why government hesitates to constitute a JPC?" said Baghel. Congress party has alleged that the BJP-led government is running away from the probe into the matter. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra on Tuesday slammed Congress for alleged corruption in the Rafale deal in the period between 2007 to 2012 following fresh media reports. Congress has said that the UPA government had negotiated the purchase of one Rafale fighter aircraft including transfer of technology for Rs 526.10 crore after an international tender for procuring 126 aircraft. The BJP-led government decided to buy 36 Rafale aircraft off the shelf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-centre-hesitates-to-constitute-jpc-in-rafale-deal-matter-asks-bhupesh-baghel/articleshow/87634920.cms||---

The Declaration emphasised that Afghanistan’s territory shouldn’t be used for "sheltering, training, planning or financing" any terrorist act while reiterating support for a peaceful, secure and stable Afghanistan. With several countries sharing concerns about terrorist groups active in Afghanistan and their benefactors, it also stressed respect for sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity and also non-interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Read AlsoAfghanistan conference: India looks to forge consensus on terror, legitimacy, aidNSA Ajit Doval set the tone for India’s conference on Afghanistan with discussions Tuesday on enhanced terror threat from the country, and also the looming humanitarian crisis it's facing, with his Tajikistan and Uzbekistan counterparts. Both central Asian countries share a border with AfghanistanThe conference chaired by NSA Ajit Doval saw the participants discussing the evolving security situation in Afghanistan and its regional and global implications while calling for efforts to ensure Afghanistan didn’t turn into a safe haven for global terrorism. Official sources said participating countries acknowledged India’s concerns over cross-border terrorism perpetrated by Pakistan based groups who are also active in Afghanistan. Read AlsoAfter Pakistan, China also skips meet on Afghanistan hosted by IndiaChina and Pakistan will be missing when the national security chiefs of seven key regional countries gather here on Wednesday for a security dialogue on Afghanistan. The day-long event, the first being hosted by India, will focus on terrorism and related security challenges and uncertaintiesAccording to sources, the participants also stressed that no one should boycott the NSA dialogue process due to the "bilateral agenda". Both China and Pakistan had turned down India's invite to the conference. The NSAs also called on PM Narendra Modi and were said to have had a substantive exchange with him as PM shared India's perspective on Afghanistan. Read AlsoAfghanistan soil shouldn’t be used to target others: India &amp; RussiaNEW DELHI: The NSA conference on Afghanistan on Wednesday saw India and Russia joining others in underlining the importance of ensuring the rights of women, children and national minorities in Afghanistan. They condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and underscored that the"The sides paid special attention to the current political situation in Afghanistan and threats arising from terrorism, radicalisation and drug trafficking as well as the need for humanitarian assistance’’ said the Declaration issued shortly after the conference that saw participation by 7 countries, including Russia and Iran, apart from India. The conference is seen as an important step by India to underline its role in regional efforts for peace and stability in Afghanistan and to remain relevant despite the Kabul takeover by a traditionally inimical Taliban. Russia, as Doval said in his opening remarks, was the initiator of the idea for a conference. According to the Declaration, the countries stressed the necessity of forming an open and truly inclusive government that represented the will of all the people of Afghanistan and had representation from all sections of their society, including major "ethnopolitical forces’’ in the country. "Inclusion of all sections of the society in the administrative and political structure is imperative for the successful national reconciliation process in the country,’’ said the participating countries. There was an understanding that it was important for the Taliban to address this issue before the international community could consider recognising their government. On terrorism, the Declaration said, they condemned in the strongest terms all terrorist activities and reaffirmed their firm commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its financing, the dismantling of terrorist infrastructure and countering radicalization, to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a safe haven for global terrorism. They also called for collective cooperation against the menace of radicalisation, extremism, separatism and drug trafficking in the region. The conference emphasised that the fundamental rights of women, children and minority communities are not violated and expressed concern over the deteriorating socio-economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan while underlining the need to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to the Afghans. “Reiterated that humanitarian assistance should be provided in an unimpeded, direct and assured manner to Afghanistan and that the assistance is distributed within the country in a non-discriminatory manner across all sections of the Afghan society,’’ said the Declaration. This is significant as India’s proposal for transporting 50,000 MT wheat to Afghanistan via Pakistan is still pending with Islamabad. "The NSAs noted the need to provide humanitarian assistance and emphasized that the land and air routes should be made available and no one should impede the process," said a source. Recalling the relevant UN resolutions on Afghanistan, the participants noted that the UN had a central role to play in Afghanistan and that its continued presence in the country must be preserved. They also expressed deep concern over the suffering of the people of Afghanistan arising from the security situation in Afghanistan and condemned the terrorist attacks in Kunduz, Kandahar and Kabul. Official sources said the meeting exceeded India's expectations as they highlighted that this was the only dialogue at the level of NSAs and that there was complete unanimity on the need to continue this process and have regular consultations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/allow-unimpeded-aid-into-afghanistan-say-nsas-in-delhi-declaration/articleshow/87634736.cms||Sachin Parashar

The tobacco industry is using Facebook to facilitate bidi sales, openly leveraging social media platforms to advertise harmful products, in violation of India’s tobacco control legislation, says a study. The report `Selling Death on Social Media: How Bidis Are Reaching Consumers Online’ by Vital Strategies, a global public health organization, details digital media monitoring data with 344 instances of bidi marketing on social media between December 2020 and August 2021, almost exclusively through Facebook (98%). The study highlights social media marketing by tobacco and bidi companies as a growing public health concern, especially as evidence shows that it leads to an increased likelihood of tobacco use among youth. Of the 267 million tobacco users in India, over one-fourth smoke bidis, with nearly half (47%) of users smoking their first bidi before their 10th birthday. Easily accessible throughout the country and cheaper than cigarettes, it is estimated that eight times as many bidis as cigarettes are sold in India. Under India’s national tobacco control law, the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco is banned across platforms, including marketing on the internet. Ironically, all tobacco products are marketed on the internet where restrictions are more difficult to enforce, though the marketing strategies used for each product vary. Bidi companies tend to use direct marketing to sell their products online. This is a concern because exposure to bidi marketing leads to an increased likelihood of use among new and current consumers, the study says. Facebook hosts at least 30 distinct pages for bidi companies, with many of these companies appearing to be utilizing Facebook pages to facilitate sales, the study found. Bidis are being openly marketed on social media with clear pictures of the product in nearly 80% of cases. In contrast, most tobacco products are promoted inconspicuously or in more clandestine ways, to comply with existing laws, the report says. This is because the bidi industry continues to be less regulated than cigarettes, and hence faces less scrutiny. Nandita Murukutla, VP, Global Policy and Research Vital Strategies, said: “The evidence is clear: tobacco marketing increases tobacco use. This evidence formed the basis for national and international regulations that ban or restrict the advertising of tobacco. When the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control went into effect in 2005, ... social media use was in its infancy. As advertising regulations in traditional media have taken hold, the industry is migrating its marketing online where national regulations have been less clear. This report is a call to action for governments to surveil and address tobacco marketing on digital media. It is also a call for social media companies, Facebook in particular, to close down tobacco marketing that facilitates sales of this deadly product.” Amit Yadav, senior technical advisor tobacco control at The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease said, “We must address online bidi marketing so that offline enforcement is more effective’’. India is both the second largest producer and consumer of tobacco products worldwide. Bidi smoke delivers more tar, carbon monoxide and nicotine than other cigarettes, and severely increases the risk for several cancers, coronary heart disease and heart attacks, several global studies have warned. Our findings confirm that smokeless tobacco products were marketed most often on Instagram (42%), followed by Facebook (39%) and YouTube (12%), while smoking tobacco products were marketed on Facebook (53%), followed by Instagram (31%) and Twitter (10%), it adds. Over the last few years, social media use has grown among India’s rural community—where bidis are particularly popular— to 299 million active internet users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bidi-tobacco-companies-use-social-media-platforms-to-advertise-and-up-sales/articleshow/87635041.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||India||As fresh whistleblower leaks points to Facebook laxity in India, government promises action||NEW DELHI: As concerns rise over Facebook’s inability to contain hate speech and polarising content in India over lax oversight and despite repeated warnings issued by internal staff, the government said it will take action against social-media giants for lapses, even as the current IT Act – that came into force in 2001 – may soon be drafted anew to factor in societal threats, technological advancements and ensure user safety and security. “You can't have the cyberspace as the wild west where there are no rules and no laws apply," Junior IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said while speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021. The minister said that accountability needs to be driven in the way the social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter monitor inciteful and hateful content, especially as much of it has the potential to create discord in the society. “So, it is an evolution for these intermediaries (social media platforms) to go from a belief that the cyberspace space has no jurisdiction and no laws to one where countries are cooperating in creating a set of rules.” The minister’s views come at a time when there are fresh concerns over Facebook’s inability to monitor hateful and inciteful content in India with new reports pointing out that the company’s senior global officials didn’t read much into the concerns raised by their own internal staff between 2018 and 2020. The concerns have come out through revelations made by former Facebook data scientist and whistleblower Frances Haugen in various submissions before regulators in the US. When contacted, an India spokesperson for Facebook’s parent Meta said that teams within the company have developed an “industry-leading process of reviewing and prioritizing” which countries have the highest risk of offline harm and violence every six months. “We make these determinations in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and following a review of societal harms, how much Facebook’s products impact these harms and critical events on the ground,” the Meta spokesperson said. The company claimed that it had hate speech classifiers in Hindi and Bengali from 2018. “Classifiers for violence and incitement in Hindi and Bengali first came online in early 2021.” Minister Chandrasekhar has previously said that effective checks should be maintained to guard against instances of hate crime, fake news, cyber bullying, child pornography, and also unlawful content around children and women. The updated IT Rules for social-media companies, announced in February this year, were a step in this direction, he added. He said that making rules for social media companies does not mean unfairly controlling their working. “I have made it very clear that the government has no intention in getting into anything to do with the internet and intermediaries, creative work and innovation, and investment. We have no role except to ensure that the internet always remains open, it is safe and trusted by those who use it, and in the Indian context. I can assure you that this government is committed to keeping the internet open. It is only interested in ensuring the internet remains safe, trusted and accountable to its users.” On getting a new IT law in place, he said that the current law was made in 2001, and was later amended in 2008. “It is almost 21 years old, which means for centuries in the internet age… It is absolutely clear in my mind that as a nation that is heavily invested in technology, for whom the internet is a big part of our digital economy, we will need to evolve our laws and we will need to get more modern laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-fresh-whistleblower-leaks-points-to-facebook-laxity-in-india-government-promises-action/articleshow/87635104.cms||Pankaj Doval

On November 5, three people were killed in Arnia when assailants opened fire at them. “Two of them had succumbed on the spot while the third died during treatment. Another person also sustained bullet injuries,” Jammu SSP Chandan Kohli said. “Following the attack, the assailants had stashed the weapons in a hideout and fled the spot,” said the SSP, adding that a case was subsequently registered under relevant sections of the law, and an SIT constituted to probe the crime. “On November 8, the wife of one of the prime accused, Sadeeq Choudhary, was questioned and she led police to the hideout from where the weapons were recovered,” the SSP said. “Today (Wednesday), the SIT received information about the movement of the accused and formed three teams to trace them. The trio was caught from the outskirts of Kathua,” SSP Kohli said. “The arrested include Sadeeq Choudhary of Arnia, Bhupinder Singh of RS Pura and their accomplice Gulab Din of Samba, who had been harbouring the two prime accused,” the SSP said. Sadeeq earlier worked in the police department and was dismissed from service in 2019, while Gulab Din alias Ghaisa is a wanted criminal with a string of cases against him, he added. “A revolver along with 10 cartridges was recovered from Bhupinder and four vehicles used in the crime were seized,” SSP Kohli said, adding: “Based on information obtained from the trio, police raided Bhupinder’s house and recovered 12 bore guns, some sharp-edged weapons, 10g heroin and Rs 2 lakh cash.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arnia-shootout-three-arrested-weapons-recovered/articleshow/87635197.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Pakistan Supreme Court questions PM Imran Khan over army school massacre case||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday grilled prime minister Imran Khan in the Army Public School massacre case, questioning his government for holding peace talks with the very terrorist group that had carried out the deadly attack on the Peshawar school in 2014, and ordered the PM to probe security lapses leading up to the assault. In December 2014, a total of 147 people, 132 of them children, were killed when Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) terrorists stormed the school. Khan’s government, however, is currently in talks with TTP and as part of the reconciliation process it has already announced a complete ceasefire with the banned outfit. In a rare move, Khan appeared before the court on the orders of a three-judge SC bench headed by chief justice Gulzar Ahmed. With regards to media reports regarding negotiations with the TTP, the bench questioned whether “we are bringing them (TTP) back to the negotiating table instead of taking action against them?” “Are we going to surrender once again?” one of the judges, justice Qazi Mohammad Amin, asked the PM. Khan was asked to explain his government’s actions against officials involved in the school’s security. He replied that he was not the country’s PM when the attack took place. It prompted the chief justice to ask him what his government has done in the past three years to redress the grievances of the families of the victims. “You issue order and we will take action,” Khan told the bench, adding that the relatives of the victims were compensated. At this, the chief justice remarked that the parents wanted their children and not compensation. The court informed the PM that the victims’ parents want action against officials who were posted at high-ranking positions at the time of the attack. At one point of time, the debate over fixing responsibility became heated when Khan said before the court: “Find out why 80,000 people were killed. Also, find out who is responsible for 480 drone attacks taking place in Pakistan.” The chief justice responded: “Finding out about these things is your job, you are the prime minister. As the prime minister, you should have the answer to these questions.” During the hearing, the bench asked the federal government to listen to the stance of the victims’ parents, saying action should be taken against anyone whose negligence was proven. The apex court also directed the government to submit a report, signed by the PM, in this regard in four weeks. The SC order came after years of protests by parents and relatives of the children who had lost their loved ones in the attack. The families are also protesting the government’s efforts to strike a peace deal with TTP. Khan’s appearance is the first time since 2012 that a sitting prime minister had been asked to appear before the top court. Raja Pervez Ashraf, the then prime minister from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), was asked to appear in connection with a graft inquiry against former president Asif Ali Zardari. Khan’s grilling by the top court happened days after his government’s surrender to the far-right Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which was behind anti-France protests over the publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad last year there. The TLP was believed to be covertly supported by the country’s powerful military establishment. The government-TLP tussle was preceded by Khan’s tug-of-war with the top military brass over the appointment of the country’s new ISI chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-questions-pm-imran-khan-over-army-school-massacre-case/articleshow/87635250.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Civilian, cop injured in grenade attack in old Srinagar city||SRINAGAR: A civilian and a policeman were injured on Wednesday evening when terrorists threw a hand grenade near Aali Masjid in Eidgah area of old Srinagar, the third terror attack in four days in the city. The police said the terrorists had meant to target the CRPF post in the area but the grenade fell on the road. The injured were civilian Aijaz Ahmad Bhat of Srinagar’s Hawal locality and policeman Sajad Ahmad Bhat of Narwara Eidgah, the police said. The cop was in civvies and, therefore, probably not the target, the police said. Terrorists had killed a cop in Batamallo on Sunday, and a civilian, a salesman for a Kashmiri Pandit shopkeeper at Bohri Kadal in Srinagar town, on Monday. While a top J&K police officer refused to say that Monday’s killing of salesman Mohammed Ibrahim Khan (45) was communal in nature, the owner of the shop, Sandeep Mawa claimed that the attack was meant to send a message to Muslims to refrain from working at businesses owned by Kashmiri Pandits. The senior J&K police officer said Mawa’s version was baseless and that sleeper cells of hybrid terrorists have returned to selective killings since October 2021 after top terrorist commanders were killed in combat operations this year. Sandeep Mawa, a doctor by training who runs the Srinagar-based business of his father, Roshan Lal Mawa, who lives in New Delhi, owns a house in Karan Nagar, Srinagar. Sandeep Mawa said he occasionally visited his grocery shop at Bohri Kadal in central Srinagar and had presented a car to Ibrahim Khan, his salesman, for his selfless service to the Mawa family for the last 13 years. The senior police officer said Mawa had been provided adequate security cover, with two PSOs always accompanying him, and tat he had been alerted after the recent targeted killings in the valley. Mawa has said this incident will not scare him into leaving the Kashmir valley. "I will stay back in Kashmir under all circumstances. I lost my uncle, M L Bindroo, a pharmacy owner, to terrorists’ bullets on October 5 this year, but these incidents will not scare me into migrating out of here," Mawa said. He added that the had left Kashmir in the early 1990s but had returned in 1998 and would not leave again Mawa claimed the killing at his shop was a case of mistaken identity as the assailants thought it was he who had got into the car when it was actually Ibrahim. "Interestingly, the assailants had switched off all the streetlights in the area before attacking the man in the car," Mawa alleged. A senior officer said the police was ready to review Mawa’s security cover and provide more men to guard him if it felt it was needed. Mawa said he was "really concerned" about Ibrahim Khan’s family. "We are planning to help the family, his wife and two children, so that they have a comfortable life ahead," Mama said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/civilian-cop-injured-in-grenade-attack-in-old-srinagar-city/articleshow/87635279.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Parcel revenue stood at Rs 174.40 crore during April-October 2021, which is 220% more than that of Rs 54.57 crore in the corresponding period last year. Around 4.01 lakh tonnes of goods were transported during April to October 2021,” an official said. The growth in parcel traffic is mainly driven by successful running of Kisan Rail carrying perishable traffic to the far-flung markets of the country. In Financial year 2021-22 (April to October), the Kisan Rail has made 497 trips to various destinations transporting 1.80 lakh tonnes of goods and earning a revenue of Rs 69.22 crore. Since inception, 724 trips of Kisan Rails have been made, transporting 2.51 lakh tonnes, generating a revenue of 98.18 crore. Anil Kumar Lahoti, general manager of Central Railway, said that parcel transportation by rail is the safest, quickest and the most environment-friendly option available for customers. “Central Railway’s efforts in setting up of Business Development Units in all its divisions have provided easy access to businessmen, traders and dealers to transport their goods quickly,” he said. In addition to time-tabled and indent-based Kisan Rails, Parcel Cargo Express Train has also been running successfully. “Performance of divisions in parcels has been very encouraging too. Mumbai division is leading in parcel revenue by generating Rs 65.86 crores, followed by Bhusawal division with Rs 53.30 crore. Solapur division has led the way in incremental traffic by achieving a percentage growth of 547% with revenue of Rs 29.68 crore against Rs 4.59 crore during the corresponding period last year. Sangola in Solapur division has become a hub for Kisan Rail. In addition to the 19 stations for parcel traffic under Central Railway, three more stations — Rahuri, Dehu Road and Kasbesukane — have been opened for parcel traffic in 2021-22. Besides, 79 POS machines have been installed at various Parcel Depots to ease the process of booking parcels,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/central-railway-retains-top-position-in-generating-parcel-revenue/articleshow/87627192.cms||Joy Sengupta

It added that 10% of Indians have only travelled within their own state. East India was the region with the highest percentage of people to have only travelled in their state. Tier-2 city dwellers are most likely to have travelled to two to five states (55%) versus 54% and 47% for Tier 3 and 1 respectively. Conversely, Tier-1 dwellers are most likely to have visited 6-10 states (30%) versus 25% of Tier 2 and 3 residents, said the survey by Agoda.  When it comes to age groups, 35-44-year-olds are more likely to have travelled to two to five states versus the 45+ age group. “Less than 1% of respondents have travelled to all 28 states,’’ the survey said.  Forty-eight percent of Indians have visited the capital city of New Delhi, with 40% visiting Maharashtra and 31% Karnataka. Taking a deeper look at Union territories besides Delhi (48%), Chandigarh ranks number 2 on the most visited Union territories list for Indians, with Jammu and Kashmir as number 3. North Indians’ top three destinations were within the region itself, with 73% having visited the number one spot, Delhi, 58% taking to Uttar Pradesh (number 2), and 46% to Haryana (number 3), the survey said.  Similarly, south Indians have travelled most within the region. Tamil Nadu took number one spot with 66%, Karnataka at number two with 57% and number three, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala with 55%. East Indians top spot were West Bengal (67%), Delhi (44%), and Bihar (42%), the survey said.  The top two destinations for each city tier were Delhi and Maharashtra, but for Tier 2 cities, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh take the joint third spot. At the same time, Tamil Nadu is the third spot for Tier-3 city dwellers, the survey found.  The top three motivations and purposes to travel were scenery (68%), food (50%) and arts and culture (43%). “Female respondents were more likely than their male counterparts to be motivated to travel for scenery (females 73% - male 64%), and food (females 54% - male 48%). Male Indian respondents were more likely than females to be motivated to travel for history (females 34% and males 40%) and sports (females 20% - males 30%),” said the survey. Scenery was a top draw for all respondents, but most for 35–44-year-olds at 75%.  Friends’ recommendations were the primary source of travel inspiration. “When it comes to getting travel inspiration by region, South Indians were the most likely to be inspired by friends and family, followed by those from the West, North, and East,” it said. When it comes to social media, those respondents from the West were most likely to get inspired by social media than any other region, followed by North and South Indians in joint second and East in the fourth spot, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-most-visited-destination-for-indians-survey/articleshow/87635415.cms||---
---||World||China, US pledge to enhance climate cooperation at UN talks||GLASGOW: The world’s top two carbon polluters, China and the United States, pledged Wednesday to increase their cooperation on climate action in a joint declaration issued at UN climate talks in Glasgow. In separate news conferences, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and US counterpart John Kerry said the two countries would work together to accelerate the emissions reductions required to meet the temperature goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. “The whole point of this is that the steps we’re taking we believe can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going and help China and us to be able to accelerate our efforts,” Kerry said. Governments agreed in Paris to jointly reduce emissions enough to keep the global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, with a more stringent target of trying to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) preferred. Both sides recognize that there is a gap between efforts taken globally to reduce emissions and the goals of the Paris deal, Xie said. “So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations,” he said. The joint declaration came as governments from around the world were negotiating in Glasgow about how to build on the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of global warming. A draft deal released Wednesday calls for pulling the plug on coal power, the single biggest source of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. The early version of the final document also expresses “alarm and concern” about how much Earth has already warmed and urges countries to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about half by 2030. Pledges so far from governments don’t add up to that frequently stated goal. Read AlsoChina says agreed with US to boost cooperation on climate changeGLASGOW: China's top climate negotiator on Wednesday said Beijing had agreed with the United States to boost cooperation on climate action, including by tackling emissions of methane. Speaking through an interpreter, Xie Zhenhua told reporters at the UN climate conference in Glasgow that China wouldSome nations, especially island states whose very existence is threatened by climate change, warned that the draft didn’t go far enough in requiring action to limit increases in global temperatures — or in helping poorer countries to pay for adapting to the warming and for losses from it. “‘Urging,’ ‘calling,’ ‘encouraging,’ and ‘inviting’ is not the decisive language that this moment calls for,” Aubrey Webson, Antigua and Barbuda’s UN ambassador, said in a statement. Read AlsoChina climate pact a vote for successful COP26: US climate envoy KerryGLASGOW: US climate envoy John Kerry said on Wednesday an agreement with China was a statement of support for a successful United Nations' climate summit, with both taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elementsWith time running out in the climate summit, a clear message had to be sent, he added: “To our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you and we are taking this seriously.” Meeting the Paris goals would require a dramatic reduction in emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas that remain the world’s top source of energy despite the growth of renewables like wind and solar power. But setting deadlines for phasing out fossil fuels is highly sensitive to countries that still depend on them for economic growth, including China and India, and to major exporters of coal such as Australia. The future of coal is also a hot-button issue in the US, where a spat among Democrats has held up one of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bills. The draft calls for accelerating “the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels,” though it sets no timeline. Greenpeace International director Jennifer Morgan, a long-time climate talks observer, said that the call in the draft to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels would be a first in a UN climate deal, but the lack of a timeline would limit the pledge’s effectiveness. “This isn’t the plan to solve the climate emergency. This won’t give the kids on the streets the confidence that they’ll need,” Morgan said. European Union climate chief Frans Timmermans was more upbeat about the negotiations. “We’re ready and willing to make sure we deliver on the highest possible levels of ambition, leading to prompt global action,” he said. The draft is likely to change, but it doesn’t yet include full agreements on the three major goals that the U.N. set going into the negotiations: for rich nations to give poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate aid, to ensure that half of that money goes to adapting to worsening global warming, and the pledge to slash global carbon emissions by 2030. The draft acknowledges “with regret” that rich nations have failed to live up to the climate finance pledge. Currently they are providing around $80 billion a year, which poorer nations that need financial help both in developing green energy systems and adapting to the worst of climate change say isn’t enough. Papua New Guinea Environment Minister Wera Mori said given the lack of financial aid that his country may “rethink” efforts to cut logging, coal mining and even coming to the U.N. talks. The draft says the world should try to achieve “net-zero (emissions) around mid-century,” a target that was endorsed by leaders of the Group of 20 biggest economies in a summit just before the Glasgow talks. That means requiring countries to pump only as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means. Highlighting the challenge of meeting those goals, the document “expresses alarm and concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 C (2 F) of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region.” Separate draft proposals were also released on other issues being debated at the talks, including rules for international carbon markets and the frequency by which countries have to report on their efforts. The draft calls on countries that don’t have national goals that are in line with the 1.5- or 2-degree limits to come back with stronger targets next year. Depending on how the language is interpreted, the provision could apply to most countries. “This is crucial language,” World Resources Institute International Climate Initiative Director David Waskow said. “Countries really are expected and are on the hook to do something in that timeframe to adjust.’’ In a nod to one of the big issues for poorer countries, the draft vaguely “urges” developed nations to compensate developing countries for “loss and damage,” a phrase that some rich nations don’t like. But there are no concrete financial commitments. Britain’s Alok Sharma, who is chairing the negotiations, acknowledged that “significant issues remain unresolved.” “My big, big ask of all of you is to please come armed with the currency of compromise,” he told negotiators. “What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and I know that we will not want to fail them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-us-pledge-to-enhance-climate-cooperation-at-un-talks/articleshow/87635510.cms||---

Read AlsoChina climate pact a vote for successful COP26: US climate envoy KerryGLASGOW: US climate envoy John Kerry said on Wednesday an agreement with China was a statement of support for a successful United Nations' climate summit, with both taking a step towards closing the emissions gap. "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elementsWith time running out in the climate summit, a clear message had to be sent, he added: “To our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you and we are taking this seriously.” Meeting the Paris goals would require a dramatic reduction in emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas that remain the world’s top source of energy despite the growth of renewables like wind and solar power. But setting deadlines for phasing out fossil fuels is highly sensitive to countries that still depend on them for economic growth, including China and India, and to major exporters of coal such as Australia. The future of coal is also a hot-button issue in the US, where a spat among Democrats has held up one of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bills. The draft calls for accelerating “the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels,” though it sets no timeline. Greenpeace International director Jennifer Morgan, a long-time climate talks observer, said that the call in the draft to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels would be a first in a UN climate deal, but the lack of a timeline would limit the pledge’s effectiveness. “This isn’t the plan to solve the climate emergency. This won’t give the kids on the streets the confidence that they’ll need,” Morgan said. European Union climate chief Frans Timmermans was more upbeat about the negotiations. “We’re ready and willing to make sure we deliver on the highest possible levels of ambition, leading to prompt global action,” he said. The draft is likely to change, but it doesn’t yet include full agreements on the three major goals that the U.N. set going into the negotiations: for rich nations to give poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate aid, to ensure that half of that money goes to adapting to worsening global warming, and the pledge to slash global carbon emissions by 2030. The draft acknowledges “with regret” that rich nations have failed to live up to the climate finance pledge. Currently they are providing around $80 billion a year, which poorer nations that need financial help both in developing green energy systems and adapting to the worst of climate change say isn’t enough. Papua New Guinea Environment Minister Wera Mori said given the lack of financial aid that his country may “rethink” efforts to cut logging, coal mining and even coming to the U.N. talks. The draft says the world should try to achieve “net-zero (emissions) around mid-century,” a target that was endorsed by leaders of the Group of 20 biggest economies in a summit just before the Glasgow talks. That means requiring countries to pump only as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means. Highlighting the challenge of meeting those goals, the document “expresses alarm and concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 C (2 F) of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region.” Separate draft proposals were also released on other issues being debated at the talks, including rules for international carbon markets and the frequency by which countries have to report on their efforts. The draft calls on countries that don’t have national goals that are in line with the 1.5- or 2-degree limits to come back with stronger targets next year. Depending on how the language is interpreted, the provision could apply to most countries. “This is crucial language,” World Resources Institute International Climate Initiative Director David Waskow said. “Countries really are expected and are on the hook to do something in that timeframe to adjust.’’ In a nod to one of the big issues for poorer countries, the draft vaguely “urges” developed nations to compensate developing countries for “loss and damage,” a phrase that some rich nations don’t like. But there are no concrete financial commitments. Britain’s Alok Sharma, who is chairing the negotiations, acknowledged that “significant issues remain unresolved.” “My big, big ask of all of you is to please come armed with the currency of compromise,” he told negotiators. “What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and I know that we will not want to fail them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/china-us-pledge-to-enhance-climate-cooperation-at-un-talks/articleshow/87635448.cms||---

Ella’s remarks at the Times Now Summit 2021 on Wednesay will further animate the discussion on the subject, as so far, the government and some experts are of the view that a booster dose is not urgent and ensuring full vaccination with two doses remains a priority. Some nations, though, have initiated booster doses for their elderly population.

Hinting at politics as a possible factor behind the negative reports, Ella recalled how soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the Covaxin shot to express confidence in Indian science, innovation and ‘atma-nirbhar’ capabilities, it was labelled by some as a ‘BJP vaccine’ or ‘Modi vaccine’. In a Q&A session, Ella indicated that the nasal Covid vaccine being developed by Bharat Biotech could be taken in lieu of the second dose of Covaxin or to protect previously infected persons. Spelling hope for a mask-free future, he said that the nasal vaccine was more effective in preventing transmission of the virus as compared to an injectable vaccine which does not reach the upper lungs and could eliminate the need for a vaccinated individual to continue wearing a mask.

Shah also inaugurated the Times NowProbed on the long-drawn scrutiny by the WHO on Covaxin, Ella said, “The negative things (said about Covaxin) in the country put WHO in a little awkward position”. He said WHO wanted to be sure if it was doing right or wrong and so reviewed data more intensely, with every small issue becoming a major one. “I think probably we are the only vaccine in WHO that has gone through so much scrutiny... We have gone through more scrutiny because of our internal systems also,” the CMD said.

Speaking at the Times Now summit, Rijiju saidElla rued how the campaign on Covaxin — as part of which even a suicide in Bhopal was projected as vaccine-induced death and scientific journals were asked to probe — based on own projections, interpretations and ideas delayed the publications as well as WHO pre-qualification process. He said that instead of criticising the vaccine, people could have just approached Bharat Biotech for the truth. “But (people) making own opinion...it not only hurt us, but also the future of startups in the country. If somebody wants to be against the political system of the country, they can take a different angle but not on healthcare. We are neutral, we want India to succeed. We want people to be benefited,” said the scientist-entrepreneur. On WHO withholding approval for emergency use of Covaxin in pregnant women, Ella said though more than a million expectant mothers had been administered the vaccine safely in India, WHO was really looking at data in a clinical mode. “We are on the job. We will finish it in the next 2-3 months,” said Ella. On bringing a vaccine for children, Ella said Bharat Biotech was the only company in the world to have done clinical trials among those between 2 and 18 years of age. “Safety and immunogenicity is well established in this population right now. We have submitted the data to the data controller but WHO, unless the national regulatory authority approves it, will not approve,” he said. Hinting at supply issues as one of the major constraints behind the government’s lack of decision on approval, Ella said, “Maybe, the government is thinking that if it is approved then every child has to vaccinated in the country. Are there enough supplies... But for us it is a global competition…So I think the Indian government should recognise. We need quick indication from India so that we can move WHO.” Dismissing talk of shortcuts in grant of emergency nod to Covaxin, Ella clarified that though the approval process was hastened, no provision of the Indian law or ‘Schedule Y’ rule was violated. “If anything had been violated, I would have gone to jail by now,” he said. The Bharat Biotech boss said that unlike other companies like Pfizer and Oxford, that are not into R&D and licensed the vaccine, Bharat Biotech developed the vaccine from scratch. “Had I been in the US and done all these things, I would have been better recognised,” he said with a grin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/booster-dose-after-6-months-of-2nd-covaxin-shot-ideal-bharat-biotech-cmd-krishna-ella/articleshow/87635907.cms||---

Formal joining through signing of the framework agreement of the ISA happened during a meeting between India’s environment minister Bhupender Yadav and the US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry at India’s delegation office here at COP26 venue. The meeting took place amid unresolved key issue of finance on table at the COP in the wake of the release of the first draft text of the Glasgow decision. It is learnt that both Yadav and Kerry discussed the issues of finance and carbon market (Article 6) in detail where the latter spoke about contribution of the US and other developed nations towards climate finance and promised to scale it up further as announced under the the ‘finance delivery plan’ of the developed countries. Welcoming the US to the ISA fold as a new member, Yadav said, “This move will strengthen the ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world.” The ISA was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former French president Francois Hollande on the sidelines of COP21 on November 30, 2015 in Paris.

Signing the framework agreement, Kerry, said, “It has long been coming, and we are happy to join the International Solar Alliance, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in making. We worked out the details and this is a process we are pleased to be a part of. This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries.” On the US formally joining the Alliance, Ajay Mathur, director general of the ISA, said, “The US’ endorsement of ISA’s framework and approach is an heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognizing the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source’s potential as a catalyst for global energy transition.” Earlier at COP26, the US also joined the Steering Committee of the GGI-OSOWOG comprising of five members – USA, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and India — and endorsed the ‘One Sun Declaration’ along with 80 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-signs-in-india-backed-solar-initiative-gets-a-boost/articleshow/87636168.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Basic nations oppose EU’s ‘carbon border tax’ proposal||GLASGOW: The Basic nations - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - on Wednesday strongly opposed to the EU's proposal of 'carbon border tax' and asked the affluent nations to bridge the trust deficit by fulfilling their obligation on climate finance through mobilising at least $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025 even as COP26 presidency released heavily bracketed first draft text of Glasgow decision amid key unresolved issues on table. "Any unilateral measures and discriminatory practices, such as carbon border taxes, that could result in market distortion and aggravate the trust deficit amongst Parties, must be avoided," said the BASIC ministers after the meeting, chaired by India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav. Though the ministers in their joint statement pledged their full support to the United Kingdom COP26 Presidency for a successful conference, they picked up all key issues of concerns and asked the developed countries to honour their pre-2020 commitments regarding mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, without transferring any burden and responsibility to developing countries. "The progress on the pre-2020 agenda should be the key benchmark of success of COP26," they said. Under the world’s first proposal on carbon border tax, the 27 EU nations had a few months ago decided to impose carbon border taxes on imports of carbon-intensive goods. The tax plan, yet to be legally formalised, will come into force from 2026. It is believed that the 'carbon border tax', being pushed by the EU nations, will impact manufacturing and export in developing countries, primarily in India and China. It may also be a move to protect European industries from outside competitors who can manufacture products at lower cost as they are not charged for their carbon emission during the manufacturing processes. The draft Glasgow decision, part of which would be included in final COP26 outcome, asked for commitments from 196 countries to boost their climate targets by 2023 to keep the warming limit goal of 1.5 degree Celsius alive and to submit by next year their long term decarbonisation strategies to be on promised net-zero trajectory. The brackets in the text reflect unresolved issues of finance, adaptation, loss & damage and carbon market (Article 6). On a positive note, the text for the first time called for acceleration of the phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. Though the draft, which is to be discussed by countries over the next two days to finalise the COP26 outcome, welcomed the $100 billion delivery plan, there has been no push to accelerate funding. As far as the issue of ‘loss and damage’ (compensating countries hit by extreme weather events) is concerned, it is recognised in the main text, but it lacks specifics. Underlining that the developed countries must urgently step forward to fulfil their obligations and mobilize at least $100 billion per year from 2021 to 2025, and initiate, at COP 26, deliberations on a formal process for setting a new collective quantified goal on finance under the Paris Agreement, they said "The new collective quantified goal must build from a floor of $100 billion per year, be significantly publicly funded with greater transparency and predictability and take a balanced approach towards mitigation and adaptation in light of the needs and priorities of developing countries."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/basic-nations-oppose-eus-carbon-border-tax-proposal/articleshow/87636140.cms||Vishwa Mohan

This is what they had promised to do.” Responding to the COP26 president Alok Sharma’s answer to a question by TOI last week that the 'finance delivery plan' already has a mechanism to monitor its progress as demanded by India and the OECD has been doing it in its current process, Yadav said this is their (OECD) own mechanism. “We want such a monitoring mechanism to come from COP26,” said the minister. The minister said that whatever India has done so far, it has done it with its own finances. “India has over 7,000 km of coastline. The country too is quite vulnerable to climate change. So, we too need finance for our future actions. Besides, whatever India has been saying, it has been for all developing countries.

Since most of the year has already gone by, it has been decided to restore the funds for the remaining part of the financial year that ends on March 31. An MP will get Rs 2 crore for development activities for 2021-22. From the next financial year, the stipulated annual grant of Rs 5 crore will be given to each MP. The decision will be welcomed by MPs, many of whom felt that a means to reach constituents had been cut off harming their outreach efforts. Opinion on the utility of the scheme, however, remains divided with it also being seen as prone to manipulation and graft. Under the MPLAD scheme, all the MPs can recommend development programmes involving expenditure of Rs 5 crore every year in their constituencies. For managing the health and adverse impacts of Covid-19 in the society, the Cabinet in its meeting held on April 2020, had decided not to operate MPLADS during the FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 and place the funds at the disposal of the finance ministry for managing the impacts of the pandemic. “The country is now on the road to economic recovery and the scheme continues to be beneficial for the creation of durable community assets, in fulfilling the aspirations of locally felt needs of the Community, in skill development and creation of jobs across the country, thereby helpful in achieving the objective of Atamnirbhar Bharat,” the government said in a statement issued after the cabinet meeting. “All parliamentarians had enthusiastically given their consent to contribute in the fight against Covid,” Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur said at the post cabinet media briefing. He said taking into account the recovery and improvement in the economic situation and even growth seen in various sectors, a decision has been taken to restore MPLAD scheme for the remainder period of the fiscal 2021-22. From 2022-23 to 2025-26 funds (co-terminus with the period of 15th Finance Commission) will be released under the scheme at the rate of Rs 5 crore per annum to them in two instalments of Rs 2.5 crore each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cabinet-restores-mplad-scheme-after-covid-break/articleshow/87636215.cms||---

The ministry’s views, finalised after consultations with the law ministry, removes a false sense of security against insolvency proceedings for discoms and gives debtors a fresh legal ammunition for recovering dues. The issue arose after the Tamil Nadu government wrote to the ministry on September 16, saying the provisions of IBC insolvency do not apply to discoms since they were discharging public functions as an extension of the state government. It also said there was a conflict between the IBC and the Electricity Act. The Tamil Nadu letter was prompted by a writ petition for initiation of proceedings under IBC filed in the Madras high court by South India Corporation Pvt Ltd. In its letter dated November 8, the ministry cited Supreme Court ruling in several cases, saying state-run discoms are set up under the Companies Act and not under statute like the NHAI. So they are not an extension of the state government. It also said the matter has been “settled” by the Supreme Court. The ministry letter also said there was no dichotomy between the provisions of IBC and the Electricity Act, which applies to different operational issues of discoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-immunity-from-ibc-for-state-discoms-says-centre/articleshow/87636326.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Malik also alleged that during Fadnavis’s tenure as CM, persons with criminal backgrounds were appointed on state-run boards and corporations and given the status of cabinet minister or junior minister. Malik claimed Fadnavis had taken the lead in criminalisation of politics and shielded criminals involved in the fake currency scam which allegedly took place after demonetisation in 2016. He also alleged Fadnavis was making all attempts to divert attention from the controversy surrounding NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who carried out, in Malik’s words, a “fake” raid on a cruise ship on October 2. “Who is Riyaz Bhati? During the tenure of Fadnavis as CM, Bhati was caught with fake passports, first in 2015 and then in 2020. I don’t know whether he was arrested or not, but he was let off in two days. Bhati was seen with Fadnavis at several BJP events. I don’t want to drag the PM into the controversy but Bhati had access to the PM’s event and even clicked pictures with him. He secured entry from the VIP gate. If entry for the PM’s event is so strict, how did Bhati secure a pass for it? Ultimately, the matter was settled after dons from other countries called the IPS officers here,” Malik said on Wednesday. He alleged Fadnavis had protected a person who had been caught with fake currency notes worth Rs 14.56 crore in BKC area. A few people were then arrested from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune, he said. “... Following demonetisation, in most states, massive fake currency was seized. On October 8, 2017, DRI seized fake currency worth Rs 14.56 crore, but the case was suppressed with the blessings of Fadnavis. Notes with a face walue of Rs 8.8 lakh were then shown as seizure. At that time, Wankhede was in charge of DRI,” Malik claimed. Fadnavis, he alleged, appointed Hazi Arafat Shaikh, elder brother of one of the accused in the fake currency case, Imran Alam Shaikh, as chairman of the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. Hyder Azam, was appointed chairman of the Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Corporation, he said. Azam had been accused of illegally bringing in people from Bangladesh to Mumbai, and his second wife is a citizen of Bangladesh, Malik claimed. Malad police were investigating her antecedents, but all cases were suppressed on Fadnavis’s instructions, the minister alleged. Munna Yadav from Nagpur, alleged to have a criminal background, was appointed chairman of Constructions Workers’ Board and given the rank of junior minister, Malik said.

The two will jointly build, sell and market multi-cloud services. This will include Airtel offering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to its 4,000 enterprise customers, and 1 million small & medium business customers. Oracle will leverage Airtel’s data centre network, Nxtra, to expand its cloud presence in India. The two will set up and manage a cloud centre of excellence (CoE) in Gurgaon, with a dedicated team of specialists from both organisations. And they will undertake joint IP (intellectual property) solution development in areas like 5G, multi-cloud, B2B customer experience, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and unified communications. Kumar said a lot of customers are coming to them asking for 5G solutions. Ajay Chitkara, CEO of Airtel Business, the division that offers enterprise solutions, said there are some clear demands from the market. One, he said, is around the regulated ecosystem – the government and other regulated customers want data to be protected and ensure the data is inside the India data centre. “That’s a very unique proposition that we are building together,” he said. Another is around 5G, where the two will use Airtel’s edge data centres – of which there are 120 now – to build specific use cases. “A third set of demands are around latency specific applications, where customers will take data centre, cloud and connectivity as a combined offering on a consumption basis (paying based on consumption). Currently, cloud is consumption based and network is contract based,” Chitkara said.  Airtel’s B2B business is now one of its fastest growing segments. Chitkara said Airtel is committed to invest $750 million in the business over the next three years, and the Oracle partnership is part of that. Apart from the smaller edge data centres (each of 1 to 10 MW), Airtel also has 10 large data centres (30 to 100 MW). Airtel works with other major cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud too. Kumar and Chitkara said demand for public cloud is soaring. Kumar said India is one of Oracle’s fastest growing markets worldwide. “We are seeing high double-digit business growth and we expect this will continue for the next 4-5 years,” he said. The company’s two local cloud regions (Mumbai and Hyderabad) are almost running at peak capacity. It is expanding the Mumbai one, and that will be available early next year. “India perhaps is the only market outside of the US to further expand local cloud presence,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oracle-airtel-enter-into-major-cloud-partnership/articleshow/87636480.cms||---

During his recent visit to TOI office as Guest Editor, Bommai categorically said he will continue to hold the Bengaluru development portfolio because it is convenient for him to take administrative and financial decisions. “Being the finance minister, I can ensure adequate funds for development works and quick administrative clearance for implementation of projects,” he added. Some city MLAs, however, see the move as risky considering BJP needs to strengthen its organisational structure in the run up to BBMP elections, which is likely to be held early next year. “There are seven ministers from Bengaluru. One of them should have been given the responsibility, especially keeping BBMP polls in mind, which are a few months away. You need a minister to lead the party’s campaign and set the tone for the polls. The CM cannot take a risk as he cannot dedicate time for party activities,” a minister said. Sources said the CM was initially inclined on allocating the portfolio to Ashoka in view of the polls, but decided otherwise following stiff opposition from city MLAs. Bommai has now asked Ashoka to oversee the implementation of Amrit schemes. The Congress has appointed R Ramalinga Reddy as the KPCC working president for his considerable influence in the capital city. “If BJP aims to come back to power in the civic body polls, it needs the support of all party MLAs and ministers from Bengaluru. Had the ministry been given to any one of the seven, there would be bad blood. By retaining it, the CM can make all ministers work in tandem,” a BJP MLA pointed out. “It is best the CM retains the portfolio as it’d mean there will be equitable distribution of funds among legislators for their constituencies. Unlike his predecessor, Bommai is easily accessible. It is a win-win situation for all,” said urban development minister Byrathi Basavaraj. “If the CM proves his mettle by developing Bengaluru, it will give other urban centres in Karnataka confidence of seeing better development,” said Chickpet BJP MLA Uday Garudachar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-no-plans-to-appoint-dedicated-min-for-bluru/articleshow/87636483.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Stroke incidence highest in Cuttack, mortality highest in Varanasi: Study||BENGALURU: A study on stroke incidence and mortality associated with it in five districts of India, taken up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shown huge variance and treatment gap. As per the study conducted for a two year period during 2018 and 2019, 187 people in every lakh population suffer strokes in Cuttack, Odisha, every year, while in Cachar district of Assam it was 96 stroke cases per lakh population. Deaths due to stroke within 28 days of onset of stroke ranged from 15 per lakh population in Kota, Rajasthan to 46 deaths per lakh population in Varanasi. The study ‘Stroke Incidence and Mortality: A Report of the Population based Stroke Registries, India’ prepared by the ICMR’s Bengaluru unit National Centre for Disease Informatics & Research (NCDIR) was released on Wednesday. To address the nationwide gap in data on stroke incidence among adults in India, population based stroke registry was set up in five different regions of the country, such as North-Varanasi, West-Kota, East-Cuttack, South-Tirunelveli and North-east-Cachar. Dr Prashant Mathur, Director, ICMR-NCDIR said that it’s crucial to have reliable, ongoing systematically collected data on stroke, its risk factors and outcome as part of setting up stroke surveillance in the country which will inform policy and programmatic actions. SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack district of Odisha, Silchar Medical College and Hospital in Cachar district of Assam, Tirunelveli Medical College in Tamil Nadu, Government Medical College in Kota of Rajasthan and Institute of Medical Sciences along with Banaras Hindu University (BHU) from Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh were part of the study. Speaking to TOI, Dr Prashant Mathur, Director, ICMR - National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research further said that the findings of the survey, where the highest incidence of stroke was seen in Cuttack should not be seen as representative of the stroke situation across eastern India. “It can mean that something similar is happening in the eastern part. There will be differences within the the eastern India too. It’s only a regional representation and not from the epidemiological perspective. We have picked up cases that were brought to the government medical colleges of the five districts,” he explained. Among the stroke cases reported, two-thirds were in males, and the majority (89%) occurred in the age group of 45 years and above. According to Dr Mathur, the incidence of stroke is more among men as per the study. “This needs to be further looked into. This also reflects that the healthcare seeking behaviour is seen more among men,” Dr Mathur told TOI. The study also analysed three major risk factors associated with stroke patients. While in Cuttack, hypertension was a risk factor in 75% of the cases, and where it was least in Kota at 40.3 %. Diabetes as a risk factor was seen in 35.1% of the cases in Varanasi and it was least in Cachar at 15.9%. Tobacco was another risk factor analysed: highest in Cuttack at 62.4 % and least in Thirunalveli at 23.1 %. The stroke mortality at 28 days after the onset of stroke was highest in Varanasi at 46.6 %, and it was lowest in Kota at 15.3 %. “Mortality rate depends on factors such as late arrival of the patients to the hospital, establishing the right diagnosis, initiating thrombolytic therapy and a combination of all these. Varanasi may not be equipped to treat, diagnose stroke cases,” said Dr Mathur. Mid-level cities undergoing rapid changesThe researchers did not include the metropolitan cities for the study. “We wanted to look at what’s happening in mid-level cities, as they are undergoing health and epidemiological transition. The registry will be a long term set up, which will study the pattern for next 20-30 years. Metros have a lot of migration population, whereas we wanted to study the stable population and these districts were chosen,” said Dr Mathur. He added that the study is ongoing and in next two years, the data will be analysed once again, based on the stroke registries at the government medical college hospitals in the said districts. He said that the union ministry of health has mandated Multidisciplinary Research Units set up in over 70 government medical colleges across the country with a mandate to take up research in noncommunicable diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/stroke-incidence-highest-in-cuttack-mortality-highest-in-varanasi-study/articleshow/87639853.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Govt must act on GPS ambulances urgently: HC||Bengaluru: The high court on Wednesday observed that it cannot appreciate the manner in which the government is proceeding with providing emergency ambulances with GPS although it is important and of public interest. The court hoped the matter will be taken up urgently. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi cited its August 31 order and said time had been granted but the additional government advocate is still not in a position to explain why the matter related to a fresh tender hasn’t been placed before the cabinet and additional 10 days are being sought for seeking instructions. “We fail to understand why GPS cannot be installed in the existing 108 ambulances and a control room set up to man them so that services are provided during an emergency and people who require immediate medical attention are sent to hospitals,” the bench said. The court has now granted two weeks to the additional government advocate to seek instructions and hoped the government will take up the issue with urgency and do the needful. ‘Dharwad hosp should function by March 2022’ The high court on Wednesday directed the government and authorities concerned to ensure Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences functions as a higher psychiatric hospital as per norms fixed and make it operational from March 1, 2022. A division bench passed this order while hearing a suo motu PIL filed by Karnataka State Legal Services Authority on implementation of Mental Healthcare Act. The bench perused the affidavit filed by Naveen Raj Singh, principal secretary to the medical education department, and said the court is not satisfied with the explanation given for the delay in implementation, particularly installation of an MRI machine at Dimhans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-must-act-on-gps-ambulances-urgently-hc/articleshow/87636486.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||HC quashes OCI students’ plea on equating them with NRIs||Bengaluru: The high court dismissed a batch of petitions filed by Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) card holder students, challenging the March 4, 2021 notification issued by the central government, stating they are “devoid of merit”. As per the notification, OCI card holders are not eligible for admission against any seat in professional education colleges reserved exclusively for Indian citizens, other than those availing under NRI quota and supernumerary seats. However, considering the special circumstances of the case, Justice Krishna S Dixit said all the petitioners are permitted to stake claim for admission consistent with the interim reliefs made in favour of many of them, subject to eligibility and qualification. Ten days have been granted to the petitioners to produce requisite documents before Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA). “There is one common characteristic discernible from the three notifications of 2005, 2009 and 2021. All OCI cardholders are foreigners but not all foreigners are OCI cardholders. These notifications treat OCI card holders on par with NRIs. The latter are citizens whereas the former are not. That these notifications in a sense restrict the educational rights of NRIs even when they are citizens qua the domiciling citizens, is obvious. They confer on OCI card holders educational rights at par with NRIs though they are not citizens. So far as the claim to governmental seats and non-supernumerary seats is concerned, both the citizenship and domicile are not treated as central to the policy criterion, although they have some ‘non-policy significance’. In other words, these notifications are ‘citizenship-neutral’. They are ‘domicile-neutral’ too. Even if the OCI cardholders assumedly happen to be the citizens of India and have domiciled in the state of Karnataka, the factor pales into insignificance,” Justice Dixit noted. Petitioners Alekhya Ponnekanti and others had argued that the notification takes away certain rights of professional education vested in them by virtue of earlier notifications dated April 11, 2005 and January 5, 2009. They contended that they are domiciled in India and have pursued their schooling for more than seven years and therefore, ought to be treated on a different footing. The Centre countered it, saying the impugned part of the 2021 notification was incorporated to protect the interest of the domiciling natives who lack the competitive edge vis-a-vis the OCI cardholders and NRIs who have greater exposure to the outer world, by virtue of birth and upbringing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-quashes-oci-students-plea-on-equating-them-with-nris/articleshow/87636488.cms||---

Dr Rakesh Shetty, in his late 40s and owner of Sri Maruti hospital, Bagalur near Yelahanka, was taken into custody based on a complaint filed by V Murali, 26, from Yelahanka on November 8. According to Murali, apart from assaulting, Rakesh Shetty and his friends urinated in his mouth and on his body. DCP (north-east) CK Baba said search is on for three more suspects. “We arrested the prime accused within eight hours of registration of the FIR,” he said. The doctor is in judicial custody. Murali used to ferry Shetty and his staff in his autorickshaw. “On November 4 evening, Dr Shetty asked me to transport food and other items from a friend’s house to a club in Satanur near Bagalur, where he and around 12 friends were partying. I took the food items to the club and served them. Shetty asked me to go back to his hospital and bring another doctor called Swami. As I was getting late to go home and meet my relatives, I told Swamy to hurry up. But he made me wait for more than an hour and I objected to that. He came out at 10.30pm. Upon reaching the club, Swamy told Shetty that I insulted him in front of everyone,” Murali said. An enraged Shetty abused him saying he didn’t have respect for doctors. “They forced me to consume alcohol and locked me inside the bathroom. Using beer bottles and other objects, they beat me up. They urinated in my mouth and on my body. I lost consciousness. Next morning, I came out of the club and using someone’s phone, I called my parents. They shifted me to Yelahanka hospital,” he stated. An officer said the injuries on Murali’s body, the doctor’s medical certificates and CCTV footage from the scene of crime confirmed the attack. The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) 342 (wrongful confinement) 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) besides the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/doc-in-soup-for-locking-up-and-assaulting-auto-driver/articleshow/87636491.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Rejecting the petition filed by Nagaraj from Bidar, Justice HP Sandesh said the petitioner stored 7,200 litres of liquor and 8 litres of toddy in his house and since he has been committing similar offences from 2017-18 and six cases have been registered against him, it is not a fit case to exercise discretion under section 439 of CrPC for granting bail. “If he is enlarged on bail, he will again indulge in a similar offence. Not convicted in any case is not a ground to grant him bail,” the judge said. Nagaraj had sought for bail in a case registered by the excise inspector for the offences punishable under Sections 14, 15, 32(1), 38 (A) of Karnataka Excise Act-1965. He claimed that though five cases were registered against him, he has not been convicted in any of them and false cases had been registered. According to him, the offences were not punishable with death or life imprisonment. The government advocate argued that the petitioner is a habitual offender. When the excise inspector raided his house, he escaped and was caught later. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/not-convicted-in-any-case-is-not-a-ground-for-bail/articleshow/87636492.cms||---

The suspended engineers — Premananda Kumar RG from SWD division and MG Nagaraju from road infrastructure division — will be eligible for livelihood allowance, special commissioner (administration), BBMP, Dayanand KA, said. He added the suspension was not on the basis of complaints from citizens, but due to shortcomings noticed by chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta during one of his inspections. The major roads engineer was found to have taken inadequate action towards the upkeep of the roads. The stormwater drain engineer was found to be absent from duty and unresponsive during flooding of some areas.

But his associate Sujit Poojari Kudkoli was found guilty and awarded a jail term of two years and fined Rs 20,000 for illegally procuring a pistol. The prosecution failed to establish criminal conspiracy by Raja and Kudkoli to extort money from four businessmen in Bengaluru and also procure illegal firearms to use them to threaten their targets. “Documents produced on behalf of the prosecution failed to establish the fact of criminal conspiracy entered between accused no.1 (Raja) and accused no.2 (Kudkoli) for supply of arms and extortion of money. No supportive call details reports were produced by the prosecution to show that accused no.1 made threatening calls to demand money from the businessmen. The call details report is not sufficient to establish that threatening phone calls were made by Raja... Therefore, this court is of the opinion that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of the offences the accused duo is charged of,” the judgment reads. Central Crime Branch (CCB) police had arrested Kudkoli from Anand Rao Circle on April 25, 2014 and seized a country-made pistol and magazine from him. The prosecution alleged that Kudkoli worked for Raja and used to threaten businessmen for extortion on Raja’s direction. The prosecution only proved that the pistol was illegally procured by Kudkoli and hence, he was convicted under the Arms Act. Other charges against him, including extortion and criminal conspiracy, were not established. The 64th additional city civil and sessions court judge Rajeshwara had pronounced the judgment on October 22. This is the second acquittal in over 40 cases filed against Raja in Bengaluru. In April 2018, he was acquitted in a murder conspiracy case filed by High Grounds police. Raja , 50, was on the run for over 18 years in connection with criminal cases filed against him in Karnataka and Maharashtra. One of the sensational cases in which he was allegedly involved was the gunning down of BJP leader RN Nayak in Uttara Kannada district’s Ankola town in 2013. A red corner notice had been issued by Interpol and he’d been detained in Morocco on February 12, 2015 after he was found to be staying in that country under a fake identity. Subsequently, he was extradited to India in August the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/extortion-case-relief-for-bannanje-raja/articleshow/87636495.cms||Santosh Kumar

---||Bengaluru||Govt sets ground for revised transit-oriented policy in B’luru||Bengaluru: Karnataka has initiated the process for implementing the revised transit-oriented development (TOD) policy that aims to develop mass rapid transport corridors to minimise the need for personal vehicles in Bengaluru. “We held a preliminary meeting and some more will follow before we get down to the implementation stage,” said Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary, urban development department. TOD in Karnataka has been in the draft stage since February 2019. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) had first released a draft TOD policy two years ago after the Centre framed guidelines for major cities on how to implement it. “It could not be implemented for practical and political reasons,” said officials. Now, the Directorate of Land Transport (DULT) has readied a revised policy, which may soon be placed before the cabinet, they added. “We have provided inputs to the new policy and brought some changes to the earlier one. We are awaiting the government’s nod,” said Anjum Pervez, MD of BMRCL. According to the draft policy, the population of Bengaluru Metropolitan Region is expected to go up from 9 million in 2011 to over 20 million by 2031. As of now, share of public transport in the city is just about 48 per cent and needs to be increased to 70. It can be achieved by enhancing accessibility and mobility, which requires huge investments to expand mass transit systems — Metro and commuter rail. Bhaskar Nagendrappa, president of CREDAI-Bengaluru, said the benefits of TOD will be immense as public ridership will go up when people can easily access jobs, education, healthcare, etc, by using the transit. “With growing Metro rail connectivity, the city has scores of opportunities for transit-oriented development with good bus transportation...,” he added. Setting up neighbourhoods around areas of transit will promote walk-to-work and cycle-to-work culture and, therefore result in healthier lifestyles, lower pollution, higher foot traffic for commercial businesses and decreased suburban sprawl, said Suresh Hari, former president of CREDAI. However, some experts are still sceptical. Monica Matthias, director, Hoysala Projects, said implementing TOD in Bengaluru is a challenge because of various reasons. “In the core city (Zone A), it is a challenge because of high density and high property values. Also, the TOD policy pertaining to Bengaluru considers mass transit like Metro and not buses as a means of transport. But buses are a more popular means of commuting in Bengaluru. The city actually needs a mobility plan... The National Urban Transport Policy emphasises a mobility plan that integrates both land use and transport planning, through TOD,” Matthias said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-sets-ground-for-revised-transit-oriented-policy-in-bluru/articleshow/87636497.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Two Congress leaders part of bitcoin scam: Karnataka CM||BENGALURU: The ongoing war of words between the ruling BJP and opposition Congress over the alleged multi-crore bitcoin scam intensified on Wednesday with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai claiming that two Congress leaders are involved in the racket. “There are names of Congress leaders in the bitcoin scam. Let the Congress worry about that instead of hurling false allegations at us,” Bommai told reporters in Delhi. He was reacting to Congress MLA and former minister Priyank Kharge’s tweet that if the bitcoin scandal is investigated thoroughly and transparently, the BJP government in Karnataka will soon see a third chief minister, indirectly suggesting Bommai will be removed. The CM further said that his government has an open mind as far as this issue is concerned. “Let them tell what is the crime and who is the beneficiary. Let the opposition give some documents on it. We will get it investigated. We have nothing to hide,” he said. Reacting to the CM’s allegation, Congress leaders dared the former to disclose the names of their leaders and arrest them. “If Congress leaders are involved, why is the government keeping quiet? Why no arrests are being made,” opposition leader Siddaramaiah asked. KPCC president DK Shivakumar said the home minister should make public the details of the chargesheet in which the names of two Congress leaders are allegedly mentioned. “What is he (home minister) waiting for? Let him tell the people. He must also talk about the letter written to the PM and the name of the person who wrote it,” he added. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy said discussions about the bitcoin scam had been going on since 2016-17 when the Congress was in power. “Had Siddaramaiah taken stringent action then, the scam would not have been so big,” he added. Kumaraswamy alleged that both the BJP and Congress have been working overtime to bury the bitcoin scam and the ongoing blame game is part of their plan. He also claimed that all details of the scam had reached the Prime Minister’s Office. RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa alleged that Congress has been blackmailing the government by saying the CM and IAS officers are involved in the bitcoin scam. “If they have any documents to prove their allegations, let them go to court,” he added. Eshwarappa said Bommai will continue as CM till the end of his tenure. Earlier, speaking to reporters in Kalaburagi, Kharge said t he has information that the hacker had hacked into three bitcoin exchanges, 14 websites, including 10 poker websites, and exploited malwares and made away with Rs 2,283 crore. Police had also recovered 31 bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore. “But these things have been left out of the chargesheet. We also want to know why was a hacker granted bail after claims that he had hacked into government websites,” Kharge asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-cong-leaders-part-of-bitcoin-scam-cm/articleshow/87636504.cms||---

At this level, the nine-year-old startup is more valuable than traditional giants such as Coal India, BPCL, Britannia and just below M&M and Bajaj Auto. For the former investment banker. it has been a dream journey so far—the sizzling stock market debut of the company has already catapulted her as the richest self-made woman in India, with a net worth of close to $7 billion. On listing the stock price of FSN E-Commerce, which runs Nykaa, almost doubled to Rs 2,001 on BSE, up from its IPO price of Rs 1,125. It ended the debut session on the stock market at Rs 2,207 and a market capitalisation of Rs 1.04 lakh crore, or a little more than $14 billion. The bidding for its Rs 5,349-crore IPO had closed on November 1 with an oversubscription of 81.7 times. The high market capitalisation of Nykaa also makes it one of the most valued stocks on BSE. At the debut-day closing price it had a price-to-earnings ratio of 1,588 times compared to the IPO valuation of 839 times for this online cosmetics retailer. Why did Nayar, who cut her teeth in investment banking, choose cosmetics and fashion? Nayar says she entered a sector about which she knew almost nothing. "I looked around for ideas and saw that beauty was an underdeveloped market in India compared to the West or even Japan and South Korea. It looked like an opportunity and since we are professionals with no deep pockets, I wanted to start in a sunrise industry before many others jumped in," she told TOI. Before ringing the opening bell at the National Stock Exchange on Wednesday, she told the gathered audience, "I started Nykaa at the age of 50 with no experience in technology or beauty or fashion. I hope the Nykaa journey can inspire each of you to be the nayika (heroine) of your lives." She noted she was in an established career which would often see her help entrepreneurs in the position she is in today. She said she saw few believers and many naysayers when she started Nykaa. "The beauty industry was nascent and customers were wary of ordering online given counterfeit products," she added. Having earned a degree in commerce from Sydenham College, Mumbai, Nayar did an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad in the 1980s. She spent close to two decades with Kotak Securities, rising to the position of managing director of Kotak Investment Banking before leaving it to begin her entrepreneurial journey. Perhaps entrepreneurship was in her blood. She is a Gujarati, born and raised in Mumbai. Her father ran a small bearings company, assisted by her mother. Nayar has said previously that household chatter revolved around investments, stock market and trade. Asked about her thoughts on the price pop of the shares, she says it is a combination of the growth potential that investors see in an underpenetrated market like India and the strong unit economics that saw the company turn black last fiscal. The beauty and personal care market in India is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12% to $26 billion between 2019 and 2025, as per reports from consulting company RedSeer. Though the market dipped last year due to the pandemic, it is expected to pick up pace as more people shop online. "For an ecommerce company like ours, we have the right unit economics. We do not lose but make money on every order that we service. The balance between acquiring new customers and keeping unit economics intact is very important. If you don’t have that, you end up diluting your equity to get that growth," she cautions. Nayar says that small towns, which account for more than half of the topline, will continue to remain the growth drivers. While 95% of the total sales are online, the rest is from the 80 stores across the country. That is expected to go up to 15% as its stores and footfalls go up along with the pandemic receding. Nykaa had 7.1 million transacting customers till August this fiscal, up from 5.6 million in the whole of last year. Nykaa has over 1,500 brands with a comprehensive selection of makeup, skincare, haircare, fragrances, personal care, luxury and wellness products for women and men. It has a portfolio of luxury brands including Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder. The company's revenue grew 38% to Rs 2,440 crore last fiscal while profit was Rs 62 crore, against a loss of Rs 16 crore a year earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nykaas-dream-debut-founder-now-indias-richest-self-made-bizwoman/articleshow/87636423.cms||Avik Das

Read AlsoCovid prevented duty cut earlier: Petroleum and urban development minister Hardeep PuriNEW DELHI: Fuel prices have risen only 30% during the seven years of the Narendra Modi government against 70% in the similar intervals since 1973 and last week’s excise duty cut was aimed at “giving consumers relief” and a confidence over robust revenue collections as the economy was “firing on allSpeaking at the Times Now Summit, Gadkari said, “The reduction in excise duty has brought immediate relief and this was required. Linking this to the election is wrong. We did this after the bypoll results and not before the polls. We have one election or other every month. If we link all government decisions to elections, then we can’t do anything.” Gadkari said the government is taking multiple initiatives to reduce crude imports, which amounts to nearly Rs 8 lakh crore annually. He said initiatives such as higher ethanol blending in petrol, the introduction of flex engines, green hydrogen, bio-CNG and penetration of electric vehicles will substantially reduce India’s crude oil consumption in near future and will also reduce air pollution.

---||Delhi||38-year-old, under witness protection, shot in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: A 38-year-old man was found dead in Chhatarpur in south Delhi on Thursday morning. The man, who had been shot in the head, was a witness in a murder case registered at Mehrauli police station and had two security personnel protecting him. He had sent the pair home before the incident. A woman called the cops around 4.45am to inform them about the man lying dead on the fourth floor of the JMD Estate building. The deceased was identified as Sanjiv Sejwal, a resident of Lado Sarai. “A police team found Sejwal lying dead with a revolver by his side. The crime and forensics teams were called to the spot to carry out a detailed inspection and to comb for clues,” said a police officer. “The body was moved to a hospital for the post-mortem examination. We have established that on Wednesday night, Sejwal had come to JMD Estate to meet three friends and was partying with them. The woman caller was also at the party.” The initial inquest proceedings and police enquiries hint at a possible case of suicide. More details will be confirmed once the autopsy report is received. Police said that the CCTV footage from the area indicated Sejwal and friends had ordered food in the evening. The deceased’s friends left the party late at night. The investigators are trying to contact them to establish the sequence of the events that eventually culminated in Sejwal’s death. Police have seized the licensed pistol used in the alleged killing and sent it for analysis. “We found that Sejwal was a witness in a murder case in Mehrauli in which his nephew had been killed by some men over a monetary dispute in 2014. A charge-sheet was also filed in this case in 2017,” the officer revealed. “Since Sejwal had recorded his statement before the court as a witness, two personal security officers had been attached to him. However, before he died on Wednesday night, he sent both his bodyguards home.” The preliminary investigation in the death has also revealed that Sejwal was involved in an IPL betting scandal last year in which six men were arrested from south Delhi’s Mehrauli. Police are probing several angles, including a property deal that went wrong or personal enmity, that could have led to the man’s death. Sejwal is survived by his wife and two children who live in Lado Sarai. Harsh Vardhan, additional deputy commissioner of police (South), said that at the time of the incident the woman caller and Sejwal were the only persons present in the rented apartment. She is also being questioned. “The matter is being probed from all possible angles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/38-year-old-under-witness-protection-shot-in-s-delhi/articleshow/87655173.cms||---
---||Business||Tax cuts on fuel improve inflation outlook: RBI governor||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday said that the tax cuts on fuel were a positive development and would help the central bank meet its inflation target of 5.3%. The governor said that the growth target of 9.5% also looked achievable, however, there were headwinds in the form of global development. The governor said that there was already a rebalancing of the liquidity in the money markets but, as long as the central bank maintained its accommodative stance, funds would be surplus. “Prices of energy, steel and commodities have gone up but there is a sense among some analysts that they have peaked. We expect that it will be in line with our projection of 5.3% as positive developments emerging from petrol/diesel cut have not been factored in,” he said. He was speaking during a fireside chat in a banking summit organised by a business daily. Das, however, cautioned against global developments. “Global headwinds are coming up. Growth in most developed and advanced economies, which was positive until second quarter, seems to have moderated. Global growth of 5.9% target may undershoot because of shortage of semiconductors and shipping containers. Freight charges and commodity prices have gone up. Covid seems to be a rising concern in some countries in Asia and the West,” said Das. On retail loans overtaking corporate loans for the first time, Das said that banks need to price risks properly and decide on the extent of exposure they want to take in each sector. “What percentage should go for retail and housing is for bank boards to decide and allocate risk pricing,” said Das. Pointing out the growth in home loans, Das said that this was a combination of the increased demand for large homes because of the pandemic, coupled with the record dip in interest rates. At the same time, Das said that the shift of corporates to the bond market was a positive development. “Over the last one year, corporates have accessed more funds from the bond market than bank funding. That is a positive development. When they go to the market, the market will decide the risk and price the bonds. So far as bank credit is concerned, our interactions show that there are signs of investment pick-up,” he said. He added that his feedback from interactions with banks was that credit will pick up from next year. On the withdrawal of the liquidity infused during the pandemic, Das said that the measures were designed for a finite period and the liquidty would be rebalanced. He said that the money released from reduction in cash reserve ratio has come back and part of the long-term repo operations money has also returned. The RBI was impounding little below Rs 7 lakh crore through its reverse repo window. “So, the liquidity is getting rebalanced. As long as the policy stance is accommodative, liquidity will be in surplus, but the excess liquidity will be rebalanced,” he said. Das said that despite the expansion of the RBI balance sheet, the need for capital infusion into the central bank was “kind of a situation that will not arise”. Das again cautioned against cryptocurrencies and said that the investor base number in India was exaggerated. “Crypto, whatever name you call it, is a serious concern from the point of view of macroeconomic and financial stability. How the issue is to be dealt with, we have given recommendations to the government. Yes, in terms of volumes and amount invested, the number is growing. But the number of investors, the sense I have, I am not sure of the numbers being quoted,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tax-cuts-on-fuel-improve-inflation-outlook-rbi-guv/articleshow/87635339.cms||---

While the retail part was subscribed 1.7 times, the institutional part was subscribed 2.8 times and the part reserved for high net worth investors (HNIs) was subscribed just 24%, BSE data showed. Till day 2 (the previous day) of the offer, the IPO was subscribed 48%. The IPO for the tech-enabled payments solutions pioneer in India is set to be the largest such offering in India, ahead of Coal India’s Rs 15,200-crore in 2010. The IPO bidding round for Paytm, one of India’s leading startups, closed the same day Nykaa — another startup — listed succesfully on the stock exchanges with a valuation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore. In July, the highly successful listing of Zomato, a startup that is one of the leaders in India’s food delivery industry, had paved the way for many more to take the route to go public, market players said. According to sources, some of the investors which bought Paytm shares during the anchor round, which closed on November 3, have also put in large bids during the just-closed bidding round. One of the largest pension funds in the world, Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), put in a bid worth nearly Rs 1,300 crore, they said. A spokesperson for Paytm said the company’s successful closing of the IPO bidding round was a testament to the India story, its startup ecosystem and the depth of the Indian capital markets that enabled it to reach this milestone.  “Our belief in the power of Indian tech dominance stands proven,” the spokesperson said. “We hope to continue to strive and drive financial inclusion for the underserved and unserved population of the country.” In its anchor round, the company had raised Rs 8,235 crore. In addition to CPPIB, global fund management majors like Blackrock, the government of Singapore, UBS and a host of other entities had picked up 3.8 crore shares of the company at the upper end of the Rs 2,080-2,150 price band for the IPO, a company release had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-ipo-closes-with-2x-subscription/articleshow/87635411.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi chief hints at enhanced ESG rules||MUMBAI: Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi on Wednesday said that Indian legislation was ahead of the curve in formulating rules for adoption of practices that promoted ESG (environment, sustainability & governance) by the corporate sector. The top markets regulator further pointed out that Sebi was also ahead of the curve in formulating rules to promote ESG practices for its regulated entities as early as 2012 and recently enhanced it with a new code. He hinted at enhancing some of its ESG rules and codes to be in tune with global investing & regulatory practices. Tyagi warned about ‘greenwashing’, a practice through which corporates and other entities take a path that seemingly promotes ESG, but the results do not reflect the same. The Sebi chief said ESG-focused funds in India will have to adhere to an investing process under new rules that will require these to invest only in those companies that follow the regulator’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR). Tyagi was speaking at an even organised by industry trade body Ficci. Tyagi also hinted at some forthcoming changes to how listed Indian companies carry out their ESG initiatives. He said the international forum for securities regulators, International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is in the process of publishing its report on ‘ESG Ratings and ESG Data Providers’, which would include recommendations on these entities, along with regulatory and supervisory approaches with respect to the same. He said that Sebi was keenly watching international developments in this space and would soon take a call on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-chief-hints-at-enhanced-esg-rules/articleshow/87635428.cms||---
---||Business||Mutual fund assets, monthly SIP flows hit record in October||MUMBAI: Growing investor interest about mutual funds helped assets managed by Indian MFs rise to a record high of Rs 37.3 lakh crore in October, up from Rs 36.7 lakh crore in September and Rs 28.2 lakh crore a year earlier. During the month, contributions through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route also rose to a new record high at Rs 10,519 crore, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. According to AMFI chief executive N S Venkatesh, net positive flows during October in all categories of open-ended MF schemes — be it debt, equity, hybrid, solutions-oriented, index, fund of funds or ETFs — coupled with continued buoyancy in SIP flows, which are at a historic high, boosted overall Indian MF industry assets to a record level. During October, net inflows through all the debt schemes together was nearly Rs 13,000 crore, while through the equity schemes it was Rs 5,215 crore. However, as the market is hovering at record high levels, investors are also showing their preference for hybrid schemes, industry players said. During the month, net inflows through the hybrid schemes was at Rs 10,437 crore. Investors’ rising preference for passive investing could be seen from a net inflow of Rs 10,759 crore, they said. AMFI data also showed that investors were taking money off closed-ended and ELSS schemes, with the month’s figures at Rs 1,082 crore and Rs 136 crore. The data from industry trade body further showed that average AUM at the end of October was at Rs 38.2 lakh crore, another record high. It also showed that the number of MF folios were at 11.4 crore while the corresponding number under retail schemes were at 9.3 crore, both all-time high numbers. The number of SIP accounts at the end of October was 4.6 crore, up from nearly 4.5 crore a month ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-assets-monthly-sip-flows-hit-record-in-oct/articleshow/87635387.cms||---
---||Business||RBI’s global hackathon to take digital payments beyond smartphones and OTPs||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced its first global hackathon to take digital payments beyond the present limitations of mobile phones and OTPs and to make them safer. The first edition of the central bank’s HaRBInger 2021 aims to identify and develop solutions that have the potential to make digital payments accessible to the under-served, enhance the ease of payments and user experience while strengthening the security of digital payments and promoting customer protection. Participants in the challenge (open to all over 18 years) have an opportunity to win Rs 40 lakh. The four challenge areas are innovative, easy-to-use, non-mobile digital payment solutions for converting small-ticket cash transactions to digital mode, context-based retail payments to remove the physical act of payment while transacting in-store, alternative to OTP and PIN for authenticating digital payments and developing a tool that will monitor social media analysis. The hackathon is owned and sponsored by the RBI and is hosted on Application Programming Interface Exchange (APIX) platform. A participant has to register online throught the link provided on the RBI’s website. “The challenge has been to sustain the growth in payments and ensure a shift in customer behaviour towards the vision of a less-cash society by creating a framework of robust, convenient, accessible, low cost and secure digital payment and settlement system,” the RBI said. The RBI note on the hackathon said that to onboard the underprivileged and underserved faction of the society to digital payments, non-mobile, swift and easy-to-use innovative solutions for converting small value cash payments of an amount less than Rs 100 to digital mode, needs to be explored. This would enhance the reach of digital payments and enable greater inclusion of the underserved into the mainstream. The context-based retail payments are aimed at removing the physical act of payment from the payment experience. “Context-based payments require no direct interaction between the customer and the merchant. It is mostly contingent on completion of an underlying activity and may include automatic payment at grocery stores once a customer exits the store,” the RBI said. It added that different use cases in the retail segment can be thought of to enable a seamless payment experience which may include an application. The solutions may also focus on consent mechanism, fraud prevention and security features besides enhancing the user experience. The search for alternatives to PIN and One-Time Password (OTP) is driven by the fact that these are received by the remitter over his mobile phone. “While the SMS through which the OTP is received is not an encrypted secure messaging system, the instances of digital payment frauds where the users are tricked into sharing the OTP have also been observed. As such, an alternate smart secure authentication mechanism may result in more secure digital transactions,” the RBI said. Given that customers are now voicing their concerns largely on social media, the analysis of consumer complaints and concerns over platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram may facilitate the digital payment operators as well the regulator in taking proactive and swift action for consumer protection and fraud prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-global-hackathon-to-take-digital-payments-beyond-smartphones-and-otps/articleshow/87629592.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Vadodara||Uncertainty looms over Nyay Mandir||Vadodara: The fate of Nyay Mandir, built in 1896 at a cost of Rs 7lakh, today hangs in balance. Reason? Nobody knows how to utilize the magnanimous heritage structure that once served its time as the high court of the erstwhile Baroda state. Ahead of the elections last year, the state government had given the possession of the Nyay Mandir to the revenue department. However, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is yet to get its possession from the government, while much brainstorming to alter the original plan of developing a city museum and other facilities there has already taken place. It was decided way back in 2014 that a city museum will be developed in Nyay Mandir and that the VMC will work on the project. While it may not have possession of the building, VMC functionaries — particularly those from the elected wing of the civic body and the city unit of the BJP that rules VMC — seem to have different visions regarding its future. They do not seem to be on the same page. Sources said that some in the civic body were of an opinion that the VMC headquarter located in Khanderao Market should be shifted to Nyay Mandir. Khanderao Market is also a heritage building, but is bursting at its seams and ugly extensions and partitions have been made to it to accommodate more people or offices. The most recent incident being that of shifting of the office of the personal assistant (PA) of the mayor to an extension so that a washroom for the mayor could be accommodated in the place where the PA’s cabin existed. Nyay Mandir is much larger and is sufficient for the civic body’s needs. But many are objecting to this arguing that the building will be ruined like the Khanderao Market if alterations are made there as per requirement. There may be need for lifts, washrooms partitions electrical lines if it is put to use by VMC. At the other end, VMC had over a decade back discussed the plan of a new headquarter building which is yet to see the light of the day. Mayor Keyur Rokadiya said that several options had been discussed some time back. “We have not reached a conclusion yet. However, I will be meeting the chief minister after Diwali and request him to ensure that the buidling is handed over to us at the earliest,” he said. BJP city unit president Dr Vijay Shah who was actively involved in ensuring that the heritage building was handed over to the revenue department said that the VMC has to get the building first and only after that any decision could be arrived on. He said that there was a possibility that the building could accommodate both the VMC office and the city museum along with other facilities. A major concern in VMC is the expenses involved in the upkeep of the building. Whenever the civic body is given the possession of the building, it will also be responsible for its maintenance. The cash-strapped VMC may not find it easy to maintain the heritage structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/uncertainty-looms-over-nyay-mandir/articleshow/87633857.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Visakhapatnam||Cases wane but no room for complacency, warn experts||Visakhapatnam: Going by the daily Covid-19 infection incidence, Andhra Pradesh was well past the peak of the second wave at least five months ago. The state is currently reporting easily manageable case numbers. At least half the eligible adult population has completed its two-dose vaccine schedule, while the first dose coverage exceeds the 85% mark. The daily case positivity rate has dropped to less than 1%. But amid the significant drop in case numbers and increasing vaccination rates, a certain degree of complacency has crept in when it comes to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the state. When TOI visited several public places in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday, about 50% of the people were seen not wearing or not correctly wearing their masks. Crowds at public places are almost back to pre-Covid levels, leaving little room for complying with physical distancing norms. Vendors and traders, who are highly vulnerable to contracting the virus due to their transactions with hundreds of people a day, also seem to have let their guard down. Inquiries made by the TOI at various shops and pharmacies confirmed the trend of a drop in sales of face masks and sanitizers in the last three months. Experts, however, have raised warnings about the perils of complacency as several countries are still witnessing a record surge in cases. Speaking to TOI, Andhra Medical College principal Dr P V Sudhakar said the public should not be in a hurry to shun masks or social distancing. “There were numerous examples from across the globe how complacency would lead to a surge in case numbers and can spur the third wave. The decreasing daily case numbers should not lead to any complacency on the vaccination part or Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Sudhakar. State Covid-19 nodal officer and Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences director Dr K Rambabu said while the Covid-19 vaccine would help prevent serious illness, social distancing and masks are still key to prevent transmission of infection. “Vaccines and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour will be the only way to end the pandemic. Even after getting two shots, unmasked people can still contract the virus and transmit it to others. The health department requests the public to follow all Covid-19 guidelines to ensure no resurgence in case numbers,” said Dr Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cases-wane-but-no-room-for-complacency-warn-experts/articleshow/87634311.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Srinivasan said that coal prices were hovering around $250 a tonne as against $80 earlier. Another key material used in cement manufacture, Pet Coke — a petroleum byproduct, isn’t available. “We still have coal stock which has been purchased at lower prices. The day we place the order for coal (high cost) we will increase the prices and it may be in the range of Rs 40 a bag (50kg),” he added.

A sum of Rs 300 crore has been allocated for the purpose. Principal secretary, PWD, RK Sudhanshu on Tuesday wrote to all the district magistrates and directed them to repair all potholed roads, including those connecting with national highways and state highways, within the next seven days. The work was scheduled to be completed by October-end but due to heavy rain, the process got delayed.

In the middle of the pandemic, the offices had started online registrations which has enabled registration of a large number of complaints and address them through virtual hearings. The 17 insurance ombudsmen offices across the country received 35,019 complaints in FY21. The maximum number of complaints were received from Kolkata (3,795), followed by Mumbai (3,721) and Pune (3,428). Due to online redressal, the offices managed to dispose of 30,596 complaints. The total disposal of complaints is more than 87%. The data was released on the occasion of Bima Lokpal Day, which takes place on November 11 every year to mark the foundation of the office. In March this year, the government had, through a notification, amended the Insurance Ombudsman Rules to enable registration of complaints either through electronic mail or online through the website of the council for insurance ombudsmen.

Family businesses in India are increasingly looking to build consensus among members to resolve conflicts as the new generation comes with a different world view. TOI spoke to Marico chairman Harsh Mariwala for his insights on how family businesses can better manage the dynamics. His advice: Keep communication channels open to identify conflicts. “They should not be dictated by ego and age,” he says. Mariwala is in talks with the Indian School of Business and SP Jain Institute of Management and Research to develop case studies for students based on his book ‘Harsh Realities’, co-authored by management thinker Prof. Ram Charan. Excerpts: Despite rising feuds around succession planning, not all promoters realise the importance of managing such dynamics... What’s your advice? When a new generation enters the family business, it usually comes with an advanced educational background as compared to older members. The new generation is equipped with more knowledge and, in a fast-changing environment, it is far more tuned to the latest trends. More so with digital initiatives. They are living this change and have age on their side. They are not conditioned by the past unlike the older generation, whose understanding of the current changes may not be as good as that of the younger ones, though I am not saying they are not updated. The new generation usually is more ambitious and wants to create an impact. This is a very critical juncture in a family business. History has shown that whenever the next generation comes in, it brings in a certain degree of discontinuity in the way the business is handled. The key challenge for families is integrating the views of the younger generation with that of the older ones while keeping in mind what is good for the business. Families need to have open channels of communication, thereby identifying conflicts. They should not be dictated by ego and age. A family council can help large families, which can create a family constitution that will take care of not only the aspirations but also guide the family on all aspects, including the entry of youngsters into the business, the exit of older members, compensation, and job rotation. If differences of opinion within a family cannot be resolved, then one may have to take steps to divide the company either on the basis of ownership or on the basis of management. If irreconcilable differences still remain, then it’s better to split the business financially. So, there is no right answer. We have seen businesses where only two members of a family are fighting, and there are those which have survived many generations and are flourishing by creating supporting mechanisms. How do you see structures such as family governance evolving among Indian businesses? Since you have gone through a stressful family separation, what advice would you offer? Depending on the size and type of business, governance needs to be thought through at two levels. The first is within the family guided by a family constitution that we talked about earlier. The other is defining how the family interacts with professionals. If you want to create a company that is professionally managed, then you need to ensure that professionals also flourish. And in many family businesses, we observe that there are multiple family members involved. This potentially creates dual reporting structures. Professionals don’t like that and then there’s resistance. So, it’s important to create the right mechanism and governance to attract and retain good professionals. Otherwise, you will attract people who would want to be close to the family and play power games. This then is not based on meritocracy, but influence. In professionally-run family businesses, At times there is a dichotomy between the vision of the CEO and that of the promoter... How should that be resolved? As a founder, I had to align myself with the current management team at Marico. Aligning in terms of purpose, strategy, culture, and values of the organisation is very important. You need to have alignment with the CEO as well as with the board. In fact, when I appointed a professional successor as MD of Marico, we independently wrote down thoughts of our respective roles and expectations of each other. There was a close match. We then documented these and both of us had complete clarity. The key is to ensure that we foster the right culture of empowerment, agility, capability, risk-taking, and be aligned on areas of growth, and review the same periodically. The key role of any board is to select the right CEO and make that CEO perform better. How should a family balance emotions attached to trusted lieutenants while choosing leaders? Some people may have played a very important role in the company’s growth journey during the evolution of business. But at some stage, if one realises that the said person is not able to add value, and if you start rewarding loyalty, then it can actually impact the organisation and its growth. Ultimately, you function as a team and if you have a weak link in the chain, strong players in the team would get demotivated because the weak link impacts their performance. The best talent may tend to leave while the weaker members may continue with the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/biz-families-shouldnt-let-age-ego-ruin-ties/articleshow/87635268.cms||Namrata Singh

The main attraction of the event is 45 Aagam chhod which has been inked in gold that was kept on display for devotees along with kalpsutra that was carved on seashell by an Odiya artist. “On the occasion of Gyan Panchmi, we put different auspicious religious things including 45 Aagam chhod, which were handwritten with gold ink by a Muslim artist from Surendranagar district a decade ago. Sadly, the artist passed away last year after suffering from Covid-19,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji told TOI, adding that the invaluable religious scripture now enjoys approximately Rs 5 crore in market value at present. Shubhmangal foundation had gifted a gold written Bhagwat Gita to a Hindu foundation along with a Sikshapatri to Vadtal Swaminarayan trust. In return, the trust had gifted the gold written kalpsutra to Shubhmangal foundation, he explained. Along with this, handwritten kapsutra on seashell by an Odiya artist, wood print of Saraswati devi by Rajasthani artist, idol of lord Parshwanath made from a single wood trunk, an ivory Bhandar, Astlakshmi made from shreeparn wood and many more are kept on display, he said. Talking about the event, the acharya said that 300 devotees from different parts of the country are observing Updhan fast under the supervision of acharya Abhayadev Surishwarji. “We are going to celebrate the Mokshamala vidhi on December 8, the day on which Abhayadev Surishwarji will also complete 60 years of Diksha,” Moksha Ratna Surishwarji added. He said that of the 300 devotees observing fast, 150 are aged between 7 and 14 years. The 47-day long Updhan fast is a very tough ordeal which demands total dedication, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gold-inked-scriptures-shine-on-gyan-panchmi/articleshow/87634886.cms||Mehul Jani

Kakumanu Lalith Kumar, founder of Hindu Jana Shakti welfare organisation, had moved the PIL alleging that police officials are not following due procedure under sections 54 and 57 of CrPC. The counsel for the petitioner, PVG Umesh Chandra, told the court that police officers should produce the arrested accused before a medical practitioner soon after an arrest is made under section 54. They should also produce the accused before the magistrate concerned within 24 hours apart from conducting preliminary investigation under section 57 of CrPC. He further submitted that the Supreme Court has issued guidelines in the DK Basu vs State of West Bengal case on the procedure to be followed under section 54 of CrPC, following which an amendment was also brought in to ensure that the apex court’s guidelines are followed. It would amount to violation of Supreme Court orders if police do not comply with the procedure contemplated under section 54 of CrPC, he said, adding that section 57 of CrPC is drawn from Article 22(2) of the Constitution. Pointing out three incidents of custodial violence that were brought to the notice of the high court in recent times, Umesh Chandra said numerous such incidents take place in the state which go unnoticed. He also sought directions to magistrates dealing with such cases to strictly follow the guidelines. Considering his arguments, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy issued notices to the chief secretary and DGP and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cops-not-following-sc-guidelines-pil/articleshow/87634266.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The government also wanted the PPA to place all records before the Jal Shakti ministry as well as the finance ministry to include water component in the total project cost. Irrigation engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy made a presentation on the various components of the project at the PPA meeting held in Hyderabad on Wednesday. Stating that the Union finance ministry’s decision to impose component-wise restriction to reflect the expenditure and releases has not happened for any national project, he urged the PPA to send a suitable proposal to the Union Jal Shakti and finance ministries with a request to remove such caps. “The ministry of finance, in a communication, has stated that claims of the state government should be restricted to the price level of 2013-14 only and the Polavaram Project Authority has to regulate the releases component-wise. Accordingly, it has worked out the component-wise eligibility for 2013-14 price level only,” the engineer-in-chief said, adding that the finance ministry further considered to grant total project cost of Rs 20,398.61crore as cost of irrigation component after removing the drinking water component. Mentioning that removing the water supply component from irrigation component is against the norms of Central Water Commission, he brought to the notice of the PPA that the decision of the ministry of finance is also in violation of the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act which mandates the government of India to execute the project bearing entire balance cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/polavaram-govt-seeks-urgent-nod-to-revised-cost-estimates/articleshow/87634294.cms||Samdani MN

Their hopes of getting regularised at some point have now been dashed with the TTD administration firm on forming a separate wing on the lines of AP Corporation for Outsourced Services. The process of registering a dedicated outsourcing corporation for TTD has already been initiated. Blaming the temple body for unilaterally going ahead with the merger of societies and agencies into a centralised outsourcing corporation without taking the consent of outsourced and contract employees, TTD employees welfare association president M Nagarjuna said the employees were promised they would be absorbed as regular employees of the temple body. Meanwhile, the TTD has said that the number of societies and agencies which employ contract and outsourced workers have increased over the years. “There are allegations that salaries are not being properly paid to outsourced employees in some of these societies and agencies. To put an end to such irregularities, TTD has decided to set up a unified and centralised corporation to ensure that salaries and other benefits are directly paid to such employees without the intervention of middlemen or private agencies,” a statement from the temple body said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/unified-outsourcing-corp-for-benefit-of-employees-ttd/articleshow/87634515.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Although chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will take the final call keeping in view his previous assurances and the latest political equations, aspirants are leaving no stone unturned to enter the portals of the legislature. The chief minister is likely to finalise the lists after taking into consideration the 50 per cent share for SC, ST, BC and minority communities. Elections will be held to fill two seats each in Visakhapatnam, Krishna and Guntur districts, and one seat each in Vizianagaram, East Godavari, Prakasam, Chittoor and Anantapur. According to sources, the party is most likely to grant an opportunity to former legislator Marri Rajasekhar from Guntur district. The chief minister had promised to take him into the cabinet for vacating Chilakaluripet assembly constituency to accommodate a BC woman candidate during the last assembly election campaign. Another seat in Guntur district fell vacant following the retirement of senior leader Ummareddi Venkaetswarlu. Although Ummareddi, a former Union minister, wanted to make another entry into the legislature, the party is said to be looking for another candidate to fill the slot keeping in view the veteran leader’s age. Dutta Ramachandra Rao from Krishna district, former legislator Amanchi Krishna Mohan and former MP Narasimham’s wife Thota Vani from East Godavari (all from the Kapu community) are in the race from their respective districts. Sources said any two from the four strong contenders from the Kapu community are likely be given a chance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aspirants-jostle-for-mlc-tickets-cm-to-take-final-call/articleshow/87634422.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Rejecting nominations sans proper reason draws high court ire||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over election officers for rejecting nominations without giving proper reasons. After hearing several petitions challenging the rejection of nominations, the court said it appears election officers have forgotten they are government employees. G Mahendra Babu from seventh division of Nellore municipal corporation, Shaik Jafar Ali from 17 division of Rajampet municipality, and others moved the high court challenging the rejection of their nominations. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocates N Ashwani Kumar, K M Krishna Reddy and K Ramesh Babu told the court the election officers acted in a biased manner in rejecting the nominations. When the nomination papers were submitted, they did not raise objections but later rejected them citing silly reasons, they alleged. The high court took a serious view on the manner in which the nominations were rejected. Justice D Ramesh said he will issue notices to the election officers for explanation if they are made respondents in the petition. However, he was not inclined to entertain the interlocutory applications seeking directions to accept their nominations, observing there is no scope for judicial review once the election process is set in motion and the only remedy before the petitioners is to file an election petition. While dismissing the interlocutory applications with a direction to approach the state election commission, Justice Ramesh issued notices to the respondents in the writ petitions. In another matter pertaining to security for contestants and voters on election day, the court directed the police to take steps for conduct of free and fair elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rejecting-nominations-sans-proper-reason-draws-hc-ire/articleshow/87634452.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Liquor VAT slashed but a drink costs the same||VIJAYAWADA: The state government on Wednesday amended schedule-VI of the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act by reducing the rate of tax on various categories of liquor. VAT, which was being levied at anywhere between 130% to 190% on different categories of liquor, has now been reduced to the 35% to 60% range. However, the reduction is not being transferred to the end consumer as the excise department has issued another GO stating that the MRPs of liquor will remain unchanged with the addition of a ‘special margin’. In the GO 312 issued for amending VAT slabs on liquor, it was stated that VAT on liquor is high when compared to other states such as Telangana, which is collecting flat 70% and Karnataka, where no VAT is levied on liquor. To bring about parity with the neighbouring states, VAT slabs have been rationalised, stated the GO. The state government issued GO 313, stating that though VAT slabs have been reduced to bring about parity with other states, keeping in view its policy of reducing consumption of liquor, it has decided to levy a special margin that is equivalent to the reduction in VAT in order to keep the MRPs unchanged. The Andhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL) will be the ultimate beneficiary of the rejig of VAT slabs. As the MRPs remain unchanged, the amount equivalent to the reduced VAT will go to APSBCL. With the present arrangement in VAT slabs, the state government is likely to lose Rs 400 crore revenue per month as the average percentage of VAT reduction comes to 100% on the basic price of liquor. When contacted, the managing director of APSBCL, D Vasudeva Reddy said the decision to amend the VAT was taken by the government. He said the margins of APSBCL will increase with the present arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/liquor-vat-slashed-but-a-drink-costs-the-same/articleshow/87634463.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Inland Waterways Authority (IWA) has cleared permission for constructing two bridges for a 3.7-long-kilometer stretch on the Eluru Canal at Satyanarayanapuram. Vijayawada is geographically located between three major irrigation canals—Eluru Canal, Bandar Canal and Ryves Canal—and Budameru Rivulet. The canals have twelve bridges across them to ease transportation. But with traffic in the the city increasing, traffic congestion has become prevalent on the bridges. “We are residing at Gadeevari Polalu area at Madhuranagar. Though we are very near to Gunadala area, we are travelling all the way for five kilometers to reach Eluru road. Madhura Nagar Rail under bridge has been under construction for months. A bridge on Eluru and Ryves canals will be a big relief,” said K Maneesh Kumar, a businessman. In a bid to ease up traffic on the bridges, the district administration proposed eight new bridges in the city and also laid foundation stones. Irrigation officials have submitted detailed project reports (DPRs) and plans to the IWA and are waiting for approvals. Vijayawada Central legislator Malladi Vishnu expressed happiness over approvals for the double bridge on Eluru Canal at Satyanarayanapuram. “We are committed to solving the traffic problem in the city. Construction of new bridges is key for development of the city. We will soon start work on these bridges after water levels recede in the canal,” Vishnu said. Gunadala flyover, a new bridge near Kotha Vantena and a bridge at Madhuranagar on Budameru will be given top priority, Vishnu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/more-bridges-over-canals-planned-to-shorten-commuting-time-in-vij/articleshow/87634360.cms||Venu Lanka

A lunch motion petition was moved before the high court for urgent hearing on Wednesday by former minister N Amarnath Reddy and 17 others. Arguing on their behalf, Ginjupalli Subbarao told the court that the petitioners did not attack the complainant.

---||Ahmedabad||Costlier coal: Dye makers see production costs soar||AHMEDABAD: Spiralling coal prices have pushed up the prices of basic raw materials used to make dyestuff and dyes. Costly coal along with the reduction in imports from China have caused dye and dyestuff raw material prices surge 50 per cent to 400 per cent during April-October period. With coal prices increasing nearly two-times over a six-month period and a consequent increase in cost of basic chemicals, dyes and intermediates makers have downsized production by an estimated 80 per cent, according to Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers’ Association (GDMA), as their production costs have gone up. Coal prices have increased by 191 per cent over the past six months. Chemicals including aniline, acetic anhydride, naphthalene, sulphuric acid,H-Acid, J-Acid, K-Acid and vinyl sulphone, among others, which are used for manufacturing dyes and intermediates are become costlier in the range of 50-400 per cent. Coal plays an important part in chemical processing and production. Chemical factories use boilers to manufacture these raw materials,which are used in making dyestuff and intermediates. While gas and electricity-run boilers are also used to make these raw materials, coal-fired boilers are mostly used by manufacturing units as they are cost effective as compared to gas or electricity fuelled boilers. “The prices of basic raw materials have gone up substantially because of the steep surge in prices of coal. High coal prices have increased the production cost of factories which produce basic raw materials for dyestuff and intermediates. Reduction in supply from China further added to the pressure,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat Region, Basic Chemicals,Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). “As a result, dye manufacturers have been forced to raise the price of finished products they produced using these basic raw materials,”added Patel. Dyes and intermediates makers are also dependent on imported chemicals from China. “The power outage in China and consequent force-shutting of production has led to a 25 per cent short-supply of some of the basic chemicals. Supply constraints against a high demand is also responsible for raw material prices to go up,” said Natubhai Patel, managing director, Meghmani Organics, which manufactures these chemicals. A hike in raw material prices came at a time when the cost of gas,plastic packaging material and even freight charges are running high due to which MSMEs are facing dire working capital constraints. This has forced dyes and intermediates manufacturers to downsize production. “Dyestuff manufacturers are barely utilising 20 per cent of their installed capacities are manufacturers are unable to absorb the dramatic rise in production costs, which have increased by at least 50 per cent. Our clients refuse to bear the increased cost of dyes and intermediates and therefore, we’re only manufacturing enough to fulfil existing order commitments,” said Yogesh Parikh, president, GDMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/costlier-coal-dye-makers-see-production-costs-soar/articleshow/87634613.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Some of these patients were mild cases and didn’t require hospitalization or oxygen during Covid infection, doctors said.Child specialists said kids have been at receiving end of the poor air quality to a great extent. Doctors advised that people need to be alert and immediately see a doctor in case they get any symptom.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said he has been seeing a lot of Covid recovered patients in last one week. “With onset of winter and post Diwali generally, there is a spike in cases of asthma and COPD patients. This time, recovered patients, who had mild Covid, are also more. They complain of tightness or heaviness in chest, cough, and cold,” he said.Dr Sarnaik, who is member of district Covid task force, said some tests are prescribed for complete evaluation of such cases. “If Covid recovered patients have any symptoms, they must immediately see a doctor. Lung function test, chest Xray, allergy blood tests are done,” he said.As the pandemic turned ‘endemic’ and fears evaporating from minds, people seemed to have also discarded their treatment documents. “Covid history mentioning what type of infection it was, did O2 drop, pneumonia are helpful indicators for the treating doctor. But many patients say they have misplaced the records,” he said.Some patients also try to hide their Covid history though it serves as reference for further evaluation. “They should not conceal the Covid history,” he added.Pediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde said asthma and COPD patients need to be managed by increasing their dose of inhalers. “Air pollution, cold weather and viral infection worsen asthma,” he said.Dr Abhishek Madhura, assistant professor at GMCH department of paeditrics, said problems get aggravated for COPD patients. “Condition of all the asthmatic patients, reporting now, was in control a week ago. Now, their doses have been increased.

For its operation, the MC has not even taken permission from government, ministry of environment and wildlife board. The petitioner went on to add that in 1983, Uttar Pradesh government had written a letter to the civic body of Haridwar, asking it to operate a cable car in Mansa Devi, adding that the work should not be allotted to some other firm.

This is the first time that both the boards are organising the exams in two instalments and the admit cards that have come in, mention that they are for the first semester/term. That apart, Covid safety protocols, and in case of CBSE, the OMR sheets have also been mentioned in the admit cards. City schools are now scheduling distribution of admit cards and in most cases students are themselves coming and collecting them. Schools say that there is no point stopping board examinees from coming in to collect admit cards because campuses are re-opening next week for them. Some schools are however calling in parents to keep it safe since in these schools board examinees will not come in before the exams start. While ISC starts from November 22, ICSE starts from November 29. In case of CBSE, minor papers that are offered by a handful of candidates will start from November 17 while the major papers start from November 30. The CBSE admit cards have more new additions in the admit card compared with the CISCE issued ones. Not only do they mention that this admit card is meant for “Term-1”or only for the first board exam instalment, but they also say that each candidate comes in with a sanitiser bottle to the exam hall. “This is the first time that candidates will answer their board exam on OMR sheets so the admit card mentions that children have to follow instructions mentioned on the question paper and OMR sheet. The last point of advisory on the admit card says how the candidate has to get acquainted with the OMR sheet and how to respond on it. These are definitely new additions to the exam system in these Covid times,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School. Some principals pointed out that the reading time has also been increased by five minutes, perhaps because of the new format. “Earlier candidates had 15 minutes reading time, now the admit card mentions that they would be given 20 minutes to read the question paper,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. The CISCE admit cards mention that they are meant for “Semester 1 Examination.” Under a separate head, “Safety Instructions”, the admit cards remind kids about the importance of maintaining safe distance, wearing their masks properly and washing hands frequently. “I have distributed the admit cards of class XII and will distribute those of class X now,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohun Mission School. “I will distribute both on Monday,” said Father Rodney Borneo, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jhimli-new-look-board-admit-cards/articleshow/87634619.cms||---

The students from Agra's Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering Technical Institute were earlier remanded to a 14 –day judicial custody on October 28. They were then attacked by some lawyers in the presence of police while they were being taken to the district jail from the court. Several lawyers’ associations in Agra had subsequently refused to provide legal assistance to the students. A Mathura-based advocate, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, is currently defending the students. He is also fighting the case of 26-year-old PhD scholar, Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Mohammad Alam, who were booked under UAPA after they were arrested along with journalist Siddique Kappan while going to meet the family of a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras who was allegedly gang-raped and killed. Chaturvedi said he has filed a petition in the high court, seeking a transfer of the case from Agra to Mathura for the “security” of his clients as they had been attacked in the court premises earlier. When contacted, P D Salonia, superintendent of Agra district jail, told TOI that the trio will be produced through video conferencing as prisoners on remand usually appear virtually. College records show that the students, who secured first divisions in Class XII, were “performing well”. They had got admission in the institute under the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS), which is given to meritorious Class XII students from Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-police-to-seek-extension-of-kashmiri-students-remand-in-court-today/articleshow/87633684.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Akubathini's father said his son graduated from IIT Hyderabad two years ago. He was in his hometown as he was working from home during the pandemic and was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under IPC sections pertaining to sexual harassment and criminal intimidation, among others, and under the IT Act. He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathani trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-month-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Subsequently, he faced a barrage of online abuse. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profile to make such threats. The cyber team is well equipped to track them," said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. Ramnagesh’s upset father Srinivas told TOI, “My son is just a cricket lover and usually very sober in his reactions…I can’t understand why he did this.” The Delhi Commission for Women has also taken suo motu note of the tweet on the basis of media reports and asked Delhi police to register an FIR and arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-father-says-son-a-cricket-lover-usually-very-sober/articleshow/87634624.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||DDA reopens land pooling portal, hopes for better response||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has reopened the portal for landowners to pool their land and expects more participation. This is the fifth time since the launch of the ambitious land policy in February 2019 that the portal has been opened. “The response has been positive and the aim of reopening the portal from November 10 to December 24 is to allow more participation. Those who have land parcels near the priority sectors will particularly benefit from this opportunity,” said a DDA official. Sources said the Delhi government recently notified nine more villages as development areas for land pooling and reopening of the portal for 45 days would allow landowners of these villages to participate. The number of villages already notified for development under land pooling is 95 and the newly added nine villages fall in Zone P-I. On February 5, 2019, DDA launched a web-enabled, single-window portal for inviting registration for participation in land pooling. The portal was scheduled to be open for six months, i.e. till August 4, but due to a lukewarm response, DDA extended the date to September 6. At the time the portal first closed, the area of land pooled under the policy stood at 6,407 hectares. The portal has been reopened four times since then, and currently, the total land pooled under the policy is more than 6,900 hectares. According to officials, the land that has been pooled is enough to create a sub-city, but scattered land parcels need readjustment. Though DDA had finalised three “model sectors” in three different zones, which will be developed under the policy and serve as a template for future growth, work couldn’t fully start on the projects due to the pandemic, which affected the process such as verification of land records and field surveys. DDA had proposed major changes in the policy and made it flexible to present it as more attractive to developers and landowners. “Flexibility has now been given to developers and they have been enabled to use variable FAR. We have also permitted mixed use in land pooling area. The flexibility to convert commercial use to residential has been permitted as long as norms are not violated,” the official said. “We are moving in the direction of creating the model sectors, which will give a huge momentum to development under the policy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-reopens-land-pooling-portal-hopes-for-better-response/articleshow/87655188.cms||Sidharatha Roy

According the Textile Labour Association’s (TLA) advocate, Dhimant Vasavada, the high court has ordered the removal of encroachments from nearly 5,000 sq m of mill land and directed the official liquidator to obtain a fresh valuation of the land parcel to be sold. The high court has ordered that the process be completed in four weeks. The last valuation was made by a valuation committee in 2018. Earlier, part of the mill land was sold and from the realization, ex-workmen were paid 67% and 33% was paid to secured creditors. The encroached land could not be sold because of litigation between two families, who are still in possession of the land. A detailed report on the encroachment was placed before the high court, which has ordered removal of the encroachment. The two families had been fighting a legal battle in courts, which have rejected their claims to the land. In 2013, the Supreme Court rejected their appeals but the land could not be cleared of encroachments. TLA took up the issue of encroachment again and demanded in the high court that the official liquidator (OL) be directed to implement the apex court’s order for removal of encroachments. In 2019, the high court had ordered inspection by the district inspector of land records (DILR) and earmarking of the land in the presence of the TLA’s representatives. Accordingly, inspection was carried out and it was reported that there was encroachment on two different parcels of mill land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-fresh-valuation-of-mill-plot/articleshow/87634638.cms||---

Hearing the verdict, the victim’s father, who works as a labourer, broke down and said, "Today, I feel that the agitated soul of my daughter will be calmed." He further said, "If all such cases get a speedy trial and conviction, criminals with perverted minds will think a hundred times before laying an evil eye on others' daughters." The court of Justice Pallavi Agarwal also slapped a fine of Rs 1.40 lakh on the convict, who is himself a father of four girls. The money will be given to the victim girl's parents. On the day of the crime, the child was playing outside her house when she disappeared. Her body was found in a village pond two days later. An autopsy report revealed rape and injury marks on the body. An FIR was filed against the accused who was last seen with the girl. Forensic reports confirmed his involvement and he was booked for kidnap, rape, murder and causing disappearance of evidence, apart from other relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Speaking about the case, Bharat Sharma, assistant district government counsel said, "We had produced seven witnesses, including the one who had actually seen the accused playing with the child on the day of the crime. Besides, forensic reports also confirmed his involvement in the heinous crime." Elaborating further, SSP Bulandshahr Santosh Kumar Singh said, "Initially, it was a blind case and for two days, police teams worked hard to trace the child. Her posters were pasted across the village and extensive search operations were conducted in the nearby agricultural lands. Then, a witness revealed he had seen the child with a local man, which helped us crack the case."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pocso-court-sentences-man-45-to-death-for-rape-murder-of-2-year-old-after-just-over-a-yr-of-trial/articleshow/87633709.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kanpur||CM Yogi Adityanath flags off Kanpur Metro trial, PM Modi to launch services in December||KANPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday flagged off the trial run of the Kanpur Metro, saying the city’s people will soon have access to the best transport facility and the Prime Minister could launch the service in the next four to six weeks. As soon as the CM pressed the button, the decked-up Metro train, stationed inside the Depot, began moving. It then came out of the Depot onto the main line and the trial commenced. On the first day of the trial, the train ran at a speed of 60 km/hour between Geeta Nagar cross-over and IIT Metro station. The trials are being carried out under the strict supervision of Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO). Speaking on the occasion, the CM said, “It will be our effort to get the Metro service launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the next four-six weeks. The start of Metro services would be a treat for Kanpurites as they will get its benefits.” “I am thankful to Kumar Keshav Ji, managing director, Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited. Apart from this, I am grateful to the Prime Minister and Hardeep Singh Puri Ji wholeheartedly for their cooperation in this project. When it is opened for the general public, Prime Minister Modi will come to launch it,” he said. “The trial run of Kanpur Metro has commenced before its scheduled time. Within the next four to six weeks, the people of Kanpur will have a better public transport facility to commute. I congratulate all of you in advance. Kanpur has now become a metro city in itself. Metro service will provide great facility to the residents of Kanpur from the point of view of public transport,” he said, adding that the achievement of Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) in completing the work in time is commendable as the entire world has been facing problems due to the Corona pandemic. “There was no Metro in the state in 2017. Now, Metro trains are running in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida. Apart from this, Kanpur will get it soon. Uttar Pradesh is the only state in the country to provide Metro facilities in five districts and it is a great achievement,” the CM said at the function held on the occasion. The CM also flayed the previous governments for the delay in Metro project. “Kanpur was supposed to get the gift of Metro earlier, but it could not happen due to the negative and corrupt attitude of the previous governments,” he said. Earlier, the CM saw the facilities at the Metro Depot. He went inside the Operations Control Centre (OCC) and observed the facilities. He was briefed by Kumar Keshav about the OCC. Several other senior officials were also present. The CM also boarded a coach of the stationed Metro train and saw it from the inside. He was briefed about the state-of-the-art Metro and the facilities for the passengers. He was accompanied by UP ministers Satish Mahana, Neelima Katiyar, MP Satyadeo Pachauri, IAS officer Durga Shankar Mishra, BJP MLAs and others. After the inspection, the CM hit the button and the Metro started moving and went outside the Depot. UPMRC claimed that it had constructed the priority section of Lucknow Metro project in over two years time, carried out the trials and then that was the fastest work to have been done. But the trial on the priority section of Kanpur is being done in less than two years. The work on Kanpur Metro had started on November 15, 2019. The UPMRC MD, while talking to the media persons after the CM’s programme, said, “It would be our effort to start the Metro services on the priority corridor in the next one and half months. The finishing work at Metro stations is going at full speed and in the next one and a half months, the finishing work will be over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-flags-off-metro-trials-says-pm-could-launch-service-in-4-6-weeks/articleshow/87635392.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

The government’s pension is insufficient to support a family. My 37 years of service taught me that anganwadi employees have never been respected and are underpaid. Many of us are on the verge of committing suicide. We do not have any other options for survival,” said Udayakumari. The anganwadi workers named the strike as ‘survival strike’ because this is the only survival option they have. The strike is to let the government know about their miseries. The protest is to bring those injustices to light. More than 1,000 anganwadi workers from all the districts participated in the strike led by the INTUC which was staged in front of the Secretariat. The protesters demanded that the workers should be given a minimum salary of Rs 21,000 and that they have to be considered as government employees. The pension amount has to be increased to Rs 5,000 for teachers and Rs 3,000 for help workers, the workload has to be reduced, temporary workers must be made permanent and must initiate other welfare allowances and ESI. Presently, the salary provided for the anganwadi teachers is Rs 12,000 and the pension amount is 2,500. While the Kudumbashree is being provided with wages for taking surveys and other government related works, the anganwadi workers are forced to do all those works without any wages, they said. “We were forced to work in all government-sponsored projects and the wage is pitiful. We must work day and night. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the workload, one of the officials said that the time set aside for workers to sleep is a gift from the government. The majority of the time, the salary is also delayed. We are also compelled to perform cleaning duties,” said Bindhu N S, an anganwadi teacher from Wayanad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/underpaid-anganwadi-teachers-seek-justice/articleshow/87634654.cms||---

Cops here are now planning to move to Pune to record Gosavi’s statement. The process of getting a warrant against him has also been initiated, said SSP (Meerut) Prabhakar Chaudhary. The FIR against Gosavi, a copy of which is with TOI, mentions that a person named Rehbar Raza had filed a cheating case against him, his father and wife in December 2020 at Meerut's Civil Lines police station. It said Gosavi had duped him of Rs 14 lakh on the "false promise of giving good returns". When Raza enquired about his money, Gosavi allegedly threatened to implicate him in a "false case and even kill him". Chaudhary said on Wednesday that though the matter pertains to events that happened in Noida, the FIR was filed in Meerut on court orders and that an investigation was also conducted at the time of filing the case. “We have already informed police in Pune about the cheating case against Gosavi in Meerut. We had recorded his father’s statements earlier this year, but he claimed to have no knowledge of his son’s whereabouts. However, he maintained that he knows that there are several cases against his son in many police stations. Since then we have been looking for him,” the SSP said. Gosavi was a "witness" in the Mumbai cruise drugs case and came into the limelight after he was seen in a selfie with Shahrukh's son after the NCB raid on the luxury ship last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-begin-probe-in-yr-old-cheating-case-against-ncb-witness-gosavi/articleshow/87633726.cms||Ishita Mishra

Bachcha Singh was sleeping in the verandah of his house next to the temple. The incident came to light at 5 am on Wednesday. Bachcha Singh also told investigators that about fifteen years ago also there was a theft in the temple. “Then the idols made of Ashtadhatu of Rama and Lakshman were stolen. The thieves could not take away the Ashtadhatu idol of Sita,” he said. On the information of theft in the temple, Maharajpur police station in-charge reached the spot and initiated investigation. Police station in-charge Maharajpur Raghavendra Singh said that the incident is being investigated. “Soon the thieves will be in the police net,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ashtadhatu-idol-of-goddess-sita-stolen-from-temple/articleshow/87635408.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Bathinda rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby joins Congress, within hours of quitting AAP||CHANDIGARH/BATHINDA: Less than 24 hours after she quit the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bathinda Rural MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby joined the Congress party in the presence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and party’s state president, Navjot Singh Sidhu, on Wednesday evening. The move caused much heartburn in AAP, with leader of opposition in state assembly and Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema saying that she shifted loyalties for an election ticket of the Congress. However, Ruby insisted that her decision was not influenced by the demand for candidature. “You don’t need to be an MLA to work for people. In AAP, I raised a voice in favour of Bhagwant Mann: that he be made chief ministerial face of AAP for the 2022 polls. In a recent meeting, AAP MLAs had expressed concern at the dipping graph of AAP and demanded a resolution in favour of Mann,” she said. “There is a big difference in what they say and what they do... Nothing is being done by the AAP for the ‘aam aadmi’ in the state.” On why she joined the Congress, Ruby said she was “impressed” with its ideology. She claimed that the AAP government could not do in Delhi in 49 days what Channi and Sidhu had done for Punjab in the last 50 days. “The real party for the ‘aam aadmi’ is the Congress,” she said. Sidhu said Ruby will be treated as a family member and will be given due respect. Channi also welcomed Ruby. He added Kejriwal was not aware of Punjabi sentiments. After the resignation, AAP MLAs told TOI that desertions just before assembly polls were not a good sign. However, Cheema hit out at Ruby on Twitter: “Ruby is our younger sister, (she should) be happy wherever she goes. This time, she did not have a chance to get a ticket from the AAP. Therefore, she is joining the Congress. It is a request to the Congress not to cheat Ruby and give her a ticket from Bathinda Rural seat.” In reply, Ruby said Cheema knew better about where the party was going. “I could not stay quiet. When it was time for you to speak, you were silent. You never raised your voice, neither for the people of Punjab nor for Bhagwant Mann. I challenge you to contest against me," she said. When contacted, Cheema said Ruby had not turned up even when party national convener Arvind Kejriwal was in Bathinda. "She had almost made her intentions clear after the party legislative meeting on November 7. Through my tweet, I have only wished her good luck for her future and cautioned her," he said. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and Punjab affairs incharge Harish Chaudhary and cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Pargat Singh, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, among others were also present at the event in Chandigarh when Ruby joined the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/bathinda-rural-mla-ruby-joins-cong-within-hrs-of-quitting-aap/articleshow/87635426.cms||---

That was in 2018. The cop wasn’t able to walk or speak following the crippling mishap. The wheelchair-bound cop couldn’t report to work until 2020, after which the government stopped his salary. His treatment and joblessness created a severe financial crisis for his family. Now, three years after the fatal accident, SSP (Saharanpur) Akash Tomar, learning about the case, took to social media and urged policemen across the state to help Kumar. He managed to raise Rs 25 lakh, all of which has been deposited in the constable’s wife’s bank account. Tomar said, "The constable's wife had approached me, after which I made an appeal to the police fraternity across UP. I had also written to the department about the constable's present situation and recommended a disability pension for him." Kumar's wife Anjali told TOI, "The SSP was the first to deposit, Rs 10,000, into my account. We have received Rs 25 lakh so far and are grateful to everyone. I only request the government to provide better treatment and pension for my husband." Kumar, his wife and their six-year-son these days live with his parents in Baghpat. According to police sources, Kumar received his salary for two years after the accident but it was adjusted against his pending leaves. All his medical bills were also reimbursed, but it was halted a year ago which resulted in a financial crisis for the constable and his family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cops-pool-in-rs-25l-for-crippled-constable-reeling-under-financial-crisis/articleshow/87633741.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Officials claimed that the civic body will be the first from the state to earn carbon credit. Apart from generating fuel that can be used in vehicles, the biomethanation plant, which processes green waste, will also help the JuMC earn around Rs 20 lakh annually as carbon credit. The civic body has already got the approval from Universal Carbon Registry (UCR), which issues carbon credit. As per a rough estimate, JuMC will earn around 9,000 credits annually. By selling the carbon credit in the open market the JuMC can earn around Rs 20 lakh. Carbon credit is a transferable permit which allows its holder, be it an organization or country, to produce a certain volume of greenhouse gases (GHG). The biomethanation plant, with a capacity to process 15 tonnes green waste per day, was installed at a cost of Rs 5 crore. The agency that has provided the plant will handle its maintenance and operation for the first five years. Vinod Moradiya, MOS, urban housing and urban development, will inaugurate the plant on Saturday. The civic body daily collects around 130 ton of waste mainly from hotels, restaurants, commercial establishments and households. Out of this, around 50 ton is the green waste which is mainly kitchen waste, vegetable waste and other wet waste. Using 15 ton of green waste, the biomethanation plant will generate 500 kg of gas which can be used as fuel. Junagadh municipal commissioner R M Tanna said that the project is designed on the concept of waste to wealth. “This is a unique project because we will earn carbon credit out of it. If this waste is not processed, it would lead to accelerated global warming. We have been testing this plant since last one month and now we are going to inaugurate it,” Tanna said. JuMC is planning to start city bus service in future and the gas generated from this plant will be used in those buses as fuel.

As per the MoU, IIRS will monitor glacial lakes, glaciers, landslide zones and avalanche-prone areas in Uttarakhand through satellites. The move is expected to help the state -- which has seen several natural disasters in the recent past – get timely alerts about detectable natural calamities in advance so that it is better placed to respond to such catastrophes. According to an estimate, there are over 1,000 glaciers and over 1,200 small and big glacial lakes in the higher mountainous region of Uttarakhand. Girish Joshi, senior consultant, USDMA, told TOI that “the disaster management authority is going to extend Rs 3 crore to the IIRS for the study and regular monitoring of glacial lakes, glaciers, landslides and avalanche for next two years.” Dhan Singh Rawat, minister in-charge of the disaster management department, said technical co-operation and training imparted by the IIRS would prove beneficial in dealing with various calamities and other challenges in the state. Describing remote-sensing technology as important for pre-disaster preparedness, SA Murugeshan, secretary, disaster management department, added, "The IIRS’s training to the department's personnel will be on geographic information system-based products prepared earlier by the state disaster management authority." Prakash Chauhan, director, IIRS, gave a presentation on the occasion on various studies done by the institute on the Himalayan region and analysis of the disasters in Kedarnath and Uttarkashi districts in the past with satellite images. He said that the institute has been continuously monitoring lakes, avalanches and landslides formed in the Himalayas. "As soon as the information is collected, it is made available to the Government of India and state government," he added. Significantly, 298 people have been killed and 66 reported missing in weather-related disasters this year alone in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/isro-inks-pact-with-uttarakahnds-disaster-management-authority-for-satellite-based-mountain-hazard-assessment/articleshow/87634681.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Her husband Sooraj, who along with his wife goes by their first name, raised an alarm. Other female passengers soon reached out. And Simpi gave birth to a baby boy inside the train’s toilet. A few Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel on the train thereafter assisted the couple and also provided them financial help. When the train halted at Moradabad station, members of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) moved the woman to the district hospital. The woman's husband, who works at a private firm in Delhi, said, “Our doctor had earlier informed us that my wife would give birth sometime next month. So, we decided to go to our hometown during Chhath pooja for better health care and spend time with family and relatives. But maybe, God wanted it to happen this way. I'm very thankful to both CRPF and RPF personnel and fellow passengers for their assistance.” Speaking about the incident, RPF official Dharmendra Kumar said, “We were informed that a woman on board the train had gone into labour inside the washroom and had delivered a premature baby.

Nodal officer (vaccination) at MLN Medical college, Dr. Utsav Singh told TOI that over 1.5 lakh doses, including 95,000 first and 55,000 second, were given to eligible recipients between April 7 and October 31 this year. He claimed that MLN medical college-SRN hospital is the only government hospital in Prayagraj division to have crossed the 1.5 lakh doses mark in the past seven months. He added, “Out of 1.5 lakh doses given to the recipients of all age groups at MLN Medical college, there were 55% male and 45% female recipients. The figure also included 7,500 beneficiaries in terms of international flyers and 3,000 under the Abhibhavak campaign group. In Prayagraj district , over 37.26 lakh doses were given among eligible recipients till now. Dr. Singh said that officials of the health department, in a bid to speed up vaccination in rural and urban areas, have also picked up a “ split vaccination plan” wherein vaccination teams were changing vaccination sites within a stipulated time (one to two hours) to cover maximum number of recipients at a particular spot. In rural areas, ground health workers like ASHA, ANM and Aganwari workers were also issuing “invitation slips”, popularly known as “bulawa parchis” to eligible recipients after preparing a list and appealing them to take their first or second dose. Moreover, ground health workers have also taken up a different exercise in selected blocks where they were putting “tick mark symbol” outside the houses of the recipients. Single tick mark symbol is being placed outside the house of the recipients who have taken the first dose and double tick mark symbol on the house of those who have taken both the doses in rural areas. Meanwhile, health department officials claimed that over 37,26,537 doses were given to eligible recipients in the district so far and about 60% recipients were from the age group of 18-44 years. Officials said that about 62% target recipients were given the first dose while 20% target recipients were fully vaccinated. The district has set a target to administer Covid-19 vaccine to over 45.16 lakh beneficiaries in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/over-1-5-lakh-covid-19-doses-given-at-mln-medical-college-in-just-7-months/articleshow/87635438.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: SIT to probe Rs 6,600 crore loss, says minister Amrinder Singh Raja||CHANDIGARH: The government would constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe loss of Rs 6,600 crore to the state exchequer in the last 14.5 years, including 4.5 years of the Congress regime, due to ‘nefarious collusion’ of governments and the transport mafia, Punjab transport minister Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said on Wednesday. The minister said if Rs 6,600 crore had gone to the state exchequer, 24,000 new buses could have been procured and 50,000 drivers and conductors and other staff could recruited for these buses and that two new buses could be run from each village of the state. “The scam will be thoroughly investigated by forming a SIT and every person found guilty, be it a leader or an official, would not be spared at any cost,” he said. Warring stated that the daily income of the department has started increasing by more than Rs 1 crore per day after crackdown on tax evaders, illegal activities and bus operators without permit. He said the income of PRTC and Punjab Roadways stood at Rs 39 crore and Rs 34 crore, respectively, in September and has risen by around 42% in October, with PRTC earning over Rs 54 crore and Punjab Roadways earning over Rs 49 crore. “Ten-year rule of SADBJP and four-and-a-half-year rule of Capt Amarinder Singh’s compromised government allowed sheer loot of the state exchequer... the Akalis surpassed Ahmed Shah Abdali in looting the public money with both hands,” the minister alleged. Warring stated that the 2012 order of the Punjab and Haryana high court judge Justice Surya Kant against illegal expansion in multiple permits was not implemented properly. “We have now implemented this decision in toto and cancelled the 680 multiple permits of illegal expansion of more than 1 lakh kms. With this, the state government has started getting profit to the tune of Rs 42 lakh daily during the month of October,” he added. The minister stated that 304 buses have been confiscated for evading taxes, plying without permits and other violations and 64 buses have been challaned so far. The transport department has been able to collect Rs 7 crore as tax. As many as 842 more buses will be added in the state government fleet soon while 1,100 buses of PRTC and 1,550 buses of Punjab Roadways are already plying on roads in the state, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-to-probe-rs-6600cr-loss-punjab-transport-minister/articleshow/87635450.cms||---

Rajbhar made the assertion days after Yadav put Jinnah in the same league as Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, triggering criticism from several quarters, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Regarding his recent meeting with the jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari in Banda jail, Rajbhar said “how could Mukhtar be termed a criminal until he is convicted?” Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, Rajbhar strongly defended Yadav on his recent statement on Jinnah. “Top BJP leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani had praised Jinnah on many occasions, hence the BJP leaders should first read their own history. The partition of the country could have been avoided by making Jinnah the first PM of the country,” he said while referring to the purported statements of BJP leaders. Rajbhar, however, displayed annoyance after being repeatedly questioned on Jinnah. “Why are you not raising inflation and other issues of public interest,” he asked the reporters. On being targeted by BJP’s Rajbhar face and UP minister Anil Rajbhar for meeting Mukhtar in Banda jail, the SBSP chief said, “How he (Anil Rajbhar) can term a person a criminal without being convicted in any case by the court. I had met Mukhtar in jail as per the provisions prescribed by the government for meeting any prisoner. I have had relations with Mukhtar for the past 18 years. Why did the BJP not question my meetings with him when I was in government as its alliance partner?” Rajbhar termed the BJP “opportunist”. “If the BJP would need the support of two public representatives to save its government, it would fall at the feet of Mukhtar.” He also targeted Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati. “When she needed Mukhtar’s support, he was termed as a messiah of the poor. But, after exploiting his popularity she forgot him. Similarly, the BJP people also go to Mukhtar to seek his blessings,” claimed Rajbhar while terming the UP minister a “novice”. Rajbhar said that he would be holding a meeting of his Bhagidari Morcha leaders for conducting a mahapanchayat of Dalit, OBC and deprived sections at Jagatpur in the coming days. Yadav had made the remark apparently equating Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi and Nehru while lavishing praise on Patel on his 146th birth anniversary on October 31, raising many eyebrows. “Sardar Patel understood the ground and he made decisions accordingly. Hence, he is also known as Iron Man,” Yadav had said at a public meeting in Hardoi. “Sardar Patel, Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and (Muhammad Ali) Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/india-wont-have-been-partitioned-had-jinnah-been-made-first-pm-rajbhar/articleshow/87635457.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Chandigarh||Shots fired at Harsimrat event, Akalis say for scaring attackers||Ferozepur: Shiromani Akali Dal leader Vardev Singh Noni Mann fired in the air outside the venue of a SAD event near Makhu Gate here on Wednesday when some people from a crowd protesting against the party attacked his security guards. The SAD claimed that the attackers belonged to the Congress. The incident took place when protesters outside the venue and SAD workers started shouting slogans against each other. SAD claimed that during this time, some unidentified persons damaged the vehicles of Mann, who is the SAD candidate from Guru Har Sahai, and former MLA Joginder Singh Jindu from Ferozepur Rural. According to reports, when the security guards of Mann and Jindu tried to save the leaders, the assailants reportedly beat up the guards and tore their uniforms. However, the assailants fled after Mann took out his pistol and fired a few shots in the air in order to save the guards, SAD claimed. Following this, the situation turned tense, but the police intervened and the mob was dispersed. Later, all Akali and BSP leaders led by former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal met the SSP of the district and demanded registration of a case against Congress for their alleged hooliganism. Harsimrat alleged that sensing defeat, local Congress MLA Parminder Singh Pinki has been terrorizing our party workers and leaders by patronizing anti-social elements, but the people of the area are fed up from the excesses of Pinki and Congress and they would be given a befitting reply by the voters of Ferozepur. In her speech during the SAD event, Bathinda MP Harsimrat alleged that Punjab farmers were being harassed on the roads to arrange diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer while chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi was busy with photo sessions. She said farmers were being exploited financially as DAP was being black marketed, mandis were choked with paddy and the Punjab government had stopped procurement on the instance of the Centre. Harsimrat said it would have been better if the CM had gone to the Union ministers in Delhi to ensure availability of fertilizers. Terming the recent announcement by the Channi government as a mere election stunt, Harsimrat said cheap sand, electricity and other announcements made by the Punjab cabinet were nothing, but an attempt to lure the voters in the state. Farmer groups demanded registration of a case against SAD leaders under attempt to murder charges. They accused the leaders of trying to run over the farmers and indulging in firing when they (farmers) wanted to put questions before Harsimrat Kaur Badal. The SKM has given a call for massive protest at Ferozepur on Thursday to press the administration for taking stern action against Akalis. The farmers claimed that one of the SUV being driven by Akali leaders, including Vardev Singh Noni Mann, dragged BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) leader Harnek Singh Mehma for long. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) state president Buta Singh Burjgill said the Akalis in a bid to save MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal from being questioned by the assembled farmers tried to run over them in a huff and even fired some gunshots. The farmers have decided to assemble at Ferozepur in large numbers to hold a protest seeking action against Akalis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shots-fired-at-harsimrat-event-akalis-say-for-scaring-attackers/articleshow/87635499.cms||Dinesh K Sharma

As per the high court direction, the state election commission will have to complete elections in these districts by December. “We told the court that since the government has already withdrawn the notification, the writ petition becomes infructuous. The elections will be held in all the panchayats in four districts, except for the newly-created panchayats due to delimitation,” said an official. Earlier, SEC had urge Rajasthan High Court to clear all disputes related to delimitation of panchayats in these districts so that elections to the posts of panchayat samiti members and zila pramukhs in these districts could be conducted without further delay. “The creation of new nagar palikas in Kota, Baran and Karauli districts led to delimitation of several panchayats. However, delimitation of these panchayats were challenged in the court. In Ganganagar too, due to delimitation in Lalgath Jatan nagar palika, the panchayat samiti elections have been postponed,” an SEC official had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panchayat-polls-hc-removes-stay/articleshow/87636044.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Redrawing of Mumbai’s electoral wards won’t delay BMC polls, say officials||MUMBAI: The number of electoral wards in the BMC has not been increased since 2001. In the very first decade of the millennium, the city’s population rose by 3.87%. “As a result, it was necessary to increase the number of representatives,” said a government statement. Asked whether this will cause a delay in the polls, officials said it was unlikely. State election commissioner UPS Madan said it depended on how quickly the BMC re-draws ward boundaries. As a first step, the state will have to issue an ordinance on the decision. “The BMC will then have to present a draft of the new ward boundaries. Suggestions and objections will have to be invited from the public and the draft will also have to be presented to the state election commission for approval,” said Madan. The BMC had on October 26 submitted its final draft of electoral boundaries for Mumbai’s 227 electoral wards to the SEC. “With the decision to increase the seats, the entire exercise will have to be redone. We will be back to square one, but this is unlikely to cause any major delay in the elections,” said a senior civic official. However, election data analyst Hitesh Jain said there could be a slight delay in the polls. “Sitting corporators and aspirants had already begun their campaign and preparations keeping in mind the existing wards. But with nine additional wards, the entire setup will be shaken up and aspirants will have to redraw their strategies too. If the number of wards goes up, the caste and community combination will also change in a big way since this is happening after 20 years,” Jain said. With the change, the number of voters in each ward will reduce. “The average number of voters in each electoral ward currently is 54,000. After the wards increase, the number will reduce to 51,000, with a 10% margin. The voting population in Mumbai is around 1.24 crore,” said a senior civic official. The last time wards were increased in Mumbai was in 2002, when the number went up from 221 to 227. After the 2011 census came out, the BMC had redrawn electoral wards to account for a rise in population in the suburbs and a decline in the island city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-redrawing-of-citys-electoral-wards-wont-delay-bmc-polls-say-officials/articleshow/87634716.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

In joint operation by special operation group and police, 19 packets of drugs worth Rs 88 lakh were seized in the morning while another 47 packets were found later. The drugs were brought from sea route to be smuggled into Gujarat from the coastal areas of Dwarka district. Police sources said that based on specific information, they detained Sajjad Dhosi (44), a resident of Mumbra of Thane district in Maharashtra and found drug packets concealed in his bags. He was carrying 6.618 kg methamphetamine and 11.483 kg heroin in three bags including luggage and school bag. This seizure is valued at Rs 88.25 crore. Sajjad came to Khambhalia from Thane on November 7 and had checked into a guest house. He checked out on November 9 and took the delivery of the drugs.

When police raided their residences, they found another 47 packets of drugs, contents of which were being verified by the forensic team. Talking to TOI Sandeep Singh, range IG Rajkot, said “We have found more 47 packets and the contents are being analyzed. Primary investigation reveals that the drugs came through the sea route but we are investigating how it came, whether it came in a boat, what was the modus operandi and who are other people involved in this racket.” “Ghosi had gone to jail in a murder case in the past and Salim Kara has been arrested in the past in NDPS, fake currency and Arms Act cases," Singh said. According to police, Sajjad was supposed to go to Maharashtra after taking the delivery of the consignment but it’s not clear who was the receipent of the 47 packets. Sources claimed that the police have detained Salim and Ali. Infamous smugglerSalaya has been infamous for smuggling, especially during the era of the Gold Control act. According to sources in the customs department, gold and cigarettes were being smuggled from Salaya. There are 42 desolate islands near Dwarka which are potential routes for drug peddlers. According to notification, it’s prohibited to go on these islands to prevent illegal activities. However, criminals are using these islands as a haven.

---||Mumbai||Continue online home delivery of liquor: ISWAI urges Maharashtra government||MUMBAI: The International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI), the apex body of the premium alcobev sector, has urged Maharashtra government to continue to allow ‘online’ home delivery of liquor in order to address low retail density and price arbitrage issues faced by the industry.  These challenges “besides causing revenue loss, are also resulting in smuggling of spurious and counterfeit liquor, thereby compromising public health,” it said in a statement.  The state introduced home delivery in order to plug excise revenue losses during the lockdown. According to ISWAI, home delivery can enable convenience and offer safe buying for women. Members of ISWAI include global leaders like Bacardi, Beam Suntory, Brown Forman, Diageo, Moet Hennessy, Pernod Ricard, and William Grant & Sons.  “A survey by LocalCircles, a community-led platform, has revealed that 95% of consumers of alcoholic beverages in Mumbai called out convenience & social distancing as the two most important reasons for ordering alcohol via home delivery,” the ISWAI said adding 78% women consumers across major Indian cities say they are likely to buy alcohol themselves if online or home delivery service is made available.  Nita Kapoor, CEO, ISWAI said home delivery will improve the purchasing experience and dignity of purchase for women buyers while unlocking potential of an alternate channel for state revenues.  “We request the state government to strengthen and frame standard home delivery norms to ensure that no delivery is done to underage consumers”, she added.  Suresh Menon, secretary-general, ISWAI, said, “Given that the population has increased four times in the last 50 years, the state has not seen much changes in AlcoBev retail store numbers since 1974 or thereabouts, i.e., around 1,700 outlets for spirits, across such a geographically widespread state. A proper home delivery model would ensure equitable access to liquor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/continue-online-home-delivery-liquor-cos/articleshow/87636046.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The man went missing on Monday after he went to fetch fodder for his cattle. The body was found on Wednesday afternoon. Pugmarks of an adult tiger were found at the spot, said forest department officials. Anil Patel, deputy director DTR (buffer), told TOI, “The victim was identified as Asaram from Grunt Daatpur village. The nature of injuries on the body suggests that he was killed by a tiger. But it looks like it was an accidental attack as the tiger did not eat the flesh.” He added that a team would monitor the area to keep a track of the tiger’s movement to prevent another attack, he added. The area is part of a wildlife corridor between Mohammadi range and Mailani range, which has been disturbed due to human encroachment, said foresters. As the area is frequented by tigers, there is always a possibility of man-animal conflict but, no incident had been reported in the recent past, they added. Patel said Asaram’s kin would be provided with Rs 10,000 as immediate compensation from Dudhwa Society and Rs 4 lakh under the state disaster relief fund. “We will send our report to the revenue department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-mauls-man-to-death-near-dudhwa-forest/articleshow/87633830.cms||---

Maruf, who goes by his first name, picked up Vikas Singh, a Delhi University assistant professor, from the Moradabad railway station and dropped him at a bus stop. It was only after Maruf got off the auto-rickshaw to look for another passenger that he noticed the bag. Thinking of ways to get through to the passenger, he decided to open the bag and found a diary containing the contact details of Singh, whom he immediately called, saying the latter had left his bag in the auto-rickshaw. Singh, who had already approached police by then, heaved a sigh of relief after speaking to Maruf and asked him to come to the Galshaheed police station. Police said Singh, who resides in Delhi, was to reach Amroha to drop his wife. SHO, Galshaheed police station, Moradabad, Mohit Chaudhary said, “By the time the passenger reached the police station, the auto-rickshaw driver had contacted him.” Appreciating the driver for his kindness and honesty, the SHO added, “Such incidents rarely happen. Passengers who forget their belongings in public transport hardly get those back. In this case, the passenger had no details of the driver or vehicle. It could’ve been challenging to trace the driver. But the man proved that humanity still exists. As a reward, Maruf has been given Rs 1,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/auto-driver-returns-bag-with-rs-2-5-lakh-to-du-prof/articleshow/87633812.cms||Maria Khan

The students who have appeared for odd semester examinations are anxiously waiting for the announcement of results. MU had assured to announce the results by the end of October. According to sources from the MU examination section, the evaluation and results have been reportedly delayed due to an error in entering data and mismatch of answer sheets. “Due to this grave mistake, officials are not able to finalise the results. The evaluation is also delayed due to adoption of a new software, which the officials are yet to get their hands on,” a source added.

We have completed the evaluation of BBA and BCom answer papers and evaluation of papers of other streams are in progress. We have decided to announce results in phases to avoid any errors. Meanwhile, evaluation of the sixth semester examination for both undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses are in progress, and will be completed in a few days,” he added. On the delay, Dharma said that during the examination, some colleges have wrongly entered the data of candidates. “As a result, the officials are not able to match the answer sheets with the code,” he said. “This ate up time in tracing those candidates, and setting it right,” added Dharma. The examination that started in April had to be postponed several times due to various reasons. In April, it had to be postponed due to the second wave of Covid-19 and KSRTC bus strike. It resumed from August, but was stopped for a few days by the district administration, as there was a steep surge in Covid-19 cases. The PG examinations that were planned in April took place in August. Finally, both UG and PG examinations got over in the first week of September. To help final-semester UG and PG students, MU conducted an examination that concluded a few days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-yet-to-announce-odd-semester-exam-results/articleshow/87633836.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Meanwhile, Delhi’s overall air quality improved from the “severe” category on Tuesday to “very poor” category with an AQI of 372. A senior environment department official said special attention would be given to locations that fared the worst and featured regularly in the “severe” category during the period. “The monitoring stations have been divided based on municipal zones. The heads of the corporation have been asked to intensify water sprinkling and use dust suppressants on roads that have seen the maximum number of severe days. Other agencies concerned have been told to step up their actions too,” said the official. North corporation, which has 16 monitoring stations under its jurisdiction, had three stations recording five “severe” days and six stations with four “severe” days. Three stations under East Delhi Municipal Corporation witnessed four “severe” air quality days. With 15 monitoring stations, South Delhi Municipal Corporation had just one that saw four severe days, while New Delhi Municipal Council had no stations recording four or five severe air days. Four new locations turned “severe” between November 1 and 8 — Alipur, ITO, Sonia Vihar and Nehru Nagar. The findings were shared during the review meeting on air pollution chaired by environment minister Gopal Rai with various departments. Delhi recorded three “severe” air quality days between November 1 and 8, while the fourth one was recorded on November 9. The share of stubble burning in PM2.5 remain the same as Tuesday at 27% and the fire count was 5,317. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research said, “Winds at transport level are likely to increase in speed for the next two days and the direction (northwest) is also favorable for transport of stubble-related pollutants to Delhi as fire counts are also increasing. Air quality is expected to deteriorate for the next two days, but will remain in the upper end of very poor or touch the lower end of severe category intermittently. Air quality is likely to improve on November 13.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/focus-on-worst-of-hotspots/articleshow/87635022.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The police identified the accused as Binu, 42, and Vinod 44, of Kottoor. The police said the two men were arrested based on a complaint filed by a private finance firm at Kuttichal where they tried to pawn gold plated steel bangles. Incidentally, the accused had allegedly pulled out similar fraud in the same finance firm a year ago. Thus, the staff grew suspicious and alerted the police. The police said that the modus of the accused was to pawn fake gold ornaments and then refrain from repaying the loan. They had allegedly duped several finance firms in Kottoor, Kariyode and Kuttichal regions for the past one year. They mostly targeted small finance firms that do not have the facility to conduct sophisticated tests to check the purity of the ornaments. Inspector S Bijoy said two more men were involved in the gang and their arrest will be made soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-arrested-for-pawning-fake-gold/articleshow/87634753.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP slams ruling alliance over increase in wards||Mumbai: The BJP on Wednesday slammed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and claimed that increasing the number of corporators in BMC was an attempt to carry out delimitation without any new census data in hand. The BJP alleged that the BMC was exposed in altering ward boundaries to favour the Shiv Sena, so the government was now resorting to another way to redraw ward boundaries favourably. “Objections were raised with the state election commission (SEC) regarding illegal ward boundaries. The BMC was caught red handed and the SEC found glaring mistakes. Hence, increasing wards to 236 is another attempt to redraw boundaries. But it can't stand before any court as there is no new census. This is also a futile attempt by the MVA to get favourable ward boundaries drawn,” BJP MLA Ameet Satam said. “Shiv Sena could see defeat due to the corruption it indulged in for the last 25 years. So they made a desperate attempt to redraw ward boundaries to favour their candidates. No matter what they do, BJP is going to win Mumbai,” BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar said. —Chaitanya Marpakwar & Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-slams-ruling-alliance-over-increase-in-wards/articleshow/87634742.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sources alleged that because of interference by the legislators, JMC-Heritage was yet to form working committees. Sources said the MLAs were yet to reach at a consensus on giving chairmanship to councillors and besides resolving their internal tussles. “MLA Mahesh Joshi and Rafiq Khan are at loggerheads as both want their councillors be lead the powerful committees like finance, building planning and lights,” said a corporation source. On Wednesday, Congress councillors complained to JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar on interference of MLAs in their day-to-day functioning. “When any civic work is completed by an MLA or an MP, their name is publicised. Then why not councillors’ name are promoted when we work day and night for the public. MLAs have become god like figures in JMC-Heritage and the mayor has no power,” said a Congress councillor. BJP councillors alleged that Congress MLAs don’t let the officials work efficiently in their wards and they face discrimination. BJP councillor Vimal Aggarwal said, “There is excessive interference of Congress MLAs. They have appointed officials for their own suitability. These officials don’t listen to councillors.” Some BJP councillors, however, said though interference of BJP MLAs is not much in JMC-Greater, but that is because their mayor is now a puppet in the hands of the government. “BJP MLAs could have interfered if their government was in power. Although, MLA Ashok Lahoty and Kalicharan Saraf did speak for matters related to their areas, at the time of polls, there was tussle in the BJP for ticket distribution,” a BJP councillor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mlas-interference-affect-civic-bodies-performance/articleshow/87636063.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Autonomous colleges to add extra courses||Mangaluru: The autonomous undergraduate (UG) colleges in the coastal district will add extra courses of their choice to each stream, in addition to the curriculum prescribed under the National Education Policy by Mangalore University. The courses include massive open online courses (MOOC), research component and others. The four-year UG course under NEP commenced this week across the district, and all colleges are following the curriculum prescribed by Mangalore University. However, autonomous colleges have decided to add a few short-term courses without diluting the original curriculum. These short-term courses not only give extra credits to the students, but also aim at improving their skills to make them ready for industry. Under NEP’s four-year graduation programme, it has multiple exit options. A candidate on completion of two semesters earns a certificate,on four semesters earns a diploma, degree on completion of six semesters and honours for completing four years or eight semesters. The old UG programme had six semesters, and got over in three years. An official from St Aloysius College shared that without making any changes or diluting the NEP curriculum of four-year courses, the institution has decided to add a few more short-term courses to the full-time course. ‘We will make sure that these add-on courses along with regular courses will not affect the academic bank of credit, in case a candidate wants to shift to another education institution after one or two years of completing the course. The add-on courses will give an edge to students to earn credits as well skills,” the official explained. Another autonomous college in the region, St Agnes College, has been offering add-on courses in its previous UG programmes. The college had been offering the computer literacy course free-of-cost to all students during the old UG programme. However, the NEP has added digital fluency as one of the subjects in one of the semesters. This course is an advancement of computer literacy, said Sr Venissa, principal of the college. “Since NEP has just been implemented, we may add extra courses along with the NEP curriculum in the coming days. Currently, the curriculum has been given only for two semesters,” she added.  “The autonomous colleges have flexibility to add open electives and also make changes in the NEP curriculum from 20% to 40%. However, in anyway it should not kill the spirit of NEP,” said Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/autonomous-colleges-to-add-extra-courses/articleshow/87633875.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The 14 lakh Covaxin doses in the state’s kitty would remain usable till April-May next year, stated Maharashtra’s health officials. The rest 76 lakh are Covishield doses and as per their expiry date, they can be used till August 2022. “The new stock of Covishield doses have nine-month expiry timeframe and for Covaxin, it is six months,” said a senior official of the state health department. A senior official from the Union health ministry told TOI that as many as 16 crore vaccine doses were lying with 28 states and eight Union territories and could be used up to next year. “There is no question of wasting any stock because the expiry date of the current vaccine stock available with the states is not January but April-May, and even later. Doses are administered, and stocks are replenished in a cyclic manner because Covishield has to be administered with a gap of about three months and Covaxin at an interval of over a month,” said the official. The state is planning to clear the pending stock of Covid vaccines through the accelerated “Har Ghar Dastak” programme. Maharashtra will get over 2.21 crore doses of vaccines in November. A stathe health official said, “We are sure to finish the stock at the earliest through our increased and accelerated vaccination programme, which had slightly slowed down during festivities.” Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that the state was proactively approaching the beneficiaries who missed their second doses and those who were yet to get the first dose under the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign. He said the target was to ensure that all eligible population received at least one dose of Covid vaccine by November 30. The state health officials claimed that their goal for the month would be to vaccinate nearly 2 crore beneficiaries not receiving any doses till now. Nearly 75% beneficiaries have received the first dose and 35% the second dose in the state so far. About 5.9 crore beneficiaries in the state are due for their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/90l-pending-covid-vax-doses-in-maha-expiry-date-mid-2022/articleshow/87634765.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Third non-bailable warrant issued against ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The 8th metropolitan magistrate court on Wednesday issued a non-bailable warrant against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh in an extortion case. This is the third such non-bailable warrant issued against Singh. A confidential report of the state is believed to have stated that Singh is in Chandigarh. Last month, a Thane court as well as the 37th Metropolitan court issued non-bailable warrants against Singh in connection with two extortion cases registered against him and others. The state CID and the Thane police have also issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) against Singh suspecting that he may flee the country. In the latest case, police have arrested two persons named Sanjay Punamia and Sunil Jain and two police inspectors Nandkumar Gopale and Asha Korke. Despite three summons, Singh has failed to appear before the state CID or reply to them regarding the case. The warrant will pave the way to declare him an absconder. Singh went on sick leave in May this year citing health issues after he wrote to the chief minister making serious allegations of corruption against the state’s then home minister. He’s been off duty since. Two months later, Marine Drive police in July registered a case of extortion, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde and six cops for allegedly trying to extort Rs 20 crore from a businessman named Shyam Sunder Agarwal. In February 2021, Punamia had filed a complaint against Agarwal accusing him of issuing threats through gangster Chhota Shakeel. A case was registered with Juhu police station. Singh was the Mumbai commissioner of police then and the crime branch was asked to probe the complaint. According to Agarwal’s complaint, officers allegedly at the behest of Singh, pressured him to arrive at a settlement and demanded Rs 50 lakh for it. Meanwhile, an intelligence report has rubbished reports that Singh has left the country and said he is very much in Chandigarh. State CID, Thane police and crime branch have made four visits in search of Singh to Chandigarh. But they could not trace him nor did they receive cooperation from local police to find him. Police officials said they met a doctor who treated Singh who confirmed he was in Chandigarh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-third-non-bailable-warrant-issued-against-ex-mumbai-police-chief/articleshow/87636080.cms||Ahmed Ali

For around 40 minutes, councillors of both BJP and Congress questioned Gurjar regarding civic problems, sanitation issues, street light problems and formation of committees besides demanding a general body meeting of the corporation. Sources at the corporation said the councillors expressed displeasure for not forming the committees even after a year. “Work should be divided between different committee chairmen. We have been demanding it for a long time. BVG Company is not working properly and hoopers are not going to the wards every day. The mayor should look into these problems instead of just sitting like a mute spectator,” said a councillor. According to municipal laws, there should be a general body meeting every two months. But till now, one meeting was convened. Congress councillor Sunita Mahawar said there was a need to look at the functioning of the corporation properly and work on its improvement. She said a general body meeting was the need of the hour where a proper discussion on various issues could be held. BJP councillors alleged that there was discrimination and civic work was not being done in their wards. Ward 73 BJP councillor Amar Gurjar said, “No work has been going on across the city especially in BJP wards. Despite writing letters, meeting officials and number of calls, BJP councillors are always last to get any facility. If there was a call for sewer jetting machine or installation of street lights, BJP councillors were always ignored while Congress wards were given priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/on-heritage-mayors-first-anniv-councillors-grill-her/articleshow/87636070.cms||---

India has been facing a drug-resistant Candida auris crisis which is being dubbed as a global health threat – since 2011. However, the virulent and difficult to diagnose and treat fungal infection caused by Candida auris strains is now being seen in 40% of the fungal infection as against its reported incidence of 5 to 6% prior to the pandemic. “In a nationwide study, only 5-6% of the candida infections in India were caused by Candida auris prior to the pandemic. However, in the last one year, drug resistant Candida auris is the fungal species seen in more than 40% of patients with candida infections in our study. Half of these patients have had Covid in the past, were hospitalized and treated with steroids and multiple drugs,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag, the study’s lead investigator. In addition to the widespread use of steroids, antifungals, and antibiotics in Covid patients, the availability of improved and accurate diagnostics has also contributed to the increased detection rate, experts have said. “We would detect five patients with drug-resistant candida auris every year prior to the pandemic, now we get five such patients every month at our hospital. Almost all of these patients are referred to us from small units for higher treatment after a prolonged hospital stay outside,” Prayag said. To detect Candida auris, sophisticated testing infrastructure such as MALDI-TOF machines are required, which are available at a few centers across the country. “Routine testing methods often fail to identify the drug-resistant strain. Before 2019, the MALDI-TOF machines were available only at a handful of centers. But now it is available at quite a few centers. We have this machine at DMH,” Prayag said. The CDC estimates that 30% to 60% of patients with Candida auris infections have died, but the agency notes that many of those patients have multiple underlying health conditions, making it difficult to determine how much the pathogen is contributing to those deaths. Since being discovered, Candida auris has spread rapidly across the globe, with multiple cases reported in healthcare facilities in more than 30 countries, including the US. “The fungus can survive on dry surfaces for weeks and is hard to kill once it gets on hospital surfaces,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the national Covid task force. Since then, despite implementing contact precautions, using bleach to disinfect surfaces, and decolonizing patients with the antiseptic chlorhexidine, the proportion of hospitalized patients testing positive for Candida auris has gone up significantly over the last two years, Pujari said. Mumbai-based Masina hospital’ s infectious diseases expert Trupti Gilada said, “There has been a steep rise of drug resistant Candida auris during the pandemic which is a potentially fatal infection most often seen in admitted patients.” Prolonged hospital stays, immunity suppressed by steroids, use of broad spectrum antibiotics and in-dwelling catheters makes the patient susceptible to this fungus which can cause infection of blood, wounds, urinary tract, Gilada said. “Candida auris is also been showing resistance to an increasing number of antifungals during the Covid-19 pandemic and the mortality rate in such patients goes very high,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drug-resistant-fungal-infection-cases-rise-most-patients-ncov-cured-study/articleshow/87634780.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The CBIC has issued guidelines in this regard in which it has been made clear that from now on, the officers will not block the ITC without recording “reason to believe” in writing. In these guidelines, which were issued on November 2 by CBIC’s GST policy wing, it has also been instructed that in case an officer blocks the ITC under due procedure, the taxpayer will be informed about the action on GSTN portal along with details of the officer who has blocked it. Besides this, monetary limits of blocking of ITC have also been set according to the designations of the officials. Several tax bar associations and tax professionals from Ludhiana and elsewhere had been taking up the issue of some officials not following the proper procedure when blocking the ITC.NK Thamman, a tax professional, said, “On November 2, CBIC issued guidelines to stop mechanical blocking of ITC. As per these, before blocking ITC, the officer must form an opinion only after considering all facts of the case, amount of ITC involved and whether it was necessary to block it to protect interest of revenue. The officer will record ‘reason to believe’ on the file before proceeding. Further, as per these guidelines, the monetary limit of blocking of ITC has also been fixed. A deputy or assistant commissioner can block ITC up to Rs 1 crore, additional or joint commission above Rs 1 crore but not exceeding Rs 5 crore and principal commissioner or commissioner above Rs 5 crore.”Thamman said, “The taxpayer concerned will be informed about the action along with details of the officer who has blocked the ITC. The taxpayer can approach the officer concerned with his submissions. After the officer is satisfied, he can clear the tax credit. The department has to conclude its proceedings within a year of blocking of the ITC. These all are welcome steps, as these will put certain restrictions on departmental action and officers will not be able to mechanically block the ITC. Earlier, the taxpayers faced many problems and in certain cases blocking was not lifted even after a year.”Narinder Bhamra, president of Fastener Manufacturers’ Association of India, said, “We are grateful to the CBIC for the guidelines. Till now, the procedure as per law was not being followed by some officials, resulting in huge amounts of ITC backlog. But now, genuine taxpayers will certainly get a big relief as their refunds will not be withheld on mere suspicion.According to Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, “The new guidelines will prove to be beneficial to the businessmen, tax professionals and the department as well because now there will be more transparency and accountability. The taxpayers will be able to know why their refund has been blocked and which official has done it.”Reasons to block ITC on material evidencePoint 3.1.4 of CBIC’s guidelines on this subject says, “It is reiterated that the power of disallowing debit of amount from electronic credit ledger must not be exercised in a mechanical manner and careful examination of all the facts of the case is important to determine case(s) fit for exercising power under rules 6A. The remedy of disallowing debit of amount from electronic credit ledger being, by its very nature, extraordinary, has to be resorted to with utmost circumspection and with maximum care and caution. It contemplates an objective determination based on intelligent care and evaluation as distinguished from a purely subjective consideration of suspicion. The reasons are to be on the basis of material evidence available or gathered in relation to fraudulent availment of input tax credit or ineligible input tax credit availed as per the conditions/ grounds under sub rule (l) of rule 86A.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/itc-cannot-be-blocked-on-officers-whim/articleshow/87633894.cms||Mohit Behl

The move came following a TOI report on Monday that cars were being parked on cycle lanes at several places across the township. A pick-up van that was parked, blocking the cycle lane at ‘Atharo tola’ crossing for about two weeks was finally removed after the issue had been raised on the WhatsApp groups of the New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of residents’ forums in New Town. Residents said this monitoring should be a continuous process. “We thank the NKDA for taking a prompt action to remove the pick-up van from the spot and NTFN for raising the issue,” said a local resident. Earlier, auto drivers used to park their vehicles on the cycle lane near Greenfield Heights housing complex. The authorities warned the auto drivers against obstructing the cycle lane by parking their vehicles. The NKDA officials said that they have engaged a team of volunteers to keep tabs on the issue and conduct an awareness drive for the next few weeks to sensitise people about not blocking the cycle lanes by parking their cars. The NKDA set up 17km cycle lanes in different parts of New Town. NTFN chairperson, Samaresh Das, said, “The NKDA should keep cycle lanes on only one side of the road and remove the barriers from the sides of the lanes, which is not serving any purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-starts-removing-parked-vehicles-from-cycle-lanes/articleshow/87634776.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Deputy Mayor P K Raju and chairman of finance standing committee has dues just over Rs 1,000 for his two building numbers in Medical college while parliamentary party leader D R Anil owes corporation dues around Rs 7,000 for three shop building numbers in Medical college. Nearly 100 buildings owned by Thiruvananthapuram development authority owe corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs. It is the top defaulter as per the list made available for Medical college ward. In many cases, single digit dues were reflected against the building number under total arrears which in all probability would have resulted either from erroneous calculation or system error, revenue officials said. This was the third list to be published by the city corporation after a tax list of four wards under Thiruvallom zone was published on Monday. Even while lists for Medical college and Pattom were being finalised, the officials reportedly dealt with glitches in the software during posting. Data uploaded within a span of hours were found missing in the system which was somehow rectified later and updated on the website. LSG minister M V Govindan Master recently told the assembly that manual uploading of data resulted in errors and that all was well with the software being managed by the Information Kerala mission. The dues from private institutions like schools and buildings and government run institutions like TRIDA comprise the major chunk of defaulters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/single-digit-dues-amuses-officials/articleshow/87634787.cms||---

At the Mumbai airport these days, an average of 660 domestic airline flights arrive and depart daily, which is what the airport handled pre-pandemic as well. Besides, the popular destinations to travel to and from Mumbai are also those of the pre-pandemic days. The ongoing ‘airline winter schedule’ of domestic flights, planned up to March 26 next year, is a significant jump from 2020 winter schedule with an average of 435 daily flight movements, said a Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) spokesperson. “But more interestingly, the 2021 average of 660 has surpassed the pre-Covid 2019 average of 657,” said MIAL. Airports Authority of India (AAI) data shows that the Mumbai airport handled an average of 661 domestic flights per day in November 2019 and 658 flights per day in December 2019, which is about the same number of flights that will be operated in these winter months. “Destinations such as Delhi, Goa, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Chennai have been on the top in terms of the highest flight frequency during the 2020 and 2019 winter schedule,” said MIAL. The number of flights in the 2021 winter schedule represents a 35 % jump in flights as compared to this year’s summer schedule, which ran from April to November. For the current schedule, IndiGo led the list with 240 weekly operations, followed by SpiceJet with 120 and Go First with 90, said MIAL. “The 2021 winter numbers are expected to be close to the pre-covid number for IndiGo, SpiceJet (20,400) and Go First (13,200) in terms of the average daily passengers catered to in 2019,” said MIAL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-avg-domestic-air-traffic-crosses-19-pre-pandemic-level/articleshow/87636087.cms||---
---||Madurai||118 arrested in TNPSC group exam scam, CB-CID tells Madras HC||MADURAI: The CB-CID on Wednesday informed the Madras high court that 118 people have been arrested in connection with the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) Group IV exam scam in 2019 where candidates who appeared from exam centres in Ramanathapuram district were involved in malpractices by using vanishing ink. A division bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan was hearing a public interest litigation filed by I Mohamed Razvi in 2020, seeking CBI probe into the scam. In the status report, CB-CID stated that the TNPSC officials had suspicion about malpractices by candidates who appeared from centres at Rameswaram and Keelakarai taluks in Ramanathapuram district. Based on their complaint, the CB-CID had registered a case. The offence was committed by few private individuals in connivance with two TNPSC staff - a record clerk and a typist. The accused with dishonest intention enticed 99 candidates with the promise of securing jobs and collected money for the same. After a comprehensive investigation, the CB-CID brought out the modus operandi of the accused. The main accused had given special pens with vanishing ink to the candidates to fill up the OMR sheets. The objective of using the special pen is that the answers marked with this pen would vanish in two to three hours enabling the accused and his team to fill up the answers later. This scheme was devised as TNPSC in 2019 brought in a system where the supervisors would attest the total number of questions answered in the answer sheets. The malpractice took place when the papers were on transit from Ramanathapuram to Chennai in a van under the supervision of two TNPSC staff and a policeman. Based on instructions given by the main accused, the van was stopped at Melur in Madurai district for dinner. The record clerk then broke open the seal secretly, took the answer sheets of candidates and handed them over to the main accused who along with his team filled up the correct answers. After the work was done, the answer sheets were placed along with the remaining sheets. A total of 118 people, including 98 candidates (one candidate died), two TNPSC staff, driver of the van and the main accused in his team were arrested.Since, there was negligence on part of the TNPSC officials who are supposed to check the seals of the answer sheet covers, disciplinary action was recommended. Incriminating materials such as OMR sheets, mobile phones and laptops were sent for forensic analysis. The investigation is progressing fast and once the lab report is ready, CB-CID would file the final report before the concerned court. The CB-CID further submitted that based on the additional facts emerged during the investigation, malpractices in VAO exam conducted in 2016 and Group II-A exam conducted in 2017 came to light and separate cases have been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/118-arrested-in-tnpsc-group-exam-scam-cb-cid-tells-hc/articleshow/87635534.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Senior officials in Vaigai dam said that in addition to 500 cusecs that was released for irrigation in the Periyar ayacut area and 69 cusecs for drinking water schemes in Theni and Madurai districts, an additional 1,000 cusecs was discharged from Vaigai dam from 10pm on Tuesday. The surplus water was discharged when the third flood warning was issued as water level reached 69 feet against the full reservoir capacity of 71 feet. On Wednesday morning, water level in the dam reached 69.26 feet with storage of 5,639 MCFT. “By Wednesday morning surplus discharge was increased to 3,000 cusecs, taking the total discharge from the dam to 3,569 cusecs,” said a dam official. This was maintained till Wednesday evening by matching the inflow with the outflow. PWD officials said that the surplus water of 3,000 cusecs has reached Peranai bordering Dindigul district – that is 33km from Vaigai dam – around 5.30pm on Wednesday. The flow in the river was 4,500 cusecs late on Wednesday evening after combining the inflow to the river downstream. With 500 cusecs that will be added from thereon it expected to reach Kamarajar Bridge in the city – 37km from Peranai and 70km from Vaigai dam – early on Thursday morning and cross the 10km stretch through the city till Viraganur in a couple of hours. The surplus flow will be diverted and utilised by the Sivaganga and Paramakudi divisions. Inflow to Vaigai dam is expected to reduce as it was only drizzling in the catchment areas. In Mullaperiyar dam, the water level marginally climbed to 138.7 feet on Wednesday from 138.65 feet on Tuesday. Inflow to the reservoir dropped to 1,994 cusecs against the outflow of 1,867 cusecs. While rains continued to lash the northern and central parts of the state as a result of the depression forming in the Bay of Bengal, the southern region continued to miss for the third day in a row. Only intermittent mild showers and drizzles were witnessed in a major part of the southern region. While the sky was overcast it was even sunny in places like Tirunelveli. The average rainfall recorded in the 10 southern districts from 8am on Tuesday to 8am on Wednesday was - Madurai (5.22mm), Theni (6.14mm), Dindigul(6.13mm), Sivaganga (16.29mm), Virudhunagar (2.08mm), Ramanathapuram (11.94mm), Tuticorin (2.03mm), Tirunelveli (0.68mm), Tenkasi (2.6mm) and Kanyakumari (6.65mm).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nearly-5000-cusecs-surplus-water-in-vaigai-river-to-reach-city-today/articleshow/87635550.cms||---

The accused threatened that they had let her off before, but won't be spared the next time. “Agli bar tere andar itni goli hongi, dekhte hai tereko kaun bachata hai, abb marne ke liye tayyar hoja (next time there will be so many bullets inside you that no one would be able to save you, be ready to die),” it said. Koli was shaken after the incident and was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. District collector Himanshu Gupta who met the MP on Wednesday said that her condition was fine. The incident comes barely five months after Koli faced a similar attack in the district in May when unidentified miscreants pelted her car with stones. Earlier in August, Koli had complained about receiving a threat call. District SP Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said that prima facie the police have not recovered any empty shells to indicate the firing yet, but an intensive probe was underway. District superintendent of police Devendra Kumar Bishnoi said that prima facie the police have not recovered any empty shells to indicate the firing yet, but an intensive probe was underway. The incident took place shortly after 12am on Wednesday when unidentified persons allegedly fired at her house in Bayana town of the district. The accused also pasted a poster with a large photo of Koli, crossed by a blue marker with two cartridges affixed on either side. They also pinned a letter on the poster which warned of dire consequences in the future. Bishnoi said cartridges were recovered from the poster and an FSL examination would be conducted. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot also spoke to Koli over the phone on Wednesday. “The DGP, principal secretary, home department, has been directed to take strict action after (a) thorough investigation of the incident. To investigate the incident, a team of SOG from Jaipur will go to Bharatpur and investigate the case,” he tweeted. The SIT will be led by SP (SOG) Manish Tripathi and includes additional SP (Bharatpur) Vandita Rana, circle officer (Bayana) Ajay Sharma, additional SP Gumana Ram, police inspectors Mohan Lal Poswal and Pooran Singh. Sources informed TOI that Koli had been persistently raising the issue of illegal mining in the region for the past several months. “SIT officials have arrived at the spot to investigate the matter. A probe will indicate who put up the poster and if indeed the firing took place,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/miscreants-shoot-at-bjp-mp-in-bharatpur-sit-to-probe-case/articleshow/87635548.cms||---

The MP reportedly stated that betel nuts can be allowed to be used for other purposes such as religious ceremonies. Campco president A Kishore Kumar Kodgi and managing director H M Krishna Kumar, along with the board of directors, condemned the statement issued by the MP, and will appeal to the Prime Minister of the need for a thorough scientific research on the health benefits of arecanut, and thus maintain the morale of farmers. They said that the MP’s statements were not only misleading, but that they have also hurt the sentiments of arecanut farmers of the region, adding scientists from IISc, Bengaluru in 1974 have reported that arecanut cures cancer. The Supreme Court too has ruled that arecanut is food within the meaning of Section 2 (v) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, Campco maintained. Shampoo from arecanut Entrepreneur and researcher Nivedan Nempe, who has developed several areca byproducts, said the government must support development of alternative use of arecanut. Arecanut has several medicinal properties that can be put to best use, he said. “We are all set to launch shampoo prepared from arecanut.

They feel that the government and residents should take adequate measures to stop spitting in the public. “There are two sections of people — some spit on the road without knowing that it may cause infection while others believe gulping one’s own saliva is injurious to health. And then there are people who do not object to people spitting even if they feel disturbed,” said Odette Katrak, co-founder of the NGO, Beautiful Bengaluru and Beautiful Bharat, who has been leading the #StopIndiaSpitting campaign. Odette said that in Bengal they are going to approach the chief minister Mamata Banerjee as well as the KMC and Kolkata Police to facilitate the campaign and make spitting a punishable offence, especially with the elections approaching that can further amplify Covid 19 in the state like the last assembly election. On Wednesday, Odette launched the Kolkata chapter of the StopIndiaSpitting movement with an aim to work with municipalities and involve schools and NGOs to send out the message of the anti-spitting campaign to rural areas. “If you spit, please stop. If you don’t, request others to stop, that should be the motto,” said Shukla Chattopadhyay of Soroptimist International- South Kolkata, who joined Odette in the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stopindiaspitting-activists-plan-to-take-drive-to-schools/articleshow/87634790.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Now, farmers are alleging that some middlemen had obtained the general power of attorney (GPA) in the name of solar units.Seven farmers have gone to court against the agents and about 30 more are planning a fresh petition, alleging that their land was sold to the company, Aequs Pvt Ltd, without their notice.The senior division court of Yelburga has issued a stay order and told the company not to alienate the land till the suit is disposed of. It means that the company, Aequs Pvt Ltd, cannot conduct any commercial transaction involving the land.Santoshreddy Madinur, the advocate for the seven farmers, said that the court had issued the stay only for a portion of land.“We are representing seven farmers, of whom six are women, who have filed a partition suit. They had given a general power of attorney (GPA) with selling authority to some agents. After a cheating case was reported at Chamarajanagar district, the state government issued an order to the department of stamps and registration on January 30, 2018, instructing that a sale deed should not be done by GPA. As the GPA and sale deeds were in English, our clients could not understand them. Our clients are saying that it was a lease for nine years for a solar company on rental basis and one job assurance for each family,” Madinur said.He stated that agents had procured the land at the cost of Rs 8 lakh per acre just a year ago and now had sold it to the company at Rs 33 lakh per acre. “Certified copies of the sale deed of this land are still unavailable online,” he said.Aequs had purchased 225 acres in Talkal, Bhanapur and Talabal village limits and has started the construction.Shankrappa Chowdki, a farmer in Bhanapur, said that partition aspect was neglected in many land purchase cases. “As disputes are arising among families now, they are approaching the court of law,” he added.Andappa Kolur, president, Karnataka Rajya Rait Sangh, Koppal district, said that many farmers were planning an agitation over the injustice. The farmers will hold a meeting next week at Talkal.Former minister Basavaraj Rayareddy, who hails from Talkal village, said the company has to sit with farmers and resolve the issue amicably.A spokesperson from Aequs said that all the purchases were done as per the law. “We have verified the legality of all purchases and not violated any rule or law of the land,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/land-allotted-for-toy-cluster-in-koppal-mired-in-litigation/articleshow/87633909.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Fully vaccinated students are allowed inside colleges to attend classes since October 20. The drive was conducted under the state government’s campaign called Mission Youth Health. Joint director of the Pune division of the state directorate of higher education Kirankumar Bondar said, “After the Covid cases declined, the state government allowed offline classes for college students from October 20. However, the government guidelines stated that the only fully vaccinated students would be allowed to attend the classes. This was the primary reason for the launch of the vaccination campaign on college campuses.” The campaign began on October 25 and went on till November 2, just before Diwali vacations began. The data collected from three districts showed about 2.17 lakh students were eligible for the vaccine, of whom around 28,000 students had not taken even a single dose, Bondar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12k-students-in-pune-div-immunized-in-colleges/articleshow/87634785.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

In September, only 13 cases were reported. Health officials, however, said that the cases are expected to peak in November and December and preventive measures have been intensified. According to data from the district health department, 49 cases were recorded in October, while 26 cases were reported till November 10. “There is no drastic or abnormal increase in cases. The cases have also been largely sporadic. There have been no clusters and we have also been intensifying control and preventive measures in areas wherever dengue cases are being reported,” said a corporation health official. Out of the 75 dengue cases recorded in Madurai since October, a majority of 49 cases were reported in urban areas coming under the corporation limits. With intermittent rains being witnessed in the district over the past week, health officials are expecting the cases to peak. “Fogging is being done twice in a scheduled manner. A drive is also being done to put oil balls wherever water is stagnant due to rains. A mass cleaning drive is also being carried out. Fever surveillance is being actively monitored and fever camps are being held to prevent any clusters,” said the official. More than 1000 DBCs across Madurai district are engaged in day-to-day dengue preventive activities, including anti-larval work, removing sources of mosquito-breeding in residential areas, spraying of abate solution and bleach etc. Those with symptoms of dengue, which include high fever, headache, rashes, muscle and joint pain etc., must immediately consult a doctor. “There is no cause for alarm but it is urged for the public to cooperate in cleaning and removing any source of mosquito-breeding in and around their residences and offices.

Colleges have now reopened for students with 50% attendance and online classes are also being conducted. Authorities at Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) said that there is no official communication yet from the higher education department on whether the semester exams have to be conducted online or offline. As of now, all colleges in Madurai are holding offline classes for students on rotational basis and hence it is expected for the semester exams to also be conducted offline unlike the previous semester when the exams were conducted in online mode. However, some of the autonomous colleges affiliated to MKU have already decided to hold the semester exams only offline. “Having offline exams will help students get back to normalcy. So far, offline classes have gone smoothly and there has been no issue. While senior students have offline classes currently, first year students have only online classes. But, we will be having offline semester exams for all,” said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. The college is set to start semester exams by November 15. Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, said that the college has planned to hold the semester exams as offline exams as well. “ We already held first internal exams as offline exams and are now holding the second internal exams offline too. We will definitely hold the semester exams too in a similar manner,” he added. Meanwhile, at Lady Doak College, students are having a continuous assessment system with online submissions being made.  “Due to the pandemic, this system is being followed. Instead of having semester exams, there are five rounds of assessments which are continuous so students have accountability to study,” said Dr Christianna Singh, principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/colleges-considering-holding-semester-exams-offline/articleshow/87635555.cms||---
---||India||Techie held for rape threats to cricketer’s baby||MUMBAI: An IT engineer from Hyderabad has been arrested for posting rape threats to the nine-month-old daughter of an Indian cricket star on Twitter after India lost their first match to arch rival Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on October 24. Ramnagesh Akubathini (23), a native of Ranga Reddy in Hyderabad region who quit his job as a software programmer to pursue a PhD, had continuously altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down. Akubathani was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under Indian Penal Code sections 354(A) (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation) and under Information Technology Act sections 67, 67(B) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in the sexually explicit act, in electronic form). He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathani trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-month-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Subsequently, he faced a barrage of online abuse. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profile to make such threats. The cyber team is well equipped to track them,” said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Rashmi Karandikar. The Delhi Commission for Women has also taken suo motu note of the tweet on the basis of media reports and asked New Delhi police to register an FIR and arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/techie-held-for-rape-threats-to-cricketers-baby/articleshow/87636645.cms||V Narayan

---||Ahmedabad||State govt to hold 3-day atmanirbhar gram yatra||Gandhinagar: Before the expected announcement of state-wide village panchayat elections schedule, the Gujarat government has announced a three-day long ‘atmanirbhar gram yatra’ from November 18 to 20. This appears to be an attempt’ by the ruling BJP to reach out to rural masses before the schedule of the village panchayat elections is announced. The state election commission (SEC) is likely to announce the model code of conduct for the panchayat elections after the three-day long village outreach programme of the state government. Around 11,000 village panchayats from a total 14,400 village panchayats will go to elections. This will be a mini assembly election covering all the district and assembly seats in Gujarat. A total of about 93,000 panchayats members and around 11,000 sarpanchs of villages will be selected through this election. About 10 lakh candidates are expected to contest the village panchayat polls. Although the village panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols, both the BJP and Congress are putting all their might to take control of rural local bodies before next year’s assembly election. Jitu Vaghani, state education minister and the state government spokesperson said, “The state government will organise ‘atmanirbhar gram yatra’ in villages to inaugurate village-level public works. Over 23,000 works of nine departments worth around Rs 500 crore will be dedicated during this period. Ministers and government officers will take part in the yatra.” Amit Chavda, state Congress president, said, “BJP has announced the yatra in rural areas just before the election code of conduct announcement for village panchayat elections. We urge the SEC to stop the BJP from organising this yatra as it is attempting to influence voters and is misusing state government machinery.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-to-hold-3-day-atmanirbhar-gram-yatra/articleshow/87634806.cms||---
---||Goa||‘After plant upgrade, panchayats that don’t segregate will be fined’||Panaji: The work of expanding the 100-tonne Saligao waste treatment plant to a capacity of 250 tonnes is nearing completion, and trial runs on the Rs 103 crore facility will begin next month. Once the plant is fully operational from early next year, panchayats and municipalities in North Goa who do not segregate waste and bring it to the plant — and are seen having waste dumped in their jurisdictions — will be fined up to Rs 2 lakh, waste management minister Michael Lobo said on Wednesday. He said that the Goa state pollution control board will be asked to strictly monitor and fine the non-compliant panchayats. Lobo said that once the new facility, along with the South Goa plant, is operational, Goa will be able to move in the direction of banning littering. The plant has used improvised technology and its tipping floor will be underground, which will ensure there is zero stench coming from the facility, said Lobo. “The facility now has two conveyor belts, one for dry waste and the second for wet waste. It means if panchayats send us segregated waste, it can go directly for treatment,” he said. “The plant now also has an effluent treatment plant within the same complex, where the effluents can be treated without being sent outside for treatment. The plant has been completed in record time, with the work having been completed within one year and three months, despite the Covid pandemic and shortage of labour,” said Lobo. Lobo said that panchayats that have good revenue earnings but are using garbage trucks without a leachate tank will also be fined soon, while panchayats with poor income will be assisted through Nabard by the government to replace garbage trucks with those with leachate tanks. The minister said that the Saligao waste treatment plant will also refuse to accept waste brought by trucks without an attached leachate tank. He said that the measures will ensure that Goa becomes a state free of garbage dumping by the road sides, which will be a boost to the tourism industry. Lobo said that his ministry is also working out a subsidy for hospitals to encourage them further to turn in their biomedical waste for treatment. “Goa will soon become a state compliant in all respects as a construction waste and debris plant is coming up in Bicholim. An e-waste treatment plant is also coming up,” said Lobo. Sandip Prabhu Chodnekar of the Goa Infrastructure Development Corporation said that the plant has not copied any other model, and has been made by adopting technology that is suitable to the local environment, in consultation with experts from IIT, BITS-Pilani and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. “At present, we are getting 180 tonnes of waste at the Saligao plant daily, and we are working in three shifts to process the waste. Once the 250-tonne capacity plant is operational, we will complete processing the waste in one and a half shift,” said Lobo. ------------------------||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-plant-upgrade-panchayats-that-dont-segregate-will-be-fined/articleshow/87636096.cms||---

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Prices of tomato, other vegetables hit the roof as rain affects supply||MADURAI/TRICHY: Tomato prices in Madurai hit Rs 60-70/kg in wholesale and Rs 100/kg in retail on Wednesday after rain impacted supply. Vegetable traders said that the prices of other vegetables, including brinjal, beans, tubers, etc., have also gone up marginally by around Rs 20/kg. In Trichy, the price of tomatoes touched Rs 100/kg. The ongoing wedding season is also one of the reasons for the price hike of vegetables, vendors from Gandhi market said. Normally Gandhi market receives around 20 to 30 trucks of tomatoes on a daily basis from Andhra Pradesh, Bengaluru, Theni and Oddanchathram. However, rain for the last few days has affected regular supply leading to the price rise, C Prakash, a wholesale trader from Gandhi Market, said. P S Murugan, president, Madurai Central Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, said that the supply of vegetables, especially tomatoes, was affected after rain damaged crops. “The price of tomato has gone up to Rs 100/kg a couple of days ago but now has come down a little to around Rs 60-70/kg,” he said. He also added that other vegetables like brinjal and small bitter gourds were selling for up to more than Rs 100/kg. S Manual Jayaraj, president, Madurai Central Market Vegetable and Perishable Commodities Merchants Coordinated Association, Paravai, also said that supply of tomatoes have declined due to damage caused by rain. “Only the second quality tomatoes are selling for a low price. The price of tubers has also risen to around Rs 35-45/kg due to poor supply,” he added. “Tomato prices have gone up from Rs 40/kg last week to more than Rs 80/kg this week. Prices of most vegetables have increased by around Rs 20-30/kg,” said Ammaiyappan, a retail vegetable trader. Farmers from Manapparai, Vaiyampatty in the Trichy district cultivate tomatoes on around 1,000 acres of land. However, during the rainy season, they opt to raise paddy. Only after the harvest, they cultivate tomatoes and green chillies during the month of January, P Saravanan, a tomato farmer from Vaiyampatti in the district, said. “During the rainy season, it is normal that there would be a dip in yield as the flowers shed. So, it automatically led to poor arrival of vegetables to the market,” M Thangamani, a wholesale vendor from Gandhi market, said. Farmers from Manapparai, Vaiyampatti raise tomatoes and other country vegetables such as brinjal, ladies finger, snake gourd and broad beans. Due to rain, there was a shortage of these country vegetables also, Thangamani added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/prices-of-tomato-other-vegetables-hit-the-roof-as-rain-affects-supply/articleshow/87639258.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||North winds make temperature drop by 3.9 degrees in Pune||PUNE: Cool weather greeted citizens in the early morning hours of Wednesday when the minimum temperature fell 3.9 degrees below the normal in Shivajinagar. The mercury dipped to 11.8° Celsius. Most locations in Maharashtra recorded below normal minimum temperatures on Wednesday, the lowest minimum being 11°C in Jalgaon. Temperature-wise, Pune was cooler than many places in North India where winter is beginning to set in. It was lower than in Delhi (13.4°C) Amritsar (12.4°C), Chandigarh (11.9°C), Dharamsala (12.2°C), Jammu city (12.6°C), Dehradun (12.2°C). Wednesday was the coldest morning of the season so far in Pune. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Shivajinagar had dropped to 12.7°C. Other locations in Pune recorded higher minimums in comparison to Shivajinagar on Wednesday. Pashan recorded 12.6°C, Lohegaon 14.2°C, Chinchwad 17.6°C, Lavale 16.2°C and Magarpatta 18.8°C. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune told TOI, “The northerly component of winds which originate from North India has been reaching North Madhya Maharashtra and its neighbourhood. This is known as cold air advection, a common phenomenon during the November to January period. This is accompanied by a drop in temperatures. The winds are northerly up to the central Indian region, becoming northeasterly over areas of central India and entering as easterlies over North Maharashtra. Some stations in central India are recording minimum temperatures below 10°C and thus, winds coming from those regions to North Madhya Maharashtra are naturally colder and drier.” Kashyapi said that the cool spell may be short-lived in the city because from November 13 morning, a gradual rise in humidity levels in Pune would be experienced due to moisture incursion. “This will cause a rising tendency in the minimum temperature for a couple of days. Chances of clouding/very light to light rain for a few days during that period cannot be ruled out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/north-winds-make-temp-drop-by-3-9-degrees-in-city/articleshow/87634807.cms||Neha Madaan

It has been found that there are some locations where the accidents are more frequent. These locations are called black spots. Different measures are being taken jointly by the police, the civic body, the state PWD and the NHAI, to cut the rate of accidents at these black spots. Senior officials said any site with five or more fatal or grievous injury accidents within 100m on either side over a period of three years is considered a black spot. ACP (traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad said there are at least 14 black-spots in the city. Various works are being taken up to prevent road accidents at these spots. The identified black spots include Chehedigaon Phata in Nashik Road, Datta Mandir signal in Nashik Road, Shinde village, Fame signal, Tarwala Nagar signal, Nandurnaka signal, CBS signal, Mirchi hotel signal in Adgaon, Rau hotel junction under Mhasrool police station, Sharanpur Road signal, Old Gangapur Naka signal, Dwarka circle, and Siddhivinayak junction in Adgaon. Almost all these black spots are either junctions or have sharp road curves that lead to accidents. Rash driving at these places is also a bog reason for the accidents, said ACP Gaikwad. Officials said after the construction of the flyover from KK Wagh to Jatra hotel, the three black spots on the Mumbai-Agra highway — Swaminarayan junction, the stretch opposite KK Wagh College and the Bali Mandir junction — are no longer black spots. Various works like putting up signboards, speed breakers, blinkers etc. have been completed at the spots concerned.

The task force members, during a recent meeting, observed that all intensive care units (ICUs) treating Covid patients were potential fire hazards because of the air conditioners, oxygen supply units and flammable sanitizer at the facilities. The task force has in its recommendations told all hospitals to identify the causes leading to fires caused by oxygen and take lessons from the past experiences to improve the prevention and preparedness.  State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “The mix of oxygen, electrical points and equipment in air-conditioned settings creates an environment conducive to fire. Mandatory mock drills and training are needed at all sites. We need to ensure that fire safety audits are a must at the facilities. There should be zero tolerance for the violators.”  State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that these recommendations (see graphic)would be presented in detail at a meeting under the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-recommends-fire-safety-steps-in-icus/articleshow/87634810.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Contempt against top officials over Gandhi museum at Central Park||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court on Wednesday issued contempt notice to chief secretary Niranjan Arya, urban development and housing principal secretary Kunji Lal Meena and Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) commissioner Gaurav Goyal over the planned Mahatma Gandhi museum project inside the Central Park. The Central Park Sangharsh Samiti had alleged that the project was being done in violation of court orders. The samiti objected to institutional and other uses of these properties for building the Mahatma Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences on the land of Hotel Laxmi Vilas and Kanak Bhawan in Central Park. Following this, legal notices were sent to officials by samiti president, Yogesh Yadav. Vimal Chaudhary, the counsel for sangharsh samiti, said, “Three weeks have been given by the court to file a reply. We argued that institutional and other uses of park land for Mahatma Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences were in violation of court orders.” In May 2017, the Rajasthan high court had ordered the state government to take possession of the hotel and Kanak Bhawan land and said that it should only be used for park or garden and not for anything else, the petitioner said. This order was given after hearing a petition filed by Sanjay Tyagi. Following the same order, the JDA took possession of the hotel and building land. The government also recently laid the foundation stone to construct the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences, conceived on the lines of Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) and School of Sciences of Governance here. “The sanctity of the park has already been tampered with by the JDA as the influential golf course administration is continuing to carry out construction in the ‘no construction zone’ after cutting trees. The officials are not taking action. The new project will create more disturbance in the park,” Yadav said. For the structural construction of Gandhi museum at Central Park, the JDA had appointed a Jaipur-based firm which is expected to complete the work within nine months, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/contempt-against-top-officials-over-gandhi-museum-at-central-park/articleshow/87635594.cms||---

The data since Diwali shows the AQI for most days has remained above 200, which falls under poor category with possible health impacts as breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.As per the Central Pollution Control Board report, Ludhiana had AQI of 306 on Tuesday evening. It comes under very poor category with possible health impacts as respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Before this, the highest AQI (345) was on November 15 last year. Since the day till October 31 this year, AQI was more than 200 eight times.The data of the ongoing month shows that AQI was 249 on November 1; 166 on November 3; 292 on November 5 (a day after Diwali); and 163 the next day.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials said high pollution levels are because of stubble burning and left-over pollution of Diwali crackers.“Stubble burning picked up recently. Besides, the pollutants that went in air due to bursting of crackers on Diwali have not dissipated, so those have got accumulated in the city’s sky resulting in rise in pollution. The AQI will drop if winds blow or it rains in Ludhiana,” they added.Green activists said required steps need to be taken.“Stubble burning is a policy failure of the government. It is easy to blame farmers, though the government has not given them alternatives. Stubble is a source of energy. It can be used to generate energy as we are facing its shortage. Long-term planning is needed to harness this type of energy. During festivals, use of polluting crackers should be avoided,” said Jaskirat Singh, an activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-breathes-years-poorest-air/articleshow/87633968.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Kolkata||Survey starts for city’s tallest skywalk at Ruby||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has started the process of building the tallest skywalk in the city at the Ruby crossing. On Tuesday, engineers and experts carried out a detailed survey for the proposed 240m-long steel structure that will ensure seamless pedestrian movement in every direction and will also have a link with Hemanta Mukherjee Metro station. State’s urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said: “The project aims at seamless pedestrian movement and easier access to the Metro station. Our officers have started their work, keeping the Metro structure in mind.” It will be the first circular skywalk in the city and the construction cost has been pegged at Rs 50 crore. The skywalk will run 8m above the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor. Once the station becomes operational, the pedestrian load at the crossing is likely to increase manifold. “The circular shape of the skywalk will give it an aesthetic look. The shape of the crossing is such that we need to build a circular skywalk to connect all corners. There will be escalators and elevators to attract people for a hassle-free use of the skywalk,” said a KMDA engineer. The project has already received a go-ahead from the finance department. KMDA and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) have already conducted a joint inspection to have a look at two underground water lines — of 800mm and 1,100mm diameter – that run through a portion of the crossing from where some of the piers of the skywalk are supposed to rise. The water lines come out of the Dhapa water treatment plant and run under EM Bypass to supply potable water to areas further south and off the Bypass. Trial pits will be dug at multiple locations between Calcutta International School and Metro Cash & Carry to have a thorough understanding of the alignment of the water pipes. KMC has prepared a cost estimate to shift the water lines and will hand it over to the KMDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/survey-starts-for-citys-tallest-skywalk-at-ruby/articleshow/87634820.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

He has been called on Friday again. Sajnani told the media outside the NCB office that he has been falsely arrested as the so-called contraband found in his possession was herbal tobacco. Sajnani also said that he has written letters to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson about the ‘false’ allegations made against him. After the questioning session, Sajnani told the media that the SIT is doing a fair job and they asked him only relevant questions pertaining to the case. He said the SIT were keen on understanding the nature of the products seized, how the herbal products were marketed and where the packaging material came from. The SIT asked Sajnani whether Samir Khan is a part of his business, which he denied. Sajnani told the SIT that Khan has been his friend for 25 years. On January 9, the NCB had raided Sajnani’s Khar house, seized drugs and arrested him, Rahila Furniturewala and her sister Shaista.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt has lukewarm approach towards climate change: Oppn||Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition charged that the intergovernmental panel report on climatic changes that warned of serious impact on Kerala is being ignored by the state government, and it is still going ahead with projects like the semi high-speed rail project that will have serious impact on the ecology. Seeking a leave for adjournment motion regarding the alarming situation that can arise due to climate change, a first on the subject in the assembly’s history, MLA PC Vishnunath said that the IPCC report made serious observations about the state. Of the 12 cities that could be engulfed by water across the world, one is Kochi. Also, there have been repeated natural disasters across the state since 2018, including Ockhi, floods, cloud bursts, landslides, cyclonic circulation, etc. “Despite these, the state could not finalise the action plan on climate change and submit it to the Centre, the draft of which was prepared in 2018 itself,” he said. He also said that the centre for climatic studies in Kottayam has a sanctioned strength for 12 scientists, but none has been appointed. Government is also sitting over the inter-disciplinary committee report prepared after the floods that hit the state. All these show the state’s lukewarm approach on this matter, he said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who agreed that the matter is serious and should be discussed on a broader canvas and not on a short notice, said that the government is doing all possible steps to address the issues. He said that the government is thinking of appointing a nodal agency for making the state carbon-neutral. He said that the government is also considering conducting an international conclave on the subject with experts from all over the world, in the capital. The government believes in balancing developmental activities with environmental conservation. He also listed out government’s several initiatives, including the Rebuild Kerala Initiative, the paddy-land and wetland act, electric vehicles policy, waste-to-energy programme, among others as some of the government’s steps with an eye on environment conservation. Opposition leader VD Satheesan, however, said that the government is still lagging far behind in taking concrete steps to address the serious issues that are cited in the IPCC report. He said that there are families residing in relief camps for as long as six years, and the government is yet to rehabilitate them. “The state has become a place which is susceptible to drastic climatic changes since 2015. It is yet to learn and take the necessary steps despite thousands of landslides have been reported from Western Ghats. Even after the 2018 floods, the government sanctioned more than 200 quarries in the state,” he said. At the same time, the government is going ahead with projects like the SilverLine project, that will divide the state vertically with a 30-feet high embankment. The government has not even conducted an environmental impact study for the project, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-has-lukewarm-approach-towards-climate-change-oppn/articleshow/87634849.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In many areas like Beliaghata, Kankurgachi, Bangur, Sreebhumi, Topsia South, Tangra, Kasba, VIP Bazar, Garia, Jorasanko, Jorabagan, Girish Park, Entally, SN Banerjee Road and others, loudhailers blare from morning till midnight, creating nuisance for common citizens. Times ViewWe need to fix this problem urgently. Very few neighbourhoods are immune from this form of harassment. Terrified citizens are often afraid to speak up or against this organised bullying. The only solution is suo motu action by government agencies.In many neighbourhoods, the playing of loudhailers started from Ganesh Puja followed by Biswakarma Puja, Durga Puja, Fateh Dohaz Doham, Luxmi Puja, Diwali and now Chhath Puja. Several school board exams will commence from third week of November. College students are preparing for various internal examinations. Teachers and principals have said they are unable to conduct online classes due to the blaring of the loudhailers. “In my area, the blaring of loudspeakers started a few days before Kali Puja and is continuing till now. It is causing immense inconvenience to all of us. I am facing difficulty in studying,” said Rohini Dutta, a student of St Xavier’s College and resident of Kasba area.

The paddy field was flooded twice, but the team was not willing to give in to natural calamities. “We cultivate paddy twice a year. This year, the field was flooded and fortunately the crops were not damaged. We have started the work for the next season which will start in 20 days,” said Sasidharan Nair, president of padasekhara samithy. The five hectares of land was cultivated with ‘Uma’, a high yielding paddy variety. The paddy cultivation in the municipality started in the year 2017. For this purpose, a farmers’ association was formed. The association includes 22 agriculturalists from the region. The land that has been barren for 18 years was converted into paddy fields by the farmers with the help of machineries. The municipality has decided to provide the rice to the civil supplies corporation after giving it to the locals. The rice will be sold at an amount of Rs 28 per kg. After 120 days of nurturing, the crop was harvested with the help of modern machineries. “We have been cultivating paddy for the last four years and we have seen a regular increase in the yield every year,” said Prabha B L, the agricultural officer of Attingal. As part of the ‘subhiksha Keralam’ project, the Attingal municipality and the padashekara samithy have started paddy cultivation in its barren lands. The municipality is in the process of converting more barren lands into agricultural lands. The harvesting was done under the guidance of municipality vice chairman G Thulaseedharan Pillai, ward councillor Sangeetharani, members from padasekhara samithy, including Girijan, Narayana Pillai, Balan Pillai, Prabhakaran, Ramachandran Nair, Sreerangan, Sreekumar, Raghunathan, Murukan and Sasidharan Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/barren-land-now-yields-25000kg-paddy/articleshow/87634837.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||City bizmen seek alms for PM, Centre||Ludhiana: In a unique protest held in the city on Wednesday, industrialists begged for alms from the general public on Gill Road near the office of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers’ Association (UCPMA). The industrialists with steel bowls in their hands stopped commuters and requested for alms so that they could send these to the Centre and the Prime Minister for combating inflation. It was part of an ongoing chain of protests by businessmen against the sharp rise in the rates of steel raw material due to which their cost of production has skyrocketed.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), said, “Wednesday was the ninth day of our protest against the Central government and the BJP leaders. Dozens of businessmen joined us from different sectors to beg for alms to be sent to the Centre to help it combat inflation and take action against steel manufacturing plants and companies so that they lower the rates. We got great response from the residents as everyone who stopped over praised us for the peaceful protest and also expressed support in this cause.”Garment and textile sector businessmen also joined the protest, which till now was mainly being led by the representatives of the bicycle industry. Vinod Thapar, chairman of the Knitwear Club, said, “Manufacturers across all industry segments, including bicycle, sewing machine, auto parts, garment and textile, are bearing the brunt of the Centre turning a blind eye to the problem of rise in the rates of raw material of all kinds. We are fed up of contacting the Union ministers and departments again and again. Therefore, we were forced to hit the roads and beg because the day is not far when factories will be shut down because of the government's apathy. Our protest will not stop till the rates of raw materials are reduced and the government forms a regulator for monitoring and controlling prices.”According to Charanjiv Singh, another garment and textile sector industrialist, “Rates of yarn, chemicals and dyes have increased by high proportions and as a result our cost of production has risen to such levels that we will not be able to break-even at the existing selling prices. Because of this, businesses of most of the micro, small and medium-scale textile and garment units have come to a standstill. If the Centre wants the businesses to function smoothly, it should take some steps to lower raw material rates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-bizmen-seek-alms-for-pm-centre/articleshow/87633985.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh among top 4 states with higher petrol costs per litre||HYDERABAD: The Centre may have decreased petrol prices, but the twin Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana still stand third and fourth in the country with higher costs per litre because of existing VAT. There are several other states in the country where price of petrol is still higher than Rs 105. Despite state and central government price cuts, Rajasthan has the highest per litre fuel price in the country at Rs 111.10. The desert state is followed by Maharashtra (Rs 109.98), Andhra Pradesh (Rs 109.05), and Telangana (Rs 108.20). Apart from these states, the price of petrol in Madhya Pradesh (Rs 107.23), Kerala (Rs 106.36), Bihar (Rs 105.90), and Punjab (Rs 105.02) are higher than Rs 105 per litre. After the Centre dropped prices, all states and union territories, regardless of their cuts, saw a decrease in price ranging from Rs 6 to Rs 17. Petrol rates in Telangana reduced by Rs 6.29 and in Andhra Pradesh by Rs 6.10. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala have not reduced their state VAT on petrol prices. The Petrol Pump Owners Association believes that the Telangana government should proceed with caution, at least in terms of diesel costs, by lowering VAT. “In the case of diesel, there is a price difference of roughly Rs 8 between Karnataka (Rs 85.01) and Telangana. Many transport vehicles will go to border areas along roads and fill their tanks, resulting in significant sales losses. It is, therefore, preferable to decrease VAT in order to promote sales,” Consortium of Indian Petrol Dealers joint secretary Rajiv Amaram said. Mizoram had the largest cut of Rs 17. 62, with prices falling to Rs 94. 94 from Rs 107. 12. While all states saw price cuts ranging from Rs 11 to Rs 17 after the Centre decreased rates (some states reduced VAT while others did not), Andhra Pradesh has second-highest diesel cost at Rs 95. 18 and Telangana third with a price of Rs 94. 62 per litre diesel. Rajasthan again has the highest diesel price, at Rs 95.71. Maharashtra, Odisha, Kerala, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Sikkim, Bihar and MP have diesel price per litre still above Rs 90.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-among-top-4-states-with-higher-petrol-costs-per-litre/articleshow/87634842.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Shubhmangal foundation had gifted a gold written Bhagwat Gita to a Hindu foundation along with a Sikshapatri to Vadtal Swaminarayan trust. In return, the trust had gifted the gold written kalpsutra to Shubhmangal foundation, he explained. Along with this, handwritten kapsutra on seashell by an Odiya artist, wood print of Saraswati devi by Rajasthani artist, idol of lord Parshwanath made from a single wood trunk, an ivory Bhandar, Astlakshmi made from shreeparn wood and many more are kept on display, he said.

I appeal to you with folded hands not to conduct an agitation that holds the common man to ransom. For the last two years, we have been battling the pandemic...” The strike, however, continued for the 14th day across the state, with MSRTC incurring over Rs 80 crore losses in the past two weeks. On Wednesday, all 250 bus depots were completely shut and bus services across the state had come to a standstill. BJP leaders joined the protests with ST workers on Wednesday, taking part in protests. Former MP Kirit Somaiya and MLA Gopichand Padalkar and a few MSRTC staff were detained by police outside Mantralaya as they planned to participate in a satyagraha protest. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis flayed MVA ministers for not fulfilling demands of ST staff. Speaking to the media on his arrival at Nagpur airport, the former CM termed the the Thackeray-led government as “insensitive”. Parab, who is also MSRTC chairman, said: “I appeal to ST workers not to get provoked by political parties. Finally, the damage will be faced by workers as we have already suspended some protesters.... Political parties are capitalising on the strike but workers will have to face loss of pay for not coming to work. Will political parties take responsibility for salary lost... ST workers’ demand to be considered as government staff can’t be considered in a day or two.” Thackeray added : “I also appeal to political parties provoking poor ST workers for political gain, to not do so. It’s not the time for politics.” With no ST buses, 10 private buses were deployed at three Thane depots for Pune and Nashik. At Vashi, the police detained 68 ST staff who came from other districts to join a protest in Mumbai.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana has not imposed additional cess on petrol||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has declared a war on the Centre, stating that cess imposed by it on petrol and diesel contributes to high fuel prices. Data obtained by TOI on state taxes shows that 14 states, including Telangana, are not imposing any additional cess. However, the rest, including some Union territories, impose cess either as a percentage (per litre or kilolitre) or flat rate (in terms of rupees). Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh along with Telangana do not impose their own cess. Jharkhand, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh levy cess (as a per cent or in rupees), while certain states like West Bengal and Sikkim impose general cess per kilolitre. Some states levy cess for road development and maintenance like Andhra Pradesh (Rs 1), Nagaland, Tripura, Rajasthan and Tripura. However, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have unique cess and taxes. Delhi has no additional cess on petrol, but levies a specific air ambience fee of Rs 250 per kilolitre on diesel. Jammu & Kashmir imposes a Rs 5 per litre cess for employment, while Ladakh extracts Rs 5 per litre on petrol and Rs 1 per litre on diesel for employment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, Gujarat, levies a town rate cess of 4% per litre, while Meghalaya, like Delhi, levies a pollution fee of Rs 0.10 per litre. And, Goa is the only state that imposes a green cess of 0.5%. According to experts, cess collection does not fall under the purview of the common pool of taxes. “Cess must be imposed under certain conditions. However, any collection of cess will go directly to respective state government or the Centre, if it is imposed. As there is no sharing of cess between the Centre and the states, all governments are using this as a source of income,” Dr Krishna Reddy Chittedi, assistant professor, school of economics, University of Hyderabad, explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-not-imposed-additional-cess-on-petrol/articleshow/87634854.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Sacked vidya volunteers left in the cold by Telangana government||HYDERABAD: It is not just the private schools, but government too is hesitant to rehire teachers (vidya volunteers) whose contracts were terminated. There were 12,000 vidya volunteers (VV) in government schools before the pandemic, but now none. This despite the strength in government schools in the state having increased by over1.25 lakh this year. According to government teachers themselves, there is a need for at least 15,000 VVs in the state as many have retired. While the state has renewed contracts of teachers working on hourly basis and outsourced teachers in residential schools, it has shown no interest in renewing contracts of VVs, said N Ramesh, who used to teach Telugu as a VV at a government school in the city for four years. Ramesh now works as a painter on a daily wage of Rs 800. “We have submitted several representations to officials to renew our contracts. But no one has responded. It’s as if the government wants to see if the newly enrolled students will go back to private schools once conditions improve. The state is not making any efforts to retain them either,” Ramesh added. United Teachers’ Federation general secretary Chava Ravi, a government teacher, also echoed Ramesh’s fears. The state, he said, appeared to have no interest in rehiring VVs for this academic year. “In many schools, there are no subject teachers. The state is using services of primary/upper primary teachers in high schools as attendance percentage in lower classes is comparatively less,” said Ravi. Sources from the school education department, meanwhile, claimed that the state might think about VVs once regularisation was over as they would then know the exact requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sacked-vidya-volunteers-left-in-the-cold-by-state/articleshow/87634859.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Collector Suraj Mandhare said the sub-committee comprising five MLAs, collector and other officials, which will be headed by district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, was likely to meet in some time and decide upon the issue. “The committee will soon decide about the demands and decide upon the same,” said Mandhare. The sub-committee formed has been allotted the powers to decide upon the equitable distribution of funds to all talukas for their development. Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of the civil hospital, has requested for funds of Rs 7.5 crore, which are required to upgrade the firefighting systems in the civil hospital, the sub-district and rural hospitals in the district. The demand assumes significance in the backdrop of the fire that broke out in the ICU of the civil hospital in Ahmednagar claiming the lives of 12 people undergoing treatment there. The fire audit of the civil hospital was carried out by the authorities immediately after a mishap in Bhandara civil hospital, where the fire broke out in the sick and newborn care unit (SNCU) in January claiming 10 lives. The fire department has proposed a ‘dry riser’ for the civil hospital and the buildings of the other hospitals under the state health department across the district. ‘Riser’ is a network of pipes raised so that that there is a vent at every floor of the building and has a hose attached to the same. In the event of a fire, water can be pumped through the pipes and using the hose, it can be aimed at the base of the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-likely-to-allot-funds-for-fire-equipment/articleshow/87765378.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused Narendrakumar Pal had applied for bail on October 30 on the grounds that his name is nowhere mentioned in the FIR. Pal further claimed that he had contacted the other accused to legally adopt the baby and not to purchase the baby boy. Opposing Pal’s bail plea, police submitted an affidavit in the court. Police argued that Pal and other accused had planned the conspiracy to abduct a child and later sell it to him as he and his wife were childless. “The infant had to suffer because of the greed of a child of the childless couple and greed of money of other co-accused. It was also argued that the accused had a direct role in the crime and he may jump the bail and hamper the investigation,” said additional public prosecutor C G Patel. The court of additional sessions judge A J Kanani upheld the arguments and denied bail to Pal. Pal had purchased a six-day old baby boy for Rs 4 lakh from Kalpesh Rathod, a man living in Kalol. Rathod had asked other accused in Vadodara city and Waghodiya to find a child for Pal. One of the accused named Kalidas alias Kaliyo had abducted the infant on October 20 and handed it over to Rathod, who sold it off to Pal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/army-man-accused-of-purchasing-infant-denied-bail/articleshow/87633907.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Primary teachers struggleas schools deny work, pay||Hyderabad: Even post-Dasara vacation, the attendance percentage of students from primary to high school has not increased as most parents were not willing to take the risk. Consequently, many teachers, especially from kindergarten to class 3, were still out of work as managements have not asked them to resume duties. “Of the total 2.5 lakh teachers in the state, at least half of them are still out of work,” said B Shivaraj, state vice-president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). In most schools, services of high school teachers were being utilised, while in a few others upper primary or middle school teachers were also working. He said many schools had reduced teachers by 50% in high schools during the current academic year. “The most affected ones are pre-primary and primary teachers,” he said, adding those working, including new recruits, were being paid only 50% of salaries. Private teachers said hardly 50% high school students were attending physical classes every day, while it was 20-30% for primary and upper primary. The managements, meanwhile, were worried about many students not paying fees despite schools having started physical classes. “Only after January we will know the exact situation. We have decided not to ask fees until then as students may stop attending physical classes if we ask for dues,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association. He confirmed that a few budget schools were not calling teachers of KG to class 3 as most haven’t begun offline classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/primary-teachers-struggleas-schools-deny-work-pay/articleshow/87634868.cms||---

The party not only lost the deposit in the by-poll but polled less than 1.50 per cent votes as against over 34 per cent vote share in 2018-assembly polls. The Telangana Congress leaders have been told to come to Delhi on November 13. Sources did not out rule out the possibility of some of the seniors having written to the party high command that the party delayed the announcement of candidate and that the ruling TRS had alleged that the Congress had allegedly fielded a ‘weak candidate” in a tacit understanding with Eatala Rajender of BJP. A couple of days ago, the AICC had appointed an ex-MLA from Karnataka to hold review meetings with the concerned and submit a report on the reasons for party losing the Huzurabad by-election. Political affairs committee convenor Mohd Ali Shabbir charged CM of purchasing 12 MLAs of Congress or else the party would have contested the MLC elections under MLAs quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-top-leaders-summoned-to-delhi/articleshow/87634867.cms||Roushan Ali

The hassle to get permissions, experts say, is what is making applicants hesitant. Telangana government and oil companies have eased rules for setting up petrol pumps. While applicants in neighbouring GHMC areas have been getting licences and other permissions, in Cantonment a new petrol pump is not on the horizon. Currently, there are only 12 petrol outlets, opened four decades ago. Confirming that there are no requisitions regarding opening of a petrol outlet, deputy CEO, Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB), Vijaykumar Balan Nair told TOI: “The Union defence ministry has to give clearance regarding allotment of a retail outlet (petrol & diesel) in Cantonment jurisdiction. That is why applicants may not come forward to apply as it is a lengthy process.” Telangana Petroleum Dealers Association’s president, Amarender Reddy said, “Lack of land in Cantonment, and stringent MoD rules regarding land lease rights are main reasons for applicants hesitating.” Reddy said, “Though applicants face some hurdles in getting permissions in GHMC, officials clear files within five months.” Once civil areas are merged into the civic body, Cantonment applicants to can get permissions hassle-free, said Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-new-petrol-pump-in-cantt-in-decades/articleshow/87634869.cms||Sunil Mungara

A battery of BJP leaders took to social media to vent their anger on the third attack on Koli in the past six months. They termed it a complete failure of the state machinery.

BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted, “Every day, we come across examples of deteriorating law and order situation. The attack on the elected representative, Ranjeeta Koli, is one such example. Till when will the home minister remain asleep? If law and order problem cannot be controlled, better to resign.” He is reportedly in Delhi to discuss the campaign against the state government over the law and order situation in the state. Deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, took the opportunity to attack the government in a series of tweets. “Repeated firing on Bharatpur MLA Ranjeeta Koli since May is highly condemnable. The attack took place barely a few days after the attack on former MLA Amrita Meghwal. It proves that even elected women representatives are not safe in the state.” He argued that this was a reason that crimes against women were on rising in the state. Quoting NCRB data, he said that Rajasthan was leading in the country in terms of crimes against women. “The law and order situation is worsening in the state and it appears that CM Ashok Gehlot is not able to control the situation,” said Rathore.

Chief minister’s statement in the assembly on Wednesday came in the wake of incidents of Youth Congress activists protesting against and blocking film shooting in the state, in connection with the controversy involving actor Joju George. Responding to a submission by MLA M Mukesh in the matter, the chief minister said that the government will not allow anyone to take law into their hands. The encroachment into the creative freedom of the artists will be dealt with firmly by the government. Dictating what others should eat or wear is a Fascist approach.  There are people in the country who are involved in such practices. We call them uncivilized anti-socials, he said. He said that the attack on creative freedom has been happening in the state too and no force can deter anyone from practicing one’s profession without fear. The government will take strong action against anyone who tries to do so, he said. Without naming Joju, Vijayan said that the attack against the actor is not an isolated incident, and there are indications of a planned decision behind this. Without naming Youth Congress activists either, he said that it was surprising that the group of people behind such attacks are taking the cover of democracy for their deeds. He warned that they should realise that the soil is not fertile for Fascist practices and they should give up their beliefs that they can use muscle power. Opposition leader VD Satheesan criticised the Youth Congress way of protest and said that blocking film shootings is not justifiable and the protest of Congress is not against film personalities, but against fuel price hike. He said that the party will take action against anyone who resorts to such practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-action-against-attack-on-creative-freedom-cm/articleshow/87634883.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hope for Covid and mucormycosis-hit patients in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: For 40-year-old priest from Vijayawada, Covid-19, which he had contracted early this year, proved to be a double whammy, leaving him completely shaken. Barely had he recovered from a severe bout of the infection, the dreaded black fungus hit him. The priest’s condition worsened as he visited hospital after hospital in vain and by the time he could receive some medical aid, he had completely lost his upper jaw and teeth to the infection. The black fungus (mucormycosis) left him with a completely distorted facial structure. He lost his ability to speak. “Although I could not chew and was completely on liquids, what affected me most was that I was unable to even recite mantras and prayers, which are most essential part of my life. It left me compeltley shattered and as I went from one hospital to another looking for treatment, I went into depression. It was only after the doctor who treated me reassured me that he will make me chant mantras again that I became hopeful,” said the priest, chanting ‘Om namah Shivaya’ to denote the Kartik masam puja. “Some cases demand upper jaw resection (cheek bones, palate, base of eye, soft tissue, etc.) and with the advantage of 3D CT facial bones reconstruction, 3D-milled titanium implant plates, designed specifically for each patient, prosthetic functional reconstruction of lost structures, including the teeth. Thereafter, the patient’s speech, chewing efficiency and aesthetics are improved. The treatment given and the expert care taken resulted in a tremendous improvement in the quality of the patients’ lives,” said Dr C Sharath Babu, department of dental and maxillofacial, Medicover Hospitals, where two patients underwent successful jaw reconstruction and rehabilitation. A middle-aged LIC agent from Guntur was also left with a functional oral disability post recovery from dual infections. “Talking is my profession and once I could not do it, it was like I was gasping for breath. It took me more than three months to get back my speech, but I want all patients of mucormycosis, who suffered disability, to not lose hope as there are options available now,” he added. The uniqueness of this infection and the large defective area it creates have proven to be very difficult to treat, not to mention the psychological, emotional, and functional loss that the patients incur as a result of oral defects and facial disfiguration . “Some cases demand upper jaw resection (cheek bones, palate, base of eye, soft tissue, etc.) and with the advantage of 3D CT facial bones reconstruction, 3D-milled titanium implant plates, designed specifically for each patient, prosthetic functional reconstruction of lost structures, including the teeth.

Principals and teachers opine that commercial establishments, including tea shops or small eateries, should not be allowed near the school premises as there is a chance that children can consume unhygienic food and these places can become an ‘adda’ (a hangout place). “A few days ago, a tea shop was opened near the school. We got it closed with the help of officials keeping student’s health in mind,” said Varalakshmi M, principal, Jubilee Hills Public School adding that if such establishments come up near the premises, they make it a point to get them removed legally. In Jubilee Hills, there are over 15 pubs constantly buzzing with activity on Road numbers 36, 45, and 10. Apart from blocking the road traffic, noise pollution is the biggest issue when such establishments are located in residential areas. Most vehicles are parked on road in front of these establishments as they don’t have parking, residents complain. “In a 2-km radius from our school, there are at least five to six pubs,” said R Praveen Rao, a Telugu teacher at a school in Jubilee Hills. “Many students pass these pubs to reach school and back home. It is common for them to see someone passing out on the roadside, sleeping in the car, empty or broken liquor bottles on roads, or witnessing rash driving. It is wrong to have such establishments near schools.” School staff also point out that there of many bars and pubs in Jubilee Hills. “We stay right in the heart of residential area and I feel bars, pubs, or other commercial establishments should not be allowed in the area,” said a principal of another school in Jubilee Hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-do-not-want-bars-pubs-near-premises/articleshow/87634894.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A father–son duo attempted to attack a forest official with iron rod and sharp weapons, who somehow managed to evade the attack. On the report by forest range officer, the police on Wednesday morning booked one Pappu Gurjar, who is reportedly a local BJP activist and his son, for interrupting government work under Sections 353, 336, 34 of IPC and initiated investigation. However, none of the two accused was arrested.

While the forest team was in action during the seizure of water pump pipes, the accused father–son duo reached there with iron rods and sharp weapons, and attempted to attack a forest official, who defended himself by instantly stepping back, he added.

They were also released from prison on Wednesday evening. Apart from Chammany, Congress leaders Manu Jacob, Jerges Jacob, Joseph Maliyekal and Shereef Buhari were granted bail. The accused should execute a bond for Rs 50,000 with two sureties each for the amount. The court also ordered to deposit a sum of Rs 37,500 each in court or together furnish bank guarantee for a sum of Rs 1,87,500 as per Section 8 of the Kerala Prevention of Damage to Private Property and Payment of Compensation Act. The court will consider bail petitions by the other accused, including PY Shahjahan, Arun Varghese and PG Joseph, on Friday. The case pertains to the incidents that occurred during the Congress blockade of Edappally-Vyttila bypass on November 1, protesting the rise in fuel prices. Actor Joju George, who was stuck in the traffic block due to the Congress blockade, had protested against it, inviting the ire of Congress workers who vandalized his car. George was injured and the rear windshield of his car was broken. Congress workers gathered outside the prison to welcome the leaders when they were released. Earlier in the day, Mahila Congress activists held a march to Maradu police station alleging that the police did not register a case against the actor based on their complaint. Municipal chairperson in movie shooting row Meanwhile, Thrikkakara municipality chairperson Ajitha Thankappan on Tuesday reportedly denied permission to shoot a Malayalam movie. Irked by actor Joju George’s protest against the national highway blockade by Congress a few days ago, she reportedly shouted at the film crew who sought permission for shooting a scene in Thrikkakara bus station. But, Thankappan denied the reports. She said that she had simply registered her protest as her colleagues and fellow party workers are behind the bars just because of the actor’s complaint. She said that permission was given to the film crew on the same day of submitting the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/five-congress-leaders-granted-bail/articleshow/87634908.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jodhpur||2 armed robbers loot Rs 12 lakh from bank near Jodhpur||JODHPUR: Two armed robbers looted Rs 12 lakh from a bank in Gangani village near Jodhpur on Wednesday morning. They entered the bank barely after it was opened in the morning and fled with the money in just 10 minutes. Both the accused had their faces wrapped with hankies to hide their identity. One of them had a pistol in his hand, while the other had a knife with him to threaten the bank staff. Police have begun a hunt for the accused based on the video grabs captured by the cameras in the bank and have set up nakabandi at different routes. According to ACP Rajendra Prasad Diwakar, the incident took place in a branch of SBI in village Gangani on Jodhpur-Nagaur highway at about 10.45am on Wednesday barely sometime after the doors of the bank were opened for the day. “Bank had just opened at about 10am and the staff members were about to begin their day when two persons with their faces wrapped with hankies and one of them wielding a pistol and other waving a knife, barged into the bank and locked entire staff including the guard, who was present in one of the chambers,” said Diwakar. They also threatened a few customers, who had come to withdraw cash and one of them headed straight to the cashier and threatened him with the knife, while the one with the pistol kept watch around waving his pistol. “At cashier’s chamber, he picked all the cash available there and stuffed the entire money into a bag, which they had brought with them,” said Diwakar. They executed the loot in just 10-15 minutes and fled from the bank with the cash on a motorcycle. Total amount looted was later counted as Rs 11.95 lakh. Diwakar said that the police have filed a case on the complaint of the bank manager and have been trying to identify both of them. “We have initiated a search operation to hunt them and have set up nakabandi in entire area. Besides, we are also checking the CCTV footage from the cameras around,” he said. In past one month, this is the third such incident where the banks have been looted in similar manner by the persons with similar appearance. In the two previous incidents also, the targets were the small branches from rural areas, which included SBI branch in village Khandap in Barmer and village Roon in Nagaur. While a sum of Rs 5.23 lakh had been looted in the former incident, Rs 94,000 were looted in the later incident. Police have not achieved any breakthrough in any of these incidents either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/2-armed-robbers-loot-rs-12l-from-bank-near-jodhpur/articleshow/87635624.cms||---

But upending the narrative, a district collector went straight to a government hospital for his wife’s delivery. The message to the masses is hopefully delivered too. In the wee hours of Wednesday, Bhadradri Kothagudem collector Anudeep Durishetty’s wife gave birth to a boy at the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam. This was the second such instance in just over two weeks, with Khammam additional collector Snehalatha Mogili giving birth at a government hospital on October 24. “The government hospital has all the facilities,” said collector Durishetty, who is the UPSC topper of 2017. The couple’s decision is now the talk of the town. Finance and health minister T Harish Rao and transport minister Puvvada Nageshwara Rao, while congratulating the couple, lauded them for opting for a government hospital. Earlier in October, additional collector Mogili, a 2017 batch IAS officer, had opted to get admitted at the Matha Sishu Kendram at the Government Hospital in Khammam district headquarters. Mogili’s husband Dr P Subharish, a 2017 batch IPS officer serving as assistant superintendent of police in Manuguru in Bhadradri Kothagudem district, had said that they had consciously decided for the delivery at a government hospital. In 2017, the then collector of Jayashankar Bhoopalpalli, Akunuri Murali, had also admitted his daughter in a government hospital for her delivery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/collector-delivers-message-takes-wife-to-govt-hospital-for-delivery/articleshow/87634904.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Goa||Fifa plans for World Cup every two years make sense for India, Sunil Chhetri tells Arsene Wenger||Panaji: Sunil Chhetri had just finished expressing his views on plans to alter the World Cup cycle from four years to two, when Arsene Wenger put his hand up. The former Arsenal manager, now Fifa’s Chief of Global Football Development, is leading a feasibility study into the practicalities of a new international calendar. During an online video call with national captains, Wenger listened to Chhetri and then posed a question of his own. “When will India play at the World Cup,” Wenger asked Chhetri. “Hopefully soon. It’s our dream,” prompt came the reply from the India captain. Should Fifa go ahead with plans to have the World Cup every two years, countries like India – ranked 107 -- will have more opportunities to get closer to the biggest sporting spectacle on earth. Whether the team is good enough to navigate its way through fierce competition is a different story. “During the meeting (with Wenger) I said having the World Cup every two years will always be welcomed by teams like us, who either have not played, narrowly miss out, or need more chances. “Also, one part of me thinks the World Cup is very sacred. It’s a huge tournament and the wait (of four years) makes it wonderful. But that’s the old school fan in me. The player in me, and the Indian football fan in me, knows if qualifiers happen every two years, we will have more opportunities,” said Chhetri, who has scored 80 international goals, the same as Argentina star Lionel Messi. At the meeting, Wenger argued that increasing the regularity of World Cups will boost all aspects of the game. The former Arsenal manager also proposed two international breaks -- in March and October -- which provides more time together for national teams and less disruption from international fixtures for clubs. It’s something that Chhetri knows will do Indian football a world of good. “I did say having a specified international gap will help us. We keep complaining that we don’t get enough time, there is a problem with the calendar and stuff like that. If there is an uniform calendar where one or two months are dedicated to the national team, no matter what, it really helps us,” said Chhetri. When Wenger spoke to captains, Chhetri was busy with the national team, helping India win the SAFF Championship in Maldives. The team was together for a longer period, and the results were there for all to see. “We were together for almost 26 days,” said Chhetri. “For a national team like ours, it makes a little bit more sense. Because every time there is a Fifa window, we are either unable to utilise the window or don’t get the teams to play against. When we have a unified month, we know exactly what to do. The planning can be better.” Chhetri, 37, said the new plans may not be ideal for big guns like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who play more than 60 plus games in a season for club and country. For India, though, it’s win-win. “The World Cup is a huge tournament. FIfa is already increasing the teams (from 32 since 1998 to 48 in 2026), which is good in a holistic way. But if it happens every two years, the charm might be lost. As the national team captain, India would love to have it every two years, since it gives us more chances,” said Chhetri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fifa-plans-for-world-cup-every-two-years-make-sense-for-india-sunil-chhetri-tells-arsene-wenger/articleshow/87654722.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Police can take suo motu action in extortion case against NCB’||Mumbai: The special investig-ation team (SIT) of Mumbai Police is caught in a fix because Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani, who allegedly paid Rs 50 lakh to prevent the arrest of the actor’s son Aryan in the cruise drug bust case, has not appeared to give her statement. The money was reportedly returned to Dadlani as NCB witness, K P Gosavi, who promised help, was a cheat. Police had issued Dadlani summons but she declined citing ill health. Meanwhile, legal experts said if there is information of a cognisable offence taking place, police can, on its own, file a case and carry out a probe. “Crimin-al cases are registered based on information. Existence of a formal complaint is not necessary. If there is credible information that money was transacted to fix an NCB case, then police can suo motu register an FIR where both the giver and the taker of money can be arrested,” said former IPS officer-turned-lawyer Y P Singh. An SIT officer said they want Dadlani’s statement about her alleged meeting with Gosavi and Sam D’Souza at Lower Parel on October 3. Subsequent to this meeting, it is alleged that money exchanged hands. Despite summons, if Dadlani does not appear before the SIT, it can move court seeking a non-bailable warrant against her, another lawyer said. He added that if she gives a statement denying paying money to Gosavi and if they suspect that she is lying, they can seek her custodial interrogation. An official said they have CCTV footage of her arriving in a blue Mercedes and talking with Gosavi and D’Souza. When TOI phoned Dadlani, she cut the call. An officer said they will wait till this weekend for Dadlani to appear before the SIT else they might visit her place or record her statement via videoconference. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-can-take-suo-motu-action-in-extortion-case-against-ncb/articleshow/87636134.cms||Ahmed Ali

The accused, 44-year-old Bhagwati Prasad alias Bhairath Jani alias Bhagi Joraram Bishnoi was named in at least four cases filed under The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Following specific leads, Bishnoi was caught by a team of Special Operation Group (SOG) as soon as he came out of the Surat railway station. The accused had a government license to deal in poppy straw powder from 2002 to 2015. Bishnoi used to sell the poppy straw powder to small traders. In 2015 the Rajasthan government discontinued issuing dealership licenses after which Bishnoi started his illegal trade. He was booked in Chittorgarh, Jaisalmer and Kota districts in multiple cases of narcotics smuggling. “Bishnoi was on the run for a long time. But as part of the city police’s ‘No Drugs In Surat’ drive, we nabbed him. He is one of the kingpins involved in smuggling of ‘posht’, a type of poppy,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. Police investigation revealed that Bishnoi owns two malls, a petrol pump, agriculture land and several other properties. “He was running a successful business when he had the license. After discontinuation of the license he took to smuggling. He made crores of rupees through the legal and then illegal business of poppy capsules,” said an SOG officer. Bishnoi was handed over to Rajasthan police. Police suspect that due to his money power he used to source poppy capsules illegally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/millionaire-nabbed-for-smuggling/articleshow/87634070.cms||---

Both the accused have been identified, but are yet to be nabbed. The deceased was identified as class 12 student Rajkumar Sharma, son of Om Prakesh Sharma of Keshavpura area under Mahavir Nagar police station here. Revenge for accidentally breaking the mobile phone of one of the accused by the deceased was the reason for the murder.

The two accused have been identified as Rahul and Sonu Meena, both around 20 years old, but have not been arrested so far. It was learnt that Rahul’s mobile accidentally fell from the hands of Rajkumar around a month ago since then Rahul had been looking for revenge. Rahul with the help of his friend Sonu took Rajkumar on their scooter to an isolated place in Anantpura police station area on Sunday where they murdered him. There were around 6-7 fatal injuries with sharp weapon over his chest, thighs and back of the body with blood stains scattered 300-400 metres.

The study shows how each district in the country was impacted by Covid-19. Metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kamrup Metropolitan, South Goa, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad were most affected by Covid-19. About 80% of infected cases and 61% deaths were observed in nine states, including AP and Telangana, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu. The study was published in Plos One journal with the tile ‘District level correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in India during March-October 2020’ by researchers Vandana Tamrakar, Ankita Srivastava, Nandita Saikia , Mukesh C Parmar, Sudheer Kumar Shukla, Shewli Shabnam, Bandita Boro, Apala Saha and Benjamin Debbarma. The results revealed that the infection rate was 42.8 per hundred thousand population. Kerala reported highest infection rate with 259 and the lowest in Bihar 6.5. Researchers found that, with an increasing percentage of literacy, there was a lower infection ratio. “The infection ratio is more in districts with a higher working-age population, higher population density, a more urban population, and vigorous testing, and a higher level of stunted children. The findings are crucial information for policy discourse, emphasizing the vulnerability of the highly urbanized and densely populated areas,” opined researchers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-had-high-covid-infection-rate-finds-study/articleshow/87634909.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Cabinet expansion to take place in February||HYDERABAD: Despite strong speculations about a possible cabinet expansion after Huzurabad bypoll, it is unlikely to happen, sources said. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao dropped enough hints that he won’t expand his team immediately by his action of handing over the crucial health portfolio to his trusted lieutenant and finance minister T Harish Rao. Sources in TRS and government said the reshuffle will only happen after the MLC vacancies were filled in January. Since there are no auspicious days, the cabinet expansion is likely to take place in February. As of now, there is one vacancy in the cabinet after the removal of Eatala Rajender in April this year. The CM is considering a rejig of his entire council of ministers apart from filling up the one vacancy. In view of this, he did not give the health portfolio to other ministers and kept it with him till now. The Election Commission issued two notifications for filling up 18 vacancies in the legislative council. While polling for six vacancies from MLA quota will be held on November 29, elections for another 12 vacancies in local authorities constituencies will be held on December 10. The 12 MLCs will take oath only after January 4. Party sources said KCR may drop a couple of ministers whose performance is considered to be poor. He will also be considering caste equations. There were rumours that the CM assured former legislative council chariman Gutha Sukender Reddy a place in his cabinet. He is likely to be renominated from the legislative council. Since one BC minister Eatala was removed from the cabinet, another BC minister will be inducted in the cabinet. Former Telangana TDP chief and ex-minister L Ramana, who is from the weaver community and hails from erstwhile Karimnagar district, may get a chance. Under SC quota, former deputy CM Kadiyam Srihari whose MLC term got expired in June this year along with five other MLCs is likely to get a second chance now. He may also find a place in the cabinet and be rewarded with irrigation portfolio, which he held in Chandrababu Naidu’s cabinet in unified AP. Under the same SC quota, the government is reportedly considering Chennur MLA Balka Suman, who worked for the party in Nagarjuna Sagar and Huzurabad bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-expansion-to-take-place-in-feb/articleshow/87634915.cms||Koride Mahesh

I calculated the rise in petrol prices at an interval of seven years since then. I found that in the seven years of the Modi government, the price of petrol has increased less than the increase in any previous seven years,” Puri told the Times Now Summit 2021.

Today it is $84-85 (per barrel). Fuel prices are rising because of the market conditions,” he said. Asked if the timing of the excise cut was dictated by the forthcoming assembly election in UP and it could have come earlier, Puri said there was always some election somewhere in the country.

Shah also inaugurated the Times NowHe explained that the duty cut could not have come earlier because the economy was hit by the pandemic and the government needed money to fund vaccination as well as welfare measures such as free food for the poor. Money was also needed to pay for the oil bonds floated by the UPA government to subsidise fuels earlier.

Speaking at the Times Now summit, Rijiju said“Now the focus has shifted on livelihood and the economy is firing on all cylinders. Consumption (of fuels) is higher than the pre-pandemic period. Revenue collections have stabilised. There is confidence (to cut duty)... The (Modi) government has always had its heart in giving relief to consumers. It (duty cut) is an excellent move by the PM and finance minister that will create pressure on states to reduce VAT,” he said. On the fairness of last year’s excise duty hike, Puri said, “The economy had shut down and the focus was on life.” Excise duty has been fixed. But states charge VAT as per cent... there is a killing (made) there.” On the strategic sale of Air India, he said the national carrier was financially sick in spite of being a “first-class asset”. “The debate was simply whether to sell or close down the airline,” Puri said. Describing the nationalisation of Air India and Bharat Petroleum (among others) by the Congress government (under Indira Gandhi), Puri expressed happiness that even the second bid for Air India was higher than the reserve price, which proved detractors of the disinvestment wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-prevented-duty-cut-earlier-petroleum-and-urban-development-minister-hardeep-puri/articleshow/87636471.cms||---

The study found that while the overall patient burden increased by 41.4% during the lockdown as compared to 2019, this torrent of patients also brought with them a 12.7% increase in cases of attempted self-harm and a staggering increase of 95% in victims of violence who were admitted to the ED. Researchers told TOI that this was a significant increase suggesting that the larger number of cases in 2020 was not a mere coincidence, hence could be attributed to the strong restrictive measures during the Covid-19 lockdown that led to unemployment, loneliness, cash crunch among families, which may have worsened the existing mental health problems. Dr Ishan Lamba,  researcher from Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre told TOI, “Among those studied, sanitiser consumption, previously unseen in the 2019 dataset, accounted for 8% of all self-poisonings reported at the hospital ED in 2020, while violence was noted as the predominant mode of injury during the lockdown period, comprising 82.7% (486 admissions) in 2020, as compared to 73.3% (176 admissions) in 2019.” The study is slated to be published in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Dr Varsha S Shinde, professor, Emergency Medicine Department at the hospital, said, “An increase in violence by known individuals was seen - from 68.8% of total cases of violence presented at the ED in 2019 to 78% in the lockdown period. Intimate partner violence also increased from 4% to 7% among the presented cases. Blunt weapons (in 355 cases in 2020) were most commonly used, but there was an increase in usage of sharp weapons from the 9% of total assault cases in 2019 to 16.2% of the total assault cases presented to the ED in 2020.” Dr Suhrith Bhattaram, lead researcher from Dr DY Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, said self-harm cases accounted for 17.3% (102) of all the study subjects in 2020, as compared to 26.7% (64) in 2019. “There was, however, a decrease in self-poisoning among the cases studied in 2019 in comparison to the lockdown period: from 84.4% to 69.6%, respectively. The decrease was greater in consumption of pharmaceuticals, than non-pharmaceutical agents. Hanging also saw an increase from 3.1% to 7.8%. Sanitiser or rubbing alcohol consumption, unseen in the 2019 dataset, accounted for 12.67% of all consumption during the lockdown,” he said. The study also found a notable increase from 10.9% (7 cases in 2019) to 38.2% (39 cases during the lockdown) in the use of alcohol before an act of self-harm. In cases of violence, use of alcohol before the act increased from 22.7% (40 cases in 2019) to 43% (209 cases during the lockdown). The study also stated that emergency department admissions at the hospital rose by 41.4% during the lockdown period. A total of 12,238 patients were admitted to the hospital ED during March 24-June 30, 2020 (lockdown period) as against 8,654 during March 24-June 30, 2019, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/self-harm-and-violence-cases-rose-drastically-during-lockdown-study/articleshow/87634943.cms||Neha Madaan

CPM’s attempts to paint the protests against certain individuals who tried to thwart the public protest against fuel price increase as the attack against the cinema field will not succeed, Sudhakaran told reporters on Wednesday. He said the state unit of Congress would organise protest programmes against the state and central governments in all assembly segments on November 18. The protest is planned to press the central and state governments to take immediate steps to make the fuel price affordable. The protest programmes, he said, would take place at 280 spots, spread across 140 assembly segments in the state. “One block committee of Congress party in a particular assembly segment would hold a march to a central government office and stage a sit-in there. While the second block committee of the state assembly constituency would march to a state government office and observe a dharna in front of that office. Such a protest programme is planned in view of the KPCC’s clear understanding that both the state and central governments are equally responsible for the unreasonable fuel prices. Congress would also construct a human chain from the Secretariat to Raj Bhavan, raising the demand for fuel price reduction,” Sudhakaran said. Sudhakaran said the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s attitude to fuel prices was arrogant. The state government, he said, has no qualms in sharing the booty extracted by the central government by levying unreasonable tax on petroleum products. The government will have to concede to the demand for tax reduction, a reasonable demand by the people, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/instructed-party-workers-not-to-disrupt-film-shoots-kpcc-chief/articleshow/87634945.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The strike by a section of MSRTC employees has paralysed bus services across the state. The government has allowed the private operators to use the MSRTC depots to ferry passengers. Pandey held a meeting with the agitating employees on Wednesday. “The representatives of the agitating employees were told that the government has decided to ply private buses during the strike. The members were told that they should not obstruct the operations of the private buses from the ST depots at any cost.” He told TOI that the members were informed that the industrial tribunal had deemed “the strike is illegal.” The officers in charge of all the police stations in the city have been told to deploy appropriate bandobast in their respective areas. “At the same time, there should be effective patrolling by the beat marshals and other patrolling teams of every police station,” he said. Meanwhile, he also instructed the police officials concerned to take necessary legal action if any person was posing a challenge to the law and order. Meanwhile, senior officials of the Nashik Regional Transport Office (RTO) conducted a meeting with private bus operators, school bus operators, etc. and asked them to deploy as many vehicles as possible so that the passengers do not have to face inconvenience. Nashik RTO Pradeep Shinde said, “We have also deployed a motor vehicle inspector at every depot of the district to coordinate with the transporters, who are willing to ferry the passengers. The transporters can take passengers from any place since the MSRTC buses are not plying. However, they should not be charging exorbitant fares from the passengers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cops-warns-msrtc-staff-against-blocking-pvt-buses/articleshow/87633104.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Trichy||‘Keep poll promise on hiking MSP of paddy, sugarcane’||Trichy: AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and deputy coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami have slammed the DMK government for not keeping its poll promise to increase the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy and sugarcane and enhance the procurement capacity of the direct procurement centres (DPCs). Criticising chief minister M K Stalin’s ‘Vidiyalai Nokki Stalinin Kural’ (Stalin’s voice towards the dawn) campaign before the assembly election, the opposition leaders alleged that the DMK government has led the farmers ‘towards frustration’ (Virakthiyai Nokki) by remaining tight-lipped over the poll promises. The AIADMK recalled the DMK’s promise of increasing the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal and of Sugarcane to Rs 4,000 per tonne. After six months of DMK rule, the MSP of paddy stood at Rs 2,015 per quintal for 2021-22 and Rs 2,900 for a tonne of sugarcane with a sugar content recovery rate of 10%. The MSP of sugarcane with a sugar content recovery rate below 10% is Rs 2,755. The opposition leaders also raked up the issue of paddy getting drenched in direct procurement centres in the Cauvery delta districts. “Paddy brought to the DPCs by the farmers and the paddy procured by the government has been spoiled due to the rain,” said the statement quoting the complaints from the farmers. The limited procurement of 700 sacks and 1,000 sacks of paddy per day is the reason for the mess. The AIADMK demanded the chief minister to keep his poll promise on MSP and to take steps to ensure quick procurement of paddy by DPCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/keep-poll-promise-on-hiking-msp-of-paddy-sugarcane/articleshow/87635656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||RKM college hostels keep numbers low, play it safe||Kolkata: Various Ramakrishna Mission colleges plan to reopen their campuses in a phased way from November 16 for smooth transition from online to offline learning over the next few days. Since most of the RKM colleges are residential institutes, the authorities are being extra careful by calling students in small batches and quarantining them for a few days before calling the others. At least initially, one student will stay in one hostel room. “In the first phase, final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students pursuing lab-based subjects will be called to the campus. Since ours is a residential college, we are being very cautious,” said Swami Mahaprajnananda,vice-principal of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur. The college had started with online classes from April 2020 soon after educational institutes were shut due to the pandemic. As a large part of theory subjects have been completed online, the college wants to focus on practical-based subjects so that students can return to the campus and can work in the lab. All the RKM colleges have decided to continue with online lessons till the classes fully shift to campuses. “We have already started calling students in small groups and they are being quarantined for three days. Most of them have received two doses of the vaccine. For those who are yet to get their second doses, we are making arrangements. Gradually we will call students from other years, too. We will keep monitoring and evaluating the Covid situation before calling more students to the campus. The online classes will continue till the entire transition is made to offline,” an official said. At Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, too, authorities are looking at phased reopening. “Most of our students have been vaccinated,” said an official at the college. At Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, authorities want to call students with practical-based subjects first. “Our teachers have finished a very big part of theory portions through online mode. So, we have decided that we will call only students pursuing lab-based subjects in the first phase. Each day will be set aside for students from a particular semester. Not more than 60-70 students will be called on a day so that social distancing can be maintained. They have missed out on using the labs and so, they will be provided enough time to catch up and learn,” said Swami Kamalasthananda, principal at the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rkm-college-hostels-keep-numbers-low-play-it-safe/articleshow/87634928.cms||Zeeshan Javed

These institutes feel first-semester undergraduate students need to get a feel of their campuses to start off their college life. But most of these institutes pointed out that in-person classes notwithstanding, online lessons will continue. A day earlier on Tuesday, most of the state-run universities in the city — Jadavpur University, Calcutta University and Rabindra Bharati University — said they did not want to call first-years immediately and rather, their focus was on older batches. Bethune College is one of the CU institutes that plan to call freshers in the first phase. “We will call first-semester students for physical classes as they are eager to see the college building and experience the atmosphere of the campus,” said Krishna Roy, principal at Bethune. The college will hold offline classes in two shifts, the first one from 11am to 2pm and the second from 2pm to 4.30pm-5pm. While Arts students will attend classes in the first half and science students will come in the second slot. Postgraduate students will also attend classes in two shifts for three days a week. However, online lessons will also continue as the institute plans to hold hybrid classes till November 26, after which a decision will be taken, based on the situation. Lady Brabourne College has decided to call UG first-, third- and fifth-semester science students and PG first- and third-semester students on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Arts students on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. “Online and offline classes will continue in alternative manner. Teachers will take classes from campuses and students will attend online or offline classes, according to the schedule,” said Siuli Sarkar, Lady Brabourne College principal. Asutosh College and New Alipore College will also call first-semester students, but for two days a week. While they will attend classes on Mondays and Thursdays, third-semester students will attend on Tuesdays and Fridays and fifth-semester students on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Practical classes will be held on a new schedule. New Alipore college principal Jaydeep Sarangi said, “Online and offline classes will be on simultaneously.” Surendranath College has divided classes according to semesters. First-year students will attend physical classes on Fridays and Saturdays, fifth-semester on Mondays and Tuesdays, and the third-semesteron Wednesdays and Thursdays. Principal Indranil Kar said, “Students will enter the campus through the main gate and the exit will be through another gate to avoid crowding.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cu-colleges-plan-shifts-odd-even-formula-to-call-freshers-to-campus/articleshow/87634916.cms||---

A special drive has been launched ahead of the forthcoming civic polls, which will continue till November 30. The voter list is also available online for voters to check details and submit applications. A meeting was conveyed by the election department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday to discuss various initiatives planned under the special drive. Leaders of political parties in PMC urged the administration to take necessary steps to avoid lapses like missing and duplication of names while preparing the final draft of the list. Prashant Jagtap, head of the NCP’s city unit, said, “The administration should prepare the voter list with minimum errors. This will avoid confusion among voters. Also, there should not be duplication of names. The authorities must rule out inclusion of names with addresses other than Pune city.” Jagtap said that some leaders had demanded that registration of new voters be accepted online as well as offline. “We also want the administration to allot the voter identity card to maximum voters before the polling day,” Jagtap said. The elections are likely to be held in February next year. The state government has taken the preliminary step of drafting of panels. Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar said that since boundaries of all existing panels were undergoing revision for the forthcoming polls, chances of confusion among voters could not be ruled out. The administration should draft the voter list based on revised panels to avoid confusion and chaos. Aba Bagul, the leader of the Congress, said, “We have suggested that natural boundaries be considered while drafting the panels. Also, the entire exercise should be done well in advance so that citizens would be able to understand revised panels. Every voter should receive identity card before the polls”. City-based civic organisations have said that the authorities should reach maximum voters during the special drive to make the draft list error-free. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “Missing of names is a common complaint. Voters also face difficulties in finding polling booths. Also, in many cases, names appear in adjacent wards. The administration must act now to restrict such instances on the day of voting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-sets-up-help-desk-at-every-ward-for-voters/articleshow/87634921.cms||---

Around 110 health department teams of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) were involved in the drive on Wednesday.  SMC is focussing on those areas where the overall vaccination has remained low compared to other localities. Till Wednesday, 61% of the targeted population had been vaccinated. “The teams conducted surveys of residential societies to find out the number of unvaccinated people. Through the survey, we could identify the societies,” said a health official. SMC earlier started the ‘Knock the Door’ campaign in which health teams used to visit residential societies on call where more than 10 persons were available for vaccination. The campaign received good response in mobilising people and encouraging those who did not take vaccines earlier. “The teams were formed at each health centre level. Large number of people are not coming forward for second dose and this drive will help in vaccinating them,” said the health official.  Against the targeted population, total 36.36 lakh people were vaccinated for the first dose while 20.94 lakh for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1700-vaccinated-at-home-in-surat/articleshow/87634108.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Have you verified social media documents, Bombay high court to Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday questioned state minister Nawab Malik if he had verified documents against NCB officer Sameer Wankhede and his family before uploading them on to social media. “Have you verified as a responsible citizen and as spokesperson of a national political party?” asked Justice Madhav Jamdar, directing Malik to file an affidavit stating so. The judge is hearing a defamation suit filed by Dhyandev Wankhede (72), Sameer Wankhede’s father, against Malik. Justice Jamdar also directed Wankhede to point out “that the tweets or material annexed to his plaint, which are tweeted by the defendant (Malik), is false.” Wankhede’s advocate Arshad Shaikh argued for an injunction against Malik from making further remarks. He referred to Malik’s reply that if Sameer Wankhede’s birth certificate showing he is Muslim is false, he must provide a correct certificate. “Why am I supposed to justify my stand to an individual who may be an MLA but not a court or quasijudicial authority?” he asked. He said Wankhede is trying to protect his blood and family. “When you say you wanted to expose Sameer Wankhede, why (have) you attacked his father?” Shaikh asked. But Justice Jamdar said he must concentrate on the aspect that Malik’s tweets are false. “Forget about technicalities. You have to show prima facie those tweets are false. Your son is a public servant. His actions can be examined by any member of public,” he added. Senior advocate Atul Damle, for Malik, said Wankhede has accepted the uploads are from family’s social media accounts. “He accepts these are uploaded by son and daughter on Instagram, Facebook… Where is the question of creating documents falsely? I have not posted in the air,” said Damle, adding whether documents are right or wrong may be seen during trial. Justice Jamdar pointed to the way “Samir” appeared on the birth certificate. Damle said it was issued by BMC. It was then that HC asked, “Is it not your duty to verify?” Asked if Malik’s reply has a statement on verification, Damle said there is no specific statement except that the admissibility and authenticity of evidence can be decided at trial stage. “Admissibility is (a) different aspect. Whether it is authentic, it is your responsibility. You will have to file a reply and verify the truthfulness,” said Justice Jamdar. The judge said he will hear only on ad-interim relief for injunction on Friday. When Damle said relief sought is also against Malik’s party members and all acting on his instructions, Justice Jamdar said, “I am not going to pass a gag order. He is also (a) citizen of India and is seeking damages. Even if it is his son, ultimately he is also defamed,” HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-malik-if-hed-verified-docus-he-put-on-social-media/articleshow/87636145.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: N-S Metro to start operation at 7am from Monday to help students||KOLKATA: Metro would advance its timings by half-an-hour from Monday to cater to school and college students, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said at the first meeting of the Metro Railway Users Consultative Committee (MRUCC) on Tuesday. From Monday, Joshi said, the first trains on the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor would leave terminal stations at 7am instead of 7.30am as educational institutes would reopen their campuses from the next day. TOI had reported on November 5 that the carrier was likely to start operations at 7am instead of 7.30am along the north-south corridor. Joshi had then said, “We are not increasing the number of trains yet since morning and evening peak-our services are already at the maximum 5min frequency. But we may start half-an-hour early in the morning for the benefit of students.” Metro now operates from 7.30am to 10.30pm, with 266 trains, against the pre-Covid fleet of 288 services. Presiding over Tuesday’s MRUCC meeting, Joshi said tokens would be back as soon as Covid cases reduced significantly. The newly constituted Metro users’ committee has nine members, including Union minister Shantanu Thakur, Lok Sabha MP Mala Roy, Rajya Sabha MP Rupa Ganguly and two senior Bengal government officials. The GM, who is the chairman of MRUCC, was responding to a question by Shankar Das, nominated member of Railway Board, as to why only smart cards were allowed to board a Metro train. The GM explained that tokens would add to the risk of coronavirus transmission. Metro had earlier announced re-issuance of tokens from March 15, but deferred its decision as Bengal’s daily Covid count rose to 700-plus. “We shall examine the feasibility of suggestions given by every MRUCC member and explain if they are found non-implementable,” said Protyush Ghosh, deputy general manager, Metro Railway. He and other senior officers attended Tuesday’s meeting. Joshi briefed the members about the various initiatives and the progress of on-going Metro extension projects. MP Ganguly called for keeping the areas outside the Metro stations clean. She also urged the authorities to facilitate the extension projects and commission the various corridors at the earliest. Das asked if an escalator could be installed betw-een the second and third platforms of Park Street Metro station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/n-s-metro-to-start-op-at-7am-from-mon-to-help-students/articleshow/87634939.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Ahmednagar civil hospital staff start indefinite strike||NASHIK: All the 50 doctors and the entire team of 180 nurses along with all paramedical staff of the civil hospital started an indefinite strike on Wednesday, paralysing OPD services and elective surgeries. Only the emergency services were rendered by the doctors and nurses at the hospital. There is an outrage among the medical fraternity of Ahmednagar following the arrest of medical officer Dr Vishaka Shinde and three staff nurses — Sapna Pathare, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant — of the Ahmednagar civil hospital in connection with the death of 11 Covid-19 patients at the hospital’s ICU following a fire on November 6. Inspector of the Tofkhana police station Jyoti Gadkari said the arrested suspects were produced in the local court on Wednesday, which remanded them in police custody for two days. The Ahmednagar unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also decided to keep the OPD and IPD services shut in about 300 private hospitals and clinics for a day on Thursday to express their solidarity with the arrested doctor and the three nurses. District collector Rajendra Bhosale told TOI that he held a meeting with a delegation of doctors, nurses and IMA on Wednesday evening and appealed to them to withdraw the strike. “They have demanded the release of the arrested doctor and nurses. I have told them that the state government would be informed of their demand. I have requested them to start their work so that patients do not suffer,” added Bhosale. The senior medical officer of Ahmednagar civil hospital, Dr Prasad Saigaonkar, said that it would be difficult to withdraw the stir as there is huge resentment among all civil hospital officials and employees. But he assured that the emergency services would continue unhindered and no patient would be inconvenienced due to the stir. “The investigations are still on and the arrests were made based on the CCTV footage from the ICU. Our doctor and nurses were not responsible for the outbreak of the fire that led to the deaths. Yet, criminal cases were filed against them. Such acts are demoralising for the medical fraternity,” he sad. President of the Maharashtra State Health Nurses Association Surekha Andhale warned of a statewide agitation if the arrested medical workers are not released soon. “We had written to the state government to roll back the disciplinary action taken against the nurses after the incident. Instead of paying heed to our demand, the government has toughened its stand. We will also not take things lying down,” she added. IMA Ahmednagar secretary Dr Sachin Vahadane said that OPDs and IPDs of all 300 private hospitals and clinics in Ahmednagar city would remain closed for 24 hours from Thursday morning. “The doctors and nurses have been made scapegoats in the incident, which was due to a technical reason,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-civil-hospital-staff-start-indefinite-strike/articleshow/87633128.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ram Mandir bridge reopened for traffic||MUMBAI: The Ram Mandir bridge over a nullah on SV Road in the western suburbs, whose surface was washed away following torrential rains of July 17-18 midnight this year (also the day when two landslides were reported in Mumbai at Vikhroli and Mahul), reopened for vehicular movements on Wednesday. BMC officials said that after July’s incessant rains washed away the bridge’s asphalt surface and exposed the concrete slab, it had to be repaired. Chief engineer bridges Satish Thosar said, “A concrete slab which was cast on site has been laid over the stretch. Simultaneously, works are underway for increasing the width of the entire stretch. Currently, only light motor vehicles are being allowed to use it.” Locals said that the suspension of the bridge was causing traffic jams in the locality as the alternative access was single lane road and a detour of almost two kilometres. The bridge is a crucial connector especially for entry and exit into Goregaon and also for motorists from Lokandwala, Oshiwara wanting to head northbound towards Malad, Kandivali. Local corporator Sandeep Patel of the BJP said, “The bridge remaining shut was hampering traffic movement for the past several months. This was also putting a lot of load on the Veer Savarkar flyover at Goregaon West as vehicles would have to use the same, wasting 20-15 minutes of time. While the bridge was not safe to use , there was also a need to open it up sooner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ram-mandir-bridge-reopened-for-traffic/articleshow/87635681.cms||Richa Pinto

Telangana Southern (TSSPDCL) and Northern (TSNPDCL) discoms, which have been going through a rough financial crisis, are planning to enhance the tariffs for all categories of consumers, including domestic and nondomestic, commercial and industrial sectors. Sources in the government said since the hike in power tariff was being taken up after five years, the minimum increase will be Re 1 per unit for domestic and Rs 6-7 per unit for the industrial sector. The discoms are expecting Rs 3,000 crore additional revenue through the hike. The government wants to increase the charges for this category of consumers but it will be between 50 paise and Re 1 per unit, sources said. The CM is expected to take a decision whether the increase in tariffs would be applicable to consumers of less than 100 units. “The exercise on revising the power tariffs has begun and will be completed soon. The aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) will be filed with the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) before November 30 after taking permission from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao,” a senior official of TSSPDCL told TOI. “In the past five years, the discoms and power utilities have spent over Rs 30,000 crore on improving power infrastructure and power arrears.

---||Goa||To curb crimes against women, Goa CM moots pink police force||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that the state is contemplating a ‘pink police force’ to tackle crimes against women. “We are thinking of creating a pink female force, especially for women and women’s safety. We are thinking about how to introduce this,” Sawant told senior policemen of the state. He said though Goa has the best track record in solving crimes in the country, police must also make an effort to prevent crime, particularly against women. Of the various crimes against women, incidents of rape have been the highest in Goa over the past six years, with 387 cases reported in the state since January 2016, as per data tabled in the assembly. A minimum of 60 rape cases have been reported every year in Goa since 2016 “I had a meeting with the DGP and SP (crime) and discussed what precautions we need to take and what new initiatives we need to adopt, especially for the safety of women. Within a short span, we are taking some major steps,” Sawant said at the function organised by the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development. DGP Mukesh Kumar Meena said women police personnel will be deployed at certain vulnerable locations to ensure the safety and security of women, and that women’s help desks at all police stations will be strengthened. “If a woman complainant comes in, she can give her complaint to the women personnel,” he said. “We are making a chart of all the women police personnel that we have, and we are going to send them to public places to talk to women. Women feel comfortable talking to women,” he said. Meena said the CM has issued instructions for all precautionary and preventive measures to be taken to reduce the number of crimes against women. “Besides detection of cases, attention also needs to be given to prevention of crimes. For this, we have increased patrolling. I have asked each police station to identify points where police presence is required around the clock. We have identified these points and deployed personnel,” Meena said. Speaking about the 60-day training programme for police officers who have been promoted to the rank of SP, Meena said the training will help the senior police officers keep abreast of new laws, guidelines and court judgments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-curb-crimes-against-women-cm-moots-pink-police-force/articleshow/87635679.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State govt gives go-ahead to recruit 2,100 teachers||Mumbai: The state government has given its nod for recruiting the largest numbers of teachers (nearly 2,100) in higher education institutions in four years. Over 9,500 teachers posts of the total 34,531 were vacant since May 2017, when government stayed recruitment. Colleges since then have been managing with ad hoc appointments even as positions went vacant after teachers retired. Higher & technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday posted on social media that government had given its nod for filling teachers’ vacant positions and a go-ahead to recruit 2,088 teachers in first phase. A government resolution will be released in two days, he added.Overall, 9,511 positions are vacant in aided colleges and universities. In Mumbai, 20% of the 3,118 positions in aided colleges are vacant. After new reservations had to be applied, government approved filling in 40% of these vacant positions only 3,580 of the 9,511 posts. Subsequently, before the pandemic, between 2018 and May 2020, 1,492 teachers were recruited. The remaining 2,088 will be now be appointed once the GR is out. Other vacant positions too will be filled, the minister indicated. Many aided colleges have been running the show with ad hoc appointments. Mumbai University’s department has nearly 40% vacant positions. In fact, MHRD’s Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan had urged government to fill vacant posts to get funding under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-govt-gives-go-ahead-to-recruit-2100-teachers/articleshow/87636146.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Ministers contradict each other, opposition targets chief minister||Thiruvananthapuram: Contrary to its earlier claim, the state government on Wednesday said forest department officials of Kerala and Tamil Nadu had jointly examined the Mullaperiyar dam site on June 11 as directed by the Supreme Court-appointed supervisory committee in a meeting in February 2021. It also said the forests department had given permission to fell 15 trees on the basis of a formal online application from Tamil Nadu and a letter from the deputy director of Periyar tiger reserve (east division) on October 30, 2021. Power minister K Krishnankutty made these statements in the assembly while replying to a submission from opposition leader VD Satheesan on behalf of water resources minister Roshy Augustine. Forest minister AK Saseendran had earlier told the assembly that there was no joint inspection in Mullaperiyar and the permit for felling trees was issued without the knowledge of the political leadership. Krishnankutty said the supervisory committee had asked the water resources department to make the necessary preparations for the joint examination of the dam site. Additional chief secretary TK Jose represents the state in the committee. Also, in another meeting held on September 17, 2021, it has been recorded that Tamil Nadu had sought permission to fell 15 trees, instead of 23, and the matter is under the consideration of the state forests and wildlife department, the minister said. Further, a letter sent by the supervisory committee chairman to the additional chief secretary (water resources) on September 3, 2021 said the joint inspection had been conducted and 15 trees identified. It also said an application to fell trees had been submitted online and the process should be expedited, he said. The joint secretary in Union ministry of water resources had also written to the state that strengthening of the baby dam, earthen dam and ghat road were necessary for the safety of Mullaperiyar dam, he said. Satheesan said the forest and water resources ministers were giving conflicting answers on the matter and alleged that the decision had been taken with the knowledge of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The forest minister had misled the assembly and made a mockery of the public. The additional chief secretary (water resources) also holds the charge of additional chief secretary (home and vigilance), which is under the chief minister. It cannot be believed that the order was issued without the knowledge of the chief minister,” he said, adding that it would adversely affect the state’s demand for a new dam in the apex court. The opposition later staged a walkout in protest against the government’s stand on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ministers-contradict-each-other-opposition-targets-chief-minister/articleshow/87634966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The 23-year-old software engineer, who tweeted a rape threat to a top cricket star’s daughter, graduated from IITHyderabad about two years ago. He had been working with one of India’s top food delivery apps headquartered in Bangalore with an annual pay package of around Rs 24 lakh, but he left the job to pursue a master’s degree in a US university for which he was preparing. Everything seemed to be falling in place for the young man until he tweeted the rape threat. Now, he is on his way to a jail in Mumbai, leaving his friends and family stunned. Ramnagesh’s father Srinivas works as a fitter in Ordnance Factory, Medak at Yeddumailaram which manufactures armoured vehicles for the Indian army. The upset father told TOI, “My son is just a cricket lover and usually very sober in his reactions. When I found out what he had done, I told him that if India had lost to Pakistan, he should have tweeted about the cricket star and should never have mentioned the daughter. I can’t understand why he did this.” Srinivas, along with his friend Krishna Murthy, accompanied the cops to Mumbai after the arrest. Krishna Murthy claimed that the rape threat tweet was an accident. “Ramnagesh had been chatting online after India lost to Pakistan in the T20 World Cup,” he said. “In frustration, he typed an angry message which he did not intend to tweet. At the same time, the phone slipped out of his hand. By the time he tried to do some damage control, the message had already gone viral. Since that day he was living in fear.” He claimed that no one in family knew about tweet until the police knocked on their door on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iitian-behind-rape-tweet-threat-to-cricketers-kid/articleshow/87634963.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Moved by the plight of the adivasis, Ashok Menon, past-president, Rotary club of Panaji-Midtown, and Baylon Gomes of the Hands of Hope Foundation coordinated with a supplier of water storage tanks at Verna and ensured that they were immediately delivered to the site. The two 750L tanks arrived at the settlement at Nirankal, Ponda, on Wednesday evening, much to the joy of the tribals. However, the two tanks only partially resolve the issue, as more still need to be installed to meet the water requirements of the nearly 100 persons living in the settlement. “Thanks to all the individuals and associations for the first response for helping address the issue partly. Hope a long-lasting solution will come from the government, as they have set the target of har ghar jal,” Dr Sachin Tendulkar, agro researcher and social worker, who has been relentlessly pursuing the cause of the Makadmares, said. TOI’s Wednesday report pointed out that with the two water tanks installed by PWD near the settlement five years ago now damaged, the tribals could soon be facing water woes. “I am glad we could be of some small help to the needy,” Menon said.  “President of the club Sunil Mone and secretary Sanjeev Dessai took the initiative to help the Makadmares by providing the water tanks, a proposal that was supported by all the members,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/good-samaritans-donate-2-tanks-to-makadmares/articleshow/87635684.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

As a result, there has been a manifold increase in prices of petroleum products, following which prices of essential commodities have increased too,” Patole said. He said that while there is a steady decline in fuel prices in the international market, in India, they have increased prices by Rs 35 per liter in a year. On the allegations against Fadnavis and Nawab Malik, Patole said since both are senior politicians and hold important positions, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should order a high-level probe into the allegations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-start-week-long-stir-from-nov-14-against-rising-fuel-prices/articleshow/87636149.cms||---

The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB), through the state environment ministry, and the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education entered into an MoU on Wednesday to promote awareness about biodiversity and the importance of preserving the environment to human well-being. “The MoU will see awareness about biodiversity being raised among students from 400 high schools and later on, extended to students of 105 higher secondary schools affiliated to the Goa Board. This will mean at least 1 lakh students will be impacted. These students will later enter the colleges under Goa University and would help in starting a discourse on biodiversity at all these levels, which is very important in this age of global warming and climate change,” environment minister Nilesh Cabral said. He said it is expected that the curriculum will eventually help 191 biodiversity management committees operating at the village panchayat level and 13 operating at the municipal level in their conservation efforts. Besides this, high school and higher secondary school teachers will also be exposed to the curriculum on biodiversity in the process, the environment minister said. “The MoU was the outcome of my resolution as member of the executive council of the Goa Board. The resolution was passed unanimously, but it took nine months for things to materialise as the Board was engaged with the Class X and XII public exam work at the time,” Goa Board member Nandakumar Kamat said. GSBB member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam, state environment secretary Kunal and Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye were present at the signing of the MoU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biodiversity-climate-change-to-be-part-of-class-ix-x-curriculum/articleshow/87635691.cms||---
---||Kochi||TN didn’t consider shift in rain pattern, say experts||Idukki: Even as the state has urged the Supreme Court to reduce the maximum permissible water level in the Mullaperiyar dam, experts have pointed out that Tamil Nadu, which prepared the rule curve for the reservoir in consultation with Central Water Commission (CWC), did so without taking into account India meteorological department’s (IMD) revised rainfall data. They said after the 2018 floods, the state’s rainfall pattern has seen a big shift and one reason for the state to oppose the rule curve was that it was fixed without considering the changes in rainfall behaviour. “If we follow the present rainfall pattern, we can’t allow a rule curve above 136ft. Mullaperiyar has a huge catchment area of 625sq km while its storage capacity is only 12 thousand million cubic feet (tmc). During extremely heavy rainfall the water level in the dam can rise quickly. In the 2018 floods, the catchment area received heavy downpour leading to the sudden opening of all spillway shutters,” said an official with Mullaperiyar dam. “What is important is that the water should not go above 142ft during northeast and southwest monsoons. If the shutters are opened suddenly it will cause extreme damage in downstream areas,” said former Mullaperiyar special cell chairman MK Parameshwaran Nair. “The state has raised an objection before CWC about the issue. Torrential rains in the catchment areas can raise the water level by five or six feet within a day. In 2018, TN released 30,000cusecs of water that led to large-scale damage,” said Nair. The water level in the dam was steady and stood at 138.70ft on Wednesday. Tamil Nadu was drawing 1,867 cusecs of water, at the same level of the inflow. The state opened Vaigai dam on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tn-didnt-consider-shift-in-rain-pattern-say-experts/articleshow/87634994.cms||Sandeep Thomas

To accommodate other homeless labourers, the seven community halls would be used.Suresh Itnal, the commissioner of HDMC, said these community halls were not used for several years and would be used “to shelter the urban homeless labourers”. Two such halls are in Dharwad and five in Hubballi, he said.Ramesh Noolvi, a National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM) official at HDMC, said the halls would be equipped with necessary essential services under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-NULM.The HDMC has prepared a detailed report on the development of community halls, such as strengthening of the rooves, painting and providing basic facilities to the labourers. Itnal said that after approval from the government, the development of the community halls will start and is expected to be over by the end of December.Noolvi added that the livelihood mission would address the concerns of urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security and skills for accessing emerging market opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-plans-shelters-for-homeless-labourers/articleshow/87633154.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Goa||My words ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ saw Goa through many challenges: CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that his phrase ‘bhivpachi garaz na’ (there is no need to fear) — even though widely criticised — helped the state get through difficult times over the past year and a half. “From the time I became CM, there were many challenges before me — from the Covid pandemic to Cyclone Tauktae to floods — but I kept saying just one thing, ‘bhivpachi garaz na’. Yes, there is no need to fear. Many criticised me saying ‘what is the CM saying’. But when I am working as CM of this state, should I tell my colleagues and the people of Goa to keep walking ahead in fear?” Sawant said, speaking at the inaugural of the National Youth Parliament. “That is why I said ‘bhivpachi garaz na’. And so, we kept on overcoming the challenges, from the pandemic to the cyclone to the floods, and we kept providing assistance to the people. And when overcoming these challenges, we saw that Goa was not left behind on any parameter,” said Sawant. Sawant also paid tribute to former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, stating that it was Parrikar who kept providing him opportunities despite the former having little political experience at the time. “If anyone has given encouragement to youth, it is Padma Bhushan awardee Manohar-bhai Parrikar. Many ask me how you reached the position of chief minister. Many do not know the story behind it. When I became an MLA, my father was not an MLA. So many ask me how did you become an MLA then. I started working in the social sector after completing my graduation in 1998. I was working as a Class-I gazetted officer, and in 2007, Manohar-bhai asked me if I would contest an election,” said Sawant. He said that many told him that he was making a mistake by resigning from his stable job, but Parrikar showed belief in his abilities. “Never had a simple MLA become GSIDC chairman. Only CMs had become chairmen of GSIDC. But Manohar-bhai gave me the opportunity to be chairman. In 2017, when I got elected yet again, it was Manohar-bhai Parrikar who gave me the respect and put me in the chair of the legislative assembly speaker at a young age. When Manohar-bhai Parrikar was no more, I was given the opportunity by the party to become the CM though I was young and with little experience,” said Sawant. Taking a jibe at Trinamool Congress, Sawant said that Goa needs no navi sakaal (referring to TMC’s ‘Goa’s new dawn’ slogan). He said the state is already ahead of most states in the country on many parameters. “Goa is pollution-free, we get the purest water supply in the country and our youth are capable of protecting our culture. There is no need for there to be a navi sakaal,” said Sawant. The CM said that his government has ensured that no benefits under state schemes were halted during the pandemic. “While going through the Covid pandemic, cyclone Tauktae and floods, we did not stop benefits under any schemes, in fact, we introduced new schemes for the youth. Even though Goa’s financial position was difficult, we granted Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia to families of those who lost their lives due to Covid,” Sawant said. He said that the work of carrying out recruitment to 80% of government vacancies has started at present. Mopa international airport will also be made operational by August 15, 2022, said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/my-words-bhivpachi-garaz-na-saw-goa-through-many-challenges-sawant/articleshow/87635702.cms||---

The entrance was conducted by National Testing Authority (NTA) and result was expected by October-end. Candidates who applied only for the central university are now in a fix as admissions in other institutes are about to close. “I wanted to study at the central university. Now, I have no choice but to submit fees at LU which is in its last phase of PG admissions,” said Sanjana Agarwal from Kanpur. Another candidate from Ambedkarnagar, Arjun Singh, said, “I had no choice but to submit fee at a private college in my hometown. BBAU was my first priority but entrance results have not been announced. Now, if I make it to BBAU, the fee I have submitted will go waste.” BBAU started the admission process for its UG and PG courses on August 13. NTA had invited applications for university’s 27 bachelor’s courses, 42 master’s courses, one diploma course and seven courses offered at BBAU satellite campus and the entrance test was conducted in September. “The new academic session begins in July but due to the pandemic, the session was delayed. Now, it has been further hit due to delay in completion of the admission process,” a BBAU official said. BBAU admission coordinator Prof Kaman Singh said, “The admission process is in its last phase and the results of entrance test are likely to be declared this week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bbau-entrance-result-late-aspirants-in-a-fix/articleshow/87635698.cms||---

In the last two days alone, four farmers were arrested in Zoz and Kawant and marijuana stock worth over Rs 97 lakh was seized. On Tuesday, Kawant police raided a farm and a house of a farmer identified as Anklesh Rathwa in Kasarvav village. Police found 196kg of marijuana crops grown by Rathwa in the backyard of his house while over 66kg of crops were found from his farm. Rathwa was booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and arrested. In another incident, Zoz police arrested three farmers named Raman Nayka, Shankar Nayka and Sursing Nayka from Mithibor village on November 8. Police said that the trio had grown 4,732 plants of marijuana worth Rs 70.9 lakh in their backyard. “Most of these marijuana growers are found in the interior areas of the district. Preliminary investigation has revealed that these growers sell the stock to dealers from the neighbouring districts,” said superintendent of Chhota Udepur police Dharmendra Sharma. “We are also investigating further about the source of seeds and who others are involved in buying the crops from these farmers,” he added. Another police official said that so far, the farmers have not given any satisfactory answer about who had sold the seeds to them. “We have got their custody from the court on Wednesday so we will be able to unearth some information from them soon,” the police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/farmers-held-for-growing-marijuana/articleshow/87633938.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||‘It’s hard to get ex gratia sans Covid report’||Lucknow: Tragedy struck Swapnil Rastogi in April this year when he lost his 59-year-old father during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Months later, he is trying to claim the Rs 50,000 ex gratia that the government has announced for the families of Covid-19 victims following the Supreme Court directives. However, he is facing a tough time as he does not have documentary proof like RT-PCR or CT scan report, his father’s Aadhaar card or mention of Covid in writing in prescription, even though the death certificate clearly mentions Covid as the cause of death. “The application for claiming ex-gratia requires RT-PCR/antigen/CT scan report as Covid proof. Death certificate with Covid as the cause of death mentioned on it and Aadhaar card details of the deceased are also required. In my father’s case, I do not have test report in writing to prove Covid nor do I have his Aadhaar card, which we have lost,” said Swapnil. He said his father was first admitted to a private hospital in Balaganj when he experienced Covid symptoms. However, instead of getting an RT-PCR test, the facility only got D-Dimer test and X-rays done to diagnose Covid and started treatment on its basis. The facility did not confirm Covid-19 in writing, Swapnil added. “After his condition deteriorated, we admitted him to Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) without an RT-PCR since testing facilities were abysmal during the peak of pandemic. The hospital allotment was done by the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) which was clearly for a Covid hospital and the treatment was undertaken in Covid ward. His death certificate also notes the cause of death as Covid and cardiorespiratory failure,” he said. In the absence of test report and Aadhaar, Swapnil is unable to submit the form though he has death certificate and other proof. Not just Swapnil, many others like him are also facing difficulties as Covid patients in their families could not be tested during the pandemic peak. Tarannum Hasan’s mother-in-law was also one such victim. “We tried everything but could not get her Covid test done when she first showed the signs of the disease. Labs were refusing to take samples from home and she was not in a condition to be taken out of the house. Hospital was also not allotted to her because there was no RT-PCR test. She had all the symptoms of Covid,” said Tarannum. “I read about the ex gratia but we don’t have the required proof to process the claim as my mother-in-law died at home,” she said. “What is the alternative for such people who don’t have test report and Aadhaar details of the deceased? The government should accept other proofs too, especially since testing was not available during the second peak,” added Swapnil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/its-hard-to-get-ex-gratia-sans-covid-report/articleshow/87635743.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court discharges Rakeysh Mehra||Aurangabad: A magisterial court has discharged film director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra from a copyright infringement criminal case initiated by a script writer in 2008. Writer Mustaq Mohsin had named Mehra and film producer Rohinton Screwvala in his complaint, accusing them of using his script titled ‘Inquilab’ for their film ‘Rang De Basanti’, which was released in 2006. Mohsin then claimed that he had discussed the script with Mehra, for developing the film. He also claimed that he gave the entire literature of the film to Mehra.Mohsin was surprised to see the same was used in ‘Rang De Basanti’ film and this, he said, amounted to copyright violation/infringement. Judicial magistrate first class V H Khedkar, however, relied on an earlier order by the Aurangabad sessions court that discharged film producer Screwvala from the case. Mehra had moved his discharge plea before the magistrate soon after the sessions court’s order in Screwvala’s matter. Khedkar observed that the sessions court had allowed Screwvala’s revision plea without “distinguishing the role of accused no.2 (Screwvala) from present accused (Mehra)” and that order had not been challenged in a high court. Hence, the observations made the sessions court were binding on the lower court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-discharges-rakeysh-mehra/articleshow/87636170.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This was the highest daily tally of cases for the state since July 11. The last time the state had crossed the 40-case mark was on July 14, at 41. Experts say this spike could be due to the Diwali festival, but added that one must keep vigil for the next couple of days to ascertain whether this is a sustained trend. In 2020, the state witnessed its first wave after the Diwali festivities. This time around, vaccination coverage may reduce the impact, they added. While daily cases doubled from 20 to 42 in Gujarat, in Ahmedabad there was a four times increase from 4 to 16. This represented a 129-day high in daily cases for Ahmedabad.  The city accounted for 38%, more than a third of the daily cases. In all, municipal corporation areas contributed 28 cases or two-thirds of the state’s cases. Apart from Ahmedabad, the new cases included five each from Surat city and Valsad, four from Vadodara city, two each from Rajkot city, Junagadh and Morbi, and one each from Jamnagar city, Anand, Bharuch, Gir Somnath, Kutch and Tapi. With the discharge of 36 patients, the state’s active cases increased by six to 215. Of these, eight patients are on ventilators, the state health department bulletin said. The state administered 4.09 lakh doses of vaccines, taking the total number of doses administered to 7.28 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/daily-covid-cases-at-122-day-high/articleshow/87635062.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why biomass burning needs to be taken head on||NEW DELHI: Over 630 complaints regarding open biomass burning were addressed by the agencies concerned in the past 12 days. Data compiled by the environment department shows that during the same period, over 1,000 challans were issued to violators for open burning of biomass, garbage and garden or plastic waste. Around 34,486 metric tonnes of biomass/garbage and 10,026 tonnes of plastic waste were collected between October 29 and November 8. As Delhi government begins a campaign against open biomass burning on Thursday, experts said such incidents increased during winter and it was one of the major sources of pollution in the city. A study conducted by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which showed the PM2.5 contribution of various sectors to Delhi’s air in winter 2020, stated that emissions from waste burning contributed 8.7% to Delhi’s PM2.5 between October 15 and November 15, 2020. The share of waste burning rose to 10% from November 15 to December 15, 2020 and 9.2% between December 15 and January 15, 2021. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, CEEW, said, “Our analysis suggests that biomass burning for heating constitutes a significant share of Delhi’s pollution burden between mid-November to mid-January.” “The Graded Response Action Plan already requires RWAs and individual home owners to provide electric heaters to security staff. Efforts should be made to understand why night shelters that could cater to the homeless run at low occupancy during winters,” added Ganguly. Anju Goel, fellow, earth science and climate change, The Energy and Resources Institute, said, “Biomass is used for cooking or for heating. A Teri study conducted in 2016 said 1.2 lakh households in Delhi-NCR used biomass for cooking. The authorities should ensure an adequate supply of cleaner fuels to reduce the use of biomass for cooking.” According to the Decision Support System developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune to forecast the sources of local and regional pollution, the contribution of waste burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was around 2-3% for the next four days. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The authorities should strengthen municipal services with focus on 100% collection, segregation and recycling of waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-biomass-burning-needs-to-be-taken-head-on/articleshow/87635040.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Ahmedabad||Edu dept circular hints at corruption in varsities||Ahmedabad: Gujarat education department’s recent circular that could curtail powers of state universities has created quite a stir with members of the Congress party strongly opposing the decision. Also, questions are being raised about the need to come out with such a circular especially at a time when allegations of rampant corruption and illegal recruitments are being raised at various universities of the state. “Saurashtra University, Sardar Patel University at Vallabh Vidyanagar, M S University, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University and Hemchandracharya University at Patan are under the scanner for various issues including recruitment of faculty members,” said sources in the state government. The education department on November 9 issued a directive for all state universities to seek government approval before hiring faculty or any ad-hoc appointments in the university. Also, the universities have to get government clearance before undertaking any major projects at the campus. Some academicians ask how corruption and scams can be prevented, when chancellors of universities are also appointed on the basis of recommendation and favouritism. Reacting strongly to the decision of the state government to curtail the powers of the vice-chancellors and authorities of the university, Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said the circular is an acknowledgement by state government that the chancellors and syndicate members appointed by the BJP are involved in malpractices and financial irregularities. “If the chancellor is appointed by the ruling BJP government, then why does it not accept responsibility for the financial irregularities, nepotism and scams committed at universities? It is a matter of concern that Gujarat is constantly falling behind in higher education,” said Doshi. Recently, there was an uproar after allegations were levelled against BJP syndicate members and the chancellor being involved in recruitment process for the post of faculty at Saurashtra University in Rajkot. Similarly, there have been allegations of illegal recruitment at M S University for past some years now, said sources. Gujarat University has also recently launched an inquiry into the issue of financial expenditures, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/edu-dept-circular-hints-at-corruption-in-varsities/articleshow/87635058.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court sets aside order barring sale of Vijaypat Singhania's book||MUMBAI: A two-judge bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday set aside an order of a single-judge bench that had last week restrained publishers and distributors of ‘An Incomplete Life’—an autobiography of Vijaypat Singhania, the chairperson emeritus of Raymond Group, from its printing, sale and distribution.A vacation court bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja, granting relief to Pan Macmillan Publishing India Pvt Ltd, observed that the single judge while putting a hold on sale of the book was under an “erroneous impress-ion” of there being an existing stay. The publisher had filed an appeal to challenge the interim November 4 order in a contempt petition filed by Raymond Ltd against Singhania in a pending dispute. The company had alleged that the book was published despite a stay by Thane district court and was also offered for sale through Amazon India. It hence, sought a stay on printing and sale, of both digital and physical copies. Raymond counsel Tushad Cooper had said that the company had filed a civil suit in a Thane court against Singhania and the erstwhile publisher (Penguin Random House) in 2018 and in April 2019, the court had restrained the then publisher from publishing the purported autobiography, pending its appeal in a chequered legal battle that had travelled by then to HC and back to the Thane local court. Staying its printing and sale, the single judge had posted the contempt petition to November 25. But lawyers Siddhesh Bhole and Yakshay Chheda, for Pan Macmillan, said the stay order was “erroneous, perverse and without any jurisdiction” and unless set aside “would set a wrong precedent…” in exceeding contempt jurisdiction. They said Raymond Ltd “indulged in forum shopping” as Pan Macmillan was not a party to any proceedings filed in Thane, which was a ‘pre-publication’ proceeding. Raymond had asserted a right to privacy and its right to confidentiality, alleging both were violated. The publisher said right to privacy “is not available to a corporate person” and the company was invoking “right to confidentiality of information without even identifying or specifying the relevant information that has allegedly been disclosed”. After hearing Bhole, Cooper and for Singhania, advocate Vibhav Krishna, the bench said the, “single judge has passed the impugned order...under an erroneous impression that the district court at Thane has passed the order ...against the erstwhile publisher from publishing the book...was to continue until the pendency of the appeal filed by (Raymond)…” Vacation judge Justice Madhav Jamdar is now scheduled to hear the contempt plea afresh on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-sets-aside-order-barring-sale-of-singhania-book/articleshow/87635748.cms||Swati Deshpande

Apart from the staff, visitors not wearing maks will also be penalized. The civic administration has already started a drive against erring residents who are found without masks in public. During the last week, the NMC slapped a fine of Rs 200 each to over 150 erring city residents who were found without masks. “There has been a drop in new Covid cases in the city during the last three-four months, but there is still a possibility of the third wave if people do not follow the Covid norms. We want people to follow Covid safety protocols like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and using sanitizers,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-fine-staff-not-wearing-masks/articleshow/87633210.cms||Tushar Pawar

The HSP fined 6,255 heavy vehicles Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 each for lane-cutting and 69,000 motorists—mainly car and light commercial vehicle drivers—for speeding. Lane-cutting invites a fine of Rs 500, but the HSP tacked on a charge of rash driving as drivers often cut lanes without a signal. The extra charge attracts a fine of Rs 500, HSP officials said. The drive, held from August to October, focused on enforcing lane discipline and punishing errant drivers on the 40km stretch between Kiwale and Amrutanjan bridge.An official from Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which controls the Expressway, said 55,000-60,000 vehicles use it daily, 55% of which are light vehicles. “The number of heavy vehicles fined for lane-cutting may appear small in the overall context of those using the Expressway daily, but these are often responsible for causing accidents or endangering the lives of others as they move from one lane to another without giving any signal or observing lane discipline,” said Sanjay Jadhav, Pune HSP’s superintendent of police. Jadhav said it was not possible for HSP to post personnel throughout the high-speed corridor but said there will be sustained action against errant drivers. Heavy vehicles are supposed to drive on the third—or left — lane of the Expressway and cannot move to the middle or the first lane. However, drivers often flout this norm. Following the drive, HSP has stepped up monitoring by its mobile teams at Khandala and Wadgaon, and announcements are being made through the PA system at toll plazas, said Jadhav. Light and heavy vehicles must adhere to a speed limit of 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively. Violation attracts a fine of Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-3-months-6k-drivers-fined-rs-500-to-rs-1k-each-for-cutting-e-way-lanes/articleshow/87636194.cms||---

Four wards under Thiruvallom zone for which the list was published on Monday also show a set of individuals and institutions; private schools, government schools, hotels and resorts which had skipped payment of property tax continuously for five years. Arrears ranging between Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh are being reported for some of the resorts coming under the Thiruvallom zone and the list also brings to light default in tax payment by some private schools. Considering the fact that an individual or an institution failing to pay tax for the first half of 2021-22 would still be included in the defaulters’ list, the data released by the Thiruvallam zonal office shows that major defaulters have failed to pay the tax dating from 2016-17. Three years ago, the revenue wing had initiated a campaign to pick defaulters among private educational institutions in the city with regard to tax dues. According to a report prepared by the corporation's revenue wing, about 12 prominent city schools then owed the city corporation tax dues worth Rs 4 crores. The report was submitted following the decision of the finance standing committee to collect dues from educational institutions, especially the private schools in the city. The revenue wing has, however, been battling a few technical hassles in collection of tax from the private schools in the city. According to corporation officials, until 2011, the schools were assessed on a common slab like non-residential buildings. A circular issued in the year 2012 empowered civic bodies to determine separate tax for educational institutions. Accordingly the council had approved Rs 20 per sq.m as tax for educational institutions in the city. However, the circular also added that the tax determined for educational institutions before January, 13, 2011 be exempted and in case tax had been determined based on annual rental value before January, 14, 2011 and if the tax had been paid, this shall be refunded or adjusted in future payments. The revenue wing had earlier tabulated data on assessment of private schools in the city and to find out other major defaulters in the city. In the coming days, defaulters in other wards among private schools and institutions will also come to the forefront. The corporation had prepared a list in 2019 focusing on major tax defaulters; however, the attempts to levy tax in a timely manner had not been fruitful. The list published by the Thiruvallam zone also includes some government schools among the defaulters list. The presence of government institutions in the defaulters’ list is likely to increase as the list from other wards will be published in the coming days once the data updation process is finished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/updated-tax-data-list-lays-bare-habitual-defaulters/articleshow/87613700.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Patel, who has cleared NEET PG, the results of which were declared one and a half month ago, says he had to let go of a job offer from a private hospital that wanted him to join as a resident doctor. There are about 2,200 PG medical seats in the state that are yet to be allotted as the admissions are running about six months behind schedule due to multiple reasons. The MBBS graduates who join PG medical courses serve as resident doctors at medical college hospitals. This year about 2,200 doctors are yet to join duty as the admission process is not completed so far. The NEET PG exams are usually held in April but they got delayed till August this year due to Coronavirus pandemic. “Last year, the candidates had joined first-year of PG programme in the month of May. These students have finished their first-year studies and moved on to the next year. As a result, about 2,200 doctors who are all ready to join the PG courses and serve in hospitals, cannot do so as the admission process is stuck,” according to a medical faculty in one of the government-run colleges in the state. The admission committee on Wednesday announced that the online registration process for admissions to MD, MS programmes will start from November 12. “The admission process is stuck due to an ongoing case in the Supreme Court regarding admission for economically weaker section (EWS) category. Also, the admissions at the state level can only be held once two rounds of admissions are completed under All India Quota,” said an academic expert from the medical field. Online registration for NEET PG from November 12 The Admission Committee for Professional Postgraduate Medical Educational Courses (ACPPGMEC) on Wednesday announced that the online registration for admissions to MD and MS programmes will be held from November 12 to November 16. Candidates who have cleared NEET PG-2021 are eligible to apply for admissions. On Wednesday, instructions were given by video-conferencing, regarding document verification process and submission of documents. Though the committee announced the date for online registration, experts said that the admissions cannot start immediately due to a case in the Supreme Court in connection with admission to PG medical for EWS category. Also, the admissions at the state-level can only be held once two rounds are completed under all-India quota, according to an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pg-admission-delay-2200-mbbs-doctors-kept-in-limbo/articleshow/87635053.cms||---
---||Delhi||In 10 days of November, farm fire count twice the October burden||New Delhi: The number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana was recorded at 20,723 till October 31, but around 41,500 were observed in the first 10 days of November, according to data from satellite imagery compiled by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). Track the pollution level in your cityThe cumulative count of farm fires of Haryana between September 1 and November 10 this year was higher than 2020 and 2019. Experts said the fire counts were likely to surpass last year’s figure in Punjab soon. Stubble burning, which usually picks up by October-end, got deferred this year due to rain. The fires were now rising and the peak season had got slightly shifted to the second week of November. Gufran Beig, founder project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, said, “The fire counts in November (11 days) are 42,099, which is the highest in the past four years during this period. However, farm fires were lowest in October in 2021 in the past four years.” SAFAR data showed 5,317 stubble burning counts on Wednesday, but in 2020 it was around 2,000. Officials said stubble burning numbers fluctuate due to the multiplicity of ways to measure satellite data. In Haryana, 7,232 cases of active paddy burning residue was recorded between September 1 and November 10. It was higher than the last two years — 4,542 farm fires in 2020 and 5,410 in 2019. Punjab recorded 55,076 farm fires from September 1 to November 10 against 65,900 last year. However, only 39,290 farm fires were observed in Punjab in 2019. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences, Universities Space Research Association, Nasa, said, “If the same burning rate continues for two-three days, Punjab will surpass last year’s fire counts.” LS Kurinji, programme associate, CEEW, said, “The cumulative number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana more than tripled from 20,723 until October 31 to 62,308 in the first 10 days of November. The shift in trend was attributable to the delayed harvest due to delayed monsoon withdrawal. With winds blowing from the northwest, farm fires are forecast to intensify the pollution levels in Delhi and surrounding areas. Taking a cue from historical trends, we can expect a decrease in farm fires in the coming days.” Earlier this season, fires were predominantly observed in the northwestern districts, such as Amritsar and Tarn Taran in Punjab. But in the last few weeks, fires progressed over the southern districts, including Sangrur, Patiala, Firozpur, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Faridkot and Bhatinda. In Haryana, fires were mostly seen in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Jind and Fatehabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-10-days-of-november-farm-fire-count-twice-the-october-burden/articleshow/87654836.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The property tax defaulters with dues over Rs 50,000 and water tax defaulters with dues over Rs 25,000 are being targeted under this initiative. “In the last 15 days, NMC squads have visited the houses of 150 water tax defaulters and snapped water connections of 30 defaulters and collected partly and fully tax payment amounting to Rs 90 lakh from 120 water tax defaulters,” said NMC officials. Apart from water tax defaulters, NMC squads have also started visiting the houses of property tax defaulters after Diwali. During the last three to four days, they have visited the houses of 20 tax defaulters urging them to clear their dues at the earliest or face action like confiscation of properties. The revenue of the civic body through property and water taxes have been badly affected due to the pandemic. The NMC administration has introduced an amnesty scheme for the property tax defaulters, but the property tax collection had not yet increased. NMC had set a property tax collection target of Rs 160 crore for the current financial year, but it could collect only Rs 86 crore so far. The officials said warrants will be issued to the big property tax defaulters if they avoid paying their dues during their visit to the homes NMC had set the water tax collection target of Rs 150 crore for the current fiscal, which includes Rs 60 crore tax of the current financial year and the remaining Rs 90 crore are the dues pending for the past few years. Hence, the NMC administration has decided to visit the houses of big water tax defaulters and snap their water connections if they avoid paying tax dues.  Meanwhile, there will be no water supply in ward no 3 in the Panchavati division of Nashik city on Friday as the water supply department of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) will be undertaking repair work at the major water supply lines in the area. Water will be supplied with low-pressure the next day on Saturday. By Sunday, the water supply will be restored to normalcy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-drive-to-visit-homes-of-big-tax-defaulters-bears-fruit/articleshow/87633219.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Kochi||Rehabilitation of dams on with World Bank funds||Kochi: While Mullaperiyar continues to be a controversial issue, many Indian states are carrying out dam rehabilitation (strengthening) projects with the help of the World Bank. Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand are the states that are currently using the World Bank funds for this purpose. The World Bank-funded dam rehabilitation and improvement project (DRIP) includes investments in selected 223 dams in six states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Uttarakhand), in addition to dams managed by the Damodar Valley Corporation in Jharkhand. The interventions are being implemented by 10 implementing agencies: central water commission (CWC) under the ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation (MoWR, RD&GR); Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC); Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (UJVNL); Odisha water resources department; Tamil Nadu water resources department; Tamil Nadu generation and distribution corporation (TANGEDCO); Karnataka water resources development organization; Madhya Pradesh water resources department; Kerala water resources department; and Kerala state electricity board. According to the World Bank report on dam rehabilitation, many dams are ageing (605 dams are over 50 years old and another 3,095 dams are over 25 years old) and exhibit various structural deficiencies and shortcomings in operation and monitoring facilities. “In most states, budget allocations for dam operations and maintenance are part of overall irrigation system maintenance budgets, which are typically decided based on irrigated area rather than on preventative and scheduled,” it said. “Over the last 65 years, India has invested heavily in infrastructure to store surface runoff in reservoirs formed by large, medium, and small dams with associated appurtenances. According to the national register for large dam (NRLD 2018), there were about 5,264 completed large dams in India, and another 437 under construction. The total storage capacity of these dams is about 304 billion cubic metres,” said the report. “As a result of population growth and development in downstream areas of dams, existing flood protection measures are often below acceptable standards and pose serious risks. Additionally, in most cases there has been minimal investment in operations and maintenance of structures since dam commissioning. High safety standards for large dams are imperative to prevent failure, which may cause devastating damage to environment and property, leading to economic hardship, and, in extreme cases, loss of life. An ever-increasing number of people are living and working in areas that would face sudden and severe flooding in the event of a dam failure,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rehabilitation-of-dams-on-with-world-bank-funds/articleshow/87635066.cms||Shenoy Karun

Snake rescuer Nitesh Jadhav said a farmer, Deepak Hiwarale, had contacted him after spotting the snakes in his farm. “After reaching the spot, we found a male and a female Indian rock pythons in close proximity to each other. The reptiles might have strayed into the human areas after getting attracted to each other,” Jadhav said. The female is nearly 7.5 feet in length, while the male is 5.6 feet long. They were rescued by Jadhav and his team comprising Sharad Dabhade, Ankush Rajput, Nitin Chauhan, Mangesh Dudhane and Amol Pattekar. “Even if non-venomous, Indian rock pythons are powerful snakes known for their nasty bites. We required a group of experts to overpower both the snakes during the resuce,” Jadhav said. The Indian rock python usually breeds on the face of Monsoon season after the female releases a special hormone to attract a mating partner. Listed as ‘Near threatened’ under IUCN Red List, Indian rock python is witnessing decline in populatio.due to various reasons. “Like other snakes and reptiles, Indian rock python plays a crucial role in the foodchain. The reptile feeds on small mammals, birds and other reptiles. Large rodents who are a menace to the farms are also part of the pythons diet. Therefore, the creature is also helpful for the farmers,” honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-pair-of-indian-rock-pythons-rescued-released/articleshow/87633261.cms||---
---||Kochi||Western Ghats destruction noted since 1866||KOCHI: As early as 1866, the famous British geographer and explorer Sir Clements Robert Markham had noted the environmental impact of the widespread practice of developing plantations on the Western Ghats of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Perhaps his account could be one of the earliest critical documentation on the effects of the destruction of nature in Kerala. “One obvious consequence of the destruction of forests is an increased rapidity of surface-drainage, giving rise to sudden and destructive floods at the outlet on the plains — The floods caused by the monsoon rains are yearly increasing in size and violence,” wrote Markham, who was then the secretary of Royal Geographical Society. “The destruction of forests has been one of the chief agents in effecting changes in the earth's surface, and the best methods of counteracting evils which may be caused by these extensive clearances is one of the most important questions that occupy the attention of physical geographers. This agency is now at work in the Western Ghats of India, those rich and beautiful mountain-districts forming the backbone of the Indian peninsula, and containing the sources of a water-supply, on which the prosperity - indeed, the very existence - of millions depends,” Markham wrote in his report titled “On the Effects of the Destruction of Forests in the Western Ghats of India on Water-Supply”. Markham notes that coffee planting had commenced in Wayanad in about 1840. “Now there are 192 coffee estates, of which 9,865 acres belong to Europeans, and 4,748 to natives, actually planted,” he noted. He had crossed Periyar in the high ranges of Idukki by foot in December 1865. While crossing the river, he noted: “Although this was nearly the lowest season, the river was 30 yards across, and we found by the marks that during the monsoon it rises 8 feet higher. The whole of this immense volume of water now runs to waste in the Cochin backwater. But there has long been a project to build a dam across, at a point 13 miles south of where we crossed, and to make a cutting, so as to throw the river into the Madura district”. “The settlement of planters on the hills has given rise to wide-spread destruction of the primeval forest. The planters are occupied chiefly in the cultivation of coffee, to which have been recently added tea, and the quinine-yielding cinchona of South America. These three products give rise to the felling and clearing of forests, in the formation of plantations,” Markham noted. He gives the extent of the destruction as 16,000 acres in Wayanad, 600 acres in Anamalais, 1,200 acres in Nelliampathy, 625 acres in Peermade - altogether little short of 60,000 acres, including the Coorg side too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/western-ghats-destruction-noted-since-1866/articleshow/87635130.cms||Shenoy Karun

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, “The season’s first smog episode has been triggered by the combined effect of unfavourable weather conditions (cool and calm winds and inversion), stubble burning and firecrackers. Though the seasonal smog is intense, the average daily contribution of smoke from farm fires from the middle of October to November 8 has been the lowest in the last four years. Its contribution peaked and reached 48% on November 7. It is still elevated.” The analysis said average intensity of the smog so far was 329 ug/m3 per day, which was lower than 2020 by 7% and 2019 by 3%. It was more intense than the 2018 smog by about 9%. “Lingering on of smog for a longer duration this year despite relatively windier local conditions might be due to the lack of pollution control measures,” it added. Ozone levels continued to breach the standards at hotspots even during the peak smog episodes. Levels were higher pre- and post-peak smog days. CO was also found to be exceeding the standard. SO2 levels mimicked the trend of PM2.5, but didn’t breach the standard. NO2 bucked the trend and was seen to drop in concentrations when PM2.5 peaked. Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager, Urban Lab, CSE, said, “While very high concentrations of PM2.5 have hogged attention, the levels of gases — ozone, CO or NO2 — have remained elevated during this smog episode. Also, the ratio of SO2 to NO2 increased on Diwali night, indicating increased pollution load from firecrackers. The PM2.5 concentration on Diwali night (8pm to 8am) was the most intense since 2017.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/severe-smog-in-delhi-ncr-may-last-2-more-days/articleshow/87635093.cms||---

Due to work from home and prolonged time spent on digital devices including mobile phones, laptops, desktops and tablets over the past one and a half years, several young professionals are lining up outside offices of physiotherapists in the city. “In majority of the cases, the root cause of their pain — be it stiff upper back, neck pain, tingling in forearms or fingers, or difficulty in sitting straight – lies in their work posture,” said Dr Nehal Shah, principal of SBB College of Physiotherapy. “In contrast to working at an office at a workstation, at home, professionals used improper chair, sofa, dining table, etc. to work on their devices. Prolonged practice in such an environment affected their health.” Two recent works from the college highlighted the impact of work environment and impact of bad posture on various joints. A work by Yoginakumari Rathva, a PG student, along with lecturer Payal Gahlot studied the workplace musculoskeletal discomfort (WMSD) with respect to the office objects they interacted with. Workstation specifics (chair, height, armrest and back support), computer (monitor, mouse, keyboard), telephone use and duration of spending time in each posture were taken into consideration. ROSA scale (1 for lowest risk and 8+ for highest risk) was applied to the individuals. All participants were between 25 and 50 years of age. “We found that 49% of the respondents were working for 8-9 hours on a computer and 18% for 10 hours and more. Out of total, 54% had low to moderate and 46% had high to very high risk of WMSD,” said Gahlot. “Chair and phone were found to be two major items which resulted in WMSD. We recommended the proper height of the chair and not to use the phone by holding it between cheek and shoulder.” ‘Neck and upper back pain most common’A study, conducted by Dr Nehal Shah and PG student Virti Shah got people to submit digital questionnaires on work-from-home posture along with their photographs. Shah said that neck and upper back pain were found to be prevalent in 35% of the respondents each. “About 28% complained of shoulder pain, 20% upper arm pain, 15% forearm pain, 10% wrist pain, and 15% each hip pain and knee pain. About 80% of respondents used laptops, and 20% desktops. Two-thirds of the participants used computers for over six hours a day,” said Virti Shah. “About 40% of the participants said that the pain, if persisted, interferes in their work.” Dr Shah said that more importantly, the study highlighted that about 20% had no pain but their posture was wrong. “They would often sit in the same wrong posture for long, which can cause damage first to muscles – resulting in pain, inflammation, tearing or stiffness – and later to bones. Out of those, about 27% were found to be at risk of developing complications,” she said, adding that it’s the reason many companies are now hiring ergonomists to assess the workplace environment and suggest changes to reduce workplace injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nail-that-wfh-posture/articleshow/87635102.cms||Parth Shastri

He was critical on August 3, 2015 when he got a new lease on life after a 42-year-old brain dead woman’s family agreed to donate her heart For a year thereafter, Anwar didn’t step out and had to stay put in a second flat that had been leased by his family for the period of his recovery. Unfortunately for him, his first girlfriend who was immensely supportive during his transplant, gave in to her family pressure and got married elsewhere. After that, Anwar’s family members started looking for a match for him, but were dejected as many families rejected his proposal on hearing about the transplant. “Many people believe a heart transplant patient cannot survive long, but I would like to tell such people to change their perception,” he said. While heart transplants are relatively new in India and Mumbai, they are routine in the West with most patients enjoying a long survival. The parents of his bride-to-be, Shazia, agreed to the alliance only after they met him and put him through a long interrogation. “Shazia’s family visited me at my father’s scrapyard while we were working and also saw me doing workouts at the gymnasium before they gained some confidence about my fitness,” said Anwar. Anwar added, “I have to forget my past and start afresh. I would also like to appeal to others who have gone through a heart transplant to enjoy life without fear.” Anwar has completed his graduation and plans to take up a job in the IT industry. On November 30, Anwar wants the entire transplant team, including transplant surgeon Anvay Mulay, to be present at the wedding and shower their blessings on him and Shazia. It will be a double wedding in the family as Anwar’s elder brother, Shoeb, too, will wed on the same day. Anwar’s parents are ecstatic that he is going to get married and start a new life. His father, Jameel Khan, told TOI, “I don’t have words to express my happiness at this moment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/want-to-show-heart-transplant-patient-can-live-long-in-mumbai/articleshow/87635778.cms||Pradeep Gupta

---||Aurangabad||Authorities remain mute spectators as tourists visiting Ajanta Caves suffer||Aurangabad: As the scores of tourists visiting the Ajanta Caves have been hit by the ongoing MSRTC strike, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and other authorities continue to remain mute spectators to the hardships faced by the visitors. While the shuttle bus service on the 4 km route between Fardapur T-point and Ajanta Caves continues to be suspended due to the strike, several tourists complained that local bullock cart owners are charging exorbitant fares. “We have come to see Ajanta Caves from Rajasthan. As buses are not plying up to the caves, bullock cart owners are asking us to pay Rs 1,600 per trip, which is very high. We cannot reach the site by walking,” said a tourist. The Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation, a forum of different stakeholders from the local tourism and hospitality industry, has accused the MTDC of acting irresponsibly by not protecting the interest of tourists. “It is painful to see that MTDC and other authorities are not making alternative arrangements for tourists. Many people have no option other than to travel from Fardapur on bullock carts by paying a huge amount or walking to the destination. Children and elderly are among the worst hit,” foundation president Jaswant Singh said. “Unfortunately, though the MTDC has a regional office in Aurangabad, permanent employees have not been stationed here. The staff that is present here is not bothered about the ground realities. They specifically said that MTDC’s role is only to look after the resorts and nothing else.” In a letter addressed to Aaditya Thackeray, Maharashtra tourism minister, the stakeholders have demanded immediate official intervention to end the tourists' ordeal. MTDC regional manager Moushani Kose said, a letter has been sent to the district administration seeking the arrangement of private buses to reach Ajanta Caves from the Fardapur t-point. “We do not have power to start an alternative shuttle bus service. The SDM–level official has been requested to make the necessary arrangements,” she said. As per the official data, a total of 10,645 Indian and 53 foreign tourists visited Ajanta Caves in October. The number has reached 9,748 (9,675 Indian, 73 foreigners) between November 1 to 8 during Diwali vacations. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached out for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/authorities-remain-mute-spectators-as-tourists-visiting-ajanta-caves-suffer/articleshow/87633313.cms||Prasad Joshi

Hence, by calling this meeting as soon as possible, I hope the right measures will be taken to control the increasing pollution,” Rai said. Conducting a surprise inspection at Ghazipur landfill in east Delhi, Rai added that he had directed the civic body to present an action plan for a full-proof fire control mechanism to avoid future instances of fires at landfill. He said the current progress of landfill disposal was poor and impractical and the municipal corporation was severely lacking in its work. Marking the beginning of anti-burning campaign, Rai said, “Today we have carried out a thorough inspection to understand how to avoid instances of fire in the future. Starting Thursday, day and night patrolling and inspections will be conducted throughout Delhi in the various localities under this anti-burning campaign. The assigned teams will ensure the instances of open fires and waste burning are attended to, doused, and the pollution levels in Delhi are brought down.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-writes-to-centre-again-seeks-meet/articleshow/87654874.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court acquits two businessmen of attacking bus driver in Chembur||Mumbai: Observing that their false implication was evident, a sessions court acquitted two city businessmen accused of attacking a BEST driver after a stationary van, purported to be theirs, was rammed into at Chembur in 2012.Acquitting Amit Koli (44) and Manoj Vaiti (33), judge B V Wagh said, “There is no independent witness to support the prosecution in the light of a self-interested version of the informant (BEST driver). In view of contradictory evidence, possibility of false implication of accused is evident. The accused deserves to be given the benefit of the doubt.” The court said it was not proved that the van belonged to the duo. The prosecution said on December 17, 2012, Sahebrao Nawale was driving the bus from Navi Mumbai to Kurla depot. At 11.45am, when it was near a stop in Chembur Camp, a rickshaw came from the left of the bus and dashed the van parked there. The accused allegedly abused the bus driver. They allegedly caught hold of his collar, manhandled and threatened to get him sacked. The BEST driver reportedly tried to tell them that it was not his mistake, but they did not pay heed. Police came to the spot after a commuter called them and the accused were arrested. The driver was taken to hospital. The accused were booked under IPC sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from duty). Among the witnesses were the driver, conductor, ticket checker, investigating officer and doctor who examined the bus driver. The court noted that there was discrepancy in evidence of the bus driver and conductor on the role of the accused. The court said while the driver claimed the accused caught hold of his collar, manhandled and threatened him, the conductor said they had beaten him. “Thus, the vital anomaly crept in evidence of the witnesses is of great concern, which affects the core of prosecution,” the court said.

The survey covered over 1,000 Indian respondents and was carried out in the third quarter of 2021. It found 73% respondents are looking at an expanded definition of “business travel”—from travelling for business to leisure while working remotely. The company added 87% said they now plan to work while travelling or living elsewhere while 48% see travel as an integrated part of their life. “As travel restrictions in India loosen, new research demonstrates a shift towards an increased demand for flexible travel, nearby stays, and longer trips that allow guests to combine work and leisure and ultimately, to live anywhere,” it said. “A trend prevalent since the beginning of the pandemic, travel within 300km of home continues to drive demand for Indian travellers, with 42% of respondents saying that they would continue to look at nearby stays,” said Airbnb, the company that commissioned the survey. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-blended-leisure-work-travel-is-a-key-trend/articleshow/87635804.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Don’t drag defence forces into Char Dham rd project’||Dehradun: At the Supreme Court’s hearing on the all-weather Char Dham road project, whose hearing is to be continued on Thursday, locals and environmentalists have expressed dismay at the dragging of defence forcesinto a “tourism-oriented” project. They say they wish to have “only the existing road to be broadened scientifically, and that, too, in an environment-friendly” way. “The all-weather road project was planned and executed with the vision to give movement freedom to tourists visiting Uttarakhand. It was never launched as an ‘all-weather defence road’ to facilitate movement of our forces,” said Sushila Bhandari, an environmentalist from Rudraprayag. Speaking to TOI, local activists said that the government first needs to save the Himalayas, which will in turn shield it from enemies. “Broaden roads only up to 7m with 1.5m footpath on both sides, which can protect Himalayas rather than attempting and experimenting broad roads on fragile Himalayas, which is leading to endless landslides and rock felling,” said Suresh Bhai, a native of Uttarkashi and founder of Rakshasutra Andolan of Uttarakhand.  "The case is not defence versus environment. The issue is that excessive road widening needs vertical cuts which destabilises the slopes and results in landslides. Chronic landslides on all the defence-related roads are detrimental to national security," said environmentalist Mallika Bhanot. Locals are of the view that the state doesn’t have space for such broad roads andtherefore, forceful construction on the pretext of defence requirement would cost both locals and forces dear. “We had asked for hospitals, good government schools, jobs for our local youth, which never happened in 61 years since we got the road in 1960. We never wanted a broad road, all we had asked for was better facilities and good roads,” added Matwal. The 889-km all-weather Char Dham road was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for boosting tourism in the state by connecting all the four Chr Dham shrines – Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. Meanwhile fake photographs of the members of the NGO, Citizens for Green Doon, complainant in the all-weather case had been trending on Twitter with incorrect name of their lawyer and morphed photos of its members, against which a police complainant was filed by the NGO in Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dont-drag-defence-forces-into-char-dham-rd-project/articleshow/87634243.cms||Shivani Azad

Kushal Garg and Isha Jain scored 700 out of 720. Congratulating the students, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Wow! Sooo many students from Delhi govt schools have qualified NEET. Unimaginable till a few years back. I congratulate students, their parents, and teachers. Together, u have shown that “It is possible”.” (sic) Many of the students who have cleared the medical entrance test are from humble backgrounds. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted, “History created by a Delhi govt school student Kushal Garg. He has secured 700 marks out of 720. All India Rank 165, secured seat at AIIMS. Father 10th pass, carpenter. Mother 12th pass, housewife.” He further stated, “Another Delhi Govt school student Isha Jain, from Surajmal Vihar school, has also secured 700/720 marks in NEET, AIR 156, and secured a seat in AIIMS. Congratulations to Ishika. Her father (12th pass) runs a stationery shop while her mother (10th pass) is a housewife.” Both these students are from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV). Garg is from Kishanganj, while Jain is from Surajmal Vihar. The two students are not sure about getting into AIIMS, but they are confident of securing a seat at Maulana Azad Medical College. This was their second attempt at clearing the exam. Both dropped a year and studied for the entrance test. Last year, 569 Delhi government school students had cleared the exam. Of them, around 10% had scored the necessary cutoff for admission in government colleges under the general category. Also, 18 of them had scored 580 and above in 2020. There are around 1,100 seats in government medical colleges in Delhi. “I had got free coaching from Dakshini Foundation after clearing their qualifying exam. I was expecting to get around 680 marks, but 700 is a surprise for me,” said Garg, a resident of Shastri Nagar. Jain said, “If had taken admission last year, I would have had to go out of Delhi and hence, I thought I should try again. I enrolled for a coaching but it was fully online due to the Covid-induced lockdown. I studied for five to six hours a day as there was nothing else to do.” She has scored 360 out of 360 in the Biology paper. Last year, her total score was 559. While 51 students from a Delhi government school in Yamuna Vihar have qualified the NEET, 28 of the successful candidates are from a government school in Paschim Vihar. Sixteen students from IP Extension school, 15 each from Loni Road and Molarband schools and 14 from a Delhi government school in Rohini have qualified the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/496-students-from-delhi-govt-schools-clear-neet-two-score-700-out-of-720/articleshow/87635118.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||My responsibility to clean Yamuna, will do so: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel may soon become cheaper in the capital with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing on Wednesday that Delhi government would reduce the value added tax on fuel. After the Centre cut excise on petrol and diesel, several states complemented this by reducing VAT. Speaking at the Times Now Summit 2021, Kejriwal also acknowledged the raging politics over the pollution of the Yamuna river and conceded that the buck stopped with him. He said the AAP government would clean the river over the next five years. While announcing his government’s intention to reduce VAT, Kejriwal indirectly hit out at the Centre for what he described as “a minor decrease in fuel prices” after such a huge rise in prices over a long period. Asked about the Yamuna’s toxic and frothy water and his promise to clean the river, Kejriwal countered, “The problem has been created over 70 years. It cannot be solved in a few days. I will not pass the buck to other states. It is my responsibility to clean the Yamuna and I will do it.” Kejriwal also blamed harvest stubble burning for the air pollution. “Delhi is not to blame for air pollution. Throughout the year the air quality index remains below 100, and the air starts deteriorating only around October 10 because of stubble burning in neighbouring states,” the CM said. “No farmer wants to burn the harvest remains, but only the government can provide a solution to them. With Pusa Institute, we developed a cheap compound that decomposes the stubble. If Delhi government could have it sprayed for free, why can’t the Punjab government?” Kejriwal rued that his efforts to convince the governments of the neighbouring states and the Centre to direct the use of the decomposer hadn’t been successful. “Stubble is currently a liability when it can turn into gold, be used to generate power, coal, cardboard, CNG. Why can’t we open factories to consume stubble?” asked the CM. The AAP leader also strongly defended his image of a cribber during the oxygen crisis at the peak of the second Covid wave. Kejriwal said the AAP government managed to resolve the problem only by making a hue and cry over it. “Even the mother does not feed a baby that does not cry,” Kejriwal said, blaming the Centre for the oxygen scarcity across the country. “Delhi has huge potential, as does India,” Kejriwal concluded, listing garbage management, water supply and Yamuna cleaning as focus areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-cut-vat-on-fuel-cm/articleshow/87635138.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Aurangabad||Court discharges film’s director in ‘Rang De Basanti’ copyright case||Aurangabad: A magisterial court here has discharged film director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra from a copyright infringement criminal case initiated by a script writer in 2008. Writer Mustaq Mohsin had named Mehra and film producer Rohinton Screwvala in his complaint, accusing them of using his script titled `Inquilab’ for their film ‘Rang De Basanti’, which was released in 2006. Mohsin had claimed that he had discussed the script with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, for developing the film, at a place called ABC Ltd office, and said that he gave the entire literature of the film to Mehra, who had gone through the same. Later, he (Mohsin) was surprised to see the same was used in ‘Rang De Basanti’ film and this amounted to copyright violation/infringement, Mohsin claimed. Judicial magistrate first class VH Khedkar, however, relied on an earlier order by the Aurangabad sessions court that discharged the film’s producer Screwvala from the same case. The sessions court, while setting aside a chief judicial magistrate’s issue process order against Screwvala, had observed, the “criminal proceeding itself was not tenable as the story (Inquilab) was not registered and there was no prima facie material to prove the offenses punishable under the Copyright Act.” Mehra had moved his discharge plea before the magistrate soon after the sessions court’s order in Screwvala’s matter. Khedkar observed that the sessions court had allowed Screwvala’s revision plea without “distinguishing the role of accused no.2 (Screwvala) from present accused (Mehra)” and that order had not been challenged in a high court. Hence, the observations made the sessions court were binding on the lower court. The magistrate cited the sessions court’s observation that the present criminal proceeding itself was not tenable as the story was not registered and there was no material to issue process for the offence punishable under Section 51, 63 and 65 of the Copyright Act. “In such circumstance, if the charge is framed, it will be groundless charge. Therefore, it is proper to discharge accused No. 2 (Mehra) vide Section 245(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” the magistrate said. When contacted, Mohsin told TOI that he was out of station and will take a call on exercising his further legal remedies once he returns to Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/court-discharges-films-director-in-rang-de-basanti-copyright-case/articleshow/87633329.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While addressing the special council meeting held in October Mayor Arya Rajendran said that data updation of 4.5 lakh tax assessments would be completed within a month following which the adalat would be held. The corporation has also decided to offer a platform for residents to raise complaints online if they find irregularities in tax dues which are being published for each ward. In case of irregularity or cases where additional amount has been levied, the corporation will facilitate adjustment of the amount for upcoming fiscals or repayment based on request filed by the resident. While the list is being published for each ward, the officials are not certain of an error free list mainly because of inaccuracies in the basic data being handled by the corporation. The adalat will be held from November 22 to December 17 here covering all zonal offices and the main office. Adalats will be held on four days for the main office. Mayor Arya Rajendran had earlier said that after the posting and adalat, all the complaints regarding tax payment will be resolved. Earlier BJP Parliamentary party leader M R Gopan cited his own example to highlight the lapses in data updation. He said that his payment of around Rs 20,000 as tax was yet to be reflected on the website. The mayor responded to his statement and said that as soon as the complaint was received, the updation was completed. M R Gopan however said that the mayor was setting a wrong precedent by expecting all those with complaints to turn up to the office so that discrepancies in tax payment could be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-conduct-tax-adalat-from-november-22/articleshow/87613803.cms||---

For medal winners from Uttar Pradesh, the state government has announced Rs 6 crore for gold, Rs 4 crore from silver and Rs 2 crore for bronze. Medallists from other states will get Rs 2 crore for gold, Rs 1.5 crore for silver and Rs 1 crore for bronze. Two UP players, Suhas LY (para-badminton) and Pravin Kumar (para-jumping), bagged silver in Paralympics and will get Rs 4 crore each. Remaining six participants from Uttar Pradesh – Varun Singh Bhati of Gautam Budh Nagar (para-athletics), Ajit Singh of Etawah (para-athletics), Deepender Singh of Sambhal (para-shooting), Akash of Baghpat (para-shooting), Vivek Chikara of Meerut (para-archery), and Jyoti of Muzaffarnagar (para-archery) – will receive Rs 25 lakh each. Total 17 medallists from across the country, including two from UP, will receive the total prize money of Rs 31 crore. Director, sports, RP Singh said specially-abled players from all the districts, coaches and representatives of various sports associations had been invited to attend the felicitation function. Unlike the function organised at the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Stadium in Lucknow, coaches will not be felicitated. “We have extended an open invitation to all players, coaches and sports bodies to attend the function. However, only the Paralympic medallists and participants from Uttar Pradesh will be honoured with cash reward,” Singh said. Sportspersons from outside UP who will be felicitated are gold medallists Avani Lekhara (shooting-Rajasthan), Sumit Antil (javelin throw-Haryana), Manish Narwal (shooting-Haryana), Pramod Bhagat (badminton-Odisha), Krishna Nagar (badminton-Rajasthan), silver medallists Bhavina Patel (table tennis-Gujarat), Nishad Kumar (high jump-Himachal Pradesh), Devendra Jhajaria (javelin throw-Rajasthan), Yogesh Kathunia (discus throw-Haryana), Mariyappan Thangavelu (high jump-TN), Singhraj Adhana (shooting-Haryana), and bronze medallists Sundar Singh Gurjar (javelin throw-Rajasthan), Sharad Kumar (high jump-Bihar), Harvindar Singh (archery-Haryana) and Manoj Sarkar (badminton-Uttarakhand). Meanwhile, coaches rued the government’s decision of not felicitating them and not even extending formal invitation. Para-badminton head national coach Gaurav Khanna said, “Para-badminton players from across the country were being trained in our academy for the last five years. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised the achievements of our players in the Paralympics. I will not attend the function as I have not received any formal invitation. It is unfortunate that we are not being given due respect in our home state.” A member of the support staff who went to Tokyo with the team claimed that the names of coaches were on the list of people to be felicitated. However, their names were excluded at the last moment, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-to-shower-cash-rewards-on-paralympic-achievers-today/articleshow/87635808.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Goa||Mapusa municipality must be fined for waste dumping: Lobo||Panaji: A day after exuding confidence that Congress’ Sudhir Kandolkar would win the Mapusa seat in the 2022 polls, minister for waste management Michael Lobo, on Wednesday hit out at Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) for failing to resolve the issue of garbage dumping within its jurisdiction. MMC is controlled by BJP supporters. Lobo said that a fine of Rs five to 10 lakh should be imposed on the council and that its officials should get the stick from the court for neglecting their duties. “Today if you go around the Mapusa municipality area, you will spot garbage dumped 24x7. They are not serious on this issue. The municipality should be fined Rs five to 10 lakh to get them to act. Someone will have to go to court and say that they are not doing any work. The chairperson, vice-chairperson and councillors should ‘get the stick’ for not doing any work,” said Lobo. He said any municipality which claims to be treating its own waste is bluffing. “If anyone is saying they are treating waste in their municipality, it is not true. They bring machines, inaugurate them and then the machines are lying unused. We have seen such machines for ourselves,” the minister said. He also hit out at the tourism ministry for interfering in collection of waste from the beaches. “Tourism department has given a contract to someone to collect waste and they are ultimately bringing the waste to our Saligao waste treatment plant itself for processing. Tourism department made the dramatic announcement that they will do beach cleaning. Not a single officer of the department has gone on the beaches to check because they are not interested, they have forcibly interfered in it. The minister has to be dedicated. Since we have a waste management ministry, all waste should come under us. This will change in 2022,” said the ports miniter . Lobo said that many panchayats are also still not serious about segregating their waste. “If we had not set up this plant, what would be the fate of these panchayats? They would be only filing affidavits in the court in the ongoing case and even some sarpanchs would be disqualified for dereliction of duty under the Panchayati Raj Act. Some are only collecting 30% of the wet waste. They are not collecting 100% segregated waste. In some panchayats, they are dumping waste by roadsides,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-municipality-must-be-fined-for-waste-dumping-lobo/articleshow/87635129.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Gold price surges to Rs 50,000 mark after three months||AHMEDABAD: As markets resumed in Ahmedabad after the Diwali break, gold prices once again zoomed to Rs 50,000 per 10 grams on Wednesday. The last time gold price was at this level was on July 30. Analysts and bullion traders attribute the surge in gold price to the firming up of the US dollar against the Indian rupee. The US dollar rate stood at 74.4 against the Indian rupee on Wednesday. “Gold price has increased due to a marginal surge in international prices of gold. In the international market, the demand for gold has gone up which caused prices to increase. Moreover, as the Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar, the effective price of gold in the Indian market will be higher,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Even though spot gold price fell marginally to $1,825.6 (Rs 1.36 lakh approx) per ounce around 6.30pm on Wednesday according to World Gold Council, prices in the local markets firmed up. Despite the surge in prices, jewellers anticipate good demand in days to come. “As soon as markets resumed operations during Labh Pancham, the demand remained upbeat as people came in to buy bullion on account of the muhurat. Customer footfalls at jewellery stores have remained good in the wake of the wedding season and people are making high-value purchases in a big way,” said Jigar Soni, president, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). Overall, the festive season sales remained good for jewellers across Gujarat. An estimated 750kg gold was traded on Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras muhurats ahead of Diwali, backed by buoyant muhurat purchases. “People have realised the importance of gold as an asset class during the pandemic and despite better returns in other asset classes be it equities or mutual funds, the faith of investors has remained intact in gold,” Soni further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-surges-to-rs-50k-mark-after-three-months/articleshow/87635134.cms||---

Kalpesh Surti, who lives behind the General Post Office (GPO) in Raopura, noticed two men lurking outside his neighbour Nilesh Modi’s house at around 5am on Tuesday.

Surti stopped the cops and told them about the two burglars. As the cops started running towards them, one of the burglars managed to escape. The other thief got into a scuffle with the cops and injured them and also damaged their mobile phones.

---||Dehradun||Submit environmental assessment report after every three years: HC||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday directed the state chief secretary to submit a report detailing the on-ground reality of the environmental aspects of the hill state after every three years. The report -- to be prepared by the Survey of India -- should assess the state of water and air quality and the measure of forest land in the state, said the court. The direction came as the court was hearing a petition — filed by social worker Ajay Narayan Sharma — alleging illegal encroachment of river land in Dehradun. Meanwhile, secretary of the urban development department, who was present in the high court for the hearing of the plea, informed the bench that such a survey has not been conducted in the state since 1964. The court has also asked the administrations of Dehradun and Nainital to furnish a report on urbanisation and how urban development can be achieved without harming the environment after every two years. In addition, Chief Justice RS Chauhan asked DM Dehradun to tell the court, by December 14, how many complaints of encroachments have been received in his office. The HC bench also asked state authorities — including secretary of revenue department, chief municipal commissioner, vice-president of Mussoorie Doon Development Authority and others — to undertake works according to a master plan and include facilities like hospitals, offices, schools, residential areas and commercial areas in every zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/submit-environmental-assessment-report-after-every-three-years-hc/articleshow/87634252.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Oppn leaders competing to praise Jinnah’||Lucknow: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Wednesday said the opposition leaders are competing to praise Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Singh’s remark came hours after SBSP chief and SP ally O P Rajbhar said the country’s partition wouldn’t have happened had Jinnah been made the first Prime Minister of India. Without taking Rajbhar’s name, Singh said the opposition leaders have become victims of ‘mental bankruptcy’ due to their appeasement politics ahead of UP elections. Earlier, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav had ignited the controversy by comparing Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and found himself in the cross hairs of the saffron party. BJP state unit chief said the comparison was an insult to the freedom fighters and backward classes who consider Sardar Patel as their ideal and draw inspiration from him. “Till now, only Akhilesh Yadav had compared Jinnah with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, now his allies are calling Jinnah as the frontline leader of the freedom struggle. While doing this they forget that Jinnah had first formed the party on religious lines and eventually got the country divided,” he said. Singh said those who are chanting Jinnah’s name have always been dividing the society on the basis of caste, religion and opinion. Accusing the opposition of conspiring to spoil the social harmony in the state, he said, “They do not want social harmony and brotherhood in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-leaders-competing-to-praise-jinnah/articleshow/87635812.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC spent Rs 3,000 crore on fight against Covid since 2020||MUMBAI: BMC has spent over Rs 3,000 crore on Mumbai’s fight against Covid-19 since 2020, data has shown. In the last seven months, BMC spent Rs.1,219.50 crore. In the last financial year, it spent Rs 1,809.95 crore. While there is no break-up on expenses corporators have repeatedly demanded that the civic body come out with a white paper on expenses made during Covid-19, especially as most proposals tabled before statutory committees would be passed without much discussion during the peak of the first and second waves, as there was a pandemic. BJP’s nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat, who is also party spokesperson, said BMC must come out with a ward-wise break-up on Covid expenses. “Many Covid-related purchases were made by BMC at inflated costs, so there is a need for a white paper detailing expenses,” said Shirsat. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja emphasized that now with statutory committee meetings like standing committee in BMC taking place physically, it was the right time for the civic body to come out with a white paper. “BMC received a lot of funds via CSR during the pandemic, which also needs to be accounted for. The Rs 3,000 crore-plus expenses are finally taxpayers’ money and hence the break-up should be put in public domain,” he said. Civic officials said in the initial months of Covid-19 maximum expenditure was made for setting up Covid-19 health infrastructure, especially field hospitals, providing food to patients at these facilities, distribution of food packets, expenditure towards hotel bills for accommodation of frontline staff, along with recruiting staff on contract basis. “Following the national lockdown in March 2020, BMC had also started sending out lakhs of food packets daily for beggars, stranded labourers and migrants across the city,” said an official, adding that other expenses made were on medical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks, 3-ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body bags, protective eye-wear and sanitizers, followed by purchasing injections, including Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Vinod Mishra (BJP) said funds for work like roads were diverted in the name of Covid. “Expenditure is likely to be more as they used funds from other departments in the name of Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-spent-rs-3k-cr-on-fight-against-covid-since-2020/articleshow/87635811.cms||Richa Pinto

He was talking to media in Gandhinagar on Wednesday. He added that of the eight municipal corporations, five have achieved 100 per cent coverage. The cities with 100 per cent coverage include Surat, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Junagadh, and Bhavnagar. Ahmedabad has achieved 97 per cent coverage and Vadodara, 99 per cent.

---||Delhi||Mission impossible: How gangs are luring targets with WFH jobs||NEW DELHI: Work-from-home employment offered by job portals could cause you much woe. Delhi Police has found several fake portals offering positions for such work and then giving the recruits targets they can’t meet, in lieu of which the latter then are made to pay heavy penalties. Explaining the modus operandi of such portals, the cops said on Wednesday that they collected resumes of people looking for employment from home such as data entry work. Offering them jobs, the fraudsters made the hired people sign legal agreements with a penalty clause if they failed to meet work deadlines. “The fake employers then gave the recruits impossible tasks to complete. They then extorted large sums as penalty for their failures,” said an investigator. While explaining what some such ‘impossible tasks’ were, another policeman said the newly hired people were given a voluminous task of data analysis to be completed, say, in 15 days. "Even if the new employees completed the work in the given time, the website staff would tell them that the work did not meet their expectations and that they had to prepare a fresh report in a new time frame,” the officer said. “In this manner, they ensured that the person never completed the work in time and had to pay the penalty.” Elaborating, the police officer said that in some instances, the recruit would be told to make a report running into 10,000 pages in five or 10 days. “After failing to complete such a task, the applicant paid the fees due under the agreement. However, the fake company kept on demanding more money, causing them to buckle by serving a legal notice,” the officer said. The victims signed the legal agreement online without realising that they were being forced into a tight corner. "We also established that the legal notices served to the victims were fake. In several cases, people paid large sums just to be freed from facing any legal action,” an investigating officer added. According to the investigators, a search was conducted on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal to list similar complaints from all over India. This exercise revealed that there were more than 50 complaints with similar allegations lodged by people in different places. During the probe, the cops found that most of the victims were already employed but had wanted to earn extra money through part-time jobs. But there were many others, first time job seekers, who were defrauded. “While trawling the internet for jobs, they came across such websites offering them handsome salaries for part-time work,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mission-impossible-how-gangs-are-luring-targets-with-wfh-jobs/articleshow/87635153.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MACT awards Rs 70 lakh payout to kin of Goregaon man killed in accident||MUMBAI: Nine years after a 28-year-old Goregaon man, father of two, was killed after the bike he was riding was hit by a jeep driver, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) awarded his family a compensation of around Rs 70 lakh (with interest). The victim, Baban Sangale, was self-employed. Considering his SSC marks of 56% and the fact that he had completed a Dairy Administration and Animal Husbandry diploma, the tribunal pegged his notional income at Rs 20,000. Sangale’s wife, two minor children and mother moved the tribunal in 2013, against the jeep owner Raju Lahane and New India Assurance Co Ltd. It was submitted that on December 24, 2012, at about 5.30 pm, Sangale was riding his bike with his friend in Ahmednagar when the jeep allegedly came from the opposite direction and rammed into the bike. Due to the impact, Sangale fell and sustained serious head and other injuries. He was shifted to a local hospital first and later to another one in Nashik. However, he died on January 2, 2013. The family had sought a compensation of Rs 94 lakh but the jeep owner did not come before the tribunal. The insurance company claimed the accident occurred due to Sangale’s negligence. It submitted that the claim application itself is devoid of merit and substance and prayed for its dismissal with costs. Sangale’s wife deposed before the tribunal and iterated the version given in the plea. The tribunal said police papers supported her version. “Though the insurance company alleged the accident occurred only due to sole negligence of the deceased, …no evidence at all is brought on record by it. The fact of accidental death of the deceased and involvement of the offending vehicle is not at all denied by the insurance company,” the tribunal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mact-awards-rs-70l-payout-to-kin-of-man-killed-in-accident/articleshow/87636223.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A large number of police personnel were deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. The residents have been facing irregular water supply since the last few years. In fact, just last week, many of them had staged a protest at the public works department (PWD) office at Mapusa and warned that they would block the road if water supply is not restored. Despite repeated correspondence and complaints to all the authorities concerned, and a face-to-face meeting with PWD officials, locals said all they received were verbal assurances that the problem would be resolved. After meetings, water supply would resume for two days, and then become irregular again. However, they were left outraged when the PWD stopped supplying water for the past few days citing that the tanker was out of order. Agitated locals said the water supply lines in the area are nearly 40-years-old and that they need to be replaced as the pipes are blocked in many places and many valves have sprung leaks too. Further, they said that if these problems are reported, they are not repaired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vagator-residents-block-road-over-lack-of-water-supply/articleshow/87635155.cms||---

The largest public hospital in Kolhapur is facing a staff crunch. As against the requirement of 700 nurses, the CPR Hospital has just 400. Of them, 300 are available on any given day. The nurses have claimed that owing to the shortage of staff, they are overburdened with several tasks. The hospital has over 20 departments and the nurses have to render their duties to multiple departments every day. Hashmat Haveri, head of the nursing staff said, "Unfortunately, we are blamed if something goes wrong. We have to work under tremendous pressure and look after multiple patients at a time. We are the first to face the anger of relatives and patients. Therefore, we have demanded recruitment of 400 nursing staff immediately." The nurses sat on the hunger strike on rotation without skipping their duties. Haveri said that the nurses never compromised on the service and thereby patient care even after being overburdened. "We met the authorities and sought written assurance regarding fulfilment of our demands. The other demands are improving safety measures, granting the pending dues for extra work and granting pending leaves. The authorities have agreed to do so and address our concerns within a month, hence we have called off the hunger strike," said Haveri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cpr-hospital-nurses-sit-on-one-day-hunger-strike/articleshow/87633355.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal: Following Lord Ram’s conduct is true Hindutva||NEW DELHI: Taking on critics who accuse him of adopting a ‘soft Hindutva’ approach to woo Hindu votes with acts such as public pujas, Ayodhya visits and recitation of Hanuman Chalisa on national TV, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Hindutva meant following the conduct, promises and life of Lord Ram, not communal riots, social media trolling or atrocities against Dalits. Speaking on a range of issues, including the national ambitions of Aam Aadmi Party, at Times Now Summit 2021 on Wednesday, Kejriwal said, “If visiting temples or celebrating Diwali is soft Hindutva, then crores of people in this country are indulging in soft Hindutva too.” He noted how he was attacked by BJP and Congress when he went to Ayodhya and chanted Hanuman Chalisa. “Connecting 130 crore people of the country is Hindutva, not dividing them. Hindutva connects, doesn’t divide,” the CM asserted. The AAP leader said his party would present the Delhi model of quality education, good hospitals and healthcare and free electricity to other states. Commenting on AAP’s intention to fight the elections in Goa, Kejriwal said, “The people there want this governance model.” He also announced that AAP would contest all 402 assembly seats in UP. Taking a dig at Congress over the infighting in the party’s Punjab unit, Kejriwal said the state was grappling with big problems, but the ruling party was busy with internecine conflicts. “People are disappointed with Akali Dal and people do not believe that Congress infighting will stop. They connect with Delhi and want AAP’s government in Punjab,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal rejected outright the rumours that he would become the CM of Punjab if AAP formed the government there. Saying AAP would announce its Punjab CM face before the assembly polls, he said, “I will not become Punjab CM. I am Delhi’s son. I will never break the trust Delhiites have in me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-following-lord-rams-conduct-is-true-hindutva/articleshow/87635164.cms||AlokKNMishra

The development assumes significance amid BJP amplifying its developmental narrative, especially in the once socio-economically impoverished east UP region, ahead of UP assembly elections. Confirming the development, CEO, UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), Avanish Awasthi, said the state government has identified areas that can be developed as industrial hot spots. “We will start the process of developing them from December,” he told TOI. Awasthi said, the expressway itself has been completed in 36 months, which is a “record” for any project of such a magnitude, despite restrictions posed by Covid-19 pandemic. The state government started the Rs 22,497crore project in October 2018. “Just a few patches on the expressway have been affected by waterlogging because of heavy rains,” he said. The Purvanchal expressway, which will be linked to Yamuna expressway (connecting Agra with Delhi) via Lucknow-Agra expressway, will complete the economic lifeline to boost development in Uttar Pradesh, said Awasthi. Industrial areas which will be part of Purvanchal Expressway Industrial Corridor (PEIC) will comprise 12 districts, including eight districts of Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh and Mau through which the expressway will cut through before culminating in Ghazipur. The other four districts which will come in the ambit of the PEIC include CM Yogi Adityanath political backyard of Gorakhpur, Jaunpur (neighbouring PM Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi), Ballia and Sant Kabir Nagar. In all, 21 sites with a combined area of 9,171 hectares have been identified for being developed as part of PEIC. While two sites each have been identified in Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, Ambedkarnagar, one site each is proposed to be developed as industrial area in Mau, Ayodhya and Ballia. The biggest industrial land parcel of 1,234 hectares has been identified in Ghazipur, followed by 949 hectares in Gorakhpur. Amethi represented by Union minister Smriti Irani will witness an industrial area coming up in an area of 855 hectares, while in Azamgarh, the parliamentary seat of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, the state government has identified 854 hectares under PEIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/purvanchal-e-way-industrial-rollout-after-pm-green-signal/articleshow/87635842.cms||Pankaj Shah

At first, Delhi Jal Board ran nine boats on the river's surface to clear the layer of froth, said an official. Workers on the boats tried to push away the white foam, which did not provide the required results. Later in the day, the irrigation and flood department of Delhi government put up barricades made out of bamboo in the water, along with green trampoline nets, to stop the froth from coming near the bank. “We have been given directions to put up the barricades to stop the froth from reaching near the bank on a stretch of around 400 metres. This kind of froth is a regular thing, I do not understand why is it making so much news this time,” said an official from the flood and irrigation department at Kalindi Kunj. The government had also deployed officials along with Delhi Police at Kalindi Kunj who were seen directing many devotees to go towards the Uttar Pradesh side of the river bank to celebrate the Puja as it is not allowed in the capital. On the other UP side, a huge crowd was seen at the Yamuna Ghat, with the administration making arrangements of tents, lighting and chairs for the devotees. Several reports early on Wednesday said that workers also sprayed water over the froth to dissipate it, but there was no such activity going on when this reporter visited the area during the day. For the last two days a thick layer of froth on Yamuna river has been observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barricades-at-yamuna-to-keep-toxic-froth-away/articleshow/87635178.cms||---

The decision to oppose the road widening was taken on Sunday during a meeting called by the 35 families who stand to be affected. These families are located between the police station and town border, which is a 500m stretch. “We will not allow work to commence. This is a residential area. Some old houses are touching the road. The government has neither acquired our land nor has it taken us into confidence,” resident Clive Colaco said. The widening work of the 4-km long road commenced earlier this month and is expected to be completed within six months. There is no issue with the work except along the 500-mt stretch. Kavlekar had said that the 500m stretch will be widened by 1.5m on either side since all residents had given their approval for the project. “I have a horticulture shop in my ancestral house and since the road is touching my house, my shop has to be demolished even if I give 1.5m for road widening. How can PWD issued the tender and commence work without land acquisition?” Vallabh Prabhudessai, a resident, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-locals-protest-road-widening-for-4-lane-project/articleshow/87635167.cms||---

Colva sarpanch Johnson Coelho informed that in October, he wrote to the tourism official about “the nuisance being created for tourists by hawkers” and urged him to initiate action. “Massages, tattoos, bracelets, tricklets, beach wear, wrap around towels, photography, etc, are all being carried out migrants on commercial basis on the beaches,” said the sarpanch. Colva police inspector Tukaram Chavan said police are already present on the beach stretch in his jurisdiction, and added that he will now seek directions from his superiors on how to go about tackling the hawker nuisance. Despite being prevalent on the beach stretches for decades, authorities have failed to tackle the hawkers. Even tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar had said that there would be a crack down on anyone who creates nuisance to tourists on the beaches. In 2019, Benaulim villagers had adopted a resolution to stop hawking on the beach stretch. They had decided to form committees of villagers to rid their beach of hawkers. The committees worked for some days, after which the hawkers were back in action. Police constables who patrol the beach disclose that if they stop the hawkers at one spot, they quickly move to another place. “We do not have much personnel to continuously patrol the entire beach stretch in the Colva police jurisdictio,” said one policeman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-dept-urges-police-to-step-up-efforts-against-hawkers/articleshow/87635182.cms||---

A team of environmental science department led by head of department Asawari Jadhav collected the data of noise levels at 22 locations — four in silent zone, six in residential zone, ten in commercial zone and two in industrial zone. The maximum limit of decibel fixed for each zone by Central Pollution Control Board is — 40, 45, 55 and 70, respectively. The team collected the data on noise levels at night and in early morning hours, when firecrackers are burst. According to the findings, except for two industrial locations (Udyam Nagar and Y P Powar Nagar), the decibel levels remained much higher than the permitted levels at 20 locations in the city. Also, the noise levels in residential and commercial zones surpassed the levels recorded last year. For instance Papachi Tickti, a location from commercial zone which recorded 68.78 dB last Diwali, recorded 72.78 dB this Diwali. The noise level at Papachi Tickti recorded was highest in the city. The locality is a major trading place located in the vicinity of Mahalaxmi temple and famous Kolhapuri Chhapal Lane. Jadhav said, “Last year, due to the Covid situation, there was a check on the celebrations. This time, there was no check and the markets were abuzz. Also, this time, Lakshmi Pujan and Narak Chaturdashi fell on the same day and therefore the crackers were burnt in large numbers on the same day.” Among residential areas, Shivaji Peth location recorded highest 66.01 dB noise level. In 2020, the noise levels here were 58.68 decibels, while in 2019, it was 55.56 decibels. It is one of the old city areas. The relatives, who usually work in Mumbai and Pune, arrived in Kolhapur this year to celebrate the festival with near and dear ones. Interestingly in silent zones, the noise levels this time went down in comparison to last year's Diwali. The locations from silent zones where the noise levels measured are- CPR Hospital, Collectors Office, District Court and Shivaji University. Last year, decibel recorded at Collectors Office was 56.37 dB, which came down to 56.26 dB this year. Shivaji University recorded least noise level of 49.71 dB in the city, though it was higher than the permissible limit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/diwali-crackers-break-noise-norms-louder-than-2019-too/articleshow/87633379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Landge, the Pune police had arrested Nemooye on August 18, 2018, from Delhi for cheating a city-based man by promising him foreign currency at a cheaper rate. “A a local court sentenced him to three years in jail. He was released in September after he completed his jail term,” said Landge. Nemooye told TOI, “When I came out of the prison, there were no flights to Nigeria. I was placed under restrictive orders and my passport had lapsed. I cannot move out of the police station. I sleep, eat and drink in the police station. The authorities of both countries should help me.” Nemooye said he came to India on a business visa from Nigeria. “I landed in Delhi and met my countrymates there. I wanted to do garment business,” he said. “I was staying in Delhi when suddenly the police from Pune came and arrested me. My friends managed to run away,” he said. “My family members are poor and cannot arrange for my air tickets. My friends are collecting money to buy a ticket for me,” he said. A senior officer with the Special Branch said, “We have written to the Nigerian high commission. However, they are yet to process the ETC and his passport.” When asked if more such foreigners were staying at police city stations with restrictive orders, the SB officer said, “As of now, he is the only one”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nigerian-lives-in-police-station-after-3-yrs-in-jail/articleshow/87613845.cms||---

If the proposal is approved, the civic body stands to lose a revenue of Rs1.25 crore. The civic administration claims that the rent is being waived because the facilities were kept closed during the lockdown. The proposal states that the rent waiver is for the six months from March-September 2020. While the proposal is tabled before the standing committee, a decision on it will be taken next week. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane said, “We want some clarity on which contractors will get the waiver. Some operators were blacklisted and appear to have re-entered the contract with different names. These details must be explained.” “The move is not correct if a blanket waiver is given. Why should defaulters, who have not paid rents earlier, get this benefit? Even errant operators, who overcharged the public, should not. If they are all included in this scheme, it gives out a wrong message to society,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-rs-1-2cr-waiver-to-parking-contractors/articleshow/87613854.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah pulled up the ministry of home affairs for not taking any action despite several recommendations made by Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Ashthana to improve the prison management. Asthana had conducted a probe and filed a report on the direction of the apex court after it was alleged that the Unitech Group’s erstwhile promoters, Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, had managed to run their business from inside the prison in connivance with jail officials. TimesViewIt is unfortunate that the court had to intervene in this matter. Convicts shouldn't be allowed to have a free run of jails. The Delhi Police should have been prompt in taking action; it's laxity is regrettable.“Necessary remedial steps shall be taken immediately and an action plan shall be drawn up which shall be placed before the court for implementing the suggestions and recommendations. This shall be complied with within a period of four weeks. A plan of action shall be submitted to this court, though the process of compliance shall not be delayed on that ground,” the court had directed the home ministry on October 6. As the court’s order was not complied with and no action plan was placed before it, the bench said that this was not acceptable and the governemnt should not wait for any other untoward incident to take action and ordered fresh direction to the government. Meanwhile, Delhi Police informed the bench that an FIR has been lodged against 37 persons, including the Chandra brothers, and jail officials who helped the siblings to carry out their operations from jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-jail-in-a-sorry-state-says-sc-pulls-up-mha-for-not-taking-remedial-action/articleshow/87635191.cms||---

Ajay Patil, the depot manager said, "Sadanand Sakharam Kamble from Gagan Bawda depot tried to commit suicide. Luckily another employee saw him and rushed to stop him. I urge all the worker's to keep calm and not take such steps." Meanwhile, passengers continue to suffer due to overpricing by the private buses. Sachin Jadhav, an IT employee travelling to Pune said, "For the last two days, I tried negotiating with the private bus operators as they are almost charging more than double the rate for Pune. Hence, I will travel on my bike." The RTO is likely to take action against the private bus operators who will be found overcharging the passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rto-to-take-action-against-pvt-buses/articleshow/87633393.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Plea against 7-year jail for Ansals: Reply sought from Delhi govt, victims’ group||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday sought response from the Delhi government and Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) on appeals filed by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal against an order by which they were convicted and sentenced to 7-year jail term for tampering with evidence in the Uphaar fire tragedy. Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil issued notice on the plea filed by the Ansal brothers. The court also sought a report from the medical superintendent of Tihar Jail after it was submitted that Gopal Ansal was suffering from certain ailments. During the hearing, the accused objected to the locus of AVUT. A magistrate court had on November 8 sentenced the Ansals to seven years in jail for tampering with evidence in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case, saying the circumstances during which the instant crime was committed show the deep disrespect which the convicts had for the law, judicial process and victims. The court had further said that the case was not only related to prosecution and AVUT but the sentencing in this case must also respond to the cry of the society. The court imposed a fine of over Rs 2.2 crore each on the Ansals. The court had also sentenced former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma, PP Batra and Anoop Singh to seven years of imprisonment in the case. It imposed a fine of Rs 3 lakh each on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-against-7-year-jail-for-ansals-reply-sought-from-delhi-govt-victims-group/articleshow/87635202.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It was no ordinary canine — it was the pet of an additional district judge (ADJ). And the accused, who was booked for reckless driving, was the wife of a provincial civil services officer. Police said, an FIR was lodged on a written complaint by the ADJ’s son, Neelesh, and investigations were underway. The incident took place near the Officer’s Colony, Sitapur.

---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP targets AAP govt for ban on Chhath along Yamuna||NEW DELHI: BJP president for the state unit Adesh Gupta and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on Wednesday hit out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over pollution in the Yamuna and claimed that AAP government banned Chhath puja celebrations on Yamuna riverbanks to hide its failure to clean Yamuna. Though DDMA, chaired by the lieutenant governor, banned Chhath on riverbanks, the BJP functionaries said Kejriwal is responsible as he is a DDMA member. Gupta said AAP government blames Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for Yamuna’s pollution, but the sorry state of the river is due to AAP’s ineffective governance. “The Centre gave Delhi government Rs 2,418 crore about 5-6 years ago for setting up 13 STPs in the capital. But neither the STPs were installed, nor is there any word on where that amount has gone,” Gupta alleged. Tiwari said it was a wrong decision to ban Chhath Puja on Yamuna riverbanks. “For Chhath Puja, devotees do not litter the riverbanks or pollute the river. The government is stopping devotees from going to riverbanks so that the shortcomings of the government in cleaning Yamuna are not exposed,” said Tiwari. CM Arvind Kejriwal, who offered prayers at a Chhath ghat in Kidwai Nagar on Wednesday, said the this is not the time for politics and everyone irrespective of political allegiances should celebrate Chhath puja. “I pray for the wellbeing of everyone including my political rivals,” Kejriwal said when asked to reply to BJP’s charges. No reaction to the charges was available from AAP despite TOI’s attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-targets-govt-for-ban-on-chhath-along-yamuna/articleshow/87635200.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 40 years after tying knot, couple in HC for certificate||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Thursday sought the Aam Aadmi Party government’s reply on a plea by a couple who married 40 years ago but are unable to get their marriage registered. The plea says that the software used to register marriages online is not accepting their application as they were underage at the time of their marriage in 1981. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the authorities and asked the sub-divisional magistrate of Alipur and district magistrate of North West Delhi to respond to the petition, which seeks to register the couple’s marriage. The high court gave the authorities two weeks’ time and listed the matter for hearing on December 23. The plea said the couple approached the SDM, Alipur for registering their marriage with all relevant documents, but it could not be done as the software did not accept their application for the reason that the man was below 21 years and the woman was below the age of 18 years, at the time of their marriage on May 28, 1981. The couple claimed that they fulfil all the conditions for registration of marriage as prescribed under the law as they have completed the age of 21 years at the time of registration and their marriage was conducted in May 1981 as per Hindu vedic rites and ceremonies. The petitioners added that since the date of their marriage, they are running their family life as husband and wife and have four children but the legal validity of getting their marriage registered has not happened yet. Their plea said the authorities had neither rectified the software nor registered the couple’s marriage so far by any other mode, which was unjust, arbitrary and illegal, being violative of their fundamental rights and non-compliance of the law. Even though they fulfil all the conditions for registration of marriage as prescribed in Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 as they have completed the age of 21 years at the time of registration and the marriage of the petitioners was conducted on May 28, 1981 as per Hindu Vedic rites and ceremonies, they have been unable to get the wedding registered, it complained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/40-yrs-after-tying-knot-couple-in-hc-for-certificate/articleshow/87654970.cms||---
---||Nagpur||With over 60 more votes, it’s advantage BJP in MLC polls||Nagpur: Even as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has made its intentions clear to fight the forthcoming MLC polls from Nagpur district, BJP seems to have an upper hand due to its greater representation in the local bodies. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) corporators, Zilla Parishad members, chairpersons of panchayat samitis, members of municipal councils and nominated members on all these local bodies in the district, can exercise their franchise in these elections to be held on December 10. The results would be declared on December 14. Of the over 600 such public representatives in Nagpur, a majority are from the saffron party. Top office-bearers from the party, including city BJP president Pravin Datke told TOI that they have an advantage of about 65 votes over combined strength of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents – Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. The MVA office-bearers too acknowledged this while speaking unofficially to TOI. Though the names of BJP general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule and former chairman of NMC health committee Virendra Kukreja are doing the rounds, the BJP leadership is not yet revealing the contestant. Though the MVA constituents are keeping their cards to the chest, the name of former minister Rajendra Mulak is at the forefront. Leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, said that the name would be finalized by party’s headquarters in Delhi. “Our state election committee will meet soon to decide the contestant. We will then send the names to our parliamentary board in Delhi. The board would finalise the contestant in consultation with party president JP Nadda,” he said. Quoting sources, TOI had earlier reported that Bawankule, who is former state energy minister, would be a frontrunner for the post after being denied ticket during the 2019 assembly polls. District collector R Vimala, who is also the returning officer for MLC elections, has already enforced the ‘code of conduct’ in the district. Speaking with the media on Wednesday, she said the district administration has a list of 614 voters from Nagpur, which would be finalised by Thursday. “Out of 156 NMC corporators, 151 are elected and five are nominated ones, while one was disqualified for want of caste certificate. The Zilla Parishad has 58 members. The district has 20 municipal councils of which 15 are governed by the public representatives while the rest are under administrator. In these 15 local bodies, 336 voters are registered. Of them, 304 are elected and 32 are nominated,” she said. The collector said that no party or the government can launch any projects or lay foundation stone till the completion of the election process. “There would be no policy announcements and even the government vehicles would be withdrawn. There will be no transfer of the state employees,” she said. The administration would be appointing a special authority to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are strictly followed during the process. “We would also monitor the advertisements and messages,” said the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-over-60-more-votes-its-advantage-bjp-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87634322.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Jakhau drug haul: Alleged recipient denied discharge||Ahmedabad: A special NIA court has refused to discharge the suspected recipient of 330kg heroin off the Jakhau coast from a Pakistani boat in 2019, with the observation that the accused could not explain satisfactorily why he responded to the signal sent by Pakistani fishermen on a particular VHF channel and why his boat was drifting near the location of the Pakistani boat on the day of the alleged delivery of the contraband. The discharge application was filed by Ramjhan Palani, who was arrested on the charge that he was to receive the drug consignment from the Pakistani fishing boat, Al Madina, on May 26. However, as the Indian Coast Guard ship intercepted the Pakistani ship, its captain and five crew members threw 194 packets of heroin weighing 217.8kg into the water. The coast guard recovered seven bags and found 194 packets in them. A few days later, 17 more packets were found floating on the Kutch coast. The security agency recovered a total of 236.6kg of heroin in 211 packets. After arresting six Pakistani fishermen, the coast guard traced Palani to his boat, Fezane Kirmani, some 8-9 nautical miles away from the location of the Pakistani boat. He responded to the message sent from the Pakistani boat and was arrested on charges that the drug consignment was to be delivered to him. After their arrests, the investigation was taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). All seven accused are lodged in Palara Jail near Bhuj since then. Palani sought discharge claiming innocence and claimed that the probe agency did not find any evidence connecting him to the offence and he was wrongly arraigned in this case. Palani’s discharge plea was vehemently opposed by NIA’s special prosecutor, Amit Nair, who pointed out the evidence the investigators have gathered against Palani. After hearing the case, special judge Shubhada Baxi rejected Palani’s discharge plea and said that he could not give an explanation about his boat drifting near the Pakistani boat on the day of its interception. Moreover, he could not explain why his boat was drifting on the same location on May 16 and 17, 2019, when the Pakistani boat made its first trip. He also could not explain why he responded to VHF channel No. 8 instead of VHF channel No. 16, which is earmarked for communication with fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jakhau-drug-haul-alleged-recipient-denied-discharge/articleshow/87634314.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Wednesday bump in Covid cases in Maharashtra, Mumbai||MUMBAI: After five days, the statewide tally of Covid-19 cases crossed 1,000 on Wednesday. In a trend that has stayed consistent for the last couple of months, the tally (1,094) is higher on a Wednesday than on the previous weekdays. In Mumbai, where cases have been below 300 since November 4, the tally on Wednesday was 339. However, the number of tests was also higher (38,661) than in the last couple of days. “The daily positivity rate is still below 0.9%,’’ said a civic official. At the state level, 11 districts, including Pune, Sindhudurg, Amravati, Palghar and Parbhani, are a matter of concern as they have a weekly positivity rate higher than the state average of 1.4%. The number of active cases (12,410) continues to drop across the state, and only five districts — Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Ahmednagar and Raigad — account for 80% of the cases. Twenty-two districts have less than 100 active cases each, with Nandurbar at the lowest end with 1 active case and Ratnagiri the highest with 78. In Mumbai, the number of symptomatic patients is less than 1,000 (959). The BMC dashboard showed that 93% of the city’s 17,493 Covid beds are vacant and only 522 out of 7,921 oxygen-supported beds are in use. A senior official said with many experts stating a spurt in cases is likely in the next 15 days, the BMC doesn’t want to reduce the number of Covid beds now. There are 403 patients in the Covid ICU in the city. Covid’s average weekly growth rate in the city has dropped to 0.03%, with H West ward (Bandra) having the highest rate (0.06%) while R South (Kandivli) has the lowest at 0.02%. The doubling rate in the city has improved to 2,194 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wednesday-bump-in-covid-cases-in-state-mumbai-city/articleshow/87635888.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Not naming accused in FIR doesn’t discredit case’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and arson against four people in two separate northeast Delhi riots cases, saying FIR is not an encyclopedia but the beginning point of investigation and not naming accused in FIR does not discredit the case of the prosecution at all. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges against Suraj, Yogender Singh, Ajay and Gorav for the offences under sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of IPC. They were charged for burning the shops of Javed Khan and Gulfam during the riots on February 25 last year. “On the basis of the contents of the chargesheet duly supported by the statement of the witnesses, it has come on record that riotous mob consisting of 100-150 people armed with lathis and danda and including the accused people had entered into the shop of the complainant Javed Khan and committed mischief and destruction by fire of the said shop by the unlawful assembly in prosecution of common object,” the court said earlier. It further said that the contention of the accused that witnesses cannot be believed or their statements as recorded late, hence cannot be relied upon, cannot be a basis for discharge as it is a matter of trial. “Moreover, the submissions that the police witnesses are not independent witnesses but interested for a ground of disregarding their statement, are without a legal basis,” it added. The court further said there was video footage showing Suraj and Yogender near the place of the incident. It noted that beat officers, who were deputed on duty on February 25, 2020, had also identified them as part of the rioters. It said that witnesses have also described the incident involving more than 100-200 rioters armed with rods and danda, and hence, there was a common object that can be ascribed to the accused people in committing the said offence of rioting and mischief. It added that “a public witness has specifically identified accused Ajay and Gorav as part of the riotous mob, which ransacked and burnt the shops of the complainants.” “Thus, on the basis of the material on record, I am of the opinion that there are grounds for presuming that the accused people namely Suraj, Yogender Singh, Ajay and Gorav have committed offences under sections 147,148, 427,436,188 IPC read with Section 149 IPC,” the judge said. The accused had claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-naming-accused-in-fir-doesnt-discredit-case/articleshow/87635206.cms||Usha Das
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Ex-MP DP Yadav acquitted in 1992 Ghaziabad MLA murder case||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday acquitted former Lok Sabha MP and UP strongman D P Yadav in the 1992 murder of BJP legislator from Ghaziabad, Mahendra Singh Bhati. The HC set aside the conviction order of a special CBI court and said there was no 'concrete evidence' against Yadav to establish guilt. The CBI court had in February 2015 sentenced Yadav, along with three others-- Parneet Bhati, Karan Yadav, and Pal Singh alias Lakkar Pala -- to life imprisonment. All four had subsequently appealed against the verdict. A division bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while setting aside the lower court's conviction of the former MP, reserved its judgment on the other three accused. Yadav was already out of jail on interim bail on health grounds. He had received several such bail extensions this year. Bhati was shot dead at the Dadri railway crossing in September 1992. He was once regarded as Yadav's mentor in the liquor business in the region. The murder case in the lower court was transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Dehradun in 2000 on the directions of the Supreme Court, which said Yadav's political influence in UP might hamper a fair trial. Meanwhile, Bhati’s family said that they will appeal in the Supreme Court against the verdict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-30-yrs-former-mp-dp-yadav-acquitted-in-mla-murder-case-by-uttarakhand-hc-for-lack-of-concrete-evidence/articleshow/87634312.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops keep lakes out of bounds as ponds, rooftops ease Chhath load||Kolkata: Natural water bodies, artificial ponds constructed in multiple neighbourhoods and swimming pools in housing complexes helped reduce the Chhath load on the Hooghly ghats on Wednesday evening. Still, police and civic staff struggled to ensure distancing and finally gave up as several lakh devotees descended on the river bank before sunset. Two large water bodies — Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarboar — that were declared off limits for Chhath rituals by the Calcutta High Court last year, remained undisturbed as devotees made no attempts to break through the police barricades as they had done in previous years. According to conservative estimates, the crowding at the ghats was down by nearly 30% against 2019 with many devotees opting to perform the rituals at alternative locations. In an attempt to attract Chhath devotees from the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt, state ministers Chandrima Bhattacharya and Aroop Biswas inaugurated a makeshift ghat at a waterbody in Patuli. Sources said the ghat was used by over 5,000 devotees. Similarly, large water bodies along EM Bypass, Ranikuthi, Behala, Cossipore and Dum Dum areas witnessed thousands of devotees performing the rituals. Artificially-created ponds in Tentultala ground off Panditiya Road, Ballygunge, Jhaldar math in Tollygunge, Deshapran Sashmal Road and at other locations in the Narkeldanga-Beliaghata belt also drew a fair share of devotees. Several hundreds more celebrated the festival in their housing complexes or on the roof of their homes. Residents of high-rises and standalone buildings that have a sizable Bihari population used the swimming pools to take the dip and offer prayers. Some also used inflatable tubs on terraces. “We are glad that a sizable population of our community respected our call and has refrained from heading to the river or lakes and also avoided congregation. The pandemic is still there and we didn’t want the celebrations to become a cause for mourning,” said Munna Singh, the president of Rashtriya Bihari Samaj. Environment activist Subhas Datta visited the Lake in the afternoon and expressed happiness over the measures taken by KMDA and police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-keep-lakes-out-of-bounds-as-ponds-rooftops-ease-chhath-load/articleshow/87634332.cms||---

With as many schemes in 13 revenue villages near Amer and Delhi Road falling under the ESZ, locals have been demanding lease deeds. However, at a meeting chaired by the district collector on Wednesday, where forest and JDA officials were also present, a decision was taken to issue lease deeds only after implementation of ESZ zonal master plan. The state forest department has declared 79.356 sqkm area as ESZ of Nahargarh (WLS) where several activities were prohibited. The central government had notified an area to an extent varying from 0 to 13km round the boundary of Nahargarh WLS as ESZ.Assistant conservator of forests Ghanzansar Ali Zaidi said, “The final notification to declare ESZ of Nahargarh WLS was released on March 11, 2019. Now, within two years, the state government had to prepare ESZ zonal master plan in consultation with all departments including environment and forest, urban development, tourism, municipal, revenue, agriculture and others.”Sources said the master plan shall not impose any restrictions on the approved existing land use, infrastructure and activities, unless so specified in this notification and the zonal master plan shall factor in improvement of all infrastructure and activities to be more efficient and eco-friendlier. With this, many new activities including hotel, farmhouses, resorts will not be allowed within a one-km area. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lease-deeds-in-nahargarh-eco-zone-only-after-zonal-master-plan-is-made/articleshow/87635872.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP MP celebrates Chhath at Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Keeping aside Covid-appropriate behaviour, scores of devotees thronged the Yamuna bank near ITO crossing on Wednesday to celebrate Chhath with fervour. Police and civil defence volunteers tried to disperse the crowd during the day, but the numbers of devotees swelled later in the evening. BJP MP Pravesh Verma also took part in the celebrations. At almost 10 metres away from the river bank, a large artificial pond was created where devotees performed rituals at sunset. CRPF was deployed at the bank near the site to keep a tight vigil. “The DDMA's guidelines are being followed at this site. No one is allowed to carry out puja in the river,” said a police officer. However, in Sonia Vihar, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta along with BJP MP Manoj Tiwari celebrated Chhath Puja at the river bank. Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri also celebrated the festival with the residents in his own constituency. “Efforts should have been made to clean the toxic froth from the river instead of banning devotees from entering the river. Kejriwal’s inefficiency and negligence stands exposed,” said Tiwari. Hitting back, Aam Aadmi Party’s national spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that BJP is disrupting the Chhath arrangements by Delhi government. “All arrangements for the Puja are being handled by Delhi government. Agitated BJP functionaries are trying to stifle the government’s efforts to disturb the festivities,” said Bhardwaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-mp-celebrates-chhath-at-yamuna/articleshow/87635209.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Health workers’ additional strides behind Uttar Pradesh’s vaccination milestone||LUCKNOW: While UP is already on top when it comes to total number of doses administered, it became the only state in the country to have more than 10 crore partially vaccinated people on Wednesday. As per data from the Cowin portal, the total number of partially vaccinated persons in UP reached 10.01 crore till 6 pm. A key factor in UP’s effort to boost Covid-19 vaccination is unmatched commitment of those in the field, especially in farflung areas of the state.  Meet Archana and Karishma, the ANMs posted in Mahasi village under the Tambaur Community Health Centre of Sitapur district. The two courageous frontline workers undertook extensive awareness drives in households allotted to them. They also worked hard to ensure that all kinds of myths and rumours around vaccination were quelled. “They remained committed to their work despite unfavourable conditions including flood in surrounding villages. On one sunny day, with floodwater at the feet, both ANMs collected the vaccine vials from Sirsira primary health center, went to Mahasi village and vaccinated around 40 people in the 45 plus category,” recalled Dr Sanjay Kumar, medical officer in-charge at CHC Tambaur. Block community process manager, Poonam Verma was pleasantly surprised by the exemplary zeal displayed by the two women. “When we asked them why they risked their life in the flooded area, they told us that no one is safe till every eligible one is vaccinated,” she said. The sentiment is shared by people across various levels. In Mirpur, a backward block in UP’s farthest district Sonbhadra, acquiring Covid-19 infection from the vaccine was the biggest fear of many in about 100 villages. The locals were so scared that they ran away upon seeing health workers approaching. Medical officer Dr Shishir Srivastava was quick to realise that an intensified campaign to dispel misinformation was needed. But considering the terrain of the region, available resources were not enough. Accordingly, he mobilised the support of companies in Renukoot to organise localised awareness activities such as street plays, puppet shows, munadi, miking besides holding meetings with men, women and community to bust the myths. The efforts translated into a six-fold increase in the number of vaccinations. In all, 47 sessions of vaccination were held in which 8,497 persons were inoculated. Health officials said that the two cases exemplify the kind of effort which is being put in to make UP achieve milestones one after another. “Everything is in place when it comes to the vaccination campaign in UP. The right strategy, a trained and motivated workforce, leadership, monitoring and feedback mechanism and proper coordination between all stakeholders,” said Dr Praful Bharadwaj, health officer, Unicef UP and member, UP State Task Force on Covid-19 vaccination.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Olympian’s help held for theft, cops find LED TV, modular kitchen at her home||KOLKATA: A domestic help employed at the New Town home of Olympian Joydeep Karmakar was arrested for stealing more than Rs 3.5 lakh from his home as cops probing into the case found a 43-inch LED TV, a king-size hydraulic bed and a modular kitchen at her shanty in a New Town slum and close to Rs 1 lakh in her bank account, which she allegedly confessed to have stolen from the 41-year-old Olympics shooter’s bedroom. Considered a trusted maid who “cooks and speaks very well” for the last four years, Mumtaz Bibi (33) was caught stealing Rs 18,000 from Karmakar’s sons’ piggy bank last year but the shooter hadn’t lodged a complaint then and had opted for giving the woman a second chance. However, when he realised a large sum of cash was missing from his home again, he lodged a police complaint this time. “When we grilled the woman, she initially denied but later confessed to having stolen a small sum of money from his wallet. But when we visited her shanty near Eco Park, we found, although it was shabby from outside, the interiors all decked up with a large LED TV, a king-sized modern storage bed and a modular kitchen. We checked her bank account and found Rs 93,000 in it, deposited in the last few months,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops said they will be freezing the account and are checking if she had bought anything else with the stolen money. According to Karmakar, the woman was possibly stealing the money over a period of four months but the theft came to light only on Monday night when he was looking for some cash to buy some machines for his shooting academy. “I found the bags lighter and at least Rs 3.5 lakh was missing. We had no one else to suspect other than the domestic help. So I called up the police commissioner for his suggestion. The commissioner immediately asked me to lodge a complaint at Eco Park police station,” said Karmakar. Karmakar added the woman initially confessed to have stolen Rs 30,000 from my wallet. But later on, she confessed before the cops to having stolen at least three times in the last four months. “But I guess she must have stolen at least six times since August. But she was so neat in her work and used to keep the keys and the money packets in the same positions that we didn’t doubt her,” he said. During Durga Puja last year, they had found Rs 18,000 saved by his teenage sons to buy a guitar and some other stuff stolen. “She was the only outsider who used to frequent our home. When we questioned her, she finally confessed but had begged before us not to lodge a police complaint. She had also agreed to repay us the stolen amount by deducting Rs 1,000 from her salary of Rs 6,500 every month. She was a good cook and seemed like a nice woman. So we gave her a chance but it is unfortunate that this is how she reciprocated,” Karmakar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/olympians-help-held-for-theft-cops-find-led-tv-modular-kitchen-at-her-home/articleshow/87634378.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

She lodged a complaint only after Patel sent these images to her son. Cybercrime police said they have a special team for counselling such victims, who are depressed after such offences. Officials said the special counselling team has been trained by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore. The officer said that Patel had sent obscene photographs of the victim to her son and later deleted them. The officials said that when Patel tried to pressure the victim by involving her son, she approached cybercrime police. The cops said Patel had also sent obscene photographs to the victim’s husband and her father-in-law but when she did not react at the time. Cops said they have found the laptop and mobile phones used by Patel and have also got digital evidence to prove that the complaint has substance. Cybercrime police had on Monday arrested Patel, a deputy collector working at Modasa town in Arvalli district, for allegedly harassing the woman, a Class 2 government officer, over a long period of time with sexual remarks, threats and sending obscene pictures to her family members. Patel met the complainant first in 2016 during a state government event and they later met off and on for work purposes. When they met, Patel was a deputy mamlatdar in Nadiad and was preparing for the deputy collector’s exam. Patel threatened to slander the complainant and even threatened to commit suicide after killing her family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/harassment-victim-is-severely-depressed/articleshow/87634381.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Inquiry ordered against cop for laxity in 17-year-old girl’s ‘murder case’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has initiated departmental inquiry against police for “maliciously” converting a case of suicide into that of culpable homicide amounting to murder and falsely implicating two men in a 2016 murder and sexual assault case involving a 17-year old girl. The court acquitted two men in the case, saying the prosecution has not been successful in building the case of murder and sexual assault against them. Additional sessions judge Nevjeet Budhiraja initiated an inquiry against the investigating officer, mother and friend of the deceased girl, senior scientific officer (biology) of FSL Rohini and the police officer who helmed the investigation at later stages for “malicious prosecution and false deposition”. “I would be failing in my duty if I chose to shut my eyes as regards to the gross misconduct on part of the investigating agency, which has acted maliciously by converting the case of suicide into that of culpable homicide amounting to murder and falsely implicating the accused people,” the judge said in an order passed on October 29. The court further said, “There is ample material in the form of delay in registration of FIR, tainted testimony of eyewitnesses, and medical and FSL reports being contrary to the version of all eyewitnesses, which suggest their involvement in setting up a false case against the accused.” It added that then in-charge of the case, failed to get the FIR registered at the earliest and later got registered the “concocted” FIR in “ connivance with the family members of the victim”. The court also said that the prosecution case has been found to “suffer from prevarications”. It said that when the in-charge of the investigation met the mother of the deceased after reaching the hospital, it was expected that the FIR about the commission of the offence was to be registered with promptitude at that time. However, that did not happen as… (investigating officer) claimed in his testimony that the mother was found to be in a depressive mood,” it noted. The FIR was registered the next morning.

---||Delhi||Postpone survey on learning gaps: Manish Sisodia to Centre||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has requested Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan to postpone National Achievement Survey (NAS) scheduled on Friday. Arguing that the schools have just opened after 19 months and all children are yet to return, Sisodia wrote that holding such a survey won’t reflect the actual situation. NAS will be conducted in 733 districts of the 36 states and Union territories covering 1.3 lakh schools and 39 lakh students of classes III, V, VIII and X. It will measure learning gaps among children caused due to Covid-19 by testing them in key subjects. Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, wrote, “In Delhi, we reopened the schools till Class VIII only from November 1. Children have returned to school after a gap of 19 months. Moreover, for now, only 50% of the strength of students is being called, and in many private schools, the primary children have not even been called.” He added, “As per media reports, the situation is similar in other states... In this situation, the learning gap that the survey intends to collect will be far from the real situation.” With the students returning to school after a long gap, the focus should be on addressing their social, emotional and mental well-being, Sisodia said. The focus must be on getting all children back to school rather than “conducting a half-hearted survey and bring out a policy based on it”, he added. Holding the survey now will be a waste of time and money, the minister underlined. “If any policy is formulated... on the basis of the survey, its results will be even more damaging,” said Sisodia. However, sample schools have made the required preparation. At The Indian School, Class X students will be part of the survey. “They have asked for 30 students, so the batch that is coming to school on Friday will be part of it,” said principal Tania Joshi. Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Ambedkar Nagar’s Sector IV is also a sample institute for Class X. Aruna Anand, its principal, said, “I have called the entire Class X batch and the required 30 will be chosen from among them. Teachers will also be randomly selected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/postpone-survey-on-learning-gaps-sisodia-to-centre/articleshow/87655011.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Global Dreamshala to make 10k kids literate||Lucknow: Around 10,000 out-of-school children across the state will now achieve literacy. For a non-profit group DEVI Sansthan has collaborated with the SBI Foundation to provide education to such children under their Global Dreamshala Literacy project. The one-year project aims to impact around 10,000 kids by making them literate in Hindi at the foundational level. Under the project, 10,000 volunteers will be trained using a web app to teach literacy. The organisation will partner with schools across UP with focus in Lucknow to impart lessons. Each volunteer will have free access to the app and will adopt an illiterate learner. The volunteers will register their learner on the app and conduct a pre-test. They will then conduct daily 15-minute learning sessions with their learners using the course content in the app. On completion, the volunteer will conduct a post-test to confirm if the learner is able to read and write at grade 3 level. Citing figures CEO of DEVI Sansthan, Sunita Gandhi, said, “We want to tap into the idealism of the young students to be agents of change for literacy. Many children in our country have lost foundational literacy skills during the pandemic and are out of school. If every student adopts an illiterate learner, India can become fully literate in five years and not 50.” The Global Dreamshaala app has videos and interactive games that help learners pick up reading skills in a very short time and in an enjoyable way. “Students can find someone in their home or neighbourhood who is unable to read and get going. It could also be someone who works at their home. The learning is mostly self-lead by the learner. The volunteer has to be there as a facilitator and motivator,” Gandhi added. Expressing happiness on the collaboration, SBI Foundation’s managing director and CEO Manjula Kalayansundaram said, “We hope to improve literacy rates through the Global Dream Toolkit that has a comprehensive set of features to accelerate easy learning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/global-dreamshala-to-make-10k-kids-literate/articleshow/87635905.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The petitioner, Haridwar-resident Ramesh Chandra Sharma, has alleged that Mahendra Giri-led Niranjani Akhara “illegally” sanctioned the construction of 30 rooms, warehouses, shops and storehouses in the temple premises. The constructions, according to the petitioner, make the area more landslide-prone.

---||Pune||Private buses in Maharashtra bring temporary relief to hassled commuters||PUNE: Private buses made their way to state transport (ST) depots and started ferrying passengers on Wednesday, giving temporary relief to the latter amid the ongoing Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) staffers’ strike. Private bus operators claimed that around 1,500 buses from Pune and close to 10,000 buses from across the state replaced the MSRTC fleet. Meanwhile, agitating employees took to the traditional ‘gondhal’ folk music to protest and vent their frustration. “It is a relief. I have been stuck in Pune for two days. I tried to go to Kolhapur on Monday, but fares were too high. On Wednesday, found private buses lined up at Swargate depot. Instead of Rs900, which I was asked for on Monday, I paid Rs450 — which is still high,” said Dayanand Phatke, a smalltime farmer. At the Swargate depot, several commuters were seen arguing with the transporters over fare. “I have to travel to Dombivali and usually pay between Rs150 and Rs200 on an MSRTC bus. Now, with only private buses from Pune to Thane, the charge is Rs600. I have been looking for cheaper fare for the last two hours,” said Pune resident Sundar Philip Rathore (65). Transporters refuted that in most cases, the fares were at par with MSRTC. “Different buses have been pressed into service, including luxury AC ones. Instructions have been given to us not to charge high fares, and we are following them. Fares of almost all buses are the same as their MSRTC counterparts,” said Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Goods and Passengers Transport Association. Senior MSRTC officials told TOI that they were helping private operators in all possible ways. “Space has been provided to them in depots and the fare chart of different routes and buses of MSRTC has been given to them. RTO officials are keeping an eye on overcharging. For now, private buses are plying on routes with a maximum distance of 250km, to destinations like Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Mumbai and more. Stress is on ensuring that the buses complete at least one or two trips to benefit more commuters,” said Dyaneshwar Ranavare, traffic manager of Pune MSRTC division. On Monday, RTO officials had also said the number of private buses at depots will be increased as per availability. Protesting employees, who chose to sing and dance at the depots for their agitation, said, “It is not good to see private buses plying from here. However, our demands are genuine. To save ourselves from any confrontation or frustration, we are singing and dancing,” one such employee told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-buses-bring-temporary-relief-to-hassled-commuters/articleshow/87634410.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Doctors using sonography to identify early complications in dengue||JAIPUR: Just like high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) played an instrumental role in diagnosing Covid or assessing the level of involvement of lungs, sonography, also known as ultrasound, an another diagnostic imaging technique, is now becoming a popular tool for doctors to identify early complications in dengue. Since dengue is causing more deaths this year, doctors are using sonography to find out if there is any fluid leakage in cavities around lungs and abdomen of patients and its effect on liver and other internal organs such as gallbladder wall thickening. On the basis of the amount of leakage of fluids, doctors are ascertaining the severity of dengue. “Utrasound findings can be detected in early and milder form of dengue fever including gallbladder wall thickening, peri gallbladder edema, minimal ascites (plasma leakage in abdomen cavity), pleural effusion (plasma leakage in cavity around lungs) and hepato-splenomegaly,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, who has also made its mention in state’s dengue management protocol. Since sonogprahy provides just a corroborative finding and require other tests not only to diagnose dengue but also to identify its severity, doctors are using certain blood tests too. “We are using hematocrit test, dengue test and complete blood count along with sonography for diagnosing and for finding out the severity of dengue. Raised levels of hematocrit indicates capillary leak and sonography provides us real picture about the quantity of leakage from capillaries,” said Dr Mukesh Sarna, professor (medicine) at a private medical college in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-using-sonography-to-identify-complications-early/articleshow/87635901.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Whereas in NATA, the general category cut-off is 70 (out of 200) to qualify. It is unfair to larger number of students seeking admissions in architecture colleges through NATA, they said.

The second wave was more intense than the first wave as around 1.5 lakh people were infected during the second wave. NMC had recruited around 1,000 health employees on a temporary basis in February and March to provide treatment to Covid patients during the second wave. This includes ward boys, nurses, medical officers and other staffers. NMC had still retained these temporary health staff since July considering the expected third wave of Covid. Earlier, a third wave was projected in August and September, but the new cases continued to drop and there is no spike in cases yet.NMC officials said there has been a rise in the number of people being vaccinated and many people have already been infected. “Moreover, the infectivity of the virus has become mild and the positivity rate has also reduced below 0.5%. This is the reason the daily Covid cases have reduced significantly,” said the officials.As the new cases are continuously dropping in the city, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav has instructed the health officials not to give extensions to temporary Covid health staff after November 30. Considering the third wave of the pandemic, the NMC administration had conducted walk-in interviews to recruit various medical staffers on a temporary basis and selected 340 candidates for various posts. But NMC had put a hold on the appointments of all 340 candidates due to continuous drop in new cases and finally cancelled their recruitment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-release-temporary-health-workers/articleshow/87632646.cms||Tushar Pawar

We strongly oppose this order and will soon launch an agitation against the government if the order is not withdrawn”.Deswal, who was the Lok Sabha candidate from Rohtak Seat for the JJP party in 2019 polls, also questioned the appointment of Rohtak’s MDU vice-chancellor Prof Rajbir Singh by challenging his educational qualification and Ph.d degree. “The scrutiny of education records of the vice-chancellor has revealed that he had obtained degrees through dubious means and by showing false experience certificates,” Deswal alleged.Producing the documents before the media, he said that the vice-chancellor had pursued a master degree (MA) in the year 2000, while surprisingly he had done his PhD in the year 1999.“Apart from this, the educational experience certificates used by him for his appointment as professor are also wrong and apparently fake,” he said.Giving an example of his teaching experience, the INSO president said that the VC had mentioned in the records that he had worked as a teacher in the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology (GJUST) in Hisar, holding classes of students of MA journalism and mass communication, but in reality, he was a government employee holding the post of DPRO in Haryana government during that time.“His teaching record has itself exposed his false claim as it is not possible for a government officer to simultaneously work as a teacher in a university. Significantly, Rajbir Singh himself was holding a MA degree in journalism and mass communication when he was teaching the students in the GJUST”, Deswal stated. The INSO national president alleged that educational qualifications and degree of Rajbir Singh seemed to have been obtained in a dubious and doubtful way.“If such ineligible persons continue to hold such posts, then education and educational institutions are bound suffer,” he maintained.Asking the state government to institute an inquiry about the vice chancellor and remove him from the post, the INSO leader said the chief minister should immediately intervene in the matter. However, MDU VC Prof Rajbir Singh could not be contacted as his office staff maintained that he was out of station and busy in meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jjp-students-wing-questions-hry-govt-over-recruitment-in-varsities/articleshow/87635254.cms||---

The investigation was launched on Tuesday after the deputy superintendent of police, CB-CID (incharge) Muralidharan issued an order on Monday to a team headed by inspector Palraj to probe into the issue. Chief minister M K Stalin had earlier forwarded a petition that he had received in this regard from an activist to director general of police (CB-CID) Mohammed Shakeel Akhtar to look into the issue. The DGP had subsequently forwarded the petition to the district CB-CID. Talking to TOI, activist A Radhakrishnan, who petitioned Stalin, said the illegal red sand and stone mining had been happening on more than 60 acres land that falls under the limits of Salem main and west tahsildar offices for the past several years. “Illegal mining is also happening in several other places, including Mettur, Vazhapadi, Attur and Yercaud, in the district.” The activist said he had visited the affected areas on October 31 after the residents raised the issue with him. “A few people have obtained licence from the Tamil Nadu Geology and Mines Department and they have been misusing the same to carry out mining activities in areas where such activities are not permitted. There are also several others who are mining red sand and stones without obtaining licence from the department.” He said the illegal miners were enjoying the support of bureaucrats and elected representatives. “Why haven’t the mining department and revenue department officials taken any action against them for many years?” When contacted, the DGP (CB-CID) refused to comment on this issue and said a probe in this connection was already on. L Nirmal Raj, director, Tamil Nadu Geology and Mining Department, said he had directed the officials in the district to initiate an inquiry. “I have constituted a team to gather details about the minerals mined from the area. Strict action will be initiated against the people, who are found guilty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/cb-cid-initiates-inquiry-into-illegal-sand-mining-in-salem/articleshow/87635256.cms||---

Shinde had some days ago claimed to have received a threatening letter from the Maoists, vowing to eliminate him to avenge the relentless deaths of their cadres and also some of the key leaders. The threat was issued through a letter allegedly sent by Bhamragarh area committee. The case is now under investigation by Thane city police. Clarifying their stand, Maoists’ western regional bureau spokesperson Shrinivas has stated through the press communication that the minister has resorted to the claims of threat for publicity. Hitting out at the minister and Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the Maoists claimed the leaders are merely ‘brokers’ of the mining company which is facing tumultuous mass protests at Surjagarh. The Maoists also claimed that leaders like Shinde and his cabinet colleague Vijay Wadettiwar cannot face the masses now for opposing the move of the masses, who have now taken a stand against mining in the district. A senior police official from Thane city police said on condition of anonymity that the investigation is presently underway, and is with the anti-extortion cell of Thane crime branch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoists-deny-issuing-threats-to-guardian-minister-shinde/articleshow/87634429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The FTK gives an indicative result but is very important to ascertain whether a water supplier is providing safe water or treated water. “The testing of water is to be done by five persons, preferably women from every village. They will undergo special training to use the kits,” said a government official. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Wednesday the programme will help check spread of diseases through contaminated water. “It will empower women to take care of family,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/field-testing-kits-distributed-in-villages-to-check-water-quality/articleshow/87635906.cms||---

This section is part of the fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor. Officials said they would speed up work on the remainder of the civil work at these stations — RTO, Pune Station, Ruby Hall, Bund Garden, Yerawada, Kalyaninagar and Ramwadi. A total of 140 pier arms have been installed for these stations. MahaMetro officials further said traffic congestion along this section will abate now that the pier arms have been installed. “The station work is divided in two parts. The initial stage includes construction of piers, pier arms and launch of pier arm caps. This work requires space so traffic blockages or re-routing of traffic was proposed to assist the work. But now these works are almost over,” an official said. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said, “The road closures are being done during the night hours as per the requirements, mainly to unload heavy material or launch segments. The work of seven stations on Civil Court-Ramwadi routes, construction of piers and launch of segments have seen significant progress in the past few months.” Sonawane said the Metro station at Pune railway station has been designed in such a way to allow movement of Metro and railway passengers between the two facilities. According to MahaMetro, about 90% of the pillars and 70% segments on the route are now ready. The remaining work is expected to get over in the next few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/work-speeds-up-at-seven-elevated-metro-stations/articleshow/87634428.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nawab Malik's charges a ‘nawabi’ low in politics, says BJP MLA Ashish Shelar||MUMBAI: BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Wednesday hit out at NCP minister Nawab Malik over the allegations he made against opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. “Malik has made bogus allegations against Devendra Fadnavis. By dropping names and making claims of an international racket, calls from abroad and extortion, he tried to create a false narrative, but his attempts have failed. Malik had said he would detonate a hydrogen bomb, but it was a fused firecracker that did not burst. Forget hydrogen, I think Malik might need oxygen,” Shelar said. At a presser, Shelar said all appointments made by the Fadnavis-led government were legal and none of those appointed had any criminal cases against them. “Malik has taken the names of Haider Azam, Imran Alam Shaikh, younger brother of Haji Arfaz Shaikh, and Munna Yadav. None of them had any criminal cases. Munna Yadav had political cases against him, and he will speak out about it himself soon. The MVA government has been in power for two years but could not register any case against these people. Malik spoke about Riyaz Bhati too. There is no connection of Riyaz Bhati and the Prime Minister or PMO,” Shelar said. Mumbai drugs case: Nawab Malik alleges links between Devendra Fadnavis, criminalsShelar showed photos of Riyaz Bhati with Congress and NCP leaders like Prithviraj Chavan, Ajit Pawar and with CM Uddhav Thackeray. “We don’t want to show photos and defame senior leaders. Taking names, showing photos of senior leaders and creating a sensation is not the tradition of our party. But see the photos and ask yourself who is seen with whom. It looks like Nawab Malik has lost his mental balance. He has stooped to the lowest level in politics. We can now say that this new low in politics can be called a ‘Nawabi low’”, Shelar said. Shelar alleged that it was the MVA government that was protecting Bhati. “Malik said Bhati is absconding, but it seems the MVA government has taken him to a safe place and is protecting him. Some top leaders of MVA had even given him protection in cricket politics. Malik has been dragging names of all minority community members and leaders. He dragged the name of Shah Rukh Khan and Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh of Congress. He is also dragging in other upcoming leaders of the minority community. It seems Malik wants to target leaders from the minority community,” Shelar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maliks-charges-a-nawabi-low-in-politics-bjp-mla/articleshow/87635917.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Pune||Concerned residents seek repair of Ganesh Darwaja at Lohagad fort||Pune: A portion of ‘Ganesh Darwaja’ at Lohagad fort in Maval tehsil has fallen, prompting local residents to approach the Archaeological Survey of India, which maintains the fort, to carry out repairs to ensure the safety of visitors. They said that parts of the structure, made of stone and lime, break off and fall at regular intervals. A senior Archaeological Survey of India official told TOI, “We have received a report in this regard from the locals. Our team is going to inspect the fallen structure. Based on our findings, we will carry out the necessary work at the site.” On the closure of the fort, the official said, “We have yet to take a decison on it. We will decide once we complete the inspection.” Around 1,000 visitors visit the fort, located close to the Lonavala hill station, daily. Maximum tourists come from Pune and Mumbai. Shivaji Maharaj had captured the fort for the first time in 1648 from the Mughals. The fort is one of the favourite destinations of trekkers and visitors due to its picturesque location and historical importance. Another famous fort is situated opposite to it. Nagesh Margale, sarpanch, Lohgad village, said, “Some portions of the security wall of the steps have become weak. Stones fall at some locations. A big stone has fallen on the passage near the main door of the fort. Moreover, stones of Ganesh Darwaja have fallen already. The wall of the Lakshmikothi has become weak. The Archaeological Survey of India needs to carry out the work at the earliest considering the increasing footfall of tourists after the reopening of the fort last month.” A section of the villagers said that there are seven security guards at the fort. “However, they are unable to control the crowd on the fort. Many tourists click selfies, photos, and shoot videos. One cannot rule out accidents. So, appointing more guards is necessary at the fort,” said Santosh Margale, another villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/concerned-residents-seek-repair-of-ganesh-darwaja-at-lohagad-fort/articleshow/87634444.cms||Sandip Dighe

The initiative, which started last month, is aimed at bringing citizens together to beautify the city. Participating in this campaign, volunteers, in collaboration with Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative, are removing posters and repainting the pillars of the flyover every Sunday for three hours in the morning. Wing Commander Puneet Sharma, founder, Swachh Pune Swachh Bharat, said, “We are taking the help of workers of Adar Poonawalla Clean City Initiative to apply base paint on all the 26 pillars of the Magarpatta flyover. Along with our volunteers, we are also requesting creative and artistically-inclined citizens to make the pillars their canvas. Even those who do not have any experience in painting are welcome to join us.” He said, “Due to the pandemic, we have been able to paint only one to two pillars every Sunday. With local residents extending support, we hope to complete the project by the end of December this year.” Core committee member Sathya Narayan said, “We figured out that the best way to keep the pillars clean and discourage people from spitting is through beautification.” Anuja Yadav, member of the citizens’ group, said, “Whoever wants to join our team can follow our Facebook page and get regular updates. All materials such as paints and brushes are provided at the venue. All you have to bring is your skill, energy and enthusiasm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/magarpatta-flyover-gets-a-colourful-makeover-through-citizen-initiative/articleshow/87634438.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Sources in the industry department said most of the MoUs would be in petrochemical sectors, which is being pushed to leverage opportunities emerging out of the Rs 43,000 crore refinery project being developed by HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd, a joint venture of the state government HPCL. Minerals would be another sector where MoUs are also expected to be signed during the visit. The state industries department is reaching out to the global investors coming to Dubai expo and sign MoUs there in advance as part of the ‘Invest Rajasthan’ investors’ summit.It is not clear if the investors, who will sign MoUs, would be attending the two-day summit in Jaipur. A source in the industries department said, “Since Dubai is a hub for investors in the petrochemical sector, the state government has chosen the expo as the occasion to showcase the opportunities for possible investments and ink MoUs.”The delegation will spend close to a week in Dubai and will engage with the investors. The source said that while MoUs worth Rs 5,000 crore has been finalized, efforts are on to convince more companies to come on board. A senior official in the industries department had told TOI that they are wary of giving out the proposed investment figures as often it has been experienced that they don’t get materialized on the ground.“We know the figures make good headline but we are trying to be realistic on the outcome. That why, besides MoUs, we will also ensure that groundbreaking events of projects take place during the investors’ summit in January.” RIICO is setting up a petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) in the vicinity of the Pachpadra oil refinery project in Barmer district. The PCPIR has the potential to catalyse investments of about Rs 15,000 crore in industries like polypropylene, thermoplastic polymer, butadiene, benzene and toluene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/14-member-raj-team-will-visit-dubai-likely-to-ink-pacts-of-up-to-rs-10k-crore/articleshow/87635909.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Covid impacting mental well-being||Lucknow: Covid-19 not only impacted the physical health but also the mental well-being of people worldwide. Even after several months since the second Covid wave, many people are still experiencing anxiety, stress and other forms of psychological distress as a long term impact of the viral disease. This, the psychologists insist, is appearing in people with or without real time triggers as the subconscious mind has become a platform for deep-seated anxiety and stress. And while some of these patients have had a history of mental health issues, others are those who experienced psychological disturbance only during Covid, which is continuing even after recovery. “A woman (30) revisited us with anxiety. The husband and wife had contracted Covid earlier in April-May and their two children were looked after by relatives at that time, which caused the wife anxiety. Now, after several months she deems herself incapable of taking care of the family when her husband is getting transferred to a new place for work. She has gone through similar situations previously and Covid induced anxiety has re-triggered after a gap,” said KGMU psychiatry department faculty Dr Adarsh Tripathi. He added that such behaviours are recurring in people even without an identifiable trigger . As per counselling psychologist Dr Neha Anand, a large percentage of the population is going through some or the other form of Post Covid Stress Disorder (PCSD) against the previously known Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). “The pandemic has caused chemical imbalance in the four most important neurochemicals of our brain. Endorphin, which is released with exercise, was cut down when our lives became sedentary. Oxytocin which gives us happiness with purpose and meaningfulness in life was affected. Serotonin, the mood stabilizer, was impacted with no social interactions and dopamine which is also a mix of the three happiness quotients was disrupted,” said Dr Anand. “The uncertainty of the pandemic has taken a toll. We all don’t follow the same timeline for physiological manifestations of these psychological changes which is true for those who feel they don’t see a current trigger to their anxiety, mood, palpitations or unexplained headaches etc,” she said. Joint director, State Mental Health unit, Dr Sunil Pandey added, “Between March 2020 and July 2020, we counselled over 60,000 people around similar issues. And the situation is true for even those who did not get Covid themselves, but also children not going to school, elderly who were not moving out and the young facing unemployment during the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-impacting-mental-well-being/articleshow/87635914.cms||Yusra Husain

No casualty was reported in the incident, said fire department officials, adding that cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. According to officials, the fire broke out at around 11.50pm at Sai Shraddha Apartment. The first two floors of the building, including the ground floor, were being used for commercial purposes. The ground floor has two establishments — one footwear shop owned by Ram Ramesh Bhoyar and another eating joint owned by Krushikesh Patel. Fire might have started from the ground floor which engulfed the first floor and then damaged the residential flats on second and third floors, said officials. Bhoyar’s footwear shop was completely gutted and the loss was estimated to be around Rs15 lakh. The food joint too caught fire and the loss was pegged at Rs30,000. However, the firefighters succeeded in containing the fire. The blaze also caught the bakery on the first floor. Refrigerator, bakery equipment, oven, computer, laptops and raw material worth Rs25 lakh were gutted. Before the fire gutted household items inside the flats, fire personnel succeeded in controlling the blaze. The firefighters of NMC’s fire and emergency services department also attended three more fire calls, including at two houses near Lokmanya Nagar Metro Station on Hingna Road, near Sadar Azad Chowk and a decoration firm in Navi Shukrawari on Tuesday night. The first fire erupted due to leakage in gas cylinders, second due to electric fault and the third because of bursting of firecrackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fire-at-building-destroys-property-worth-rs40l/articleshow/87634450.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Over 6,000 drivers fined for lane-cutting on Pune-Mumbai expressway||PUNE: The Pune unit of the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) cracked down on unsafe driving on the Pune-Mumbai expressway during a three-month-long special drive. The drive, held from August to October, focused on enforcing lane discipline and punishing errant drivers on the 40km stretch between Kiwale and Amrutanjan bridge. During the drive, the HSP fined 6,255 heavy vehicles Rs1,000 each for lane-cutting and 69,000 motorists — mainly car and light commercial vehicle drivers — for speeding. Lane-cutting invites a fine of Rs500, but the HSP tacked on a charge of rash driving as the drivers often cut lanes without a signal. The extra charge attracts a fine of Rs500, HSP officials said. An official from Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which controls the expressway, said 55,000-60,000 vehicles use the expressway per day and that 55% of these are light motor vehicles. “The number of heavy vehicles fined for lane-cutting may appear small in the overall context of the number using the expressway each day, but these are often responsible for causing accidents or endangering the lives of other expressway users as they move from one lane to other without giving any signal or observing lane discipline,” Sanjay Jadhav, Pune HSP’s superintendent of police, said. Jadhav said it was not possible for the HSP to post personnel throughout the high-speed corridor but said there will be sustained action against errant drivers. Heavy vehicles are supposed to drive on the third — or left — lane of the expressway and cannot move to the middle or the first lane. However, drivers often flout this norm and cause traffic snarls and accidents. Following the special drive, HSP has stepped up monitoring by its mobile teams at Khandala and Wadgaon, and announcements are being made through the PA system at toll plazas, said Jadhav. Light motor vehicles and heavy vehicles are supposed to adhere to the speed limit of 100kmph and 80kmph, respectively. A violation attracts a fine of Rs1,000. “If lane discipline is not followed, it will invite accidents and traffic jams. We found that smaller vehicles, like cars and SUVs, change lanes on spotting heavy vehicles on the first or second lane. Sometimes, cars and SUVs even go onto the shoulder lanes to overtake heavy vehicles. This is not acceptable in any situation,” he said. “Shoulder lanes can be used by motorists only if the vehicle breaks down or in case of deflated tyres. Many accidents have occurred on shoulder lanes involving cars and SUVs as they crash into stationary vehicles while overtaking heavy vehicles which occupy all three lanes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-6000-drivers-fined-for-lane-cutting-on-eway/articleshow/87634443.cms||---

The six-yearly election has been announced as the tenure of sitting MLC Satej Patil is set to end. The code of conduct has come into effect and the voting will be taking place on December 10. The elected members of local bodies forms the electorate for legislative council's local body constituency. Patil is going to be candidate of the Mahavikas Aghadi. After winning the Gokul dairy election recently, the confidence of MVA leaders is high. However, BJP is unlikely to make the election a cake walk for Patil, though the numbers are currently on his side. As many as 406 members of the local bodies will be eligible to cast vote. Since most of the local bodies have MVA in power, Patil expects it to win easily. A senior BJP leader, whose name is under discussion to fight the election, said on the condition of anonymity, “We are meeting on Thursday to discuss and find suitable candidate for the election. It is for sure that the candidate will contest on BJP symbol unlike the last time when we had an independent candidate supported by BJP. A strong candidate, in all sense, will be pitted against Patil.” The names which are doing rounds for the election from BJP camp are state vice-president Suresh Halvankar, Shoumika Mahadik, district president of Mahila Morcha the BJP's women wing, Rahul Awade, son of sitting independent MLA of Ichalkaranji Prakash Awade and three time MLC Mahadevrao Mahadik, who was defeated in last election by Patil.

Bote’s office released a report stating paddy harvest covering over 34 hectares, held by 221 farmers, in seven villages near BhimaShankar in Ambegaon taluka was destroyed in the recent rains. “As per the state government policy, farmers can receive compensation if rainfall is over 65mm. In this case, Ambegaon has recorded 13.8mm rainfall. So, the farmers are not eligible for the state government compensation. The rainfall has not crossed the 65mm mark anywhere in the district. The maximum rainfall of 30mm occurred in Khed tehsil,” said Bote. Bote said only farmers who have subscribed to crop insurance will get compensation. “We have told the tehsil agriculture staff to find out how many farmers have subscribed to the crop insurance policy,” he added. Officials from the Ambegaon agriculture office said paddy growers do not subscribe to crop insurance policy. “We do not have the capital to invest in crop policy. The government should consider this and give us compensation,” said Shankar Langhi, a paddy grower from Ahupe village. “It was our annual crop. We do not know how we will manage throughout the year,” said Sachin Lembe, another grower from Malin village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/insured-farmers-to-get-compensation/articleshow/87634451.cms||Sandip Dighe

Dubbed the 'Nazir Hoosein Memorial Drive' after the founder member of the Indian Automotive Racing Club, the rally started from Greater Noida on November 8 and will be following the same route as the Himalayan Car Rally of the 1980s. The rally set off from Mussoorie for its next leg on Wednesday. Motorists were flagged off by Uttarakhand tourism minister, Satpal Maharaj, from Welcomhotel The Savoy at Gandhi Chowk. The last rally that the hill station had witnessed was in the early 1980s. “We are glad that this rally is back on track after 40 years. It will go a long way in promoting tourism in the state. Our government will extend all possible support to ensure that this rally is a regular feature,” Maharaj said. A few motorists who had been associated with the rally 40 years back and are also a part of the current drive nostalgically remembered the experience of being in Mussoorie. “I was here for the rally in 1981. Although I could not participate in it back then, I am here 40 years later to relive those memories,” remarked Harish Samtani, a motorist. “We at The Savoy are delighted to host the rally after 40 years. Savoy was a regular pit stop on the Himalayan car rally route and we hope that the rally will continue for years to come,” said Nikki Gupta, director of the hotel. Several older residents of the town also recalled with fondness the joy of seeing cars from across the country converging at The Savoy during the 80s. Paralympian Deepa Malik, a member of Women in Motorsport Commission of India, who is also participating in the drive, said, “I am participating in this drive to celebrate the legacy of the Himalayan rally that was organised here 40 years ago. I am also here to encourage women to explore career options in motorsports.” Motorists will be following the same route as that of the 1980s rally. They had their first stopover at Lansdowne on Monday, followed by a halt at The Savoy on Tuesday. They headed toward Kufri on Wednesday and on Thursday, will traverse the Jalorie Pass before stopping at Manali. Thereafter, they will cross over the Rohtang Pass before concluding the drive at Manali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/car-rally-passes-through-mussoorie-after-40-yrs-90-vehicles-flagged-off-by-ukhand-tourism-minister/articleshow/87634455.cms||Anmol Jain

The complainant is Dishant Patel, 25, a resident of Gota. His complaint was filed on Tuesday. Patel said he has been in contact with Soni for two years. Soni claimed that he organized tours and had an office in Naroda. Soni had sent some people from Patel’s village on a pilgrimage. Patel said that Ghyanshyam Patel, his cousin, is to be married on November 29 in Goa. Patel had asked Soni to book air tickets for a group from Ahmedabad to Goa. The payment of Rs 3 lakh was made in May for the bookings and in June Soni asked for another Rs 60,000 which Ghyanshyam paid. Patel said in June Soni told him that he was organizing a tour to Maldives and the charge was Rs 35,000 per person. Patel and eight of his friends booked spots in the tour and paid Rs 15,000 in advance. Soni assured them that the trip could be made anytime within a year. Patel said Rs 1.35 lakh was paid to Soni for 17 persons. But Soni never gave a receipt though Patel and his friends continually asked for it. Soni claimed that a couple he had sent to Goa were so satisfied with the organization of the holiday that they paid him Rs 6.03 lakh for the Maldives experience. When Soni finally gave Patel and his friends the tickets, they realized all the bookings were bogus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/baiting-with-beach-rs-13l-con-over-goa-maldives-trips/articleshow/87634453.cms||---

The Kovilpalayam police said the shop was run by V Sunitha, a resident of Ganapathy in the city. A police officer said Sunitha’s son Amarnath was an accused in a murder case that was reported at Gandhi Maa Nagar recently. “He was part of the gang that murdered K Ashok Kumar over a previous enmity last week. We suspect Kumar’s friends would have hurled the crude bomb at the shop to threaten his family members.” The officer said CCTV cameras in the area had captured the footage of two bike-borne men hurling the petrol bomb at the shop and speeding away. “A few clothes caught fire in the incident and the shop employees put out the fire immediately and alerted us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/petrol-bomb-hurled-at-textile-shop-probe-on/articleshow/87635270.cms||---

Patient had accidentally consumed acid and had his food pipe damaged badly. According to doctors at AIIMS, this is the first instance in the world where a complete robotic surgery was successfully done for damaged food pipe by acid intake. Due to precise robotic technique and control, the patient had less bleeding during surgery and less pain after surgery. He started being given food four days after the surgery and was discharged six days after the surgery. Doctors removed the damaged food pipe robotically and replaced it with a new food pipe created from the stomach, called as ‘Ivor-Lewis’ operation in medical terms. This complicated surgery was done by only four 8mm incisions at the department of surgical gastroenterology. Professor M K Garg, the medical superintendent of AIIMS, said that the person had consumed acid nine months back leading to damage of food pipe. “Due to this damage, he was unable to eat and was being fed through a tube inserted into abdomen,” Garg said. Commonly, the surgery for this condition is done by long incisions at neck, chest and abdomen which cause significant pain causing slow recovery from surgery and long unsightly scars after surgery. Garg said that the idea to do the case completely using a robot was made by the surgical team of the department of surgical gastroenterology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/robotic-surgery-helps-repair-food-pipe-at-aiims-jodhpur/articleshow/87635920.cms||---

This would be the sixth time that a woman has led the parade since the inception of the police academy. National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval would be the chief guest at the parade of 149 probationers, which includes 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees, SVPNPA director Atul Karwal told a press conference on Wednesday. Punjab cadre Dr Darpan Ahluwalia would be leading the parade as she was the overall topper of basic course phase-I training. In all, there were 27 women IPS officers and 4 women foreign officer trainees in the probationers’ batch of 2020. This batch would be sent to France as part of the training programme, Karwal said. SVPNPA authorities were also in talks with officials in the United States to enable training for IPS probationers there. Following the phase-I training and the passing-out parade, these probationers would be given charge of a police station for three months. Subsequently, they would return to the academy after the first-hand experience for phase-2 of training. This was the scheme of things till 2014 and the academy returned to this pattern again this year. From 2015-2020, the parade used to be held after probationers completed both phases of training. During their on field work at the academy, they were trained on AK-47, sniper shooting and rocket launchers. About 90% passed out as sharpshooters. Khaki in their family spurred them to dream:The khaki dream took wings for some of these IPS probationers at home itself. For George Allen John from Kerala, who did his MBBS, the inspiration to write UPSC came from his IPS officer sister and bureaucrat father. . “My father was a chairman of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC).

---||Aurangabad||5 booked for usurping retired cop’s Rs 2.1cr land compensation||Aurangabad: A total of five people, including two lawyers from Yavatmal district, have been booked by city police on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery and criminal conspiracy, after they allegedly forged documents and usurped Rs 2.11 crore that a retired superintendent of police (SP) rank officer had received in compensation against his land acquired by the state. An offence under nine different sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at Pundalik nagar police station against the suspects, including complainant Hirasingh Jadhav’s three relatives. Jadhav said that after being duped earlier this year in January, he made several rounds of the police station and met senior police officers, but in vain. “The retired police officer was compelled to move court for getting his FIR registered against the suspects as the police officers across the hierarchy in the city failed to take cognizance of his complaint,” Jadhav’s lawyer Prashant Nagargoje said. Police said that based on the directives of judicial magistrate first class DS Wamne issued on Monday, an offence against the suspects was registered. Jadhav in his complaint has stated that his land was acquired by National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) for ‘Nagpur Tuljapur’ national highway. Against this acquisition, he was awarded a sum of Rs 2.11 crore as compensation. According to Jadhav, his relatives had come to his N-4 based residence in January during which they obtained his signatures on some documents on the pretext of completing some procedure. Later the suspect relatives, which include a serving police constable, allegedly with the help of two advocates allegedly forged the documents including notary documents and used the same for withdrawing the money. The complaint has also made allegations against police officers for failing to register a criminal offence despite complainant taking a follow-up with the senior police officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/5-booked-for-usurping-retired-cops-rs-2-1cr-land-compensation/articleshow/87632694.cms||---
---||Pune||No takers for 81k minority pre-matric scholarships||Pune: Change in schools, migration and also benefit of other government scholarships has found few takers for the pre-matric scholarship scheme provided by the state directorate of adult and minority education. About 81,000 scholarships were not applied to by the students this year. An amount of less than Rs 500 is transferred directly to the beneficiary’s bank account once the student is eligible for the scholarship, but the change in school as a result of migration to native place has been the major cause for poor application. The adult and minorities education department has reported that nearly 81,695 beneficiaries have not opted for the scholarship this year. Director of the department, Dinkar Temkar, said, “Due to the pandemic and online schooling many students moved to their home towns. So, these students have changed their schools or their applications were not received.” The scholarship at pre-matric level has been introduced by the Union ministry of minority affairs to encourage parents from minority communities to send their school going children to school. The scheme will form the foundation for their educational attainment and provide a level playing field in the competitive employment arena. Empowerment through education, which is one of the objectives of this scheme, has the potential to lead to upliftment of the socio economic conditions of the minority communities. Temkar said, “Some schools are only till Std V or VIII, so to pursue further education students have to change their schools. Once they change schools, students tend to take advantage of some other scholarship scheme.” Scholarship is awarded to the students who have secured 50% marks in the previous final exam and annual income of from all sources does not exceed Rs 1 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-takers-for-81k-minority-pre-matric-scholarships/articleshow/87634470.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Passengers relieved as pvt buses ply on ST routes||Nagpur: As the strike by MSRTC employees across the state entered 14th day, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) on Wednesday operated private buses on several routes including Gondia, Bhandara, Katol, Amravati, Chandrapur, Wardha, Gadchiroli and other places. Total 350 buses ferried 10,000 passengers, as per officiating regional transport officer Ravindra Bhuyar. Amid heavy police bandobast, the RTO team led by motor vehicle inspector Anand Mohod resumed the bus service from outside the ST depot in Ganeshpeth, bringing relief to passengers, especially those travelling to rural areas and interior places from Nagpur. Initially, the RTO launched the operations from outside the Ganeshpeth depot. However, citing high court’s order not allowing private bus operation within the periphery of 200m from ST stand, the Nagpur city police led by senior PI (traffic) Hanmant Urlagondawar shifted the operations to nearby roads. The move caused some inconvenience to commuters who had to walk a longer distance to board a bus. Passengers welcomed the move to ply private buses on MSRTC routes but pointed out that the service should have resumed from inside the Ganeshpeth bus depot. TOI spotted passengers facing difficulty in locating the buses and even the police and transport department employees seemed helpless. No control room or helpline centre was found at the ST stand. The private buses engaged by RTO were also ferrying passengers on routes like Butibori, Koradi, Kamptee, where Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is providing Aapli Bus service. Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said he has directed the local office to look into the matter, but till late evening no decision. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar too assured to resolve the issue. Though the RTO is monitoring movement of private buses, many operators allegedly fleeced the passengers. Many passengers told TOI that the operators are charging exorbitant fares on routes like Bhandara, Gondia and Wardha. ST employees said that they would continue with their strike until their demands are met. ST driver Pravin Ghughe, who is among those leading the agitation, said that they would not take law and order in their hands while ruling out opposition to ply private buses. The employees are hopeful that the state government will fulfil their demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/passengers-relieved-as-pvt-buses-ply-on-st-routes/articleshow/87634483.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Pune||Proposal tabled to give civic jobs to relatives of missing officials||Pune: A proposal was recently tabled before the Pune Municipal Corporation’s general body to make relatives of “missing” civic staffers eligible for jobs in the civic administration. If any staff member remains absent from work for five years, s/he is declared a “missing official”. The family members of these employees will be able to approach the PMC for a suitable job after the policy is approved. A decision in this direction was taken to give some relief to the missing employees’ relatives, who were suffering from losing the family member and also the bread winner. The policy regarding recruiting the relatives of missing staffers was approved by the law committee and the standing committee. The general body’s (GB) nod was awaited now. Shivaji Daundkar, a senior official of the PMC’s labour department, said, “The proposal has been tabled before the GB for the final nod. The policy would be implemented once the GB gives a green signal. The pending recruitment cases can be speeded up after its approval.” The draft policy stated the relatives would have to make sure that they comply with certain norms. Documents proving the relationship between the missing staff and the job applicant were a must. The defination of missing person is considered as per the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. After seven years, a missing person is considered to be dead and a death certificate is issued on their name. It can be used for applying for jobs in the PMC under compassionate grounds by his/her descendents. The PMC’s policy states the missing staffer’s family should file an FIR within one month of the employee missing. Daundkar said 22 civic employees have gone missing in recent years. Their family members have been following up for jobs. Their files can be cleared once the policy is approved. According to the policy, the family members aged between 18 and 45 years would be eligible for the job. If the employee has three children (even if one is born after December 31, 2001), then those missing employees’ kin would not be considered for the scheme. “A minimum service period before retirement” has been made mandatory to be eligible for the scheme. When the employee goes missing, if the service period remaining for their retirement is less than two years, then his relatives will not be included in the scheme, stated the policy document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proposal-tabled-to-give-civic-jobs-to-relatives-of-missing-officials/articleshow/87634457.cms||---
---||Pune||Demand to implement tax waiver scheme||Pune: A group of ex-servicemen demanded that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s property discount scheme, introduced for them, should be implemented at the earliest. The group — Soldiers Independent Rehabilitation Foundation (SIRF) — conducted a press conference on Wednesday pressing for their demand. “All municipal corporations across the state are giving this scheme’s benefits, except PMC. It is very unbecoming. The ex-serviceman housing federation is trying to take constant follow up, but is not getting any response from the authorities,” said Sumedha Chithade, secretary of SIRF. The government had announced the scheme, “Balasaheb Thackeray Maji Sainik Sanman Yojana”, to give property tax discount on houses owned by ex-servicemen and war widows. The PMC’s GB in June approved the tax waiver proposal to ex-servicemen with added benefits. As per state’s proposal, a discount was proposed only in general tax section of the property tax. But elected members unanimously decided to give total waiver. So effectively, beneficiaries will not have any tax now. The officials said some of the tax collected by PMC goes to state. So, if PMC has to give total tax discount, clearance from the state would be needed. “The process of getting the clearance is under way. It will be completed soon and the scheme would be implemented accordingly,” said Vilas Kanade, head of PMC’s property tax department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-to-implement-tax-waiver-scheme/articleshow/87634460.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot meets Central leaders amid buzz of cabinet rejig||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot holding discussion with AICC leaders in New Delhi on Wednesday has heightened the expectations of an imminent cabinet expansion and state-level political appointments. A long three-hour meeting was held at the residence of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the evening. It was attended by chief minister Gehlot, AICC general secretary organisation K C Venugopal, state general secretary incharge Ajay Maken and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi. Maken said, “the meeting discussed the overall political situation in the state and a road map ahead for the party towards retaining power in the state (in 2023).” He said a lot of clarity had been achieved after the meeting. Maken, however, evaded a direct reply on the cabinet reshuffle saying “the good news will come soon.” He said the meeting also discussed the bypoll results and much expected cabinet expansion and political appointments in detail. According to sources, the expansion was likely to take place next week once governor Kalraj Mishra returns to the state after attending the governors’ conference in Delhi. Meanwhile, Sachin Pilot said he had met Venugopal, Maken in Delhi on Wednesday and apprised them of the political situation in the state. He expressed hope that the much-needed cabinet reshuffle and political appointments would happen soon. He claimed Congress workers who had toiled hard to bring back the party back to power in the state should get respect and recognition as there is hardly two years left for the government to complete its term. Currently, there are nine vacancies to be filled in the council of ministers, while two more may arise if the recently appointed AICC in-charges of poll-bound Gujarat and Punjab are dropped from the Gehlot cabinet. Medical and health minister Raghu Sharma and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary were recently appointed as party incharges of poll bound Gujarat and Punjab, respectively. The Gehlot government, which will complete its third year in office in December, is under pressure to accommodate the faction led by Pilot, former BSP legislators merged with the ruling party and supporting Independent MLAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-meets-central-leaders-amid-buzz-of-cabinet-rejig/articleshow/87635922.cms||---

District collector G S Sameeran said the holiday was announced only for schools, and colleges would function as usual. Schoolteachers also need not go to the schools on the day, he said. Sameeran said they had set up a war room at the district collectorate and that would function round the clock to tackle the rain-related issues. The collector said they had identified 21 vulnerable places that require attention, if heavy rain were to lash the district. “We have established contacts with the people there and dispatched ration materials in advance. We have also identified and deployed 1,858 first responders to act swiftly, if the situation calls for rescue measures.” Dr Darez Ahamed, monitoring officer for the district, said the administration was well prepared to face any eventuality. “Emergency contact numbers have been established for the people to contact for any help. We will inspect all vulnerable areas, including the ones at Valparai.” City corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, meanwhile, said electric motors and men were deployed at places such as Avinashi Road flyover, where waterlogging is usually reported, to drain out water immediately. “We have identified 65 low-lying areas in the city limits and set up as many relief camps to shift people, if required.” He said the waterlogging issue at Ramanathapuram Junction on Trichy Road was addressed by facilitating free flow of Valankulam surplus water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-to-remain-shut-today-as-well/articleshow/87635280.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra districts asked to use social media to boost Covid-19 vaccination||MUMBAI: With 26% of Maharashtra's eligible population yet to get a single shot, districts have been asked to proceed at full throttle in the next 20 days by roping in sports personalities, celebrities, army personnel or any local influencer who can motivate people to take their jabs. They have also been asked to target the weekly local bazaars in a big way to build awareness and deploy Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp to tackle any myths and misconceptions ahead of drives. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, dashed a letter to districts on Tuesday asking them to activate the ‘Mission Indradhanush Approach’, an intensified strategy that was adopted nationally in pre-Covid times to cover every left out women and children who failed to get immunised against 12 vaccine-preventable diseases. The same strategy will be used now to knock on doors and vaccinate people against Covid, Dr Vyas said. The state has set a target to vaccinate the remaining eligible population of 2.3 crore people with at least one shot by November 30. Outlining what districts must do, the letter has specified that district immunization officers will create micro-plans based on details of unvaccinated individuals. Smaller teams composed of ASHAs, auxiliary nurses and midwives (ANMs), line workers and other support staff will be handed out the lists of people who have not taken the first dose. The names of those who have skipped the second dose too will be extracted from Co-Win and given to the teams. These teams would reach out to the families, register and vaccinate them. For a wider reach, districts have been asked to target weekly bazaars both for creating awareness and vaccinating people. The state has also asked districts to deploy all popular social media channels, including Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and Facebook to quash any misconceptions against vaccination or to tackle rumours ahead of drives. “These mediums must also be used to share the positive experiences of persons who are vaccinated already,” Vyas said. The letter to districts comes days after Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to states asking them to initiate the Har Ghar Dastak Campaign from November 3 till November 30. In addition to creating 'vaccination tolis', Bhushan suggested intra-state competitions to be held between teams to motivate them. He said states could develop a ranking mechanism of identifying the best performers and felicitate them. Vyas, however, cautioned that vaccine wastage should be minimal. “While going house-to-house, it should be ensured that vaccine wastage is minimal and all protocols related to maintenance of cold chain, prescribed temperature, safe injections, waste disposal, and reporting of adverse effects are followed diligently,” he said. Recently, it was observed that vaccinate wastage rates had gone up in several districts in the range of 3-12%. Maharashtra completed administering 10 crore doses on Tuesday. It has given at least one dose to 74% and both doses to 35% of its eligible population of 9.14 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-districts-asked-to-use-social-media-to-boost-vaccination/articleshow/87635956.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Delhi||Delhi: 21-year-old stalker held for attacking woman with blade||NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly attacking a woman with a shaving blade and snatching her cellphone in north Delhi’s Timarpur. The youth was stalking the woman for sometime and trying to force her to befriend him. He had also injured her in April this year. The arrested man, Sushil alias Ponta, is a resident of Wazirabad. Police are verifying his criminal antecedents. On Tuesday, the complainant was going to drop off her two children for tuition at Nehru Vihar when Sushil reached there on a motorcycle and forced her to ride pillion. “The woman said she accompanied him due to fear. Sushil then took her to a lonely stretch where, following an argument, he attacked her with a shaving blade and injured her on the neck. As she shouted for help, locals gathered and Sushil ran away. He even snatched her phone before fleeing,” said a senior police officer. A case of stalking, theft and attempt to murder was registered against Sushil on the woman’s complaint. A police team then started technical investigation and questioned informers to get clues about the suspect. “Acting on a tip-off, Sushil was arrested from Gopalpur on Wednesday. A motorcycle, the shaving blade used in the crime and the cellphone of the victim was seized from him. During interrogation, he said he was friendly with the woman, but for the last few months she had been ignoring him. This annoyed him. This is why he had attacked her in April. When she continued to ignore him, he assaulted her again and tried to kill her,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/21-year-old-stalker-held-for-attacking-woman-with-blade/articleshow/87655079.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Green fuel to power entire Kolkata public vehicle fleet by 2030||KOLKATA: The city’s entire public transport will run on clean fuel — electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) — by 2030, said state’s transport minister Firhad Hakim on Wednesday. By public transport, he meant the bus fleet — both private and state transport undertakings (STUs), taxis and autos. This is certainly an ambitious departure from his earlier stance, when he set a 2030 target for the entire STU fleet to be EV only. Hakim was speaking at a panel discussion on accelerating electric mobility with green jobs and gender parity organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. While detailing the success story of e-vehicles in public transport, Hakim said, “100 electric buses are plying in the city. STUs will be acquiring 1,000 more e-buses shortly, besides the only surviving tram network which has been operational since 1880. Also, 300 STU diesel buses are being converted into dedicated CNG buses.” The possibility of CNG supply through a pipeline has gained momentum after intervention of the National Green Tribunal. “We will also convert the entire fleet of private buses to dedicated CNG buses in a phased manner.” Significantly, the state is actively thinking of giving financial aid for facilitating the shift from diesel to CNG. The promised shift will do enormous good to the city’s environment, as well to India’s commitment to keep global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial level and to secure net-zero emission by 2050. The state has set an ambitious target to be among the top three best states in India in terms of electric mobility penetration by 2030. Director general of International Solar Alliance Ajay Mathur appreciated the state’s ambitious move towards cleaner fuel and said, “Adoption of electric vehicles will generate jobs double that of IC engine vehicle manufacturing and it will facilitate higher mobility of women.” The Bengal government in its EV policy targeted 10 lakh EVs combined across all segments by 2030 with 1 lakh charging stations. In the EV policy, Kolkata, Asansol, Darjeeling and Howrah have already been declared model EM cities with phase-wise goals to adopt EV charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and new EV-enabling building codes, where at 20% parking must be earmarked for EVs.

---||Kolhapur||Former honorary wildlife warden writes to Uddhav||Kolhapur: Former honorary wildlife warden of Satara Rohan Bhate and member of wildlife crime control bureau Nana Khamkar have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, appealing for the transfer of newly-declared conservation reserves in Kolhapur forest division from territorial to wildlife wing along with reorganizing various range offices and sanctioning Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF). Bhate said, “The conservation reserves namely Chandgad, Dodamarg-Amboli, Ajara-Bhudargad, Gagan Bawda, Panhalgad, Vishalgad, Jor-Jambhali and Mayani will strengthen wildlife corridor between Kali Tiger Reserve in Karnataka to Bhimashankar in Maharashtra.” He added, “These reserves in Kolhapur forest division need to be moved from territorial wing to wildlife wing and to reorganize the ranges in the region so that the pending STPF deployment in the region can be feasible. This will also bring the entire region under the protection and guarding of SPTF. This in turn will control wildlife crime and illegal bauxite mining.” Meanwhile, Khamkar, while talking to TOI, said, “The move will greatly help in preserving the corridor between Kali and Sahyadri tiger reserves. As all the conservation reserves will come under the purview of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, it would be appropriate to transfer the areas from the territorial wing to wildlife wing. This will help in the unified control of the entire corridor area which will be beneficial in the management of the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/former-honorary-wildlife-warden-writes-to-uddhav/articleshow/87632713.cms||---

Explaining how the smart valves will work, NKDA officials said once the reservoirs get full, the valves will receive a signal through the sensors and close to stop water from entering the reservoirs. Once the reservoir water is pumped out for supply and the level reduces to half, the valves will again receive a signal and reopen to allow water to flow in. Officials said that an experiment has already been carried out on this as a pilot project to see how the system works. “It has been noticed that about 34% of water is being saved by using this method. The water pressure is also increasing as it is properly getting supplied to the other reservoirs as well. The project is to be rolled out soon,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smart-valves-at-new-town-reservoirs-to-stop-wastage/articleshow/87634473.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Ramnagesh Akubathini (23), a native of Ranga Reddy district who worked with a Bengaluru-based startup, had continuously altered his profile on social media to troll the cricketer before he was finally tracked down. Akubathini’s father said his son passed out of IIT Hyderabad two years ago. He was in his hometown at the time of the arrest as his employer had allowed him to work from home during the pandemic. Akubathini was picked up by a Mumbai police team. The cyber police station at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) has booked him under Indian Penal Code sections 354(A) (sexual harassment), 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation) and under Information Technology Act sections 67, 67(B) (punishment for publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in the sexually explicit act, in electronic form). He will be produced before the Esplanade Court on Thursday. A cyber police officer said the accused used fake names on social media to cover his tracks while issuing the threats. “He was using technical means to conceal his identity in the online space to make it difficult for the investigation agency to trace him,” said the officer. Akubathini trolled the cricketer and his wife and threatened to sexually assault their nine-year-old daughter for coming out in support of a team mate following the match against Pakistan which India lost. “Attacking someone over their religion is the most pathetic thing one can do as a human,” the cricketer had said. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambe said a police team has brought the suspect to Mumbai. “People think they can go scot free by hiding their identity on social media and using a fake profiles. Cyber team is equipped to track them," said DCP (Mumbai-cyber) Dr Rashmi Karandikar. Delhi Commission for Women has taken suo motu note of tweet and asked cops to file FIR and arrest accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-techie-held-for-rape-threats-to-star-cricketers-daughter/articleshow/87636295.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The number of cases too have risen to 13,059. In 2019, when the state reported 13,709 dengue cases, it was a major outbreak in a decade. In 2021, the dengue outbreak is set to surpass the 2019 figures. In five days (November 4 to 8), the state added 1,146 more cases, taking the overall tally to 13,059. During the same period, three more dengue deaths happened, taking the toll to 31 in 2021. Jaipur, Kota and Jodhpur and Alwar are among the districts which have reported 496 new dengue cases from November 4 to 8, and accounted for 43% of the total cases reported in the same duration. The health department teams are focusing on the districts which are reporting more cases for containing the spread of dengue. Despite the intensified activities, the vector-borne menace in different parts of the state is still continuing. However, the health authorities claimed that the cases of dengue have started declining and that it is now not being reported in the numbers which it was reporting few days ago. A health department official said that they are conducting anti-larvae activities and also taking measures for preventing breeding of mosquitoes. The health department has also been expanding its facilities for diagnosing dengue. The health teams visiting door-to-door in areas marked as highly-sensitive areas for dengue are also taking blood samples of the people who are suffering from fever. Timely treatment is the key to preventing complications, and for this purpose, separate orders have been issued by the health department for collecting blood samples of those who have fever, during door-to-door surveys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dengue-death-toll-rises-to-31-in-raj-cases-breach-13k-mark/articleshow/87635945.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Dip in diesel rates brings down vegetable prices across Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Slash in diesel prices and winter season vegetables entering the market has led to a drop in vegetable prices across the city. The diesel prices in the city have come down from Rs 107 per litre to Rs 94 per litre in the last few weeks. Until a month ago, one kg of lady’s finger, tomatoes, carrot and brinjal cost close to Rs 60 and above. Now, the prices of these vegetables have dropped below Rs 50 a kg, giving much-needed relief to consumers. “Earlier, I was not able to sell the entire stock by the end of the day because consumers were purchasing limited vegetables. Now, I am able to sell almost 90 per cent of my stock with only a bit of wastage,” said Venu Gopal, a vegetable vendor at Kapra. Green vegetables such as spinach and fenugreek, which suffered the biggest casualties of incessant rains, have also made a comeback to the city markets. Even cauliflower, which was extinct from the Rythu Bazaars, is being sold now. “Not only are more variety of vegetables available in the market, the quality has also slightly improved in the last two weeks,” said Annapurna C, a resident of AC Guards in Masab Tank. According to officials, the vegetables are set to come down further by December as new crops from various districts in Telangana are set to flood the city markets. “Currently, close to 60 per cent of the vegetables are arriving from other states such as Karnataka, Maharashtra among others. We can expect more vegetables to arrive from nearby districts in the next few weeks,” said an official from the agriculture marketing department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dip-in-diesel-rates-brings-down-veggie-prices/articleshow/87635292.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Can keep to Mar-Apr Tallah reopening deadline: Min||Kolkata: The Tallah bridge will be inaugurated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee by the end of March or in early April, said PWD minister Moloy Ghatak. The Public Works Department (PWD) is trying to finish the residual work of the bridge with shifting of the railway quarters being underway. The railway quarters fell in the path of the ramp of the bridge linking Cossipore Road.Ghatak said the state had already released Rs 11 crore for the relocation of the staff quarters a few months ago. The Railways has started the work of relocation and work is now on track “We are hopeful of completing the work by March,” Ghatak said. Atin Ghosh, an MLA from Cossipore-Belgachhia, raised the issue of delay in construction at the state Assembly on Tuesday and sought Ghatak’s intervention at his level in taking up the matter with the Eastern Railway authorities. In reply, Ghatak assured fast-track completion of the bridge which involves a cost of Rs 350 crore. Ghatak said construction had been stuck for the last few months because of the 38 railway quarters that had come in the way. The entire staff quarters needs to be relocated for PWD to start its construction work. The new bridge will have a wider and longer ramp to connect Cossipore Road with the upcoming Tallah Bridge for smooth movement of vehicles from Shyambazar to Dunlop.A crucial 240-metre section of the 750m new bridge will stand over the Tallah tracks in the ER zone. ER’s chief bridge engineer has already passed the design and drawings relating to the girder launching. PWD had been expecting the girder launching to start this month.Initially, there was a delay in getting permission from the Commissioner of Railway Safety regarding construction of pillars for the project. At present, steel girders made by Larsen & Toubro at Panagarh are awaiting the clearance of the ER authorities so that they can be commissioned at the site. “Work will be delayed unless we get the nod from ER,” said Ghosh.The dismantling work of the 57-year-old Tallah Bridge, which was a crucial link between Kolkata and the northern fringes, had begun in February 2020 after RITES and, most importantly, Bridge and Cons-truction expert V K Raina recommended pulling down the structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-keep-to-mar-apr-tallah-reopening-deadline-min/articleshow/87634504.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

---||Nagpur||Munna Yadav to file Re1 defamation case against Malik for calling him ‘goonda’||Nagpur: Former chairman of Maharashtra Buildings and Other Construction Worker’s Welfare Board (MBOCWWB) Omprakash Munna Yadav has shot back at state minister Nawab Malik referring to him as a ‘notorious criminal’ and a ‘close aide’ of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis.Hours after NCP spokesperson Malik’s press meet in Mumbai on Wednesday morning, where he accused former chief minister Fadnavis for shielding goons like Yadav, the latter warned that he would file a defamation case against Malik. “I would be speaking to Fadnavis and then file a defamation suit of Re1 against the minister, as per his standard, within a couple of days. I have already spoken to city chief Pravin Datke in this regard and would be taking an appointment with my lawyer.”Malik had accused Fadnavis of going out of the way to elevate Yadav, who faces several criminal charges, to the top post of labour board, which is equivalent to a state minister’s rank. Yadav was absconding for six months in 2018 after he and his family, including wife and two sons, were booked for allegedly attacking his brother’s family in October 2017. He came back only after the Supreme Court granted him anticipatory bail.Challenging Maharashtra skill development minister Malik to prove the charges levelled by him, Yadav said he would take retirement from politics if they were proved, but the latter should resign if he fails to prove them. “Malik has become restless after Fadnavis dropped the bomb and exposed badly his links with the underworld. He definitely has links with terrorist groups. His so-called hydrogen bomb turned out to be a farce. If proper inquiry is conducted against him on charges levelled by Fadnavis, he would soon find himself behind bars.”On Malik’s charge of offences were lodged against him, Yadav said all of those were either related to political demonstrations or family feuds. “There are no offences against me of looting, dacoity or molestation. There’s no denying the fact that I am close to Fadnavis, as I have been working with the BJP for the last 25 years and he is our leader from the area. Me and my wife were both corporators from the area for the last two decades, and it is obvious that we are in regular touch with him.”Asserting that he had no connection with the underworld, Yadav targetted Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s former ministers. “Malik does not have any right to defame me when NCP’s former home minister Anil Deshmukh is behind bars while another minister Sanjay Rathod was forced to resign. He is misusing my name to target Fadnavis. As far as offences lodged against me, they were registered when my rivals in civic polls attacked me. Then my supporters had clashed with his supporters.”Speaking of his stint with MBOCWWB, Yadav said he helped the board reach new heights, as it was relatively unknown before he took over. “Due to my efforts, crores of rupees were directly deposited into labourers accounts. We distributed labour kits to thousands of them. We helped them financially in educating their wards and during delivery of their wives. In my tenure, the labour registrations jumped to 19 lakh from two lakh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/munna-yadav-to-file-re1-defamation-case-against-malik-for-calling-him-goonda/articleshow/87633570.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On Tuesday morning, vegetable trader Jesinh Solanki had lodged a complaint with Morbi police that he was looted of Rs 6.1 lakh at knife-point. He also said the looted money was meant to purchase onions from the market. Police said that Solanki has admitted that he had planned the robbery as he had to pay money to several people. During investigation, police became suspicious because of Solanki’s behaviour and his response to questions posed by cops. When cops continued asking him tricky questions, Solanki’s lie was exposed and he admitted that his nephew Praful alias Pappu Solanki had robbed him along with his friend. Solanki told police that he had to repay money to several people as he had suffered a loss in business. His pick-up van too was mortgaged so to avoid paying money to people, Solanki hatched the robbery plan. As per the plan, Solanki deliberately parked his vehicle outside a hotel where a CCTV camera was installed and Praful and his friend could be seen taking money from him at knife-point. On Wednesday, Solanki was booked for giving false information to police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/robbery-on-vegetable-trader-turns-out-to-be-fake/articleshow/87633583.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Migration turns 60 villages into ‘ghost villages’ in Pithoragarh||PITHORAGARH: Owing to large-scale migration, almost 60 villages in Pithoragarh, which shares a border with Nepal and China, have transformed into ‘ghost villages’. There was a time when these villages had a sizable number of residents with agriculture being the backbone of their economy. Now, according to the land records available in the revenue department, almost every tehsil of the hill district has a ghost village. Harish Giri, district land record officer, told TOI, “The eight development blocks in the district are made up of 1,400 villages. Among these blocks, the maximum of 14 ghost villages is located in Gangolihat, followed by 13 ghost villages each in Berinag and Munakot, six in Didihat, four each in Munsyari and Dharchula, three in Kanalichhina, and two in Bin.” When asked about the reasons behind migration from these villages, Gopal Giri Goswami, district development officer, Pithoragarh, said, “Lack of road connectivity and employment opportunities are the major causes driving people out of these villages.” Echoing similar sentiments, Prakesh Pande, a resident of the district's Bhatad village said, “People have been migrating to other parts of the state and outside in search of better infrastructure and job opportunities. Besides, the lack of health and education facilities is also prompting locals to move to urban centres.” He added that agricultural lands have become barren in these villages and wild animals like leopards can often be found roaming around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/migration-turns-60-villages-into-ghost-villages-in-border-district-of-pithoragarh/articleshow/87634513.cms||Prem Punetha

Goud was the handler of Jollu Shiva during the alleged encounter in Chattanpally on December 6, 2019. He told the panel that as per ACP V Surender’s orders he was holding Shiva’s left hand with his right when the accused picked up soil with his right, threw it in his eyes, pushed and attacked with a stick multiple times before escaping. When asked if it was correct to say he had failed to discharge his duty as the accused managed to escape, Goud responded: “At that time I had soil in my eyes. I was injured in my hand. I tried to catch the accused and did not permit him to escape voluntarily.” “I had received a strong blow to my left shoulder. I was also hit on my head. I had heard firing sound for the first time. I did not know what was happening. I felt my head spinning and I lost consciousness,” Goud added. On his condition subsequently, Goud said he didn’t know what the doctors wrote at the hospital when the commission’s advocate asked if it was correct that “at 9am on December 6 the doctors had noted you were conscious, coherent and stable?”. He was also asked about the Call Data Record (CDR) of his mobile showing no incoming or outgoing calls on December 5. “Does it not appear strange?” the commission asked and Goud replied: “I can’t say.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-lapse-accused-escapedafter-attacking-says-cop/articleshow/87635308.cms||Mahesh Buddi

To mark the moment, an event was organised at National Gallery of Modern Art. Brought back with the help of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the idol would be placed inside Kashi Vishwanath temple. After crossing Aligarh on November 11, Kannauj on November 12 and Ayodhya on November 14, it would finally reach Varanasi on November 15. “The idol, illegally lifted by Canadian art collector and lawyer Norman MacKenzie from a Kashi temple 108 years ago, was returned to India on October 15,” a senior official at ASI’s headquarters Dharohar Bhavan at Tilak Marg, where the idol was kept before being returned to UP, told TOI. ASI said the statue was returned with the help of the Consulate General office in Canada. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the return of this idol from Canada in his “Mann Ki Baat” on November 29, 2020. Two years ago, Canada-based artist Divya Mehra noticed a sculpture at MacKenzie Art Gallery at University of Regina represented as Lord Vishnu while researching on the collection and it struck her as a female, holding a bowl of rice. When she checked the records, she found that the same sculpture was stolen from a temple in Kashi in 1913. Union culture minister G Kishan Reddy applauded ASI for the feat and said, “Soon, the central government will hand over two idols to Tamil Nadu, one to Andhra Pradesh and one to Rajasthan.” MoS for external affairs and culture Meenakshi Lekhi and ASI officials were also present at the event to officially hand over the statue to UP. Meanwhile, of the 157 Indian heritage artefacts and antiquities handed over to the PM during his recent visit to the US, 63 were returned to India late on Tuesday. ASI officials told TOI that the artefacts would stay in their custody unless some would need to be returned to the states from where they were stolen. They added that 94 other artefacts handed over to the PM by the US government would return to India within a month. Sources said the stolen or smuggled artefacts and antiquities included a 10th century 1.5m bas relief panel of Revanta in sandstone, a 12th century bronze Nataraj figure, 56 terracotta pieces, bronze figurines and copper objects, and an 18th century sword in its sheath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/annapurna-idol-stolen-from-up-back-from-canada-after-108-yrs/articleshow/87655132.cms||Zumbish

Their counsel P V Ramana said that a 15 percent reservation was given to the Goud community in the allotment of the liquor shops. Though SCs and STs too were given 10 per cent and 5 per cent reservations respectively, Gouds alone were considered in the BCs. “This is a caste-based reservation and we are questioning this,” the counsel said.

In Maharashtra, around 2.34 lakh students of Std III, V, VIII and X will have to compulsorily attend school on that day and appear for a 90-minute exam.These schools are chosen randomly by NAS and state governments implement the test through their officials. The test is conducted at the same time and date across India to ensure uniformity.Even though physical classes for Std III are not permitted in Maharashtra, these kids will have no choice but to be in classroom on that day. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The same concern was raised by us in the meeting with the Centre, but they stressed the importance of NAS as it will help ascertain the learning gaps/progress at the national level. In fact, in some states schools have not opened to the extent that we have done, still there too the NAS will go ahead.”In Nagpur district, around 7,000 students from 232 schools will appear for the exam. A local education official said, “All care will be taken so there is no chance of Covid-19 safety guidelines being flouted. Also, in the entire district, only randomly chosen kids will appear for the test. So, there’s no question of crowding on campus.”The 232 schools chosen include a mix of private CBSE and state board schools, along with those managed by local bodies.A teacher, who did not wish to identified, said, “My concern is for Std III kids. They are hardly eight or nine years old and shall be in class from 8am till 2pm. That’s an extremely long period to keep such small kids on campus. The exam will be held from 10.30am to 12 noon, but then the buffer timing is to ensure that all paperwork is done properly.”Since school canteens will be closed, all kids will have to bring their own tiffins. A teacher said, “Half an hour break will be given for lunch but mostly, the kids will be in class. They are not used to sitting at one place for such a long time.”Another issue before teachers is how to convince parents to send their kids to school on that day. An official notification makes it clear that attendance is mandatory and that teachers must remind parents a day before. “All we can do is remind and let them know about the seriousness of the issue. But frankly, if a parent does not wish to send his/her child, then I wonder what can be done legally. It’s only the soft pressure tactics which will work, not force,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/8-yr-old-kids-mandated-to-appear-for-nas-exam/articleshow/87633587.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Insurance top-up gets tougher for Covid recovered||Nagpur: Experiences during the pandemic may have increased demand for medical insurance but those recovered from Covid are finding it tough to enhance the cover now. The post-Covid health disorders are also hampering their insurability.Insurance companies are discouraging enhancement of cover under existing insurance schemes for Covid recovered patients. Enhancement is an addition over and above the old policy. Although separate insurance policies can be taken, it is done only after a thorough scrutiny, said sources in the insurance advisory business. The fresh policies are triggered when the existing one is exhausted and cashless facility is generally not available. In cases of severe Covid, some insurance companies are also denying applications for a separate insurance cover, said sources. There are some exceptions with liberal approach too.It is a standard practice for insurance companies to delay an insurance for a year or six months after any major illness. This is also being applied in cases of severe Covid. However, Covid cases have their own complications.Each of the post-Covid cases are also being thoroughly examined with special emphasis on the health conditions developed due to Covid. Patients have ended up with complications like high sugar levels, hypertension and even joint pain. These conditions are being taken as underlying diseases and excluded in the insurance policies. This means the diseases will not be covered for the first three to four years.Manoj Aya of GNTL Financial Services said that the customers have to give a self-declaration that they did not have Covid. After that a thorough investigation begins. Not only the discharge summary but even the in-patient department report with day to day account of hospital stay is being studied. If a person was on ventilator or other oxygen support, there is a likelihood that insurance may be even denied.In some cases certain diseases considered as a co-morbidity under the Covid protocol have become a reason for rejection. The grounds are that it can become a serious complication in case a person gets Covid.“My parents’ application for an insurance cover was rejected as they had high sugar levels. In the normal course they could have got insured along with the exclusion clause. They were not infected with Covid at any time though” said Prasanna Dani, an insurance advisor himself.Patients with joint pain post Covid are likely to get a policy with exclusion of knee replacement treatment cover, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/insurance-top-up-gets-tougher-for-covid-recovered/articleshow/87633597.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||My tweet is an answer to Malik’s charges: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis refused to comment on NCP minister Nawab Malik’s counter charges against him alleging latter’s links with the criminal elements and underworld.Flaying the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers for not fulfilling demands of thousands of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees demands, the former chief minister termed the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government as “insensitive” and reiterated BJP’s full support to them.Speaking to the media after his arrival at the airport, the senior BJP leader said his tweet was an apt answer on all charges labelled against him by Malik.Quoting George Bernad Shaw, the South West Nagpur MLA tweeted, “I learned long ago not to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, besides the pig likes it.”After engaging in a bitter war of words with the skill development minister, Fadnavis said there was no need to grant any weightage to the latter’s allegations and even BJP Mumbai chief Ashish Shelar had clarified on it.For their various demands, including merger of MSRTC with the state government, the former’s employees have been on an indefinite strike since October 28, which crippled the transport services across Maharashtra since last week.“The government is acting like a dictator by sacking the striking employees. Such an attitude would only deteriorate the situation. The solution can be found only through dialogue and discussions. It is high time the government should wake up and increase employees’ wages, to stop their spate of suicides. The BJP leaders would continue to support the striking employees and many of our leaders have joined them in the protest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/my-tweet-is-an-answer-to-maliks-charges-fadnavis/articleshow/87633579.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy gave this direction while hearing a PIL filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) general secretary Jaya Vindhyala seeking a probe into the death of Mariamma, who died in police custody on June 18, 2021. Mariamma was brought to Addagudur police station along with her son in connection with a theft case. The bench went through the first post-mortem report, judicial first class magistrate report and the second post-mortem report. The bench also saw the photos furnished by the petitioner showing injuries suffered by the son of Mariamma, who was allegedly beaten up brutally by Addagudur cops. Addagudur falls under Rachakonda police commisionerate. The bench noted the difference between the findings given in two post-mortem reports and said this was a fit case for a CBI probe. The bench also asked the petitioner to implead both the CBI and the Union of India as parties to the case. The high court had earlier found fault with the state government for getting the matter inquired through a tahsildar and, instead, ordered an inquiry through a judicial magistrate. It was this sealed cover report furnished by the judicial magistrate that had reached the high court now. When advocate general BS Prasad sought a copy of the report, the bench said it would be handed over to the CBI SP. To a submission made by the AG that the government took prompt action against the errant cops, the bench sought to know from him whether all such efforts would bring back the life of the hapless woman. The court asked the counsel for the Centre also to be present before it on November 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mariamma-death-case-fit-for-cbi-probe-hc/articleshow/87635315.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Education department extends Diwali vacation; city schools to reopen on November 22||MUMBAI: Schools in Mumbai not participating in the nation-wide survey of students’ learning achievements can continue their Diwali vacation till November 22, stated an education department circular issued on Wednesday. However, the 292 schools in Mumbai that have been selected for the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 will reopen on Thursday. The state had curtailed the vacation and directed schools to reopen on Thursday—a day before the survey to be conducted on Friday.  Across the state, though, confusion over reopening continued till late on Wednesday. Earlier, in a circular dated November 3, the state had left it to schools to adjust the pending Diwali holidays with Christmas or summer vacations. “It made no sense to reopen schools not participating in the survey,” said Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Samiti, who was fighting for the Diwali vacation. With schools being told to ensure 100% attendance for the survey, parents are being pressured to send children to school. In the state, though, schools had reopened for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and 8 to 12 in urban with parental consent. For the survey, parents are being told it is mandatory to be in school on Thursday and Friday. “We got a call saying my daughter has to come to school, else it will result in an adverse remark on her academic calendar,” said a parent of a Class 10 student in Bandra. The students have to be in school on Friday from 8am to 3pm. They have to carry their tiffin and water. The state has permitted students to travel by train for the survey. The person accompanying the student need not be fully vaccinated. School heads said the response of parents in sending their children to school was poor. “They are refusing to send children to school for just two days,” said a principal, who has to bring in classes 3 and 8. Selected schools have to gather 30 students for the survey per standard. For instance, a school selected to survey classes 5 and 10 will have to call all the students. Among them, 30 each of the two classes will be randomly selected with chits. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday requested schools and parents to participate in the survey and keep Maharashtra on the top in overall ranking. While the survey, in the form of a written test in languages, maths and science, is for 39 lakh students from 1.25 lakh schools in the country, the final number will be known on Friday. UP has the maximum of 15,302 participating schools, followed by MP with 9,499 and Maharashtra 7,330.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-edu-dept-extends-diwali-vacation-city-schools-to-reopen-on-nov-22/articleshow/87634562.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan Patuli suicide||Kolkata: A 53-year-old man who had lost his job last year during the pandemic and was under mental stress for a number of reasons, allegedly died by suicide at his rented accommodation in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. The victim has been identified as Amit Jyoti Banerjee, a resident of a complex located close to Garia under Patuli police station. Police said his wife (37) and son (11) were staying with a relative and were busy house hunting when the incident took place. “Prima facie, the family has stated that Banerjee was upset over his financial crisis. However, there might be a number of other personal issues involved. We have ordered an inquest to ascertain the details,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. “On November 10, around 12.10am, Patuli police received information over telephone regarding no response from a family residing in the complex. A police team arrived at the spot and found that Luna Sarkar, the landlady residing on the first floor and four neighbours were standing in front of the flat. They said that Banerjee who has been residing there for the past six years, was not opening the door since the past few hours. Cops broke open the main door and found Banerjee hanging from the ceiling fan hook in his house with a white dupatta. His wife along with other relatives of the deceased also arrived at the spot sometime later. He was taken to Baghajatin State General Hospital where he was declared dead,” said Khan. “During enquiry, it was revealed that he was an employee of a private firm and had lost his job during the pandemic in 2020. We came to know that he wanted a fixed source of income. No foul play has been detected as yet. No complaint has also been received from any corner so far,” added khan. Neighbours told police that the family often went out and ordered food from outside. “It was impossible to know in the past few months what Banerjee was going through,” a neighbour told the investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-patuli-suicide/articleshow/87634564.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||‘Raw material prices forcing foundries to shut operations’||Ahmedabad: Reeling from extreme cost pressures with rise in prices of coal as well as pig iron – a key raw material for manufacturing metal castings, foundries are being forced to curtail or shut production. Estimates by Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF) – a pan India association for the foundries, suggest that most foundries in Gujarat are yet to resume production after Diwali, as they are facing acute working captial shortage. Coal is a key input material for foundries to operate, whose prices have doubled. That apart, pig iron which is a basic raw material has become costlier by at least 45%. Since most foundry units are dependent on coal for manufacturing processes, the input costs have dramatically shot up by at least 25%. “Most foundries are micro small and medium enterprises, which do not have adequate working capital to buy costlier raw materials. At the same time, timely availability of raw material is another constraint,” said Subodh Panchal, past president, IIF. Making matters worse, foundries are unable to cash-in on fresh order volumes due to supply-side bottlenecks triggered by uncertain supply and rising cost of raw material. This is making foundry operations unviable and lot of small units are on the verge of closure, according to IIF. IIF estimates suggest that Gujarat is home to at least 2,500 foundries which are mainly concentrated in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Rajkot and have a cumulative installed capacity of some 5-lakh tonne per month. Metal castings are widely used in manufacturing of automobiles, engineering goods, railway and windmills, among others. Metals and castings industry saw a steep rise in commodity prices over the past one year including that for coke, pig iron, cast iron, steel scrap, cast iron borings, HR sheet, CR sheet, ferro alloys, chemicals for core making and coatings, consumables for foundry units, copper, brass and aluminum in the range of 60-150%. IIF has sought that the government revokes the import duty on key raw materials used in casting production. “Most raw materials are imported and therefore, cutting down the import duty will help bring down cost of production,” said Devendra Jain, president, IIF. IIF members held that foundries need to implement monthly price revision of raw materials based on national price index for ferrous, non-ferrous, steel finished products and the customers need to be prepared for such a revision because it is the only way doing business will remain viable. “Monthly pricing index can be a solution till normalcy is restored. This will be helpful to the castings buyers as well as suppliers,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raw-material-prices-forcing-foundries-to-shut-operations/articleshow/87634558.cms||---

The officials are calling the beneficiaries who took their first dose in Nagpur district centres and didn't turn up for the second even after passage of the requisite gap period.Over 2 lakh people are due for the second dose in the district. When asked to take the second dose, the beneficiaries informed the officials that they had taken both doses but got certificate of partially vaccinated.Officials said the Co-Win system too allows the beneficiaries to merge their certificates procured from two different centres using different IDs. “Our centres help those who are not aware of the feature on the Co-Win or don’t know how to do it themselves,” he said.The beneficiaries need to fill up the dates and details of IDs in the system to generate fully vaccinated certificate.Civic officials said daily over 300 calls are made to people who have taken their first dose in last three months but still their second dose is shown as due. “About 5,000 people have been found to have taken their second dose using a different ID,” they said.Asked how were beneficiaries allowed to take the second dose using a different IDs, officials said many of these people had taken their doses in panic. “They belong to the batches when we used to have shortage of doses and the drive used to come to a halt. Also, due to longer span, they somehow fail to recall which ID they had used before. Some also would refuse to cooperate and wouldn’t disclose if they had been jabbed earlier or which ID they had registered the first time,” they said.Officials said some also had preferred other districts like Bhandara where doses would remain available in a bid to complete their doses early.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/registered-with-different-ids-vax-beneficiaries-get-certificates-merged/articleshow/87633610.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Delhi||Delhi: Three arrested with imported marijuana worth Rs 35 lakh||NEW DELHI: Three men were arrested on Wednesday and imported marijuana worth Rs 35 lakh was seized from them. The drug was bought via Darknet and payment was made in Bitcoin. The accused have been identified as Karan Sajnani (24), Priyansh (22) and Sanjeev Midha (39). Around 11.15am on Monday, a Crime Branch team raided a flat in Shalimar Bagh and caught the trio and seized 1,873 grams of fine quality Canadian ganja. “The selling price of the seized consignment is Rs 40,000-50,000 for each ounce (28 grams) depending upon the paying capacity of the buyer. In USA, it costs about 600 dollars per ounce,” said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner (Crime). During interrogation, it was found that Sajnani had a family business of car sale and purchase. “Priyansh is his friend. Their common friend, Pankaj Davar, was engaged in procuring marijuana from the US by courier to sell it in Delhi. About four months ago, Sajnani and Davar procured approximately 1.5kg of the drug. Three months ago, they had procured another consignment in the same manner. This time, Davar cheated Sajnani by not sharing the profit equitably. Sajnani then decided to work without him,” said the joint commissioner. Kumar said about two months ago, Sajnani and Priyansh procured around 1kg marijuana and sold it to two men, Golu and Vicky, in Paschim Vihar. They had ordered the recent consignment a week ago, which was intercepted by the Crime Branch. Police also found that the trio used to chat with people abroad using a special app in which the conversation was automatically deleted after three days. “The seller was traced on the Darkweb through an onion browser, which directs internet traffic through a free, worldwide volunteer overlay network consisting of more than 6,000 relays. After striking a deal, payment was made in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. Priyansh paid for the consignment using his bitcoin wallet. The drug parcels were sent through an international courier, package delivery or express mail service and sold to buyers in Delhi,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/three-arrested-with-imported-marijuana-worth-rs-35-lakh/articleshow/87634721.cms||---

Kempty falls sees heavy tourist footfall through the year and officials allege that there is massive waste generation from the place. Locals believe the problem of garbage generation is going unchecked. “The problem was highlighted and officials took stock of the situation. We worked with administration and forest department to make this happen. Traders’ association identified the space where the plant could be set up and we will provide all necessary support to keep this running smoothly,” said Sunder Singh Rawat, president, Kempty falls traders’ association. The plant is located 1km ahead of the falls. Officials said that as it is a pilot project, they are starting off at a smaller level. “We have begun with a budget of Rs 10 lakh, for now. Nearly 4 tonnes of plastic waste, constituting mostly PET bottles, will be procured on a daily basis and upgraded at the facility into granules,” said Kahkashan Nassem, district forest officer, Mussoorie. Officials believe they can use the local waste for the project and the final product can then be sold off to private companies. The profits will be utilised by the business association to expand and even generate employment opportunities at the plant. “The staff strength, including a security guard, is 10, at present. The collection, segregation and processing will all happen here. Our aim is to eventually create refurbished tiles and construction material, and finally generate agricultural grade fuel at the facility,” said the DFO. The facility will become operational on November 15. Stakeholders are working on arranging vehicles that will ferry the waste to the plant from areas around the facility.

Vehicular movement has witnessed a steady rise over the years as the town is the headquarters of Quepem taluka with numerous government offices, including those of the deputy collector and mamlatdar, located here. In the absence of a proper parking system, severe traffic congestions are a frequent sight. Vehicles are mostly found parked on both sides of the road from the main Quepem junction to the temporary fish market, thereby disrupting the flow of traffic Areas near the buildings of the RTO office, deputy collector and around the fuel station are the most congested due to parking scarcity. A few years ago, as per the notification issued by the South Goa collector, Quepem municipality with the assistance of traffic police had erected parking signboards with painted markings at various locations in the town. However, the signages have disappeared since then. “There is no control over the traffic as people park their four-wheelers on the road for the entire day. Some areas which were allotted for two-wheelers are now used for parking four-wheelers as well,” said a resident Filomeno Pereira. Traffic police expressed helplessness in issuing challans for improper parking owing to the lack of designated markings and signboards at parking lots. As per the collector’s notification, a stretch of around six metres parking space along the roadside in front of the RTO building office was reserved for differently abled persons. However, the entire stretch is now being used for routine parking as authorities failed to erect signboards. Speaking to TOI, deputy collector Nilesh Daigodkar expressed concern over the issue and said that he will call the municipality’s chief officer and the police inspector of traffic cell to his office to discuss the implementation of a parking system in the town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/quepem-town-in-urgent-need-of-parking-plan/articleshow/87635976.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The collapsed roof was six metres long and three metres wide with a height of two metres,” an official from Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) said. “The four workers were trapped below it and lost their lives,” the SCCL official said. While an internal probe was ordered by SCCL chairman and managing director N Sridhar to find out reasons behind the roof collapse, families of miners protested demanding more safety measures for their kin. The deceased workers were identified as B Laxmaiah (60), V Krishna Reddy (57), G Satyanarayana Raju (32) and R Chandrasekhar (32), all hailing from neighbouring areas. Witnesses said there were about 21 workers, including miners and the supporting staff in the mine, raising apprehension that more people could be trapped inside the mine. However, by evening it was clear that all other workers were safe. “Only four died in the accident. No other workers got trapped in the mine. We were informed that the rest of the workers came out of the mine after the incident. One body has been retrieved and efforts are on to take out the other three bodies,” Jaipur ACP G Narender said. After learning about the mishap, senior officials of SCCL and police rushed to the spot. Family members of the workers as well as worker's union representatives staged a protest demanding that the SCCL authorities must step up safety measures to ensure that such mishaps don’t recur. SCCL authorities pacified the protesters assuring that one member of the deceased employee's family will be provided a job at the place of their choice and will also be given a compensation between Rs 70 lakh and Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/four-singareni-workers-killed-in-underground-mine-roof-collapse/articleshow/87636327.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Kolkata||Prithvi weather||TNN Kolkata: The city is set to receive light to moderate rain this weekend under the impact of a low pressure over southeast Bay of Bengal. A cloud cover may appear over Kolkata from Thursday as easterly winds start flowing in, carrying moisture from the sea. It may start drizzling in Kolkata from Friday night and the rain may continue till Monday. It could get moderate on Sunday even as the city remains cloudy. Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 19.7 degree Celsius on Wednesday. The minimum temperature may rise above 20 degrees from Thursday. The maximum, though may slide marginally below 30 degrees, said the Met office. "It will get marginally warmer as the mercury rises. But we expect drizzles from Friday night. The rain could continue on Saturday and get more frequent and marginally heavier on Sunday. Once the cloud cover recedes and the rain stops, the minimum temperature is set to drop again. But it will be a gradual slide and winter chill is still far away," said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. Meanwhile, the low pressure system has moved towards the Tamil Nadu coast. "Even though there will be no direct impact of the system on south Bengal, the moisture and the wind are set to trigger clouds and rain. It won't last till the weekend, though," added Das. Meanwhile, a low pressure trough is set to form between Odisha and Bangladesh that will converge with the low pressure system as it hits land on Friday night. "This will trigger the rain this weekend," said Das. The mercury had said to 18 degree Celsius earlier this week as chilly westerly winds blew into south bengal. It was unusual for the temperature to slide below 20 degrees in early November, said weatherman. "This, however, does not indicate an early onset of winter. The minimum temperature must remain below 15 degrees for three consecutive days for winter to set in. It rarely happens in Kolkata before mid-December, " said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prithvi-weather/articleshow/87634581.cms||---

The decision came as the HC was hearing a petition -- filed by Dehradun resident and activist Ravindra Jugran -- which claimed that Bhandari was not eligible for the post as he doesn’t have 10 years of professorship experience. Jugran, in his petition, said that Bhandari has been a professor for about eight years, following which, he was appointed as a member of the Uttarakhand Public Service Commission.

---||Delhi||Why dengue patients should not ignore abdominal pain, discomfort||NEW DELHI: At least nine patients have been admitted to Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) due to acute liver failure caused by dengue fever in the last three months. At Holy Family hospital, doctors say, nearly 30% of dengue patients who require ICU admission have liver-related complications. Similar cases of liver dysfunction in dengue patients have been reported in other hospitals also. “Dengue is a systemic illness. It affects all organs. But the liver is among the most affected organs. We have seen at least nine dengue patients coming with acute liver failure in the last three months,” Dr S K Sarin, vice-chancellor of ILBS, said. He added that management of such patients isn’t easy as other organs such as the kidney are also involved. According to Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family hospital, liver dysfunction in dengue patients can be caused directly due to cell damage and indirectly due to capillary leak, which is a known complication of the viral illness. “In dengue, people focus mostly on fall in platelet count. But, the real warning sign is abdominal discomfort or pain. It is reflective of capillary leak – escape of blood plasma through minute blood vessels called the capillaries – which can damage the organs. Timely medical intervention in such cases can help reduce complications and, therefore, save lives,” he added. This year, as on November 6, Delhi has recorded 2,708 cases and nine deaths due dengue which is the highest since 2017. Public health experts say the overall number of dengue cases is high and that has led to a proportionate increase in severe cases also. Also, the experts say, there is a predominance of type II strain of the dengue virus. Dengue virus strains are of four types. Type I causes classic dengue fever, type II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, dengue III causes fever without shock and dengue IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. People suffering from chronic kidney disease, heart diseases and pregnant women among others are at higher risk to develop complications if they get the disease. They should take extra precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, says Dr Ashutosh Biswas, professor of medicine at AIIMS. Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine at Max Saket said dengue cases may start reducing once the winter sets in. “People have to be alert and take all precautions to prevent mosquito bite. If there is persistent fever, it is better to get tested and see a doctor so the symptoms are managed in time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-dengue-patients-should-not-ignore-abdominal-pain-discomfort/articleshow/87634584.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis shielded man caught with Rs 15 crore fake notes: Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday made charges against leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, saying that the former BJP chief minister had links with Riyaz Bhati, considered to be a henchman of gangster Dawood Ibrahim. Malik also alleged that during Fadnavis’s tenure as CM, persons with criminal backgrounds were appointed on state-run boards and corporations and given the status of cabinet minister or minister of state. Malik claimed Fadnavis had taken the lead in criminalisation of politics and shielded criminals involved in the fake currency scam which allegedly took place after demonetisation in 2016. He also alleged Fadnavis was making all attempts to divert attention from the controversy surrounding NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who carried out, in Malik’s words, a “fake” raid on a cruise ship on October 2. The NCP minister alleged Fadnavis had protected a person who had been caught with fake currency notes worth Rs 14.56 crore in the BKC area. A few persons were then arrested from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune, he said. “The PM had on November 8, 2016 declared demonetisation to stop fake currency coming in from neigbouring countries, particularly Pakistan. In most states, massive fake currency was seized. On October 8, 2017, DRI seized fake currency worth Rs 14.56 crore, but the case was suppressed with the blessings of Fadnavis. Notes with a face walue of Rs 8.8 lakh were then shown as sezure. At that time, Sameer Wankhede was in charge of DRI,” Malik claimed. Fadnavis, he alleged, appointed Hazi Arafat Shaikh, elder brother of one of the accused in the fake currency case, Imran Alam Shaikh, as chairman of the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. Another controversial person, Hyder Azam, was appointed chairman of the Maulana Azad Minorities Financial Development Corporation, he said. Azam had been accused of illegally bringing in people from Bangladesh to Mumbai, and his second wife is a citizen of Bangladesh, Malik claimed. Malad police were probing her antecedents, but all cases were suppressed on Fadnavis’s instructions, the minister alleged. Munna Yadav from Nagpur, alleged to have a criminal background, was appointed chairman of Constructions Workers’ Board and given the rank of minister of state, Malik added. Fadanvis did not comment on the allegations but tweeted after Malik’s presser, “Thought for the day: I learned long ago. Never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides the pig likes it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-shielded-man-caught-with-rs-15-crore-fake-notes-malik/articleshow/87635973.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The expertise in braille and determination to excel in academics motivated her to score 87% in distinction in graduation, the results of which were announced last week. Dethroning the long lineage of sighted students that came before her, Khan is the topper in her batch, this year. “It was challenging when we shifted to online classes due to the pandemic. However, once I was able to adjust to the medium, there was no looking back and I was able to complete my studies,” Khan said. She is now aiming for IAS preparation so that she can uplift people from the underprivileged and rural areas. “I want to ensure that others get the same opportunities that I did,” she said. Saish Salkar, 23, a visually impaired student from Old Goa, also graduated with 80% in his graduation course. He is now pursuing a masters degree in English literature at Goa University. “Shifting to virtual examinations was the toughest challenge since verbally saying our answers on Google Meet was something we had never been exposed to. However, I was determined to excel since I want to further prepare for UPSC,” he said. The duo’s achievement has made their teachers at NAB extremely proud. Theirs is not just yet another success story to come from the institute, but also an achievement wherein the students have performed against their sighted counterparts in a regular college, instead of a special one. “They cannot come out of schools as leaders if they do not learn to be a part of regular society early on. We, therefore, follow an integrated regulated programme as part of which students can go to regular schools instead of special schools. Here, the students compete with the sighted students and emerge as successful while overcoming all challenges,” said NAB president Rozendo Mendonsa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-blind-students-graduate-with-distinction/articleshow/87636023.cms||Nida Sayed

The accident occurred near Bhandiawas in the desert district of Barmer not long after the bus had left Balotra for Jodhpur around 9.55am, the police said. Ten charred bodies were found inside the bus. Another unidentified body, possibly of the driver, was retrieved from the trailer’s cabin. A six-month-old baby succumbed to burns in hospital. A villager identified as Chainaram was the first to enter the burning bus and rescue those trapped inside. He and some other residents of the area risked their lives to save around 18 passengers, the survivors said. Officials fear the number of casualties could rise as many of the injured are in a critical condition. Ten of them are being treated in a government hospital while another 12 have been admitted to a private hospital in Balotra.Rescuers deployed by the administration struggled to enter the heated bus even hours after the flames had been doused, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/12-killed-in-rajasthan-bus-trailer-crash/articleshow/87636928.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Over 98% paddy procured: Ashu; 15% yet to reach mandis: Farmers||Bathinda: Refuting claims of farmer groups and opposition parties where they have said that a considerable amount of paddy is still to be procured, Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has made it clear that the state government has procured nearly 98% paddy, and mandis will be closed in a day or two. Afterwards, a small window will remain open for farmers and the procurement will be made only after fully verifying the details about paddy and no purchase will be made for arhtiyas and rice millers. Speaking to TOI, Ashu said, “As much as 179 lakh metric tonne paddy had arrived in mandis till evening of November 9, out of which 178 lakh MT has been procured. We expect 5-6 lakh MT more in the two days before mandis are closed for procurement. The claims of 15-20% paddy is yet to arrive are not as per ground reality. We feel only up to 2% paddy might not have come to mandis, but not more than that.” Last year, a record 203 lakh MT paddy was procured in Punjab. Ashu said a lot of hue and cry was made over how this much of paddy came to Punjab and this time “we have put a lot of checks against bogus billing.” He said though there is no any issue of payments, it has been stopped for a couple of days to verify various details and it will be released after checking the same. The farmer groups are making claims that over 15% paddy is still to arrive in mandis as a big part out of it has not been harvested yet. They have decided to raise the issue with the chief minister and also to hold protests if mandis are closed. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan and BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said a lot of paddy is still to reach mandis and to be procured, so closing the mandis is totally unjustified. They will raise the matter with the CM and if no solution is found, they will hold protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/over-98-paddy-procured-ashu-15-yet-to-reach-mandis-farmers/articleshow/87636439.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Delhi HC nixes plea against DDMA's Chhath order||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday dismissed a plea challenging the DDMA's decision prohibiting devotees from performing Chhath Puja on the banks of the Yamuna. "This is just a publicity interest petition. Covid 19 hasnt totally vanished its still there..it is a misconceived petition.." Justice Rekha Palli said, pointing out that the petitioners were unable to show that devotees are entitled to or can insist to perform the puja only on the Yamuna banks. "They have not given any explanation as to why they did not approach the respondents if they were desirous of having additional designated sites in the area even after the list of designated sites was made public," the court said. It said the petitioner society, which claim to organise various social and religious functions, were free to approach the Delhi government to earmark additional sites in Sonia Vihar and Wazirabad area but even after November 6, when list in their sites was made public, they made no move. Infringement of right of worship, says plea in HCChhath Puja has already commenced today and even otherwise no orders for alternative sites at this stage can be passed," the court observed, underlining that the AAP government's decisions "to take care of religious sentiments of all devotees." "Even though Covid-19 has still not fully disappeared, the government has taken steps to ensure that devotees can perform Chathh Puja." The petitioner organisations challenged the Delhi Disaster Management Authority's October 29 order, which permitted the Chhath Puja celebrations in Delhi but certain restrictions were imposed. According to the petitioner, authorities unreasonably prohibited the devotees from performing Chhat Puja on the banks of the Yamuna without assigning any reason in their notifications/orders. Delhi government told the court that 800 designated sites are created in the national capital for performing puja and there are seven designated sites in the vicinity of where the petitioners wish to perform the rituals. The petitioners - Chhath Puja Samaj Sudhar Samiti, Sonia Vihar, and Bihar Mitra Sangathan, Karwal Nagar - said that notifications have caused infringement to their fundamental right of worship. The petition said the environmentalists have claimed that the festival of Chhath is one of the most eco-friendly religious festivals that should be used to spread "the message of nature conservation".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-hc-nixes-plea-against-ddmas-chhath-order/articleshow/87636961.cms||Abhinav Garg

All this came to light when the Haryana government decided to provide personal security officers (PSOs) to such administrative secretaries, director-level officers and other senior bureaucrats who have been assigned various duties as special magistrates or incharges of districts for Covid-related tasks. “Many administrative secretaries and HoDs have informed me about the difficulties they have faced in the discharge of duties assigned to them in view of the agitation which has resulted into road jams, picketing at toll plazas and agitations at government offices in the districts. These senior officials while travelling have to negotiate such hotspots,” the chief secretary said in his communication to the home department and Haryana DGP. The chief secretary has asked DGP P K Agrawal to provide PSOs to such officers with immediate effect to ensure their safety while travelling. Notably, Additional Chief Secretary (home) Rajeev Arora has been assigned the work to negotiate with farmers over the opening of borders. Similarly, Additional Chief Secretary Devender Singh was the one who negotiated with farmers at Karnal. Most of the head of the departments, administrative secretaries have been given two districts each for the Covid management issues. Besides, those handling special projects are learned to be visiting various project sites in the state. “The problem surfaces when farmers comes out on roads after seeing escort guards and cars with beacon. They leave the way only after they realise that officers are sitting in vehicles. Sometimes they give way on their own and sometimes it take time. Though there is no such incidence of attack on bureaucrats by agitatators, the move on PSOs is just for precaution,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/feeling-heat-due-to-farmers-protest-hry-top-babus-to-get-psos/articleshow/87636440.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Nagpur||No restrictions, NMC lays out red carpet for Chhath puja at lakes||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) not only violated its own guidelines but also those issued by the state government for Chhath puja celebrations. On Wednesday, instead of imposing restrictions and taking action, the civic body made arrangements for the puja at a few lakes by spending from its own coffers. The government had strictly prohibited rituals at the water bodies citing Covid-19 pandemic. But the city police remained mere spectator even as a large number of devotees thronged the water bodies and violated Covid guidelines. In the guidelines issued on November 3, the state’s home department had restricted the Chhath puja celebrations to home. “People should perform the puja in a simple manner at their houses and avoid coming together to the banks of lakes, rivers and sea. Also, no mandap should be erected,” the department had said. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi on November 8 issued a circular for implementation of the government guidelines. As per information available from the NMC officials, the same day the civic body opened quotations invited for executing works to allow devotees on the banks of lakes. The quotation process had started from the beginning of November. The works were done on the banks of Sonegaon, Ambazari, Futala, Police Line Takli, Gorewada etc in just two days. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and Joshi confirmed that NMC executed the works through tender process. “Government should have issued the guidelines well in advance but the delay caused confusion. Like every year, NMC started the arrangements. I planned to perform bhoomipuja on November 6 as the NMC officials confirmed that there are no restrictions from the government,” said Tiwari. The mayor claimed he also directed the NMC officials to cross-check after receiving information about the guidelines from a section of media. “By the time officials learnt about the government order of November 8, works had already started,” he said. Joshi said that NMC carried out some works to avoid any untoward incident at the lakes. A large number of devotees across age groups performed the puja at Ambazari, Fulata, Sonegaon and Gorewada lakes while ignoring Covid norms like wearing mask and following physical distancing. Traffic police managed traffic on roads leading to the lakes while police personnel were deployed on security bandobast. None of the devotees was stopped from approaching the lakes. The NMC officials were also not to be seen. According to CP Amitesh Kumar, police ensured compliance of all guidelines issued by the government. Umakant Agnihotri from Uttar Bhartiya Sabha said there was no reason to impose restrictions for the puja as it is performed only for a few hours at the banks of water bodies. “All the guidelines were followed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-restrictions-nmc-lays-out-red-carpet-for-chhath-puja-at-lakes/articleshow/87635028.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Former Goa chief minister and present TMC national vice-president Luizinho Faleiro held the meeting with party functionaries including Leander Paes, Yatish Naik, Antonio Clovis, Swati Kerkar, Pratibha Borkar and Francis de Tuem. “We will take up hard issues like water, women’s safety, mining and we take them head-on,” Paes said as he addressed party members. Paes said that TMC will start campaigning in Goa from Thursday in order to prove to voters that it is not in Goa to divide the anti-BJP votes, but to provide a political alternative. Sources said that the hype over TMC’s entry into Goa has calmed down as no political bigwigs have joined the party recently. TMC said it has launched a digital campaign in response to chief minister Pramod Sawant’s “audacious demand asking people to thank him for doing his job”. On Saturday, Sawant had complained that the media had not thanked him and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for slashing fuel prices. In a fitting reply, Goans have decided to congratulate Sawant for destroying Goa, in their own unique way. From law and order, unemployment, corruption, potholes, or complete destruction of the economy, Goans are making sure that Sawant gets his due. As TMC continues to build its presence in Goa, the Bengal-based outfit continues to poach former Congress functionaries. On Wednesday, former Congress general secretary from North Goa district, Socorro Menezes joined TMC . A few days earlier, Carmona sarpanch Allwyn Jorge also joined TMC along with 200 people from his village and Benaulim constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-takes-stock-of-its-expansion-plans-in-state/articleshow/87635738.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

His statements are likely to add fuel to speculations that Lobo is cosying up to Congress ahead of the polls. Lobo has said that he has been approached by several parties including Congress for the 2022 polls and that he would take a call depending on the situation. He had also said that he would leave BJP if the party didn't want him. Kandolkar, a former BJP karyakarta, described Lobo as an efficient minister and a helpful friend. “As a minister, he has always been helpful. He entertains everyone and he shows results, so he will definitely win the next election. His style of working is good,” said Kandolkar. When Kandolkar was asked if he would leave Congress, he said that doing so would hurt his political reputation and cause voters to distance themselves from him. “I will contest the coming elections as a Congress candidate,” said Kandolkar. “If Lobo joins Congress, it will benefit me as I will get additional support in Mapusa, and there will be more development for Mapusa.” Mapusa has been represented by BJP since former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza joined the party in 2000. After his death in 2019, his son Joshua was elected. Kandolkar, a one-time close aide of Francis, was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket in the 2019 byelection, but after he was denied a ticket, Kandolkar switched to Congress. “If I change parties, the people will lose faith in me. I got 10,000 votes in the last byelection. By going from this side to that side, it will be a betrayal of the people’s trust,” said Kandolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-joining-cong-will-boost-my-chances-says-kandolkar/articleshow/87635745.cms||---

Following reports that Lobo may join Congress and contest on its ticket from Calangute constituency in the coming assembly election, Fernandes along with other aspiring candidates from Calangute, Joseph Sequeira and Anthony Menezes, both former Calangute sarpanchs, and Calangute Congress block committee convener Benedict Lobo, held a meeting at Candolim on Wednesday to discuss the issue. “We held a meeting to develop a strategy in case Lobo is admitted into Congress and given the ticket from Calangute. We will not allow that to happen,” Fernandes said. Fernandes said that Lobo knows that he will lose in the coming election. “Lobo thinks that he can win if he contests on the Congress ticket by banking on the groundwork that we party workers have been doing,” Fernandes said. Fernandes, along with Sequeira and Menezes, have already started a door-to-door campaign, even though the party has not declared the candidate for the constituency. Aspiring Congress candidates from Siolim and Mapusa were also supposed to attend the meeting after Lobo announced that he would be fielding his candidates from those constituencies. However, they were not present. Congress central observer P Chidambaram is scheduled to chair a meeting of the Calangute Congress block committee on Friday at Candolim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-calangute-congmen-say-no-to-lobo-in-party/articleshow/87635750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

State Congress president Girish Chodankar accused the state government of using kid gloves with the highway contractor. “Congress, along with the affected travellers, will hold a massive protest march on the Zuari bridge, if the problem is not solved in next three days,” Chodankar said. “It is the failure to take the contractor to task due to which the huge traffic jams are witnessed every day on both the sides of the bridge.” He said that people travelling to their offices and tourists heading for Goa airport are caught up in traffic jams and as a result they reach their destinations late. He also said that several ambulances are stuck in the traffic endangering the lives of patients. “Traffic congestion on both the sides of the Zuari bridge has made life of travellers hell and all this is only because the BJP contractor has failed to abide by the conditions,” he alleged. The state and the Centre have allowed the highway contractor to flout all the rules from the book, the state Congress president alleged. “It is the duty of the contractor to ensure smooth flow of traffic even when construction of the road or Zuari bridge is taken up. People are left stranded in traffic during the day. Travel time between Margao and Panaji has been increased, at least, by an hour,” he said. Chodankar said that the government has taken people for granted and is not bothered to even sit and work out a solution for this problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resolve-zuari-bridge-traffic-woes-in-3-days-cong-to-govt/articleshow/87635756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The drugs were brought from the sea route from Pakistan to be smuggled into Gujarat from the coastal areas of Dwarka, a police officer said. Police sources said that based on specific information, they detained Sajjad Dhosi (44), a resident of Mumbra of Thane district in Maharashtra and found drug packets concealed in his bags. He was carrying 6.6 kg methamphetamine and 11.4kg heroin in three bags, including luggage and school bag. This seizure is valued at Rs 88.2 crore. During interrogation, Dhosi, a vegetable vendor, said he got drugs from Salim Yakub Kara and Ali Yakub Kara, both natives of Salaya town near Jamnagar. When police raided their residences, they found another 47 packets of drugs, contents of which were being verified by the forensic team. “Dhosi had gone to jail in a murder case earlier and Salim Kara had been arrested in the past in NDPS, fake currency and Arms Act cases,” Rajkot range IG Sandeep Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drugs-from-pakistan-worth-300-crore-seized-in-gujarats-dwarka-district/articleshow/87636990.cms||---
---||Goa||AAP alleges `70L scam in Iffi tenders||Panaji: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the government of fixing tenders of the international film festival of India (Iffi). The party alleged that painting work worth Rs 70 lakh that was tendered has already been completed and demanded an investigation. “PWD had put a work order of external painting worth Rs 70 lakh. The tenders were to have been submitted by 3pm on Tuesday and opened on Wednesday, at 11am. But the problem here is that all the work of external painting has been completed. Our simple question is, what is the work left for money to be spent on,” vice president Valmiki Naik said. The party urged the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), which is a state agency of Iffi, to cancel the tenders. “Iffi venues, which are government property, are painted completely without the work order. Surprisingly, the vice chairman, managing director and CEO are not aware of this,” Naik said. AAP has demanded an investigation into the matter and an answer within 24 hours, failing which it has threatened to hold a dharna in front of the chief minister’s house. Taleigao assembly incharge, Cecille Rodrigues said, “Rules are only for common people. The government is blatantly using their power.” AAP joint secretary Sunil Signapurkar said, “This incident proved the former governor of Goa Satyapal Malik’s statement about the corruption in the state government. I request PWD officers to cancel the tenders.” Meanwhile, AAP office in Calangute was inaugurated on Tuesday by the party’s state convener Rahul Mhambre along with Calangute in-charge Manuel Cardozo, panchayat member Sudesh Mayekar and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-alleges-70l-scam-in-iffi-tenders/articleshow/87635780.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||All of Delhi except Lutyens’ is now a vending zone: HC||NEW DELHI: All of Delhi except the Lutyens’ part has become a vending zone today, an anguished Delhi high court said on Wednesday, adding that there was “no political or executive will” to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from the city’s streets. “Why spare Lutyens' zone? Why should we be exempted? Let them come to Prithviraj Road, let them be in front of President’s House, the high court. Why leave this area, we all should face it,” an annoyed HC remarked when Delhi Police claimed it was the sheer numbers of hawkers/vendors in Chandni Chowk that overwhelmed its best efforts to remove them from no vending zones. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, which was examining if the Street Vendors Act, 2014 unduly favoured vendors, was monitoring steps taken by the authorities to finish redevelopment work in Chandni Chowk. “If there is no political and executive will, then let it go the way it has to. Why should we be bothered? We are getting a feeling of complete defeat in this matter,” observed the court, while pulling up police and telling its counsel the reason why vendors were not being removed was because they must be paying “hafta”. The court was hearing a plea by Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal seeking directions to the authorities to remove illegal hawkers and vendors from no-hawking and no-squatting areas. “We have too many loose ends in the scheme, too many loose ends on the ground. We need to find a permanent solution,” it added. The bench noted, “People have become habituated to hawking even though it is a no-hawking and no-vending zone. A large population is unemployed and they find it easier to hawk and vend to meet their livelihood needs.” It added that vending was recognised as a fundamental right. “But it has to be regulated, so there is no littering, pedestrians get right of way on pavements and hawking ceases to be a nuisance, which it is currently,” it stated. North Delhi Municipal Corporation was directed to immediately start the process of preparation of the street vending plan for which experts from the field of planning should be involved, including from School of Planning and Architecture, IIT, PWD and other bodies. The municipality was asked to file a status report indicating the steps taken in this regard. The court made it clear that the civic body’s commissioner shall be personally responsible for complying with this direction and listed the matter for hearing on December 6. Senior advocate Sanjeev Ralli informed the court that despite repeated directions for installation of 330 cameras, not a single one has been installed by police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-of-delhi-except-lutyens-is-now-a-vending-zone-hc/articleshow/87634542.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Goa||Goa: Calangute panchayat launches app for locals||PANAJI: With the Calangute panchayat launching a smartphone app, villagers can now get their day-to-day panchayat-related works done on a button click. With it, the civic body has become the only panchayat to develop it own app. From house tax payments to registration of new business establishments, the app currently caters to the village residents and businesspersons’ needs. It will soon have features like maps and store locators for the benefit of tourists. Other panchayats have websites. The app was conceptualised by sarpanch Shawn Martins and software developer Benedict Lobo. “Besides the various services of the panchayat, users can also pay their electricity bills and other financial services. We have tied up with a payment gateway of HDFC bank to ensure smooth tractions. Alerts and announcements about the village panchayat events are also notified via the app,” Lobo said. The Calangute website and the app feature the same information. The platform also features the number of houses, number of business establishments and the status of payment for services such as garbage pick-up, renewal of taxes, and the number of days due for payment renewal. Attempts will also be made to digitise the trade licences of the various business establishments. The IT team will upgrade the app, following a green signal from the panchayat, to develop unique QR codes for each business establishment in the jurisdiction, which will be pasted in the form of a sticker. The panch inspectors will, therefore, be able to check the licence by scanning the QR code and verifying the business’ trade licence. “This will also help legalise all the shops unregistered with the panchayat and allow the panchayat to collect a higher revenue. Once we get an ‘okay’ from them, we will be able to add this feature,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-panchayat-launches-app-for-locals/articleshow/87635800.cms||Nida Sayed

These are the aspirations of the party workers. I am sure the high command will take a decision (about ticket allocation) in the interest of the party and its workers,” Sardinha said. His statement came in response to a query over reports about several legislators planning to join Congress. Over the issue of Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) insisting on its NOC for setting up beach shacks, he said, “It’s very unfortunate. Let them mind their own business of running the port and nothing else.” Sardinha said that the government’s assurance of restarting mining in the state was yet another false promise. “Mining dependents were happy during the Congress government. BJP is giving only false assurances,” he said. He congratulated the government for lowering the prices of petrol and diesel, but said it was “unfortunate” that the LPG gas rates weren’t dropped. “The government opened its eyes too late, only after Congress and opposition parties protested,” he said. He slammed the chief minister for his failure to live up to his assurance of removing all potholes by November 1. “I want to tell the CM, you are doing a favour to none. It’s your duty to get the roads repaired as people are paying road taxes. It is the right of the people to get good roads. Goa is a tourist state, and we want tourists to return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-entrants-to-congress-should-not-get-tickets/articleshow/87635805.cms||---
---||Goa||DHS study to identify cases of asymptomatic malaria||PANAJI: The directorate of health services (DHS) has undertaken a study along with the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) to detect incidence of malaria among asymptomatic carriers. The study will focus on asymptomatic and low-density malaria parasite infection in the community. It was found that asymptomatic carriers do not test positive owing to the presence of fewer parasites in their bloodstream. They can, however, still be an infection source. “Since they have fewer parasites in their blood when tested their report returns negative. But after some time, they will have a fever, and within a few days a lot many cases get reported from the area of the patient,” health officer in charge of the national vector disease control programme Dr Kalpana Mahatme said. Under Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), Mahatme said, a patient will test positive for malaria if he has at least 50 parasites in his blood. However, people coming from endemic areas may have fewer parasites in their bodies, and naturally do not get detected under an RDT slide. If the patient is negative, he does not get treatment for malaria. Under this study, she said a blood sample collected is tested on a special machine that can detect even five parasites in the blood sample. “Treatment of asymptomatic patients starts immediately and it helps contain possible transmission of malaria in his area. This is crucial for Goa since we are in the elimination stage,” she said. The study assumes importance since Goa sees a large presence of migrant labourers coming from other states. Goa is striving to eliminate malaria by 2022, a target that was pushed forward due to the pandemic. The earlier target was 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhs-study-to-identify-cases-of-asymptomatic-malaria/articleshow/87635830.cms||Bindiya Chari
