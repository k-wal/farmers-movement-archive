Furthermore, all international and domestic passengers arriving at the Chaudhary Charan Singh airport will have to undergo mandatory but free RT-PCR testing now. Domestic passengers will be screened first and will be tested if found symptomatic for Covid-19 infection. Besides, random sampling among domestic passengers will be done at the airport. These orders were issued by district magistrate Abhishek Prakash on Sunday to check the spread of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, which has been declared a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organisation. The DM said that the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) will constantly remain in touch with these travellers through phone calls during the isolation period. After eight days, these travellers will be tested again through the RT-PCR method. The quarantine period will be over, if the test report comes negative, but in case of a positive result, they will either be hospitalised or will have to be in home isolation for 10 more days. Chief Medical Officer Dr Manoj Agarwal said that health department teams will also visit houses of those in self isolation to check whether they are following the norm or not. The DM order also said that all the flyers, both domestic and international, will have to declare their 15-day travel history at the airport. "The names, address and phone numbers of all the travellers will also be noted at the airport itself so that ICCC can keep track of their status in future," he said. The DM said that about 1,800 international and 4,500 domestic travellers arrive daily at the airport. These travellers come from different places, including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Goa, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Dubai, Sharjah, Muscat, Abu Dhabi, Jordan, Kuwait and Jeddah. Samples of those testing positive, domestic or international travellers, will be sent for genome sequencing. All major hospitals in the city have been asked by the health department to get the RT-PCR test done of all the patients who have recent international travel history. An official spokesperson said: “While there is no need to panic, adherence to Covid protocols is required. State surveillance officer Vikasendu Agarwal said meeting has been held with health officials and experts of 75 districts of the state. “Guidelines have been issued by the state government to ensure thorough screening of Travelers who have returned from abroad within 14 days,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/covid-19-international-travellers-landing-in-lucknow-to-undergo-8-day-mandatory-home-quarantine/articleshow/87968318.cms||---

The police rescued the girl and rushed her to the DMC hospital; however the doctors declared her brought dead. The deceased girl has been identified as Dilroze Kaur, of Shimlapuri who is daughter of a Punjab police constable Harpreet Singh, posted in 3rd IRB Battalion. The police have also arrested the accused woman, Neelam, 35 of the same locality. Dilroze was playing outside her house when the accused woman kidnapped her and took along on her scooter. Joint commissioner of police- city J. Elanchezhian said, “Neelam took Dilroze to the Salem Tabri area and buried the girl in a vacant plot. Meanwhile at around 3:15 when the family could not find Dilroze, they contacted the police. The police immediately reached the spot and started questioning people and also scanned the CCTVs installed in the locality. In CCTV Neelam was captured with Dilroze on her scooter. The police detained Neelam for questioning who confessed that she had buried the toddler in a vacant plot in Salem Tabri area. The police exhumed the girl and rushed her to hospital but she was declared dead." He added, “Neelam and Dilroze’s family had no big issue between them. Neelam got divorced in 2015 and since then she was living with her parents in Shimlapuri along with her two sons. At times the neighbouring kids fought with each other and had complained to Neelam against her sons. Neelam took it to heart. She started believing that everyone targets her and her children. Some time ago Neelam had an argument with Dilroze’s parents. To avenge it on Sunday when she saw Dilroze alone, she kidnapped her and buried in a vacant plot in Salem Tabri.” A case under section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) of IPC has been registered against the woman at Shimalpuri police station.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/punjab-woman-kidnaps-2-5yrs-girl-buries-her-alive-following-personal-enmity/articleshow/87968367.cms||Payal Dhawan

Most of the government’s tenure, he said, has been spent on combating the Covid Pandemic. “There is no negativity in the government and administration while tackling the pandemic. We did not panic during natural and human-made calamities rather converted crisis into an opportunity. Everyone can see the huge difference in health and medical infrastructure before the pandemic and now,” said Thackeray in a written communication as he recovers from a spine surgery at a private hospital. The government, he said, spent Rs 2,600 on upgrading hospitals and 14.4 lakh people have been treated free of cost under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Referring to infrastructure development works in the state, he said the Mumbai-Nagpur Balasaheb Thackeray Samruddhi Expressway would be commissioned soon. Terming Mumbai as India’s growth engine, the chief minister said the coastal road, Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link would revolutionise travel in Mumbai and the entire metropolitan region. The government, he said, is creating a strong network of roads, metros across the state even as it was mindful of protecting the environment. His government, he said, is a people’s government and thanked citizens for supporting his government throughout. The government, he said, fulfilled its assurance of loan waivers to farmers. Under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karzmukta yojana it waived off over Rs 20,000 crore in loans, he said. Farmers, he said, suffered on account of various natural calamities but each time the government offered relief more that prescribed under the National Disaster Respond Fund norms. The government is working on creating a master plan on various relief measures to be offered to farmers in case of calamities. The government offered financial aid to workers from the informal sector who have suffered due to Covid including orphans and women. To every police constable, his government has ensured will be promoted as an officer. His government, he said, has been recognised internationally for its efforts on mitigating the effects of climate change. “Inspiring Regional Leadership award was awarded to the state at the recently held COP26 conference in Scotland. The state also bagged the maximum number of awards in the Central government’s Swachchta Survey, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/converted-crisis-into-opportunity-cm-uddhav-thackeray-on-two-years-in-office/articleshow/87968419.cms||Clara Lewis
---||India||Amid rapid Omicron spread, India ups travel surveillance||With the proposed resumption of international flights on December 15 under review, the government issued fresh guidelines on Sunday, mandating RT-PCR test on arrival for all passengers from Covid at-risk countries. While those testing positive will be isolated and their samples sent for genomic testing, those testing negative will have to home-quarantine for a week and test on the eighth day. No cases of the variant have been detected in India so far. As of November 26, the list of at-risk countries include — countries in Europe including UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. Flyers also have to declare their travel details for the past 14 days. The Centre has asked states and UTs to focus on containment, surveillance and increased vaccination coverage besides beefing up genome sequencing measures. The enhanced protocol came on a day the Omicron variant surfaced in the Netherlands and Denmark, and Australia — half a world apart — and more countries tightened travel restrictions. Israel barred entry to foreigners and approved controversial phone-tracking of contacts. Morocco suspended all incoming air travel from around the world for two weeks starting Monday. Indonesia and Saudi Arabia too imposed fresh curbs. While South Africa questioned the “act first, ask questions later” approach of the global community in blockading travel, calling it a blow to its economy, the EU said it needed to buy time. “We know that we are in a race against time... And the scientists and manufacturers need 2-3 weeks to have a full picture about the quality of the mutations of this Omicron variant,” European Commission president Von der Leyen said.

Officials have now started a survey to find out exactly how many such cases are there where owners of buildings are paying tax as residential houses, whereas the entire house has been leased out to nursing homes, restaurants, hotels or shops. Some owners have leased out a part of their residential houses for commercial establishments. Large number of garages have been leased out for setting up shops, especially those on the main roads. Manager of AMC, Debasish Pradhan, said that those commercial establishments set up in buildings which are paying taxes as residential houses will not be given trade licences. Taking a tough stand to quell this growing problem, he said businessmen applying for new trade licences will have to produce documents to show whether they are paying taxes as per commercial establishment. After due verification, a trade licence will be issued. He added that after the list is prepared, owners of houses which are not following the rule book have to pay hefty fines and be prepared for legal action. He said many kindergarten schools, banks, ATMs are functioning from such residential houses too. Pradhan said those commercial establishments who are functioning from residential houses will also face action as it is an illegal business.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/jharkhand-lens-on-business-units-operating-from-private-buildings/articleshow/87968499.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

The all-party meeting on Sunday, which was not attended by PM Narendra Modi, saw the opposition listing several issues they intend to raise in the winter session, which is likely to start on a stormy note with the opposition looking to raise the heat despite the government’s decision to repeal the farm laws. The issues associated with the farm agitation were raised with gusto by the opposition parties and even parties that have cooperated with BJP in the customary meeting called by the government on the eve of the session. Modi’s decision to skip the meeting drew comments from Rajya Sabha leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, who said the opposition was keen to seek clarifications from the PM on whether farm laws can be brought back after some time. Defence minister Rajnath Singh chaired the meeting. Parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi later said it was not a set norm for the PM to attend the meeting. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Rahul Gandhi’s demand of Rs 4 lakh compensation for every family that suffered a Covid casualty should be accepted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-skips-all-party-meet-on-eve-of-winter-session/articleshow/87968654.cms||---

He said that a target has been set to prepare 2500 doctors every year and for this the MBBS seats have been increased to 1685 from 700 in 2014. The chief minister was addressing the 'Doctors Day Award function' organised under the aegis of Haryana Medical Council at Indradhanush Auditorium, Sector 5, Panchkula near here.. On this occasion , chief minister, along with health and famly welfare minister Anil Vij honoured 90 doctors above the age of 75 years by presenting them with the 'Vat Vriksha Award'. The 92-year old Dr. R.S. Sangwan from Sirsa, was also among those who received the honour. The chief minister said that the doctors of today's generation should take inspiration from the doctors of the older generation and serve the humanity with same spirit and devotion. He said that at present the number of doctors in both private and government sector in Haryana is about 13,000-14,000, whereas according to the UNO norms, there should be one doctor per 1000 population. If we consider the population of Haryana as 2.70 crore in 2021, then 27,000 doctors are required. To meet this demand, a target has been set to produce 2500 doctors every year, he added. Khattar said that required support and cooperation is also being received from the Central government in the medical sector. The National Cancer Institute has been established at Badsa in Jhajjar district. Apart from this, the process of setting up an AIIMS each in Rewari and Panchkula is going on. The land measuring 25 acres in Panchkula has already been handed over to the central government .  He said that a doctor is treated like a God by the patients. If after a long illness his state of mind becomes such that now death is certain, then at that time he gives himself up to the doctor.  Doctors also leave no stone unturned to save the patient. The chief minister recalled that when he himself was admitted in Medanta for the treatment of Covid-19, he had closely observed the spirit of serving doctors. The chief minister further said that along with MBBS seats, about 600 seats for PG courses have also been increased. He said that in allocation of budget also, priority is being given to the education and health departments in comparison to other departments. There is an increase of 5-7 percent in the annual budget of other departments, while there is an increase of 12-15 percent in the budget of education and health departments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-will-prepare-2500-doctors-every-year-manohar-lal-khattar/articleshow/87968759.cms||Manvir Saini

Following the cluster cases emerging out of SDM medical college in Dharwad, the government appears to have taken a serious view of providing booster doses to the health care workers on priority and urged the centre to have a uniform national policy on the same. “We have written to the centre seeking their approval for a booster dose of the vaccine specifically for healthcare workers in light of the new strain of the virus and continued positive cases emerging in the state,” said Bommai. The CM said there needs to be a national policy which needs to be mandated for the purpose, and that once it is done then Karnataka will immediately start giving the booster doses. There are as many as 9 lakh healthcare workers who have been registered on the CoWin portal. Earlier, Bommai said the state government has also urged the centre to ban all flights from the “high risk countries” of Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong to curb the rapidly spreading Omicron virus strain of Covid-19. CM Bommai also hinted at the government making it mandatory for people to get vaccinated for both private companies and government employees. “The two doses are being mandated for everyone who enters any malls, private companies or government offices, including the employees,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-writes-to-centre-to-approve-booster-dose-for-health-workers-cm-bommai/articleshow/87968911.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The exam to be held in two shifts for recruitment of teachers for UP government schools was called off, basic education minister Satish Dwivedi said, adding, “it would be held within a month” and candidates wouldn’t have to pay the fee again. A new date would be announced soon. As many as 19.99 lakh aspirants were to write the TET at 2,736 centres. CM Yogi directed officials to hold the test within a month and ensure that the admit cards were accepted as “free pass” on state transport buses for the candidates to travel to and from exam centres. “Those involved in the misdeed must know that a case is being registered against them under Gangsters Act along with National Security Act and their property will be confiscated,” he said in Deoria. According to police, the gang was busted following information that it had managed to get hold of a question paper before the exam. “It surfaced during investigation that the TET paper found with an accused matched the one to be given to the examinees in the first shift. There were multiple gangs active in six districts in the state,” said Amitabh Yash, additional director general of UP Police special task force (STF) that went after the gangs. The STF has picked up 26 suspects so far — 16 from Prayagraj, four from Lucknow, three from Shamli, one each from Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar and Kaushambi. The three arrested in Shamli district had procured 10 copies of the question paper for Rs 5 lakh, and had taken Rs 50,000 each from 50-60 candidates to give it to them before the test, STF sources said. Another gang took Rs 15,000 from each candidate for the paper. Explaining the modus operandi, ADG Yash said the gangs operated at two levels — take money from candidates and give them the test paper in return, and arrange “solvers” from Bihar to write the exam in place of the real candidates. Eleven of those arrested were “solvers”, one was a candidate, another a primary school teacher, and three kingpins of different gangs. Ten of them ran an organised racket. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said all information was shared with the government and the UP Basic Education Board (UPBEB) that conducts the TET.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-teachers-test-put-off-after-paper-leak-29-held/articleshow/87968973.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Rahul Gandhi’s demand of Rs 4 lakh compensation for every family that suffered a Covid casualty should be accepted, while Chinese aggression has to be debated, besides price rise, unemployment and the Pegasus scandal. Shiv Sena’s Vinayak Raut raised the issue of an MSP law, China and GST arrears of Maharashtra. Trinamool Congress’s focus is on the extension of jurisdiction of BSF among other issues. Government assured opposition parties that all issues will be discussed and called for smooth functioning of Parliament with the monsoon session having seen continuous disruptions by the opposition on the Pegasus issue. Later in the NDA floor leaders meeting, alliance partner National People's Party demanded the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. National People's Party MP Agatha Sangma told reporters said since the farm laws will be repealed and this was primarily keeping in mind the interests of the people, therefore, she requested the government to repeal the CAA keeping in mind the same sort of sentiments of the people from the northeast. “There was no response from the government but it has taken note of the demand,” Sangma said. Sources said issues are common to all parties and a coordinated stance against the government was likely despite the chill in relations between Congress and Trinamool Congress, and the likely absence of some other parties from the meeting called by Kharge on Monday morning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjp-ally-npp-seeks-caa-repeal-govt-seeks-smooth-functioning-of-house/articleshow/87969082.cms||---

Cohesity is expected to offer the highest package of Rs 1.46 crore (or 1,95,000 USD), followed by Glean, that has a package of Rs 1.12 crore (or 1,50,000 USD) on offer. These packages also include incentives and other stock options.  The annual placement season will kick off virtually at all the major IITs on December 1. After a slow season last year in the pandemic, students are expecting this year’s placements to start on a good note. While cloud data management company, Rubrik, too will be offering a US role for a package of Rs 75 lakh (or 1,00,000 USD), HiLabs is yet to confirm. Most of the top software roles are usually taken by students from the computer science and engineering, followed by the electronic students. A couple of firms offering US roles are also planning to recruit from the campus. Microsoft, which usually picks students for international profiles, has confirmed only domestic ones for this year’s placements, said a final-year student. “Direct US placements have anyway declined in the past few years, irrespective of the pandemic,” he added. Of the international roles on offer, a large number will be from companies in Japan and Singapore.  Among the Japanese firms, offering attractive packages are Sony Japan, Hyundai (research & development) and Rakuten. Some international profiles, which are not located in the US, will be paying in USD too, said a student. Other IT majors such as Apple, Google, Oracle, Uber, will be visiting the campus (virtually) only with domestic roles.

The BJP in its manifesto for the Maharashtra assembly polls in 2019 had stated that it will recommend Veer Savarkar's name to the Centre for the highest civilian award if the saffron party retained power. “Earlier, we did not even imagine that Article 370 of the Constitution would be abrogated in Jammu and Kashmir.

Mamata Banerjee's TMC, which got just one seat in Ambassa Municipality, said it had petitioned the Supreme Court with “evidence” of how the November 25 elections were rigged. CPM got three seats while the fledgling Tipraha Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance (Tipra) snatched a rare victory from BJP in Ambassa. While BJP grabbed the lion's share of votes overall with 59%, TMC emerged as the strongest opposition party in the seats it contested with a 24% vote share. Soon after the results were declared, suspected BJP supporters attacked the houses of two TMC candidates and a counting agent at Teliamura in Khowai distroct and a CPM functionary in Sabroom. Section 144 was clamped in Teliamura after 12 people, including three cops, were injured in an attack on a bus carrying TMC supporters, according to a PTI report that quoted Khowai SP Kiran Kumar. CM Biplab Kumar Deb, without naming TMC, told the media that voters had given “a befitting reply to slander by a party that does not even have a base” in Tripura. “I dedicate today’s victory to the people of Tripura. They (BJP’s detractors) defamed Tripura with false and fabricated allegations, but the results indicate that the people will remain with PM Modi,” he said. TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who led his party's Tripura campaign, said there was much to look forward to based on its performance on debut. “It is exceptional for a party beginning with a negligible presence to successfully contest municipal elections and emerge as the principal opposition in the state with more than 20% vote share.” He alleged that TMC was not allowed to file nominations in 90% of the civic bodies at the behest of BJP. CPM state secretary Jitendra Chowdhury said, “BJP would not have won a single seat in the civic poll had the elections been free, fair and peaceful. They actually looted the votes, disrespecting the people's mandate. In the next assembly election, voters will give them a proper reply.” Watch BJP sweeps Tripura civic polls but TMC has something to cheer about||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agartala/bjp-sweeps-tripura-civic-polls-bags-329-of-334-seats-tmc-claims-gains/articleshow/87969240.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

A delay of two hours would have drastically reduced the chances of recovery. Sandeep, who hails from Rajasthan, lost his left thumb while working on a saw machine in September. His modest income did not allow him treatment in Dubai. Doctors there put the thumb between the fingers and wrapped a bandage around it. The family took him to Aakash Healthcare, it being the nearest hospital to the airport. The saw had cut three vessels causing loss of 300 ml of blood in less than 24 hours, doctors at the hospital said. “We took him in for surgery within 10 minutes of reaching the hospital. The procedure, technically known as ‘reimplantation’ and conducted under regional anesthesia, took six hours to complete. This is a highly specialised process where micro suture and micro instruments are used,” said Dr Aashish Chaudhry, director & head, orthopaedics & joint replacement department. The doctors harvested a part of a vein from the forearm to place between the severed arteries of the thumb. The patient has recovered well and is ready to join work in another fortnight, Chaudhry said. Doctors termed it a rare surgery as an amputated thumb can be successfully reattached within 24 hours only if it is preserved in a cold container or surrounded by ice.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dubai-to-delhi-with-severed-thumb-and-in-nick-of-time/articleshow/87969314.cms||---

Describing Kannadigas as attached to ISRO, which launched Gaganyaan, Shivakumar said any move to shift the project from the state would prove detrimental to their trust in the Centre. “They (Kannadigas) are aghast to learn there are attempts to shift this prestigious project from Bengaluru to Gujarat. If this happens, people of the state will feel the Centre is ignoring, betraying and giving scant respect to them. It will hurt the self-respect of Kannadigas.

---||Kolkata||In Kolkata, 2 cyclists, coachman, cart-puller booked for ‘drink-driving’||KOLKATA: It makes horse sense not to mix drink and drive. Just to reinforce this timeless rule of the road, Kolkata police have prosecuted a coachman allegedly caught drunk in the saddle of his horse-drawn carriage, adding to a list of unusual offenders that already includes two cyclists and a cycle-cart puller. On Friday night, a team from the headquarters traffic guard stopped a horse-drawn carriage returning from the Maidan area, where it is a popular transport option for tourists visiting Victoria Memorial and other sights in the vicinity. On being subjected to a breathalyser test, the coachman was found to have a blood alcohol level of 32 mg/100 ml, slightly higher than the permissible limit of 30 mg/100 ml. He was prosecuted for “committing public nuisance” and fined Rs 50. Around the same time, Jorabagan traffic guard stopped a cycle-cart puller during a routine check at north Kolkata’s Sovabazar crossing. He allegedly looked inebriated and a breathalyser test confirmed it, the police said. He was handed over to Burtolla police and fined Rs 100 under Section 290 of the IPC. Jorabagan traffic cops, who had for the first time booked a cyclist for “drink-riding” on Friday night, penalised another cyclist at the same spot on Saturday night. Sources said subjecting users of non-mechanised transport to breathalyser tests had become necessary after 14 accidents — three of them fatal — in the first 25 days of this month. Also, CCTV footage from across the city indicates that a large section of these road users do not follow traffic rules, they said. According to traffic cops, at least 6,000 non-mechanised vehicles ply in central Kolkata alone. The order to prosecute inebriated cyclists was issued by DCP Traffic Arijit Sinha last Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/in-kolkata-2-cyclists-coachman-cart-puller-booked-for-drink-driving/articleshow/87969386.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||‘Omicron 6 times more transmissible than Delta, could infect even vaccinated’||HYDERABAD: The newly emerged variant of concern B.1.1.529 (Omicron) may not respond to monoclonal antibody therapy or cocktail treatment, experts fear. Based on preliminary analysis of Omicron infections in South Africa and elsewhere, experts suggest that it has six times higher potential to spread (R value) than the Delta variant that had triggered the second wave in India. It could also evade the immune system. It may also cause vaccine breakthrough infections. The Delta variant, which causes heavy infections and mortality, responds to monoclonal antibody therapy. However, its offspring, the Delta plus, did not respond to this therapy, considered a miracle treatment for Covid-19 in initial stages of infection. After the Delta plus, Omicron is the second variant of concern that may not respond to monoclonal antibody treatment. According to Mercy Rophina, research scholar at IGIB, the new lineage carries a total of 53 variants precisely, including 32 spike protein variants. “Most of the observed variants are found to possess resistance against immunity and other functional implications. Six variants with spike receptor binding domain on G339D, S373P, G496S, Q498R and Y505H are found resistant to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) including etesevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab, imdevimab and their cocktails,” Rophina tweeted. In a series of tweets on the new variant, Scaria, an expert in genome sciences, said at least one case of B.1.1.529 in Israel seems to have received a Covid-19 vaccine booster, suggesting the variant can cause vaccine breakthrough infections. “The disease severity is yet to be known, which is the most important point to consider. While vaccine breakthrough infections per se are not the major concern (Delta also caused vaccine breakthrough infections), transmissibility and clinical outcomes (severity and mortality) are the key points,” he said. Rophina, who is from Scaria’s lab, compiled the structural context of the immune escape mutations in Omicron. Scaria said three mutations in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site possibly suggests better cell entry (and may be transmissibility). He, however, added that properties of single mutations don't always add up when they occur in combination. Nevertheless, they give potential directions to explore. “Notwithstanding the potential for bias in sequencing, the B.1.1.529 variant seemingly is becoming dominant (almost 0 to 75% in 2 weeks) in South Africa. More sequences and data are awaited over the coming days. The B.1.1.529 variants seemed to be spreading rapidly in South Africa, faster than other variants of concern we have seen in the past,” Scaria said in his tweet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/omicron-6-times-more-transmissible-than-delta-could-infect-even-vaccinated/articleshow/87969450.cms||Syed Akbar

Another five inmates who are suspected to be infected have also been hospitalised. The area has been declared a containment zone. Importantly, 60 of the 62 infected were fully vaccinated, the health department said. An inmate was the first to test positive on Friday after he was screened at a private facility. Thereafter, a team of government doctors visited the Matoshree old age home in Sorgaon village in rural Bhiwandi on Saturday and tested 109 inmates, said Dr Manish Renghe, district health officer. Following the tests, the cluster of cases was discovered. Among the relatives of the staffers who came positive are a pregnant woman and a girl aged two and a half years. It is one of the biggest clusters to be detected in recent months from Thane district. An international academic report that came out in May this year outlined the risk factors for Covid-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs). As frontliners battling the pandemic, they are most at risk of acquiring the infection for being directly or indirectly exposed to infectious material. While the pandemic has placed immense pressure on health systems, experts have pointed out the need for healthcare providers to ensure vaccination and devise protocols on how best to distribute scarce resources equitably between HWCs and patients. The 55 Matoshree inmates, all above 60 years of age, were admitted to Thane Civil Hospital for treatment early on Sunday. Of the total infected, one male patient is admitted in ICU while six others are in general wards. Among the total positive cases, 39 are male. Around 41 patients have comorbidities, while 32 are showing symptoms. The pregnant woman and child have been admitted to the civil hospital. Dr Renghe said Sorgaon has been declared as a containment zone and the district administration is keeping a tab on the health of other inmates. “We are taking adequate steps to curb further spread of the infection,” he said. At least 15 samples from the cluster are likely to be sent for genome sequencing, he added. Meanwhile, 108 new patients were added in Thane district on Sunday, taking the total count of positive patients to 5.69 lakh. No death was reported in the district, maintaining the tally of Covid fatalities at 11,581. The count of active positive patients was 1,062 on Sunday. Officials said they have stepped up vaccination in the district with nearly 21,000 taking jabs on Sunday; 93 lakh doses have been delivered till date in Thane district, of which 58 lakh are first doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/62-test-positive-maharashtra-old-age-home-now-containment-zone/articleshow/87969499.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The highest 65,584 cases were reported by Germany on Saturday. The top 10 countries, with upwards of 20,000 positive cases daily, are mostly in Europe and US, warning of the possibility of a fresh wave of the virus infections with vaccination also affected by hesitancy. And while these nations are suffering despite vaccines being available, much of Africa is awaiting supplies of the shots that are largely with the developed world. Most of these affluent countries witnessing a sudden surge of new infections have fully vaccinated at least 60-70% of their population. India's fully vaccinated population is under 32% but its infection rate has plunged to almost 8,000 cases a day, helped by a large coverage of at least one shot and immunity that has been detected in post the high infectious Delta wave. Russia with 34,000 cases a day remains an exception among high prevalence nations where infections are on the rise given low vaccination coverage of 38% of population even as appeals led by president Vladimir Putin have had little effect. Larry Corey, professor of medicine and virology at University of Washington studied the pattern of Delta variant in August and noted that it had the potency to infect a larger number of contacts than all other variants, but among those who were hospitalized, an unprecedented 95-98% were unvaccinated. “When we look at who’s in the hospital among adults, we see an unprecedented number of people who have not been vaccinated – 95-98%. The same pattern is seen with children. COVID-19 Delta strain is a hospital epidemic of the unvaccinated,” he wrote in a paper for the JHU. The slowing down of daily cases in India somewhat attest to Prof Corey’s observations as a large population in the country had been infected by the more infectious Delta variant in April-May. Combined with seropositivity of up to 90% in major cities and towns, a universal vaccination campaign by the government has sort of created immunity against the virus and may be the reason for lower numbers of infections. India, however, needs to complete the targeted 100% coverage of the two dosages of the vaccination to insulate its adult population from any new variant. Reports have shown there are at least 20 crore vaccine doses remaining unused with states, just half of them required to fully vaccinate the entire adult population. Though India’s total coverage may be less than the US or other European countries, in sheer numbers, India had fully vaccinated 43 crore people as against 19.6 crore in the US. China leads all countries having fully vaccinated more than a billion (107 crore) of its total population.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/west-seeing-surge-despite-higher-fully-vaccinated-population/articleshow/87969588.cms||Pradeep Thakur

This will include those transiting from these places too. Those testing negative must home quarantine for seven days and then re-test on the eighth day. Those who are testing positive will be admitted to seperate isolation facility and their sample sent for genomic testing and would be discharged if found not infected with the Omicron variant. Those found to be infected with this new variant will be kept in “strict isolation” and treated till they test negative. Union health ministry on Sunday issued a new protocol for international arrivals in the wake of a new variant found in southern Africa, Hong Kong, and some other countries to prevent its spread here. This adds to the existing norms like a negative report from a RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of flying into India and filing a self-declaration form. They must also add details of their travel in the last 14 days from the time of arrival. To be sure, the government will keep updating the list of at-risk countries as the situation evolves. Five per cent of the passengers flying in from not-at-risk countries will also be tested on arrival on a random basis. "The cost of testing of such passengers would be borne by the aviation ministry," the order says. Their samples will also be sent for genomic testing and they will be treated as per “standard protocol”. Children unde five years of age continue to be exempt from both pre- and post-arrival test if they are asymptomatic. “Contacts” of positive cases from at-risk countries — their co-passengers seated in the same row and three rows in front and behind their row and identified cabin crew — will be kept under institutional or home quarantine, under strict monitoring of the state government concerned. As of November 26, the health ministry's list of at-risk countries include: countries in Europe including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-variant-india-updates-norms-for-international-passengers/articleshow/87969626.cms||---
---||India||Non-BJP states lagging in disbursing ex-gratia, Supreme Court told||New Delhi: Most opposition-ruled states, barring Delhi, have either not disbursed Rs 50,000 ex-gratia to kin of Covid victims or have abysmally low disbursal rate, the Centre informed the Supreme Court on Sunday through an affidavit that collated data in this regard from all states and UTs. The SC had in October approved the Centre’s decision to grant Rs 50,000 to kin of each person who succumbed to Covid. With the country recording nearly 4.5 lakh Covid deaths, the financial burden as of now at the rate of Rs 50,000 for kin of each Covid victim would cast a cumulative financial burden of Rs 2,250 crore on the states. The top ten big states which reported the maximum Covid deaths are: Maharashtra (1.41 lakh), Kerala (39,000), Karnataka (38,000), Tamil Nadu (36,000), Delhi (31,000), UP (23,000), West Bengal (19,000), Punjab (17,000), Andhra Pradesh (14,000) and Chhattisgarh (14,000). As per the statistics provided in the Centre’s affidavit, Delhi government has led the states in disbursal of the ex-gratia to Covid victims’ kin. It recorded 31,017 deaths, received 25,358 claims applications and has already disbursed Rs 99.63 crore to 19,926 relatives of Covid victims. Meghalaya too did exceedingly well in disbursal of ex-gratia. The state saw 1,318 deaths and received 996 claims applications, all of which has been processed and ex-gratia disbursed. But, the big states have an abysmal record. Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government in Maharashtra, which recorded 1,40,807 deaths, has not yet opened application forms for submission of claims. Hence, it has not been able to disburse a single penny to the kin of Covid victims. The SC is scheduled to hear a PIL filed by Gaurav Bansal in this regard on Monday. The Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left-Front government in Kerala, which registered 38,737 Covid deaths during the pandemic, has so far received 6,116 applications claiming ex-gratia. But, no money has been disbursed so far as there is no clarity on “who is the next of kin” of the deceased. M K Stalin-led DMK government in Tamil Nadu has not provided any information to the Centre on disbursal of any ex-gratia amount to the kin of 36,401 persons who succumbed to Covid. Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government in West Bengal, which recorded 19,407 Covid deaths, has received only 124 claim applications and disbursed the ex-gratia to only 96 applicants. Charanjit Singh Channi-led government in Punjab, which registered 16,588 Covid deaths, has received only 1,818 claim applications but has not disbursed any money to any of the kin. Bhupesh-Baghel-led Congress government in Chhattisgarh saw 13,593 Covid deaths and has received 9,934 claims applications. But, it has not provided any information about disbursal of ex-gratia. Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan had recorded 8,955 Covid deaths in the state. It has so far received only 329 claim applications but has not disbursed any money to the kin. Y S Jagan Reddy-led government in Andhra recorded 14,431 deaths due to Covid. Interestingly it received 28,468 claim applications, almost double the number of deaths Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar granted ex-gratia to kin of 8,800 out of 9,663 who died of Covid. Yogi Adityanath-led UP government which recorded 22,909 Covid deaths, has so far received 3,071 claim applications and granted ex-gratia in 1,083 cases.MP, Haryana and Odisha governments have also not performed well in fund disbursal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/non-bjp-states-lagging-in-disbursing-ex-gratia-supreme-court-told/articleshow/87969668.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The health ministry advised states and UTs to immediately focus on intensive containment, active surveillance, increased vaccination coverage as well as enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour. Apart from rigorous surveillance of international passengers and enhanced testing, the health ministry has also directed states to monitor hotspots and send positive samples for genome sequencing. The move came soon after PM chaired a high level review meeting on Saturday and asked officials at the Centre to proactively engage with states and UTs. Immediately after the meeting, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to all chief secretaries and administrators of states and UTs listing a series of measures that need to be implemented immediately. “As a proactive step, government has already placed countries where this VoC has been found in the category of ‘At-Risk’ countries for additional follow up measures of international travellers coming into India from these countries,” Bhushan said in the letter sent to states on Saturday. The Centre suggested that all international travellers from and transiting through these countries are subjected to rigorous screening. In his letter to states, Bhushan pointed out that there is already a reporting mechanism for obtaining past travel details of passengers. In this regard, a meeting was chaired by home secretary on Sunday where the overall global situation was reviewed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/containment-key-monitor-hotspots-govt-tells-states/articleshow/87969723.cms||---
---||India||India leading world in startups a turning point in growth story: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Turning the spotlight on the importance of startups, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the country, in a way, is leading in the world in this domain and this could be a turning point in India’s growth story. The country now has more than 70 startups or unicorns that have crossed the $1-billion valuation. In his radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat, the PM said in every country with a large youth population, three aspects, “ideas, innovation and the can-do spirit”, matter a lot. “When these three things combine, phenomenal results are produced, miracles happen,” he said. “These days, all we hear about from every corner is about startup, startup, startup. It is true, this is the era of startup, and it is also true that in the world of startup, India is leading in a way in the world today. The reach of startups has increased even in small towns of the country,” Modi pointed out. The PM said the word ‘unicorn’ is in vogue. A ‘unicorn is a startup whose valuation is at least $1 billion, that is more than about Rs 7,000 crore. “Till 2015, there used to be hardly nine or ten unicorns in the country. Now India is flying high even in the world of unicorns. According to a report, a big change has come this year. In just 10 months, a unicorn is being raised in India every 10 days,” Modi said. He drew attention to the fact this achievement is also big because India’s youth have achieved this success in the midst of the corona pandemic. “Today there are more than 70 unicorns in India. That is, there are more than 70 startups that have crossed the valuation of more than $1 billion,” Modi emphasised. Sharing that Indian youth are also contributing to the solution of global problems through startups, the PM interacted with Mayur Patil who along with his three college friends has put forward a solution to the problem of pollution by introducing technology by which he managed to reduce emissions of buses by 40%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-leading-world-in-startups-a-turning-point-in-growth-story-pm-modi/articleshow/87969778.cms||---

Parents of the players who informed the Indian high commission about the incident were later told that they had been provided accommodation & food in Botswana capital Gaborone. tnn"We have been told they will be under the care of the high commission until they leave Botswana," a parent told TOI. Another Indian shuttler, Farogh Sanjay Aman, who won the men's singles title on Sunday defeating Bengaluru;s Naren in the final, is headed for the South Africa International, which begins in Johannesburg on December 2.Parents are also in touch with their travel agents, seeking a detour and other transit destinations which haven't banned flights from Botswana and South Africa.All seemed well when the players landed in Lobatse on December 23. The first sign of disruption in travel arose on Saturday when return tickets of some of the players using Doha as their transit point were cancelled. Hours later, they could book again on Qatar Airways but that too was cancelled on Sunday evening, the parent said TOI."We booked tickets for November 30 the second time," the parent said.Meanwhile, three players from Karnataka -- Saneeth S Dayanand, Janani Ananthkumar and Shamanth Rao Kidiyoor, who were bound for Johannesburg for the South Africa International -- have withdrawn from the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/three-indian-shuttlers-stuck-in-botswana/articleshow/87969802.cms||---

BMRCL had sought clearance to fell 833 trees, but the tree officer and deputy conservator of forests, BBMP, in an official memorandum said that permission to remove 44 trees has been denied and they shall remain at their current location. V Govindraju, deputy conservator of forests, BBMP, said, “BMRCL submitted an application in June this year requesting to cut 833 trees between Central Silk board junction and Kodibeesanhalli (9.7 kilometres). “The tree office reviewed the application, inspected the trees mentioned and took a call on which of them had to be felled, relocated or retained,” he said. Further, a Tree Expert Committee (TEC) was formed by the state government as per the directions of the Karnataka high court. “The committee further inspected the list provided to them by the tree officer and scheduled a field visit in the presence of BMRCL engineers and the tree officer. The engineers explained to the committee where the pillars might come up or where the wires might be laid and then a final decision was taken on which trees had to be retained, felled or relocated,” Govindraju added. BMRCL has also been informed to carry out work in a manner that the roots of these 44 trees aren’t disturbed. Meanwhile, BMRCL has made another application to cut 1,026 trees for the ORR line between Kodibessanhalli and KR Puram. Govinraju confirmed that the location has been identified to relocate 212 trees. “They are going to be shifted to various locations in and around the place from where they will be removed. Some will be going to military land, wetlands of some lakes and other places,” Govindraju added. The translocation process is likely to begin after a 15-day period allowed for the public to file objections. Once translocation is over, the process of felling 577 trees will begin.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/orr-corridor-bmrcl-gets-nod-to-fell-577-translocate-212-trees/articleshow/87969824.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Despite CSR fund, Tamil school in Bengaluru faces closure||BENGALURU: It may be the end of the road for a 91-year-old Tamil government high school in the heart of Bengaluru despite offers of help pouring in under corporate social responsibility to repair and revive it. Reason: The state education department wants the school to be shut. Located in the heart of the city and built in 1930, the Tamil government high school in Ashoknagar is one of the few existing minority language government schools being run in Karnataka. Through the years, areas around the school developed, but the institution itself got a raw deal from successive state governments vis-a-vis maintaining its basic infrastructure. So much so that the tiled roof is broken, there are no functional toilets and there has been no power supply for seven years. Today, the school has barely 10 students on its rolls and one teacher. Having witnessed the crumbling infrastructure and the need for its revival, the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) approached the local Rotary Club of South Parade and decided to revive the “almost” heritage structure. On October 30, the state government even wrote to INTACH, asking it to submit its past records of renovating and reviving the Fort High School. Based on this letter, INTACH and Rotary Club roped in a corporate firm to raise funds, in the range of Rs 27-30 lakh, for the project. However, when the club and INTACH approached the deputy director of public instructions (DDPI) to finalise the dates for the groundbreaking ceremony, they were told that the local block education officer had given an adverse report and allegedly had sought closure of the instituion. Department of public instruction (DPI) commissioner R Vishal reiterated this decision and said the government is trying to persuade the Rotary Club and INTACH to invest the same funds in some other schools where there are substantial number of students. Education minister BC Nagesh too agreed and cited the example of the renovated structure of Fort High School, where despite huge investments there has been no significant rise in student enrolment. Meanwhile, speculation is rife that there is an intentional effort to shut the school given the prime location of the government property. Housed on a 15,514 sq ft area in Ashoknagar, the land is allegedly being looked as realty goldmine. Nagesh, however, asserted that the education department won’t let any of its properties be taken for commercial use. The DPI commissioner said he will soon meet the BEO of the Shantinagar area and discuss what best can be done with the land parcel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/despite-csr-fund-tamil-school-faces-closure/articleshow/87969825.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

---||Bengaluru||Man who started on ₹2k monthly pay holds assets 14X more than income||Bengaluru: Vasudev RN joined government service for a monthly salary of Rs 2,000 in 1995. After he took voluntary retirement as project director-planning, Nirmiti Kendra, a few months ago, his assets were worth Rs 30 crore. Though the 57-year-old was drawing a monthly salary of Rs 1.5 lakh, his assets were 1,434% in excess of his known sources of income, said Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) investigators.Among the 15 government officials raided by ACB last week, Vasudev was arrested on Saturday for not cooperating with the investigation. “We suspect he has more properties and he isn’t providing us details. He did not cooperate with our inquiry, and hence we arrested him,” ACB officials said.A day after the raid, ACB had declared that Vasudev’s assets were worth Rs 18.2 crore, 880% in excess of his known sources of income. To ACB’s surprise, details of more of his assets kept tumbling out of bank lockers in his wife and son’s names and the bedroom of his Kengeri residence. The sheer volume of papers pertaining to the disproportionate assets stretched ACB’s resources and left it exhausted, so much so, that the 30-member raid team had to be augmented by over 20 people. ACB seized the documents pertaining to these assets and after scouring through them for almost 18 hours, it calculated the worth of Vasudev’s total assets at Rs 31.2 crore. According to the revised estimates, the assets are worth 1,434% in excess of his known sources of income.ACB officials said that they have recovered documents pertaining to 28 houses, some of them flats in apartments, and 16 sites in and around Bengaluru belonging to Vasudev. Most of the houses have been rented out. Besides, he also owns three acres of land in Nelamangala and 11 acres near Doddaballapur. His moveable properties included a Volvo XC60, worth around Rs 70 lakh, a Mercedes Benz, five top-end Innova SUVs, a Skoda Octavia and a Tata Nexon, 925 grams of gold, nine kg silver, Rs 17 lakh cash and Rs 1.3 crore in different bank accounts.“His total assets are valued at Rs 31,20,39,868. Of this, the ACB has estimated that around Rs 29,70,39,868 are in excess of his known source of income,” ACB officials said. “First, a team of 30 ACB officials raided Vasudev on Wednesday. That day, we searched six different locations. Now, the team strength has been increased to more than 50 as more documents are being examined,” ACB sources said, adding: “Each day, we begin work at 6am and wind up little before midnight.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/man-who-started-on-2k-monthly-pay-holds-assets-14x-more-than-income/articleshow/87969829.cms||---

The two are now on a quest to find the suitcase, which also contains clothes for a wedding they are scheduled to attend. The coconuts were to be part of a belated Bhai Dooj celebration in Uttarakhand. Education content developer and Kodihalli resident Astha Chaudhary and her mother booked an Air India flight, AI 804, from Bengaluru to Delhi on Saturday as they were headed to their relative’s wedding in Kashipur, Uttarakhand. “We checked in two suitcases at Kempegowda International Airport around 5am and took off in the 6.10am flight. We landed in Delhi by 9am. I was shocked to realise that one of our checked-in suitcases hadn’t reached our destination. I enquired with Air India ground staff at Delhi airport, who checked with their Bengaluru counterparts and informed us that the bag was retained in Bengaluru as there were dry coconuts inside,” Astha said. She said Air India staff asked her to wait at the airport for an update on the missing luggage. “I waited outside the airport for two hours but there was no update. The airline gave me a property irregularity report for my complaint. Its phone helplines have been unresponsive since,” she claimed. Astha is enraged that the airline failed to flag the coconut issue soon after her luggage was checked in Bengaluru. “If they had reached out to us at Bengaluru airport itself, we would have discarded the coconuts and got our bag with our wedding clothes. We had no clue dry coconuts were banned on flights,” she said. ‘Mentioned on tickets’According to an Air India spokesperson, it is clearly mentioned on the tickets that items such as lighters, matchboxes, firearms, dry coconuts (copra) and others that pose a fire hazard are not allowed in check-in or hand luggage. “Passengers must read the rules carefully and not carry prohibited items to prevent their bags from being offloaded. In this case, the passenger should get in touch with the ground staff at KIA and collect the luggage directly or give an undertaking to another person who can collect it on her behalf,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/woman-mom-fly-to-delhi-bag-with-coconuts-retained-at-kia/articleshow/87969830.cms||Petlee Peter

Describing Kannadigas as attached to ISRO, which launched Gaganyaan, Shivakumar said any move to shift the project from the state would prove detrimental to their trust in the Centre. “They (Kannadigas) are aghast to learn there are attempts to shift this prestigious project from Bengaluru to Gujarat. If this happens, people of the state will feel the Centre is ignoring, betraying and giving scant respect to them. It will hurt the self-respect of Kannadigas. The move will have an adverse effect on the consolidation of the country’s federal system...,” he said. Shivakumar wrote a similar letter to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, asking him to lead a delegation of state MPs to ensure the proposal is not implemented.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/dont-shift-gaganyaan-to-gujarat-dks-tells-pm/articleshow/87969834.cms||---

Seshadripuram police had registered a suo motu case under sections 79 and 80 of Karnataka Police Act against seven individuals and five workers found at Striker Association Recreation Club when the premises were raided after a tip-off about gambling. Thereafter, a chargesheet was filed before the metropolitan magistrate (traffic court-1), Mayo Hall. Police said they raided the club after obtaining permission from the magistrate and seized Rs 12,800 cash, 120 tokens of various colours, a 6x4 dart game board. However, Justice K Natarajan, after perusing the records placed before the court, said the magistrate’s order permitting police to register the case was not forthcoming. “The FIR was registered on March 13, 2020, and it reached the magistrate at 11am. This being the case, permission might have been sought by police on March 12, but it should have been submitted with the FIR and submission of the investigating officer. But nothing has been found,” he said. This proves the documents submitted were created only to show police obtained permission for raiding the club as per procedure, he said in his order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-nixes-gambling-case-cites-shortcomings-in-police-claims/articleshow/87969836.cms||Vasantha Kumar

The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation. Global cloud adoption has exhibited growth that would sustain at a massive scale. “Infrastructure software companies indexed to the cloud have weathered the Covid storm and infrastructure funding has gone global. Cloud-native is not an option, it’s a necessity,” the report said.Cloud has become a mainstay as companies are at different points in their transformation journeys. Gartner’s estimates showed that cloud spending is expected to represent 20% of the $842-billion overall infrastructure spending this year. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and desktop-as-a-service (DaaS) will see the highest growth in 2021, 38.5% and 67.7%, respectively, as CIOs face continued pressure to scale infrastructure that supports moving complex workloads to the cloud and the demands of a hybrid workforce, Gartner said.The Battery Ventures report said open-source and cloud financings have continued to accelerate, and there is a healthy backlog of private company unicorns gearing up for IPO. Privately held Databricks, for instance, has raised $1.6 billion in Series ‘H’ funding valuing the company at $38 billion. Databricks combines data warehouses and data lakes into its architecture. Tanium that offers endpoint management and security is valued at $9 billion.The report said the shift to remote work and distributed teams will continue to drive innovation on a global scale. “Cloud growth continues to exceed expectations, and the growing demand for flexible and scalable infrastructure will continue to drive cloud computing spend growth and increase the go-forward global cloud penetration rate,” it said.Toolchains are emerging to support new software development architectures. A toolchain is a set of software development tools that supports the development and deployment of different tasks. There are code-first companies like Github, Jenkins, Cypress, while API-first companies like Postman, Spotlight, Readme, and others. API platform Postman has secured $225 million in a Series D round that values the company at $5.6 billion.

---||India||Govt support & subsidy needed for diabetes patients: CJI Ramana||NEW DELHI: Chief Justice N V Ramana, a diabetic for 30 years, on Sunday said governments should provide “support and subsidy for diabetic care” as the cost of getting treated for this life-long disease is beyond the reach of common patients. Speaking at the Ahuja-Bajaj Symposium on Diabetes here, Justice Ramana said scientists could find vaccine for Covid within months but there has been no breakthrough in curing diabetes for centuries and that it has to be managed by observing a strict restrictive regimen for control of sugar levels, diet and lifestyle. “The human cost is immense. The economic cost to the nation is immeasurable. Therefore, it is essential that the State provides support and subsidy for diabetic care. The government also needs to train and introduce more healthcare professionals to deal with this problem,” he said. Narrating his own struggle with diabetes, the CJI said, “The need of the hour is to innovate and develop modern drugs and find a cure for this problem. Every time I see a report that a new drug for diabetes is about to be released, I anxiously look forward to it. For the last 30 years I have been taking the same drugs.” “I felt so happy when Indian scientists and researchers came up with a Covid vaccine within a few months, but unfortunately we are nowhere near to finding a permanent cure for diabetes, which is an ancient disease. My only wish is that a cure is found. For this, scientists and researchers have to give full attention to this aspect,” he added. He said apart from obesity and lack of physical activity, the other main cause for diabetes is stress. Terming judgeship a stressful job, the CJI said, “Maybe, if I had chosen some other profession other than this stressful legal profession, I would have saved Dr Anoop Mishra (whom he consults) the trouble of treating me.” Justice Ramana said stress management, discipline in diet and fitness regime are key to keep diabetes at bay. “It is an expensive disease which is a recurring financial burden for the lifetime of the patient. Insulin, other medicines and associated health care products are highly unaffordable for the vast majority of our population. In this context, availability of walk-in test, free of cost assumes great importance,” he said. Quoting WHO studies, the CJI said that of the total expenditure incurred in connection with diabetes, it is estimated that nearly 65% is spent on treatment and medicines, whereas the remaining 35% is social cost.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-support-subsidy-needed-for-diabetes-patients-cji-ramana/articleshow/87969841.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

CM Basavaraj Bommai said the state has urged the Centre to ban flights from high-risk nations like Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong to check the spread of new variant Omicron. He has suggested that there must be a national policy on booster shots and Karnataka will start giving the doses once it gets the nod. A circular issued by the principal secretary, department of health and family welfare, said that conferences, seminars and academic events in schools and colleges should also be postponed to avoid large congregations.

The ninth standard student of Greenwood High International School had won the Billoo Sethi trophy stroke play title earlier in the week.“It feels great to win the All-India,” said an elated Avani. “I started off really well and had the lead throughout the final. It feels special to complete a double,” added the teenager, who has been making waves with her performances this season.IN FULL CRYThe Bengalurean, also the top-ranked amateur in the country, was confidence personified, right from the get-go. Barring a slight wobble with the tape in sight, Avani was largely untroubled.One of the longest hitters in the women’s game in the country, Avani’s ball-striking was excellent and she kept the ball in the fairway for the good part of the final. She was also spot-on with her approaches and putted really well, not giving much of a look-in for Kriti on the day.flying startThe top seed started off in rousing fashion, birdieing the first and third holes to throw down the gauntlet. A brilliant chip-in birdie on the sixth saw her go 4-up. Although Kriti won the seventh and 12 holes, Avani was in complete control. She came up with a tough 12-foot putt to halve the hole on the 14th.Five-up after the first 18 holes, Avani, winner of two Women’s Pro Golf Tour titles this year, made it 6-up after the 27th hole to inch closer to victory.Kriti needed to come up with a something spectacular to stay alive. The 17-year-old from Jaipur nailed the pin with her tee shot on the 28th for birdie to pull one back. Then, two bad tee shots from Avani — on the 30th and 31st holes — saw Kriti win the two and raise visions of a cliff-hanger.However, Avani put the two blemishes behind her and sealed the title by winning the 34th hole with a par.Result (Final, 36 holes): 1-Avani Prashanth (Blr) bt 10-Kriti Chouhan (Jpr) 4 & 2.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/avani-completes-double/articleshow/87969882.cms||---
---||India||Govt agreed to review Rs 8L income cap over fear Supreme Court might scrap EWS quota||NEW DELHI: The fear that 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Sections as a whole may be scrapped by the Supreme Court led to the Centre tamely submitting that it will review the eligibility income ceiling of Rs 8 lakh for the quota catering to mostly the upper castes. While the Supreme Court had focused on how could the income ceiling for OBC reservation and the EWS quota be the same at Rs 8 lakh, the implied question of parity between the two quotas was up for argument. Seemingly similar, the Rs 8 lakh ceiling for OBC and EWS is different. The one for EWS is more stringent as it includes income from all sources including “salary”, while the income ceiling for OBC does not include “salary” and “agricultural income”. This is a key difference that makes Rs 8 lakh for OBCs relatively liberal as compared to the EWS. However, when the Supreme Court questioned the government about the parity between the OBC and EWS, and asked if there was any study done to arrive at Rs 8 lakh for the EWS, the Centre caved in. As per government sources, the concern was that complications on the tricky issue of process adopted to arrive at the figure could lead to the entire EWS policy being scrapped or put on hold. This was a big fear which prompted the Centre to pre-empt any drastic court order by agreeing to review the EWS norm. That was apparently the reason why the government did not argue that Rs 8 lakh in case of EWS and OBC were different in the sense of how they were calculated, and did not amount to parity between two groups that the court suggested. Well-placed sources said the government will form a panel to study the income ceiling for the EWS, and a decision may come early this week. Given that the implication of the court’s queries is that EWS income ceiling is on the higher side, the new income cap for eligibility May be much lower. The downward revision of eligibility income, which will make it more stringent for aspirants from the EWS bloc, is likely to be resented by target group. Sources said the EWS issue is unlikely to affect the proposal to overhaul the eligibility income criteria for OBC reservation. The government has proposed that income cap for Mandal quotas should include “salary”, which is not done presently. But Cabinet note is pending for over one and half years after it ran into a controversy with OBCs who protested the move to make eligibility norms stringent. It has also delayed periodic revision of income ceiling for OBCs, which government has proposed to be raised from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-agreed-to-review-8l-income-cap-over-fear-supreme-court-might-scrap-ews-quota/articleshow/87969894.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The number of employees resuming their duties is increasing. However, 25% of the workers are yet to rejoin. Despite several employees resuming their work, the unions had declared that their strike would continue. However, on Sunday, it was observed that the strike has somewhat fizzled out, at least in the region, as there was no sit-in protest or demonstrations at the CBS.  The day earlier, five contractual workers were fired from work. The increased number of employees joining work was the effect of strict action taken against MSRTC staffers.  Senior depot manager Ajay Patil said, “We expect all the employees to rejoin work from Monday. All buses will be operational once all workers rejoin. We are running buses along major routes in the district and at other places such as Pune and Mumbai.”  The staffers were demanding the merging of MSRTC with the government service. Last week, the buses of Karnataka state transport undertaking, which were plying between Karnataka and Maharashtra, were called off following the incidents of stone-pelting on MSRTC buses. On Sunday, after most of the MSRTC buses were operational, the Karnataka buses too resumed services in Maharashtra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/75-buses-in-kolhapur-city-operational/articleshow/87966754.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Particulate matters (PM) 10 and 2.5 continued to remain the lead pollutants in the atmosphere. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded air quality index (AQI) level of Patna at 342 at 4pm on Sunday. It was by far the highest AQI registered in the state capital in November this year. The city has witnessed four “very poor” AQI days, 21 “poor” days and three “moderate” days this month. Data from individual areas having continuous ambient air quality monitoring station showed five of them falling in the “very poor” category, including Planetarium (394), BIT-Patna (391), Eco Park (386), S K Memorial Hall (344) and DRM office-Khagaul (340). Only Patna City’s station was in “moderate” category with the AQI level of 200. An AQI below 50 is classified as “good”, between 51 and 100 “satisfactory” and between 101 and 200 “moderate”. “Poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500. “Very poor” air quality may cause respiratory illness to the people on prolonged exposure. The effects may be more pronounced in people with lung and heart diseases. As per the CPCB bulletin, the average PM10 (less than 10 microns) was recorded at 344 and PM 2.5 (less than 2.5 microns) at 394. The emergency threshold is when PM10 concentrations cross 500ug/m3 and PM2.5 300ug/m3. The Air Quality Early Warning System of the ministry of earth sciences, a forecasting agency. has predicted that the situation may slightly improve in Patna, but the AQI will remain in the “very poor” category due to meteorological conditions highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants till November-end. Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, said early onset of winter led to early formation of thermal inversion and it is one of the main reasons for the deterioration in AQI level. “Increase in vehicular movement and bursting of firecrackers during marriages are also responsible for the rise in AQI level. The wind is getting trapped over Patna and adjoining areas due to climatic reasons and pollution is also concentrated over this region, leading to the rise in AQI recordings,” he said. “The climate action plan will be implemented strictly in the districts as the Bihar chief secretary held a meeting with the secretaries of departments of building construction, road construction, urban development and housing department and environment, forest and climate change in this regard. The state has to strictly follow the plan for at least 3-4 years for better results,” Ghosh said. Meanwhile, Chhapra’s AQI was recorded in “severe” category at 431 on Sunday, Siwan (426), Sasaram (401), Bhagalpur (291), Darbhanga (331), Gaya (290), Hajipur (326), Katihar (338), Kishanganj (243), Motihari (339), Muzaffarpur (313), Purnia (315) and Rajgir (359).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/smog-engulfs-patna-aqi-turns-very-poor/articleshow/87967208.cms||Faryal Rumi

Reeta Singh, senior scientist and head of KVK, Katihar, said 50 farmers of the district have so far been tied up with this project this year. “Farmers of Rautara, Dighri and Dharhan panchayats are already engaged in modern method of makhana cultivation. We provide high-yield variety of makhana seeds, fertilizer, insecticides and other materials to the farmers." “Sabour makhana 1 seed variety gives an output of 32-35 quintal per hectare. In case of traditional variety of seeds, the yield would be 16 to 18 quintal per hectare. A farmer can easily earn a net profit of Rs 3.5 lakh per hectare by adopting modern method of makhana cultivation,” Singh added. Ranjeet Kumar, a makhana grower of Dharhan panchayat under Pranpur block in the district, said, “I was provided 25kg makhana seeds (Sabour makhana 1 variety) as well as medicines, fertilizer, insecticides and other materials. The output was 30 quintal per hectare. The deal was more profitable than the traditional method of farming. In the new variety, the percentage of puffed makhana formation is 60%.” Another makhana farmer, Gopal Mishra of Rautara panchayat, also expressed similar views as far as profitability is concerned.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/kvk-bid-to-help-makhana-growers-increase-output/articleshow/87967139.cms||---

---||Business||Loss due to conservative accounting: Paytm||Mumbai: Paytm founder & CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma has said that One97 Communications’s (Paytm’s parent’s) losses were due to conservative accounting, which led to upfront booking of acquisition costs even as revenues from those subscriptions would flow over the next 12 months. One97 Communications announced its results for second quarter of the current fiscal, the first result after listing, on Saturday. The company’s revenue from operations grew 64%, while consolidated net loss widened by 8% to Rs 473 crore. A key driver of the revenue growth was the 52% growth in non-UPI volumes. In an interview with TOI, Sharma said “Our accounting is extremely conservative. We immediately charge 100% of all marketing, cashback, sales and system costs. The reason why ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) has improved is that merchants acquired earlier are generating revenue.” Paytm, which has a payments bank, had earlier expressed intent to seek a small finance bank (SFB) licence that will enable it to lend. However, the RBI on Friday said that it would consider applications for transition to SFB only after five years of a payment bank’s operations. “We are less than one year away from completing five years (on May 2022) and are open to exploring the opportunities should they arise. Also, Paytm Payments Bank’s net worth is Rs 400 crore as against the Rs 300 crore prescribed by the regulation,” said Sharma. Responding to analysts who said that Paytm’s business was hit because of increasing market share of UPI in digital payments, Sharma said, “I have always maintained that it is important to have zero fees on UPI as it helps to create a digital acceptance ecosystem. Paytm makes revenue because once a retail merchant matures, they start accepting other digital payment instruments as well.” He said that as a percentage of gross merchandise value, payment processing costs have come down. “Everything on the app beyond making the payment is revenue-generating. In fact using the wallet for payments in organised retail, or payments using Fastag generates revenue. UPI is like bread and milk in a kirana shop, it may not bring in revenues but does expand the ecosystem,” said Sharma. According to Sharma, it is clear that third-party apps work harder than bank apps on customer experience in payments. He said compared to other third-party apps, Paytm had the added advantage of holding the customer’s money in the form of payments bank, wallet and credit lines he added. He said with many states easing lockdown, there was an upside to revenue from travel, movie and event ticketing, which were hit by lockdowns during the pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/loss-due-to-conservative-accounting-paytm/articleshow/87969042.cms||Mayur Shetty

The government business to be taken up during the session pertains to the safe passage of at least two Bills–one related to the Technical Services Commission and another related to private universities-in the assembly. Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha will try his best run the House smoothly, so that government can reply maximum number of questions submitted by the MLAs concerned during the question-hour session. Sinha has already held a meeting with the state government’s senior officials to ensure that the answers of the government to the questions put up by the MLAs concerned are submitted and also uploaded on the assembly’s portal. Legislative council acting chairman Awadhesh Narayan Singh had also participated in the meeting. During the monsoon session, replies to around 99% of the questions were submitted and also taken up on the floor of the assembly, and Sinha would definitely like to maintain the tempo. The legislative council has already gone for the refurbishing of the House so as to bring about a change in the working style of the MLCs, as tablets have been set up on the desks. Further, Sinha also held an all-party meeting ahead of the start of the winter session, and also appealed to the political parties concerned and their MLAs to ensure smooth running of the House. As for the treasury benches, they are buoyed by the fact that the JD(U) won both the assembly seats–Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur–where bypolls were held recently, the former comfortably, and the latter one in a gripping session of vote counting. On the opposition front, the by-elections saw the souring of relations between the RJD and the Congress, as a result of which Congress legislature party leader in the assembly, Ajeet Sharma, announced that his party was not in the Grand Alliance, and, therefore, the floor coordination with the other opposition parties would be on selective issues. To that extent, it would be interesting to see in what manner and to what extent the opposition parties are able to achieve floor coordination and on which of the issues, observers feel. Meanwhile, the opposition parties have a plethora of issues to raise in both the Houses. “The recent Niti Ayog report on the state of household economy, income and standard of living of the people of the state is on the top of our agenda,” senior RJD member Bhai Birendra said. “That apart, we will also focus on the issues related to prohibition, unemployment, rising crime graph of the state, corruption in higher education system, and others,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/winter-session-of-state-legislature-from-today/articleshow/87967321.cms||Abhay Singh

The newborn and her mother are now at high risk of getting the infection as the transfusion took place before delivery. The woman, resident of a village in Silao block, had given birth to the girl child via Caesarean-section in OT-I of sadar hospital on November 5. Health department sources in Nalanda said the woman was transfused with one unit of blood before surgery. The unit, selected after matching the woman’s blood group, was later found to be donated by a HIV+ man on November 3 at the blood bank inside the hospital as a replacement unit for his wife who was also pregnant and needed blood transfusion. The man hails from a village under Karaiparshurai block in Nalanda. His 30-year-old wife is also HIV+ and the couple has been undergoing treatment at the sadar hospital for over a decade. The Caesarean operation of the HIV+ woman had also taken place in OT-I on November 3. The civil surgeon said the three-member committee has been asked to conduct a thorough inquiry into the matter and submit its report within three days. He added HIV  test was conducted on the blood samples of the infected man when he donated blood. “However, his sample tested negative for HIV. The infection had probably decreased following regular treatment,” Dr Kumar claimed. Dr Kumar said the infected couple has gone into hiding and efforts are on to locate them. He said their newborn child is also at the risk of being infected with HIV. “The woman who was transfused with infected blood has been traced. Her blood sample has been collected and it would be sent to Patna for test,” Dr Kumar said. Sadar hospital deputy superintendent Dr Sujit Kumar Akela said he has inspected the files related to blood transfusion. “Screening test report for HIV is mentioned as negative. We conduct blood tests at three levels in donation and transfusion cases. It seems there were lapses in following standard procedures,” he added. Blood bank office-bearer Rajesh Kumar, who said he works for social cause without taking salary, denied any lapses. “The blood bank is of government and is managed by Red Cross. All test kits and equipment are provided by the government,” he added. Kumar said technicians are not at fault as all tests were conducted. “We even mentioned kit serial numbers in reports. The donor did a blunder by not disclosing about his infection,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/pregnant-woman-transfused-with-hiv-blood-in-nalanda/articleshow/87967374.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Fifteen flights, on the other hand, were delayed due to bad weather till 8pm. The flight operation at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport resumed after 9am when the required visibility of 1,000m was achieved. Go First’s Delhi-Patna-Delhi flight (G8-165/168) landed at Patna airport at 9.10am instead of its scheduled arrival time of 7.15am. The flight was diverted to Ranchi. Another flight from Delhi (6E-2022) of IndiGo was diverted to Kolkata and landed at Patna airport at 12.30pm. The flight got delayed for more than four hours. An IndiGo executive at Patna airport said the flight landed at Kolkata airport at 7.55am. “Even the manual runway visual range (RVR) was less than required visibility of 800 at Patna airport. Most incoming and outgoing flights of different airlines operated with delays,” he added. Earlier, the airport authorities asked the flyers to check the timings of their flights before leaving for airport. “Due to low visibility/fog, departures/arrivals scheduled to operate in the morning are delayed and other flights of the day also may get affected. Passengers are requested to check the latest flight status from respective airlines (sic),” the Patna airport tweeted in the morning. A SpiceJet executive said all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights got affected due to bad weather in Patna. The terminal building was packed with people sitting on the floor and staircases waiting for announcements on their delayed flights. Several passengers said their flights got delayed for hours without any prior information. Some flyers even took to social media to vent their ire on the Patna airport authorities. One flyer, Sidheshwar N Chaubey, shared a picture of congested terminal building of city airport on a social media platform and wrote, “No seating space for anyone at Patna airport.” A SpiceJet flight between Delhi and Patna got delayed by five hours and 45 minutes while four other flights suffered delays of more than two hours.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/two-flights-diverted-15-delayed-due-to-dense-fog/articleshow/87967196.cms||Faryal Rumi

The scenario is changing, however, according to the recent findings of the National Family Health Survey (NHFS)-5 that was conducted in 2019-20. The survey results indicated that overall, 11.4% of the surveyed population used condom as a family planning method. This is a major jump considering this population was only 4.9% in the last survey in 2015-16. Among the urban population, condom use was 16.8% while it remained less than half at 7.5% in rural areas. Both urban and overall numbers were remarkably higher than the national average of 13.6% and 9.5% respectively. For the rural areas, it was the same as the national average of 7.6%, indicating increased awareness and usage among urban populations. However, female sterilization remained the most-practised family planning method at 35.9% where rural areas accounted for 40.8% compared to 29.1% in urban areas. These results were also closer to the national average. Dr Alpesh Gandhi, the immediate past president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Society of India (FOGSI) and Ahmedabad-based gynecologist, said that the results are encouraging. “Traditionally women bear the burden of family planning – and as the survey highlights, females either undergo sterilization or intrauterine device (IUD) such as Copper T. Reluctance of their male partners to use condoms is a major factor behind the phenomenon,” he said. “But our clinical experience highlights that the women undergoing institutional delivery are often more aware of family planning methods. Gujarat has a very high institutional delivery rate of over 90%. Thus, awareness may also have played a part in the rise in condom use.” An earlier survey showed that condom sales rise by less than 2% annually and are not the most popular of contraceptives overall. Another survey indicated that only 7% of women and 27% men ever used condoms in pre-marital sex and depended on other methods for ‘safe sex.’ Pallavi Patel, director of city-based NGO CHETNA that closely works with women on reproductive health and other issues, said that the need of the hour is to talk more about contraceptives. “Our field experience says that condoms are still not popular in rural areas where men refuse to use them. But as shown in survey, it might have to do with a large younger population that is more aware about use of contraceptives for both sexual health and family planning,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/use-of-condoms-in-guj-doubles-in-4-yrs/articleshow/87968240.cms||Parth Shastri

The main conspirator, Rohit Kumar, was interrogated thrice by different police officers after his arrest on Saturday. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said several cut marks were found on Rimjhim’s wrist. He said her friend Poonam told police that Rimjhim used to visit burial grounds and take out her blood from wrist to perform black magic. “Investigations revealed that Rimjhim used to call Rohit only during her periods as she believed that her ‘powers’ were at the peak that time. There were several rings on her fingers. Rohit got Rimjhim killed as he was in her ‘grip’ due to black magic. Rimjhim used to threaten Rohit of severe consequences if he cut ties with her. Rohit’s brother-in-law had died recently. Rimjhim told him that her brother-in-law died as he didn’t listen to her,” the SSP said. Police had arrested Rohit, his friend Kamal Sharma, Suraj Kumar, Pawan Kumar and shooters Ranjit Kumar and Rahul Kumar for their alleged involvement in the murder on Saturday. Police said Rohit had developed severe depression and suffered panic attacks due to Rimjhim’s activities. Police recovered Kamal’s car in which Rohit had taken Rimjhim to Naubatpur, two motorcycle, a country made semi-automatic pistol, two magazines, three live cartridges and six cellphones from the possession of the arrested people. Police said of Rs 4 lakh paid to the shooters, Rs 2.25 lakh was recovered. Surprisingly, Rohit had taken Rs 4 lakh from Rimjhim as loan and used the money to hire killers. Rimjhim was shot dead near Punpun dam in Naubatpur on November 23. Her body was found the next morning.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/ssp-black-magic-led-to-murder-of-dentists-wife/articleshow/87967236.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The high court observed that in the cases registered under the NDPS Act, drivers of the vehicles and other inmates are being shown as the accused while the kingpins of the trade are never included as the accused. She observed that the police are conducting investigations in a casual manner without taking into account the social impact of the drugs. Justice Lalitha Kanneganti in her recent judgment before she was transferred to the Telangana high court, said that the special court at Visakhapatnam dealing with the NDPS cases is not taking steps to number and list the cases. Even the bail applications and extension of custody applications are not being heard in accordance with the Supreme Court guidelines, she noted. Granting bail to the driver and cleaner of a vehicle caught with a contraband, Justice Lalitha noted that according to the Supreme Court guidelines, if the chargesheet was not filed by the investigating agency, the accused would have an indefeasible right to bail which cannot be rejected. She said that if the investigating agency did not file an application for extension, the courts should consider that the accused is deemed to be eligible for bail. Justice Lalitha further noted that the high court has been getting several cases where the accused has been languishing in judicial remand for more than six months. Though several copies of the order have been sent to the Director General of Police (DGP), these cases continue to come up before the high court. However, she noted that the DGP in his counter affidavit explained the steps taken to sensitise the unit officers following the directions of the high court. Justice Lalitha observed that there seems to be large scale cultivation of ganja in Agency areas and the locals do not have a clue about its legal implications. She suggested establishing a special wing to investigate these cases and also to sensitise locals by conducting awareness drives. She directed taking action against the public prosecutors and assistant public prosecutors who failed to file extension petitions even after the police requested them. Justice Lalitha also directed the special judge who deals with the NDPS cases to file an affidavit stating the details of the number of bail petitions filed, when they are numbered after filing, when they were heard and when the orders were passed in those petitions. Justice Lalitha Kanneganti in her recent judgment said the special court dealing with NDPS cases is not taking steps to number and list the cases.

The incident happened on Saturday evening when constable N Praveen Babu was returning to the police station after completing an enquiry in nearby villages. While he was returning on his bike, along with special police officer (SPO) A Venkateswarlu, he noticed one person entering the canal. At the time, they did not sense anything was wrong but when they reached the other side of the canal, they heard a splash. Looking to the other side, they noticed another three persons jumping into the water. Praveen and Venkateswarlu realised that one of the persons was drowning, and to save him, the other three had jumped in but were being pulled deeper into the water by the strong currents. They rushed back to the other side of the canal but by this time, two of them had caught hold of a pipe while the other two were gasping for breath and moving further away. Running along the bank, Praveen took off his jacket and threw it at them. Both caught hold of his jacket and Praveen pulled them out of the water. By the time he had pulled them out, the two who were holding on to the pipe had started to drift away. Praveen managed to pull them out and shifted all four to a hospital. “Ironically, there were more than 10 onlookers but no one came to the rescue,” said Praveen, adding, “they did not even come to help me.” The four persons who were rescued have been identified as Lakshmaiah, Balu, Anjaiah and Keshavulu. They were in an inebriated condition when the incident took place. Balu, Anjaiah and Keshavulu were visiting for Lakshmaiah’s wedding at Rentachintala and had a few drinks on the way to the ceremony. Guntur Rural SP Vishal Gunni and DGP D Gautam Sawang appreciated Praveen’s efforts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/cops-quick-action-saves-four-lives/articleshow/87968197.cms||---

The accused used to send the contraband to Madhya Pradesh from the city. The arrested have been identified as Ch Srinivasa Rao, J Kumaraswamy, B Krishnam Raju, Ch Venkateswara Rao and Srinivasa Rao’s son Ch Mohan Raju alias Rakhi, all Vizagites. It may be recalled that an online cannabis racket was busted by Bhind police in Madhya Pradesh, leading to the arrest of three youngsters and the seizure of over 20 kilos of dry ganja. Joint director of Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), Vizag, S Satish Kumar said based on credible information, they arrested Srinivasa Rao and seized 48 kg of dry ganja stored in a rented house at Kancharapalem in the city on November 21. Apart from ganja, packing materials such as covers, cardboard boxes, tapes and an electronic weighing machine were also found in the house, Satish said. Investigation revealed that Srinivasa Rao got acquainted with Suraj Pawaiya and Mukul Jaiswal from Madhya Pradesh, who were registered as vendors on an e-commerce site. Srinivasa Rao became a contact person for Pawaiya and Jaiswal to smuggle dry ganja from Vizag city to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan under the guise of ‘supernatural’ stevia dry leaves. Pawaiya and Jaiswal created a firm ‘Babu Tex’ and registered themselves with the e-commerce site as vendors, using the GST numbers of other firms, and supplied cannabis to Madhya Pradesh from Vizag city. “We have also arrested two associates — Kumaraswamy and Krishnam Raju — and one van driver Venkateswara Rao. He aided the accused Srinivasa Rao at Kancharapalem. Our investigation also revealed that Srinivasa Rao’s son Mohan Raju was involved in the illegal trade, so he was also arrested,” Satish Kumar said, adding, “We suspect Pawaiya and Jaiswal transported over 600 to 700 kg of dry ganja from Vizag to Madhya Pradesh through the e-commerce site over the past eight months.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/five-more-arrested-in-ganja-smuggling-case-through-e-commerce-platform/articleshow/87968145.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Depression in Bay stokes rain fears||VIJAYAWADA: Paddy farmers across Krishna district are in a state of limbo following the rain alert given by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Farmers have intensified the harvesting process to protect the crop from another spell of rain. Farmers across the district have cultivated paddy on an extent of around 3.5 lakh hectares. All parts of the district received abundant rains this year and got a good yield. With the current kharif season likely to end by the second week of December, the crop is in the harvesting stage. Around 16 per cent of farmers have already harvested the crop despite high moisture levels. Many parts of the district, however, have received a forecast of rain from Monday morning following the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal. Heavy rainfall was recorded at Nagayalanka and Avanigadda regions on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, the demand for harvester machines has increased in the district. Farmers are facing problems as the middlemen have doubled the rent of harvesters. “This is a crucial time. Our 95 days of hard work will go to waste if we delay harvesting. We are deploying machines at double the price to complete harvesting,” said Gunnam Rambabu, a farmer from Kotturu Tadepalli. The Krishna district administration has started procuring paddy at 845 procurement centres and Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs). With the kharif season likely to end by the second week of December, the paddy crop is at the harvesting stage.

This year, between January and October, over 33,000 cases of speed limit violations were booked by the police. City traffic police say motorists are breaking speed standards with some driving at speeds as high as 120 kilometres per hour, while the permissible speed ranges between 40 and 70 kmph/hr. “Traffic is high from 8 am to 11 am and again from 4 pm to 8 pm. Most of the drivers are violating the speed limits between 11 am and 1 pm and again in the afternoon,” said a senior police officer with the traffic wing. The latest data of NCRB in its Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India-2020 report reveal that 7,039 people lost their lives and 19,675 people suffered injuries in 17,924 road accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020. The data classified cause-wise distribution of road accidents. Among all causes, speeding claimed 4,778 lives and caused injuries to 12,344 people in the state. “Though many motorists are aware that speeding and rash driving will lead to accidents, they continue to violate the norms. Our teams have been registering at least 100 cases of speed violations a day by using speed laser gun and interceptors on the NH-16 stretch and a few other roads,” said ADCP (traffic), Vizag, Ch Adinarayana. “At present, only one speed laser gun and interceptor are used to identity speeding vehicles on city roads. If we get more equipment, we may register a greater number of cases,” police said. “I have observed that some youngsters resort to rash driving at night and in the wee hours on the Beach Road. There is an urgent need to end such practices by deploying special teams,” said K Srinivasa Rededy, a resident of Vizag city.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/vizag-records-at-least-100-cases-of-speed-violations-every-day/articleshow/87968136.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Business||‘Losses because of extremely conservative accounting’||A little over a week after listing, Paytm’s parent One97 Communications announced its results for Q2FY22. The company’s revenue from operations rose 64%, while consolidated net loss widened 8% to Rs 473 crore. A key drive of the growth in revenue was the 52% growth in non-UPI volumes. In an interview to TOI, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the company’s founder & CEO explains how the losses are not caused by burning money for volumes but by conservative accounting, which provides for acquisition costs upfront. You have announced your results within days of listing. What has been the analyst response? We had our first earnings call. I can only reference the experience with what I am familiar with. I would compare it to the experience of joining an engineering college after coming from Aligarh to Delhi. The IPO process was like getting admission and the earnings call was the exam immediately after. Before the call, the three of us who were on the call threw questions at each other. Your contribution margin has jumped but the loss has also increased? Also many lay investors do not understand contribution margin. Our margins have grown faster than our revenues. Even if people do not understand contributory profits, which we have tried to explain, the ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) is a straightforward measure. Our ebitda margins are much higher. We used to have an ebitda margin of -64%, which is now -39%. What is the reason for the increase in costs? As a business, our expenses can broadly be classified into people and marketing. Our marketing expenses are flat but we are hiring more people, more engineers, which is good. This is the equivalent of growing a factory in a manufacturing business. The difference between investing in a factory and our investment is that we do not amortise our acquisition costs. A merchant we acquire is a subscriber for at least one year and they provide revenue either through lending or MDR over the year whereas the acquiring cost is provided upfront. The losses are not because we are selling goods worth Rs 100 at Rs 90. Our accounting is extremely conservative. We immediately charge 100% of all marketing, cashback, sales and system costs. The reason why ebitda has improved is that merchants acquired earlier are generating revenue. A lot of analyst focus appears to be on the lending business... Banks have the lowest cost of funds and they also have an obligation to extend priority sector loans with a value of below Rs 50,000. We have a technology platform that can deliver, service and collect loans. These are short-term loans and we have demonstrated our capability through a couple of cycles and the pandemic. Our average ticket size is Rs 4,000, which no lender could not touch. It is the easiest thing to extend a Rs 1,000-crore loan through a single corporate relationship. We are disbursing Rs 7,500 crore (a billion dollars) through small loans. How do you make money on payments with zero fees on UPI? I have always maintained that it is important to have zero fees on UPI as it helps to create a digital acceptance ecosystem. Paytm makes revenue because once a retail merchant matures, they start accepting other digital payment instruments as well. Our non-UPI has grown 52%. On non-UPI transactions, we earn more as we also get issuer fees. Our transaction processing cost as a percentage of volumes has gone up. As a percentage of gross merchandise value, payment processing costs have come down. The customer base you mentioned (5 crore+) is more than the population of South Korea. Why is Paytm Mall not used by top brands for offers? WalMart has a business model of ‘every day low price’. We follow a similar strategy in payments. Rather than offering deals in a few high-end brands, we offer cashback on every transaction whether it is petrol, electricity or an iPhone. Our focus is not on select anchor customers and the model is more inclusive. Also, unlike e-commerce platforms, we do not sell our products, rather we are open to hosting all e-commerce platforms on our app. Some analysts are of the view that payments cannot be a moat... Payment apps can either come from banks or independent service providers. It is now clear that payment app companies work harder than banks in providing a customer experience. Now if one is using a payment app for transactions, it is logical that customers will prefer those apps where their money is. Banks can store money, but they do not provide the same payment experience. Paytm has the advantage of storing money in either the bank account, wallet or through a credit facility. We have brought innovation in the method of payment (QR code, phone number) and added the next level of convenience (soundbox). Customers can use their fixed deposits to make payments seamlessly. Customers can use Paytm for toll payment on Fastag without blocking their funds. So besides lending, how will Paytm be making money? Everything on the app beyond making payment is revenue generating. In fact using the wallet for payments in organised retail, or payments using Fastag generates revenue. UPI is like bread and milk in a kirana shop, it may not bring in revenues but does expand the ecosystem. Payment gateway Billdesk made a profit of Rs 270 crore. How much did Paytm make in the payment gateway business? Our revenue from payment services to merchants was up 64% to Rs 400 crore. This is driven by non-UPI payment volume growth in payment gateway and growth in devices. The RBI has said that a payment bank’s transition to a small finance bank can be allowed only after 5 years? We are less than one year away from completing five years (om May 2022) and are open to exploring the opportunities should they arise. Also, Paytm Payments Bank’s net worth is Rs 400 crore as against the Rs 300 crore prescribed by the regulation. The pandemic and subsequent lockdowns gave a push to digital payment and e-commerce. What impact would the easing of restrictions have? There is an upside to revenue from travel, movie and event ticketing, which were hit by lockdown during the pandemic. We are expecting a good response from customers as the unlockdown takes place. How do you expect the market to respond? Hopefully more people in the market are able to see our performance in detail. We listed in India so that everyone gets an opportunity to participate. It is important that the retail investor gets the complete picture. Yes, our losses have increased 8%, but our revenues have gone up 64% and ebitda has gone up 50%. That is the complete picture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/losses-because-of-extremely-conservative-accounting/articleshow/87969126.cms||Mayur Shetty

Two passengers and the conductor rushed out to say a senior citizen had fallen ill on the bus. When the sergeant reached the bus, he found the passenger — later identified as Samiran Poddar (64) — unconscious on the seat. He relayed the information to OC Suman Mukhopadhyay who asked Baidya to rush to RG Kar Hospital and said he was bringing in other officers to handle traffic at the busy crossing. Baidya informed the Shyambazar guard about the incident and all the signals in the short journey were turned green. Baidya escorted the bus while other cops ensured it was not blocked by any vehicle. The doctors admitted Poddar in the emergency unit. Baidya managed to unlock Poddar’s cellphone and contacted his brother. Doctors said he was stable, but will need time to recover. After this they will carry out an MRI. The family thanked the cops, bus workers and passengers who helped him. Cops said Poddar, a retired insurance agent, lives in Dum Dum’s Bediapara. “We were told they brought him here within five minutes. In such cases, time always plays a crucial factor,” a doctor said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bus-workers-cop-take-man-to-hosp-after-heart-attack/articleshow/87968314.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The initiatives include a bar on entry of visitors who don’t have a family grave there. The changes were brought about after a new caretaker took charge. “A series of positive initiatives were taken up to make the place a peaceful abode for the departed souls,” said Paritosh Canning, the Bishop of Kolkata and also chairman of the Bhawanipore Cemetery. Bikash Lobo, the new caretaker, said he was threatened several times by miscreants after outsiders’ entry was barred. “After dark, the cemetery used to turn into a heaven for drug addicts, drunken youths and anti-socials. There were several raids by cops to nab criminals who often took shelter here,” he said. At present, a visitors’ log book has been introduced, along with round-the-clock security. Time for visiting has been restricted to 8am-5pm and visitors are required to maintain Covid protocols. There is a proposal to use a few bighas of unused land on the eastern part of the graveyard for ash burial. Due to many Covid deaths since March 2020, there is a growing demand for ash burial. In the last six months, there have been 28 ash burials at the cemetery. There was also water scarcity at the cemetery complex which was resolved. Two toilets have been set up for visitors and more are on the cards. A new mortuary, ‘Abode of Rest’, equipped for eight bodies, has been functional since January 18. More plans, including paved paths and illumination, are also planned.

The private agency that had been engaged by the civic body last year to clear this waste has also been compelled to stop the service after the bins were removed. The decision to remove the bins amidst the pandemic has left households and neighbourhoods from where Covid cases are being reported in a fix. Several households with Covid patients are flouting the waste-handling norms and disposing Covid waste with their daily kitchen waste. But that is not possible in apartments with other residents objecting to this citing fears of infection during the door-to-door collection. An octogenarian in Ballygunge and his wife had repeatedly urged the KMC for help in disposing their waste after they tested positive. “They told us we must engage private operators for bio-waste disposal. When we contacted a private operator, they asked for Rs 500 every time they would collect bio-waste till 1kg. For every kg more, they asked for Rs 50. But they also told us that bio-waste would only be masks and medicine disposables, not food and other household waste. We had little bio-waste, but took care to properly sanitise any food waste we put out during this time,” he said. Civic authorities said the decision to stop the Covid waste collection was taken around August, months after the city emerged from the second wave. The reason, KMC officials said, was lack of use of the bins. “Widespread use of PPE kits during the first wave and them being dumped in the open around June-July 2020 had led to panic in the city. This led to the installation of yellow bins in September 2020. At the time, daily Covid waste comprising PPEs, gloves, masks, sanitary napkins, adult diapers and medicine foils across the 144 wards had touched 4 tonnes. But use of PPE declined sharply following the vaccination drive. After the second wave, hardly any Covid waste was dumped in the bins,” an official said. With Covid cases inching up after the festive season, a section of KMC officials conceded the decision to stop collecting waste, at least from the Covid-sensitive areas, was perhaps hurried. “At a time when the city’s Covid graph is slowly rising, we should have kept the service alive in some neighbourhoods which have been reporting a spurt in Covid cases,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/covid-waste-collection-hit-after-kmc-removes-bins-from-streets/articleshow/87968280.cms||Saikat Ray

GACD principal Dr Dineshwar Prasad said, “Medical astrology is an ancient applied branch of astrology based on the association of various parts of the body, diseases, and drugs with the nature of the sun, moon, planets, and the twelve astrological signs. Herbs and other medicines are selected for treatments while considering their astrological qualities. In this system, ailing people are advised the mode of treatment either with the help of their horoscopes or palmistry.” Dr Prasad further pointed out that in ancient times, this science was quite popular but in course of time it sank into oblivion. But, now it is coming in use again and GACD is the first hospital in the country to have introduced medical astrology along with ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy. The principles of ‘dincharya’, ‘ritucharya’ and ‘panchkarma’, essential components of Ayurveda, are all based on medical astrology, he added. OPD incharge Dr Dinesh Kumar said that a proposal for starting a full-fledged course in medical astrology has already been submitted to Aryabhatta Knowledge University for its approval. Inaugurating the medical astrology OPD Arjun Sahni, MLC, said the people of Mithila region would be greatly benefited from this centre. A garden of medicinal plants based on zodiac signs was also opened on the occasion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/govt-ayurvedic-college-darbhanga-starts-opd-in-medical-astrology/articleshow/87967344.cms||B K Mishra
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Smart City to open e-charging stations in city for public||Thiruvananthapuram: In a move to push e-mobility in the city, Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Limited (SCTL) will open up its charging stations at Gandhi Park to the public. The charging stations were installed at Gandhi Park as part of the launch of e-autos and e-rickshaws in the city. The SCTL is in talks with the private firm that installed the station to develop a mobile app which can be used for payment purposes. In addition to this UPI scanners will also be installed at the charging station. SCTL officials said that the rates will be fixed through consultations with KSEB and the electricity regulatory commission. More than the monetary benefit, SCTL is planning to give a thrust to e-mobility and address the issue of inadequate number of charging stations for private e-vehicles. “We are planning to open it for the general public. The guidelines for the rates to be applicable are under discussion. Very soon we will come out with this. Smart city wants to expand its green footprints and bring the benefits of green energy to more and more people,” said Vinay Goyal, Smart City CEO. Although e-rickshaws were conceived to encourage shared mobility schemes in the city, the plan was put off owing to the spread of Covid. Although the design was altered to ensure social distancing, it was suggested that shared mobility shall not be initiated using e-rickshaws during the time of pandemic. The beneficiaries chosen for the scheme were given training and directed to run it as normal passenger autos. Some of the beneficiaries raised concerns regarding incurring electricity bills from charging at home and some complained of power delivered by the vehicle. SCTL installed a charging station at Gandhi Park and the entire expense is being taken care of by SCTL. Even then some of the beneficiaries reportedly stuck with the demand to get e-autos instead of e-rickshaws and four of them had returned the vehicles. SCTL had procured 15 e-rickshaws at a cost of Rs. 2.30 Lakh each in 2020. The charging stations are now being used by individual beneficiaries of the e-mobility scheme of Smart city. SCTL had awarded power zone the work to install three charging stations at Rs. 1.1 lakhs per unit. The plan was to install two charging stations at Gandhi Park and one more near the Museum. The EV chargers were procured in consultation with KSEB (renewable energy) and it was one of the first public charging stations to be commissioned in Kerala. The arrangement was such that three vehicles could be charged at a time and there was one slot reserved to be kept free. The idea was that the beneficiaries could top up charging during their daily service to ensure they have sufficient battery reserves to travel the entire day. On an average an auto consumes 1.5 units per hour to charge which roughly translates to Rs. 15 per hour. As per the project note, the charger would be connected to the integrated command and control centre coming up at the Corporation. It will transmit key information to ICCC like details of vehicle and driver who have used the facility, amount of charging done, payment made on digital mode.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/smart-city-to-open-e-charging-stations-in-city-for-public/articleshow/87968357.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops plan AI cover to identify and prosecute helmetless riders, no-parking rule violators||KOLKATA: The city police are planning to introduce artificial intelligence to scan images generated by over 2,500 CCTV cameras in Kolkata — 125 of which can read licence plates — to identify helmetless bikers and illegal parking in real time and prosecute offenders. In December, the Kolkata Police has sought detailed presentation from tech experts to help understand the advanced machine learning tools which are being increasingly used for detecting helmetless bikers and illegal parking. Once the cops zero in on the project, a detailed proposal will be sent to the state. DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “There are some plans in this regard. It is too early to comment till anything is finalised.” In 2020, among the 39.4 lakh traffic violations recorded on Kolkata streets, 7.3 lakh were detected via CCTV footage. According to an officer, several projects are being undertaken by academic bodies to identify helmetless bikers and their number plates in real time. The thrust on technology, an officer said, will also reduce the risk to officers who physically try to stop these bikes at personal risk. Police also want software models to identify illegal parking and trace the vehicle licence places. The software, which depends heavily on video data, will be installed in the road cameras that can read number plates and on the servers of the central Lalbazar police control room. This can be done by installing an embedded card attached to CCTV cameras, which helps detect helmetless bikers by sending out an alert. The artificial image recognition and processing solutions will also see alerts sent out when cameras detect vehicles in no-parking zones. This application can be implemented in real time using a webcam or a CCTV as input. IIT Hyderabad has developed a software using AI for automatic detection of bikers without helmets in surveillance videos. Recently, the institute signed an MoU with Hyderabad City Police to gain access to video. For illegal parking, the system uses IP camera to continuously capture and transfer image sequences to a base station whereby CNN is employed to realize automatic image features extraction in detecting illegally parked vehicles. The proposed software is robust against the influences of environmental variations, namely shadow effects, illumination changes and different weather conditions, said sources. Both systems will generate challans. It will be automatic, with a web interface to verify the alerts. From there, it will be connected to the existing RTO website to generate challans and send SMS notification to riders,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-plan-ai-cover-to-identify-prosecute-helmetless-riders-no-parking-rule-violators/articleshow/87968366.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The class V student, Rohan Ali Mondal was watching a group of labourers chopping down a large coconut tree in the neighbour’s courtyard when the rope, the labourers had held on to lower the tree, somehow slipped and got entangled with the boy’s leg as he rocketed off the ground and fell 30 metres apart severely injuring his head. He was under treatment at SSKM Hospital for around 24 hours before he succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. The incident happened at Majherpara neighbourhood in New Town’s Hatiara on Saturday afternoon. Witnesses said Mondal’s mother was calling him for lunch while the boy stood outside his home watching the tree felling session. “The coconut tree was tied with a lamp post and held on to by labourers thereafter. But somehow the labourers lost grip of the rope and it somehow got stuck with the boy’s leg. The boy was off the ground in a moment and fell at a distance just like a sling,” said Monirul Islam, a local resident. Mondal’s parents Rahman and Nasima were too traumatised to speak but his uncle Moidul levelled allegations of negligence against the neighbours. A senior officer of Eco Park police station said a written complaint has been lodged by the boy’s family on Sunday against the neighbour and the contractor deployed at the task and that they have detained three persons for questioning. The ward 13 coordinator of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, Md Mohsin Ahmed said: “No permission was taken for felling trees in the area. I will personally look into the issue and will ask police to take necessary action against the perpetrators.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kid-dies-in-new-town/articleshow/87968364.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Despite numbers stacked against it, Congress banks on cross voting||HYDERABAD: Though the ruling TRS has a majority of voters on its side to win both Khammam and Medak MLC seats, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the ministers not to be complacent. The Congress is contesting two of the total 12 MLC seats under local authorities constituencies, the polling for which is scheduled on December 10. TRS and Congress are trying to get the support of CPI, CPM, TDP and independents in Khammam. While the TRS is trying to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Congress, the grand old party is banking on cross voting by disgruntled elements to beat the TRS in its own game. Voters comprise elected representatives from the local bodies, including corporators, councillors, MPTC and ZPTC members. There are a total of 768 voters who are eligible to cast their vote in the MLC election in Khammam. Of the total, the Congress has 120, independents 75, CPI and CPM together have 60, TDP 14 and the remaining voters are with the TRS. Transport minister P Ajay Kumar sought the support of the CPI despite the TRS enjoying a clear majority to win the Khammam seat. Interestingly, the CPI and the CPM had contested the local bodies polls by aligning with the Congress in some wards and the TRS in a few other seats.  “There is discontent among TRS councillors and MPTC members, who are not able to come out openly against the ruling party. We are expecting cross voting to take place,” Congress district president of Khammam P Durga Prasad said. The left parties said though their support to any of the parties was not going to change the poll outcome, they said they will take a decision by this month-end. In Medak, all eyes are on BJP-elected members from the local bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/despite-numbers-stacked-against-it-cong-banks-on-cross-voting/articleshow/87969092.cms||Roushan Ali

Much stress was also laid on expediting the ongoing projects of setting up oxygen plants and ensuring maximum vaccination coverage. The meeting was held in the backdrop of the emergence of the new variant of coronavirus ‘Omicron’ in South Africa, and the global threat it is posing. The Centre and state governments too have issued guidelines, which the divisional commissioner asked administrative heads of districts to follow and gear up to face the newest challenge. Lavangare-Verma has asked officials of Nagpur district administration and city’s civic body, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), to work out the modalities to begin screening of passengers arriving by international flights. She has also asked officials to draw up a blueprint of the measures to be taken with the passengers, and the protocols to be followed if any passenger tests positive, said a source. “Most of the discussion during the review meeting revolved around international passengers, as the threat is mostly from them,” said an official who was present at the meeting. During a review meeting with the collectors of Nagpur, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Wardha and Chandrapur, the divisional commissioner asked the administrative heads to take appropriate actions to enforce Covid Appropriate Behaviours (CAB) of using mask and maintain social distancing. Lavangare-Verma underlined the fact that there was lethargy observed among the masses in following Covid norms, and asked officials to step up the enforcement measures and also increase the numbers of tests per day. The commissioner also spent a lot of time on review of ongoing projects to set up medical oxygen plants and take status review of those ones already functional. Lavangare-Verma also asked officials to ensure stock of oxygen in cylinders present at the district headquarters, and operational fitness of the existing medical oxygen plants. She has asked for review of all stocks, and assurance that they are ready to meet any emergency cropping up due to the surge in international cases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/start-testing-international-passengers-arriving-in-city-div-comm/articleshow/87969094.cms||Soumitra Bose

The two arrested accused, Rehan Khan (21), the deceased’s alleged boyfriend, and his friend, Faisal (20), were arrested on Saturday. While Khan is a BCom student, Faisal is a class XI drop-out. The duo is in police custody for further interrogation. Investigators found that prima facie, Khan got tired of the woman ‘pestering’ him for marriage, and roped in his friend to murder her. “The accused had stabbed her 25 to 26 times,” said zonal DCP Pranaya Ashok. The woman had stab injuries on her neck, chest and stomach. They also used a hammer to bludgeon her, due to which she sustained serious head injuries, said an officer. Investigators have also recovered the hammer used in the crime. Police said it was Faisal who brought the hammer, while Khan brought a knife. “Our team worked hard and nabbed the accused. Further investigation is on,” said Dnyaneshwar Chavan, additional commissioner of police. Her body was found the next evening on the terrace of a vacant 13-storey building near Kohinoor Hospital in Kurla (W). Investigators found that Khan and Faisal had taken the victim there on the pretext of sorting out wedding issues and then killed her. The Vinoba Bhave Nagar police sent the body for postmortem and registered a murder case. After sexual assault was confirmed in the autopsy report, police added the rape charge as well in the case. Police established the woman’s identity as a Govandi resident, recorded the statement of her family, who had already lodged a missing person’s complaint. There are several vacant buildings in the vicinity where the incident took place. “We had written to the MMRDA two months ago to deploy security guards, install CCTV cameras and street lights in the area. Till date, 10 guards have been deployed. However, there are no street lights or CCTV cameras near the building,” said a senior police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/kurla-rape-murder-victim-stabbed-at-least-25-times-in-mumbai/articleshow/87969916.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The accident took place in a house near Kotwali police station in Meerut. At the time, some 12 family members were present. They had assembled for the ‘Hakika’ ceremony of the 21-day-old daughter of Mohd Junaid, his third child. ‘Hakika’ is a thanksgiving function for the newly born among Muslims in which an animal is sacrificed and a few strands of hair of the child are cut. Junaid's sister, a mother of a two-month-old daughter, residing in Delhi, had also joined the festivities. While both infants were lying on bed, the cooking gas cylinder in the kitchen caught fire and in the ensuing blaze, both infants died. As soon as the fire broke out, the men of the house tried to douse it but as it turned into an inferno, all the adults rushed outside the house, forgetting in the mayhem that they had left the two infants on the bed. “By the time the family realized its mistake, it was too late and the two children were charred to death. Since the house was in a congested area and small, it took the fire brigade service a lot of time to manage the fire,” circle officer, Kotwali, Arvind Chaurasia. While the mourning family could not be reached, a neighbour, Mohd Tanveer, said, “Women of the house were preparing food when the gas leak took place. It was a heart-rending scene to witness the screaming mothers of the two infants as the fire transformed into an inferno. There was no chance the two could be saved.

As per the official data, 71,729 target beneficiaries working at the local industries have received first dose and 54% of the beneficiaries are fully vaccinated. Known as one of the industrial hubs in Marathwada, Aurangabad has industries at Waluj, Chikalthana, Shendra and Chitegaon areas, where a large number of workers are employed. Raman Ajagaonkar, Marathwada zonal council chairman of Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), said, organised efforts by the government agencies and industry captains have led to 100% immunization of the workforce from the local industries. “A slew of initiatives were taken by different industrial bodies to boost the vaccination. Besides the industrial workforce, families of the employees and people living in the vicinity of the industrial areas have also been vaccinated using special measures,” he said. Mukund Kulkarni, a member of the national task force of CII said that the industrial vaccination would prove to be a major advantage in tiding over any further Covid-19 outbreak. “The industries have already received major blows during the first two Covid waves. The vaccination of the workforce along with continuous adherence to Covid norms would prove beneficial in waging effective battle against the possible further outbreak,” he said. Along with CII, the Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA) and Marathwada Association of Small Scale Industries and Agriculture (MASSIA) are among other local industrial bodies which were instrumental in carrying out the vaccination drive. “As half of the beneficiaries are yet to get fully vaccinated, different industrial bodies along with health authorities are taking joint efforts to ensure all workforce gets the second dose as early as possible,” Kulkarni said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/in-aurangabad-all-industrial-workers-got-at-least-1-vax-dose/articleshow/87966776.cms||Prasad Joshi

According to organizers from both parties, rural voters are not very loyal to one party. They keep switching sides as per their convenience and the postings they get. Money also plays a major role in the entire affair and therefore, they are not very trustworthy. It is precisely due to this reason that both the national parties are focusing on rural voters. The major challenge is not only to keep their flock together, but also to lure other party’s representatives to vote for them. Parties adopt all kinds of tactics to woo voters from the opposition. Animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar, who holds the key for the grand old party, said voters in this election are not common people, but elected or nominated representatives. “These special voters have commitments. While exercising their franchisee, they need to take into consideration their future, their constituency and voters. Such voters cannot be lured by anyone easily. They vote with their conscience. Here, the trust factor works to a large extent,” Kedar told TOI. BJP nominee Chandrashekhar Bawankule is also believed to be a strong player in rural areas. He can take on Kedar’s might. Previously, he worked in ZP before becoming an MLA and was also leader of opposition. While refusing to divulge the strategy, Bawankule said the party has 235 voters in rural areas and it was unlikely that any of them would opt for cross voting. “In the last few years, BJP votes were never taken away by any party. Our voters strongly believe in our party and leadership,” he said, adding, they are already ahead by 80 votes. The saffron party is not leaving any stone unturned to keep its flock together. “We have started meetings with all our voters in rural areas. We are taking them into confidence. We are 80 plus against the combined strength of the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena. Though Congress has 144 votes, many of their voters are keen to go with the BJP along with the independents,” said BJP city president Pravin Datke. For the Congress, its rural president Rajendra Mulak, Umred MLA Raju Parwe and Kedar are working in pockets to keep their voters together and also to get votes from other parties and independents. “All three are master planners in the rural areas. In fact, Kedar has already proved his might in ZP polls and by-polls where Congress trounced BJP in areas which were the latter’s bastions. We are sure our nominee Ravindra Bhoyar would attract votes from all municipal councils and ZPs,” said Congress city chief Vikas Thakre. Khode-Chavre appointed as MLC polls observer Dr Madhavi Khode-Chavre has been appointed as the election observer for Nagpur local authority constituency MLC polls to be held on December 10. Her office has been set up at Cottage No. 2, Ravi Bhavan, where she will be present from 12 to 1pm. She could be contacted on 9420513821.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/70-rural-voters-hold-key-for-cong-bjp-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/87969102.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The police later reached the spot and sent the body to a government hospital for a post-mortem, he said. The official said that they suspect that the woman, aged between 30 and 35, was killed three or four days ago and the body was dumped in the sea waters.  The police are conducting a probe into the case and waiting for the autopsy report, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/womans-body-with-stone-tied-to-neck-found-in-palghar/articleshow/87969919.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Clogged stormwater drain causing problems||Thiruvananthapuram: A clogged stormwater drain has made life hell for the residents of Aruvancode ward in Malayinkeezhu panchayat. Even during light showers, rain water mixed with waste flows to the households and owing to heavy showers in the past few weeks, four houses in the area have remained flooded. “The waste water is rushing even inside our houses. It is common for snakes to crawl into the house. Extremely venomous snakes like cobra and viper have been spotted inside the house. There is no safety for babies. Stagnant water can cause many diseases. This wastewater also goes down to the well. It is not yet clear why no action has been taken,” said Baiju Raj R E, one of the residents. These four families will have to wait until the water recedes. The reason for the flood is the clogged PWD drain from Neeramankuzhi to Erathavoor which is not functioning due to the block caused by the deposit of soil and other waste materials. The only solution to the problem is to clean the drain and ease the flow of water without restriction. Houses of Baiju, Geetha, Jaya Mohan, and Suresh are among those who have been affected by the flooding. The region was also flooded six months ago. At that time, the residents attempted to flush the water using a motor with the help of ward member Krishnapriya K S. That too was a failure. They have been complaining since then, but no action has been taken so far. When they reached out to the Neyyattinkara PWD office, the officials said that it cannot be cleaned as the road development works are going on. There are children in these families. The mosquitoes lay eggs in the water which has flooded residential areas. This creates various diseases and allergies among the residents. The officials have taken precautions to avoid such diseases by giving them prevention tablets against rat fever. The place was visited by the government officials but still no action was taken to end this misery.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/clogged-stormwater-drain-causing-problems/articleshow/87968373.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ahead of MLC poll, BJP corporators start leaving for ‘official picnic’||Nagpur: Ahead of December 10 MLC poll (local body constituency), small batches of BJP corporators have started departing for Goa and some other states rules by the saffron party. At the time of filing this report, some Nagpur corporators were scheduled to board a 1.15am direct flight to Goa. Senior BJP leaders said that the voters, who are public representatives in local bodies, will be carrying their mobile phones with them, so there won’t be any ‘virtual house arrest’. One such leader said, “Media is reading too much into this because we are not doing anything secretly. Our people are going in different batches and that too by regular service airlines, not chartered flights. All of them will be back on December 8.” Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said, “Travel plans for our corporators are part of a pre-decided itinerary. Women corporators were due to visit Uttarakhand, so that’s happening now. Male corporators are visiting different places, again as part of a previously decided plan, which has nothing to do with polls. If the opposition is so interested, we can take them along as well.” Another BJP politician said that the party is so confident that quite a few corporators are not even going. “We had a quite a few corporators tell us that they cannot leave the city now due to various other commitments. The leadership has already agreed to this for some, and I am sure in a day or two many others will get this relaxation,” the leader said. So, if there is no fear of the party’s voters defecting, why are they being herded to different locations. Top leaders of the party refused to speak ‘on record’ and added that this is just a safety protocol. “In NMC itself we have over 60 corporators who will never ever cross vote. Others could be manipulated through force because in state BJP is not in power. This is not the first time such a thing is happening, every party does it,” said the leader. The plan to send corporators to different locations had been chalked out earlier, and what remained was the task of breaking them down into smaller groups. One such leader, who will be overseeing travel plans of a particular batch of corporators, said, “First thing is to consider where to send them, even if it is BJP ruled states. Also, who goes in one group is also important, not for spying, as the media would like to believe, but to keep them together as a level headed mediator.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/ahead-of-mlc-poll-bjp-corporators-start-leaving-for-official-picnic/articleshow/87969109.cms||---

---||Nagpur||SECR creates dedicated space as ‘safe bubbles’ on platforms for women passengers||Nagpur: In a first of its kind experiment, south east central railway (SECR) have developed ‘safe bubbles’, dedicated exclusively for women passengers travelling alone, on platforms of key stations to ensure safe journeys. The bubbles, christened ‘Akshita’, are demarcated arenas or enclosures of transparent glasses for visibility with various facilities, including CCTV footages. Started by the Nagpur division of SECR, Akshita enclosures have been replicated at two other adjoining divisions of Bilaspur and Raipur. In Nagpur division, special women enclosures or Akshitas have been created at Gondia, Rajnandgaon and Dongargarh. In Bilaspur division, the Akshita facility has been created for women at Bilaspur and Raigarh. Similarly, such enclosures for women have been created at Raipur, Bhilai and Durg in Raipur division. Divisional railway manager (DRM) Maninder Uppal said the exclusive enclosure is a novel concept for Indian railways which was introduced in Nagpur division for securing women travelling alone. “Akshita is the brainchild of SECR general manager Aloke Kumar. Women travelling alone feel uncomfortable and insecure while waiting for trains on platforms,” said Uppal, adding, the enclosures ensure well-lit, CCTVs, strategically located and also have a Railway protection force (RPF) post close to it. “The facility was created at platforms where the footfalls are higher,” he said. Uppal said women waiting at enclosures are being provided with a number of facilities like digital display boards for arrivals and departures, public address systems, GPS clocks and mobile charging facilities. “We have ensured that women feel safe and secure in every sense,” he said. “At island platforms, women would feel more at ease at Akshita enclosures,” he added. SECR sources also stated that the safe bubbles for women would also have refreshments stalls, drinking water and foot over bridges in the vicinity. SECR’s railway protection force (RPF) is also implementing ‘Meri Saheli’ in long-distance trains where security personnel attend to women travelling alone. Women are being contacted in trains by RPF staffers under the special schemes for their security. “With the Akshita enclosures coming up and the existing ‘Meri Saheli’, women should feel most secure while passing through SECR or using its facilities,” said a senior SECR official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/secr-creates-dedicated-space-as-safe-bubbles-on-platforms-for-women-passengers/articleshow/87969122.cms||Soumitra Bose

At the Kognoli inter-state border checkpost between Maharashtra and Karnataka, the health staff guarded by Karnataka police have shown up again. The long queues of vehicles stranded on both sides of the checkpost are causing inconvenience to the passengers. The decision to start screening has been taken without any prior declaration. Only fully vaccinated passengers are allowed to enter Karnataka. The unvaccinated people and those who have received just the first dose are mandatorily screened. Temperature is checked and those with high fever are subjected to the rapid antigen tests. According to the Belagavi district officials who visited the Kognoli checkpost, the RT-PCR negative report will be made mandatory from Monday onwards. The passengers travelling to Karnataka must either have a negative RT-PCR Covid report of not more than 72 hours old or should be fully vaccinated||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/negative-rt-pcr-report-mandatory-to-enter-karnataka-from-monday/articleshow/87966798.cms||---

Several arrests have been made from other parts of the state and teams of sleuths were conducting more raids in Ghaziabad, Meerut, Mathura, Bulandshahr and Noida when this report was filed. Additional director general (law and order), Prashant Kumar, told TOI, "We are committed to a free and fair examination and that is why the decision was taken to cancel the exam due to paper leak. All field units of UP STF have been activated in the state to investigate and arrest the gangs involved in the leak and so far, we have nabbed around 26 culprits from across the state." The examination is now likely to be held next month. "Those arrested from Shamli include Manish Malik, Ravi Kandla and Dharmender Pal. They are members of a gang that procured the examination papers for Rs 5 lakh and their task was to provide the contents to willing candidates for Rs 50,000 each," said Brijesh Singh, circle officer of Meerut field unit of UP STF. Notably, the UPTET was not held last year as well due to prevailing Covid restrictions and over 21 lakh candidates were set to appear for the test, in two shifts, from across the state. The cancellation of the test led to a lot of inconvenience for candidates who had travelled to different cities to reach the examination centres. Archana Chaudhary, who came all the way from Ghaziabad to Bijnor, said, “I prepared for several months and had already solved 85% of the questions when all of a sudden, the invigilators informed us that the exam had been cancelled. So many candidates had to bear the hardship due to this sudden announcement." Saturday's UPTET cancellation comes just a day after the UP STF had arrested four members of a ‘solver gang’ from Aligarh and Meerut who had gained access to a college server and took control of computers of the candidates taking the UP Police sub-inspector recruitment exam. Those arrested included the centre head of the company which had been entrusted with the task of conducting the online exam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/up-stf-arrests-3-from-shamli-after-teacher-eligibility-test-cancelled-due-to-paper-leak/articleshow/87967482.cms||Sandeep Rai

His draft advised on making MSP a guaranteed law,” Tikait said at a Mahapanchayat of farmers and workers at the Azad Maidan on Sunday.  “Modi had done his PhD on MSP. But today, when the lawyer has become a judge, they are saying MSP will be a hindrance for farmers. In reality, they don’t want to give the MSP as they want to benefit the corporates so that they can fill their godowns with cheap grains looted from farmers,” said Tikait. The farmers’ leader reiterated that the protest would not end without a law on MSP. “The disease of the farm laws may be repealed but that doesn’t mean farmers do not have other ailments,” he said.  The Mahapanchayat called for the defeat of the BJP in the upcoming assembly polls in the country and hailed the victory of the farmer’s struggle in the repeal of the farm laws. It also paid homage to the farmers who died at the year-long protest near Delhi and at Lakhimpur Kheri. Other leaders present included activist Yogendra Yadav, Medha Patkar of the National Alliance of Peoples’ movements and Ashok Dhawle of the Kisan Sabha. Tikait said the farmers’ protest was far from over and that the Central government could not be trusted. “The intention of the government is not good. They have conspiracies and will betray us. They want to belittle farmers,” he asserted. He also said that the Samyukta Kisan Morcha would participate in people’s protests and would stand with students and the unemployed. Tikait called upon the MVA government in Maharashtra to support those who died in the farmer protests at the Delhi border.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pm-modi-backed-msp-as-gujarat-cm-should-do-so-now-farmer-leader-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/87969924.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Following the PM’s push, approvals from the WB government came fast and the pace of digging of the tunnel has increased more than three-fold in the past six months — from 300 metres a day to 1 km — and is likely to touch 1.3 km daily by December end. The progress in tunnelling work is important considering that 86% of the project from Sivok near Darjeeling to Rangpo in Sikkim, comprises 14 tunnels. Out of the total 45 km, 38.6 km are tunnels. About 42 km of the rail line falls in West Bengal. The government has set December 2023 as the deadline for this crucial north-east connectivity project. Sunil Sharma, general manager (works) of the Northeast Frontier Railway, said the deadline is realistic and works will be completed by that time. “Approvals came late. Now all the tenders have been awarded and work is progressing fast. While in June the daily progress of digging for tunnels was 350 metres in June, this has touched 1,000 metre and we expect this to reach 1,300 metres in the next few months,” he added. Officials said although this project was sanctioned in 2009-10, work could not start due to delays in land acquisition and forest clearances. After getting necessary approvals from the WB government and forest department in June 2019, activities at all the fronts were planned for execution. Currently, Sikkim and Kalimpong districts are dependent solely on NH-10A from Siliguri. The NH gets disrupted due to frequent landslides during monsoon and traffic congestions are regular features from Sivok to Rangpo. The new railway line will provide all weather connectivity to Sikkim. This will also prove to be a big boost for tourism in the region and has strategic significance for the defence of the country.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-sikkim-rail-project-picks-up-pace-after-pm-push/articleshow/87969920.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Meerut||Post withdrawal of farm laws, BJP holds series of 'tractor rallies' in UP||Bijnor: The BJP is all set to show its strength on Monday by bringing out a 'tractor rally' for which mobilisation is taking place at the grassroots level. It is also the day when the party has asked all its members to be present in the Parliament where it will formally start the process of repealing the three contentious farm laws. The party had earlier asked all its elected representatives to reach out to farmers and explain the "benefits of the laws". But, the members were turned away from several villages where local farmers were not even willing to talk to them on the subject. Now, holding tractor rallies in the state would help them to neutralise the farm agitation. With tractor rallies, BJP is trying to reach out to the region's farmers again. West UP president of BJP's Kisan Morcha, Teja Singh Gurjjar, said, "We have held several tractor rallies in UP. We will hold the same rally in Bijnor on Monday. Farmers will take part in the event where we will harp on the good work done by BJP for the welfare of farmers." Giving more details, Gurjjar added, "Some farmers could not understand the agri laws. They were adamant for its withdrawal. We respect our government's decision to repeal them. Farmers were with BJP and are still with us. These rallies have been held since November 16 and will conclude on November 30. Our final rally will take place in Hapur." According to senior BJP member Sitaram Singh Rana, west UP is an agriculture hub. "Tractor rally will prove a boon for the party. It is an effort to make the farmers understand that BJP is always with them and their interest lies only with us." Meanwhile, all preparations are in place for the tractor rally in Bijnor on Monday. The party's west UP president, Mohit Beniwal, is scheduled to address the rally.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/post-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-bjp-holds-series-of-tractor-rallies-in-up/articleshow/87967537.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt school creates audio books for primary students||Thiruvananthapuram: Kilimanoor government higher secondary school has come up with a novel project to enhance the knowledge of the primary class students by launching audio books. The project was implemented by the NSS unit of the school as part of the ‘Edu help’ scheme initiated by the government. The audio books include ‘muthassikadhakal’ and other moral stories. The school has created an audio book library for primary class students. The library was made possible by the active participation of NSS volunteers from the school’s higher secondary department. Around 25 NSS volunteers and a few teachers participated in the production team. The school has also developed an application named ‘story world’ to access the audio books. The app was shared to the parents and while opening the app, it will redirect to a website where all these audio books are showcased in video format. This app is not available in the play store. Currently, the volunteers are sharing the app through different social media platforms. The videos are also uploaded to their YouTube channel and disseminated on their official social media pages. The narration of the books was done by the NSS volunteers and a few teachers who were interested to take part in the project. The volunteers collected the matching voices and the caricature for the video. The institution is also planning to record poems for this audio book library. They recorded the narration on their mobile phone and shared it to the editor. “When the pandemic hit the students hard, parents reached out to online audio books and they found that the Malayalam short stories for kids are very less as compared to English short stories. That is the reason behind our initiative. We aim at creating a study platform for primary class kids. We are looking forward to recording more study materials like this and the kids all over Kerala can use this as a study platform,” said Niza U J, the program officer of NSS unit of the school. “After recording, the volunteers sent the audio to me for editing. The difficult part for us was to find out the appropriate caricatures and music for the story. We will continue to do this service in spite of all the drawbacks. We managed our class timings with the works and went forward. We have also got good feedback,”said Hussain Salim, the editor of the audio books and boys’ leader of the NSS unit of the school.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-school-creates-audio-books-for-primary-students/articleshow/87968390.cms||---

Cashew trees start flowering by December-January and they need dry, cold weather for nearly 10-15 days to bloom well. However, it has rained for several days in November. “Cashew trees need a well-defined dry period for a good yield. Excessive rainfall during monsoon and a delay in the onset of winter usually disturbs blooming and ultimately affects production” said Sattari zonal agriculture officer Vishwanath Gawas, adding that if the rain continues, it could affect the cashew crops. Gawas said that delayed blooming will affect both, quantity and quality of cashew nuts, and in turn, adversely impact the income of cashew farmers. With nearly 75% of farmers in the taluka involved in cashew growing, they are now hopeful that the post monsoon rain will cease. Meanwhile, the recent unseasonal rain has extensively damaged paddy cultivations in remote areas of the taluka such as Kumthol, Karmali and Naneli. Gawas said that so far, his office has received applications from three farmers seeking compensation. They have surveyed their cultivations and found rain-related damage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/continued-rain-has-sattaris-cashew-farmers-worried/articleshow/87969232.cms||---

On the other side, retailers too are pinning hopes on customers ‘upgrading’ to overseas brand liquors as prices go down drastically. This would be specially true for upper class consumers, for whom there would be a significant reduction in retail prices. A senior excise department official said customers may have to wait for some time to get the benefit as existing stocks will continue to be sold at the older rates. “Manufacturers would now need to print new MRPs on the packaging as per the latest duty fee cuts, and procure permission from the excise department to sell products with the new rates,” said the official. The duty cut would also put a brake on illegal manufacture and transportation from neighbouring states like Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, where imported brands were available at much cheaper rates than Maharashtra before the latest notification. The state government has slashed special duty fee on BIO category liquors from 300% to 150% on the manufacturing cost. The state excise department is hoping for a substantial jump in revenue from ongoing 2021-22 financial year. In Nagpur division, the revenue from Nagpur district was Rs248 crore between April 1, 2020, and November 21, 2021, which is expected to increase to Rs508 crore by the end of the financial year. The revenue collection in the financial year 2020-21 was marred by the lockdown but still Rs500 crore mark was crossed, said an official, adding the revenue collection of the pre-pandemic financial year 2019-20 was Rs526. In the current financial year (2021-22), the total revenue generation for Nagpur district between April 1 and November 21 was Rs254 crore. With the lockdown lifted and the latest notification slicing special duty fee, Nagpur district’s revenue collection is expected to cross Rs550 crore mark in this financial year. SP state excise Pramod Sonone said the slashing of duty would boost sale of imported brands, which is expected to push up revenue. Rajeev Jaiswal, president of Nagpur District Permit Room Association, said the cut would curtail illegal transportation of liquors from other states, where prices of premium imported brands were much lesser than Maharashtra. “The association had been demanding a cut for three years. The high duty hit sales and led to illegal transportation, manufacture of fake branded liquors, and other illegal activities,” he said, adding the decision would mainly benefit upper crust consumers. Another liquor businessman sounded hopeful customers would feel motivated to upgrade their choices and consumption as prices go down. “Customers would be able to get premium quality liquor brand at cheaper rate now,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/duty-cut-could-give-excise-dept-rs550-cr-high-from-liquor-revenue/articleshow/87969147.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Police again turn down KSRTC’s plea to open Rajaji Road||KOCHI: The demand for opening up Rajaji Road for KSRTC buses to enter the depot from MG Road has cropped up again after the state corporation took up the issue at higher levels. KSRTC raised the issue again at the Ernakulam Regional Transport Authority (RTA) meeting recently. RTA then asked Traffic West ACP to submit a report to the district collector regarding the matter. As per the report submitted by the ACP, police won’t open the road again for allowing vehicles to turn from MG Road towards KSRTC depot through this road. Ernakulam KSRTC officials have been demanding to open Rajaji Road to allow its buses to turn from MG Road towards the depot. But their requests were always denied by the traffic police citing that it would create severe traffic congestion in the junction. KSRTC officials say that Rajaji Road was constructed to allow their buses to turn from MG Road to its depot. Banning this has forced its buses from Thoppumpady and Alappuzha to travel more distance. “Currently, buses from Thoppumpady and Alappuzha side reach the depot through Kadavanthra. This leads to increased fuel consumption. If they allow our buses to turn from MG Road to Rajaji Road, we can reduce the travel distance. It will also help the passengers. Around 150 trips from Thoppumpady side are being diverted daily via Kadavanthra now due to the closure of Rajaji Road from MG Road,” claimed a KSRTC official. As there was no favourable response from the police, KSRTC officials approached its chairman and managing director (CMD) this time, raising the demand. “The CMD took up the matter at the transport secretary level,” said district transport officer Thajudheen Sahib V M. Transport secretary wrote to the officials to consider the matter at the RTA meeting. The road was closed around nine years when the traffic congestion issue on MG Road became a serious issue. “The KSRTC officials are citing the issue of rising fuel consumption when their buses from Thoppumpady side have to travel to the depot via Kadavanthra. However, they remain tight-lipped on positive aspects. Buses from Muvattupuzha and Kottayam sides reach the depot via Kadavanthra by saving four kilometre. Their other claim is that passengers to the High Court side do not benefit by travelling on buses reaching the depot via Kadavanthra. Even if buses are allowed to reach the depot via Rajaji Road, the problem will persist as no KSRTC buses run via High Court Junction,” said a traffic police personnel. “The road cannot be opened only for KSRTC buses,” added the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/police-again-turn-down-ksrtcs-plea-to-open-road/articleshow/87968388.cms||T C Sreemol

Sejal Jain, second-year undergraduate student in the department of earth sciences, accidentally slipped and fell into the Ganga while she had gone to the barrage accompanied by her seven friends, all from IIT Kanpur. Her batchmates, fellow students and faculty members were shocked by the tragic incident. The media cell of the institute stated on Sunday that second year undergraduate student Sejal Jain accidentally slipped and fell into the Ganga at Barrage. The student was declared ‘brought dead’ by the doctor at Lala Lajpat Rai hospital, it added. “With profound grief, we inform you of the tragic and untimely demise of one of our beloved students, Ms Sejal Jain, a second-year BS student in the Department of Earth Sciences. At about 6pm on Saturday (November 27), a message was received by the security control room of the institute, that Sejal had accidentally slipped and fallen into the Ganga at Ganga Barrage. Immediately, the Nawabganj Police Station was contacted, and the police team rushed to the location. A search team went into the river and found Sejal in an unconscious state,” the media cell said. The security officer of the institute and Student Gymkhana president Vedant Sikka dashed to the site. Sejal was rushed to the LLR hospital in an ambulance. At 7.15pm on Saturday, after a few investigations, the doctor on emergency duty declared that Sejal Jain was brought dead. “It has come to our knowledge that Sejal had gone to the Ganga Barrage along with seven other students. During their visit, a few of the students, including Sejal Jain, had crossed the safety railing of the bridge and went towards the ramp of the barrage gate. Out of curiosity, she crossed the danger area alone and accidentally slipped from the open space into the water and drowned,” the institute said. “We mourn the untimely loss of a young bright mind and pray that God gives her family and friends the strength to bear this loss,” it added. The postmortem was conducted on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/iit-k-iind-year-student-slips-into-ganga-drowns/articleshow/87969139.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Mumbai||Supreme Court rejects builder’s plea against Wadala flat buyers’ refund order||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court, granting no relief to Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company, dismissed its special leave petitions for permission to file appeal against an August 30 high court judgment that had upheld a Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) tribunal order for refund to flat buyers over possession delay. The project is in Wadala. After hearing the counsel for Bombay Dyeing and perusing the documents placed on record, the SC bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath on Friday ruled: “We are not persuaded to entertain these petitions seeking leave to appeal against the judgment.” The HC ruling had come in a batch of appeals. The SC, however, said, “Even while not entertaining these petitions, we would leave it open for the parties in taking recourse to other appropriate proceedings, including the proposition for settlement, as may be advised and as may be permissible in law.” In its order on August 30, the Bombay high court had served a setback to Bombay Dyeing, which constructed two “ultra-luxurious” towers in Wadala. The HC had upheld the RERA tribunal’s order directing it to refund with interest amounts received from buyers who booked flats in 2012-13. The flats were to be delivered by 2017. Ashok Narang, a realtor, and other buyers had initially filed a complaint with Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority alleging delay in possession. They had sought refund and an exit under Section 18 and invoked Section 12 of RERA for compensation. They alleged reduced amenities and other “unilateral changes” in the apartments and project layout by the builder while registering the then ongoing project in May 2017 when the MahaRera Act came into force. The developer said amenities were provided. Section 12 of RERA places an obligation on a builder or promoter of a project for “veracity” of an advertisement or brochure. It states that when a buyer who has paid a deposit based on information in a brochure or advertisement suffers a loss due to false information contained in it, he can be compensated by the builder. The HC judgment by Justice C V Bhadang, had held: “Section 12 would also apply to the obligation of the promoter regarding the information given...prior to the registration of the project under the RERA Act of 2016 as ongoing project.” The provision is “retroactive”, it had held. The HC had said the “brochure indeed mentions the date of possession as 2017”. The developer had said that the date was subject to its disclaimer in the brochure. The HC had rejected the argument saying the disclaimer did not mention the possession date.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-rejects-builders-plea-against-wadala-flat-buyers-refund-order/articleshow/87969941.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Garbage continues to be a headache for Kochiites||KOCHI: Even as shoulders of roads, vacant plots, etc. in the city have turned into waste dumping yards, posing the threat of spreading communicable diseases, the Kochi corporation authorities are unable to address the issue. According to the leaders of Anticorruption People’s Movement, an NGO which fights corruption, authorities fail to take action even if the issue of waste dumping on public places are brought to their notice. “Waste stacked on the side of the road at Palathuruth near Kadavanthra had been a headache for the residents. Though we complained to the corporation authorities, they didn’t take any steps to address the issue. On October 1, 2021, we lodged a complaint with Kadavanthra police in this regard. After a month, we lodged another complaint with the city police commissioner as the authorities failed to clear the garbage,” said Anticorruption People’s Movement general secretary N S Unnithan. Then, the police brought the issue to the corporation authorities. On November 18, 2021, corporation authorities replied to Kadavanthra police that the garbage piled up in the area had been removed. As per the letter sent to the police by corporation health officer, Palathuruth is a collection point of waste. The corporation would collect waste from the area every day, the local body authorities claimed. Palathuruth being a less populated area, motorists would dump waste there. So, the corporation surveillance squad is deployed to nab such offenders, the corporation official states in his letter to the police. “It not true that the corporation removed the waste on November 18. The owner of a neighbouring land parcel erected CCTV cameras and two floodlit lights a week ago. Then, the corporation workers cleared the waste on November 27,” Unnithan said. At the same time, corporation authorities said the waste collection in the city is proper. “Waste is being collected from all places in the corporation on a daily basis. Still, some anti-social elements would be dumping waste at some places. For booking them, we have pressed squads into action,” mayor M Anilkumar said. Giant African snail menace, crowding of street dogs and many other health issues are stemming out of the garbage which is being piled up in the streets. “On Chittoor Road near Krishna Swamy Road, there is a vacant plot. It is full of garbage. Nobody bothers to clear it despite the fact that we took up the issue with the authorities several times,” said Ranjit Thampy, an activist. Some of the corporation councillors had suggested that there should be special projects for clearing garbage from vacant plots in the city. “When we gave the suggestion, the corporation authorities replied that there is no provision for the local bodies to remove waste from private properties. Though we explored the possibilities of using the workforce under Ayyankali Urban Employment Scheme for clearing the garbage on vacant plots, the norms allow removing waste only if the land is allotted for agricultural purpose. Sadly, no owners are ready to allot their holdings for agriculture,” said Henry Austin, a councillor.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/garbage-continues-to-be-a-headache-for-kochiites/articleshow/87968401.cms||---

The leopard was captured in the CCTV camera of the college while it was moving around the campus. The college is situated in the thickly populated Nawabganj area of the industrial city. This was the first time that such incident of a wild animal entering the residential pocket here. The CCTV footage, dated November 27 (Saturday), was shared by the college authorities with the district administration after which the Forest Department swung into action. People had been alerted and told not to panic. Divisional Forest Officer, Arvind Yadav, told TOI that the traps have been laid to capture the leopard successfully. Also baits have been placed. “Our teams are combing in the area. We are sure of capturing it sooner or later. Normally, leopards are shy animals and until disturbed they do not attack,” said the official. He added that the forest department had received the permission to tranqualise the wild cat and the department teams were making efforts to either trap it or else tranqualise. Kanpur Zoo doctor, Mohammad Nasir, said that while combing, he had an encounter with the leopard, but from that location it could not be tranqualised. He said that this leopard is an adult, aged around 5-6 years and is probably a female. He said that he also came across a carcass of a dog in the area which indicates that this leopard made it her prey. “Leopards hunt during the night time. And it is only then they move out of their hideout. It appears we shall be able to capture it during the night. It had eaten up a dog and some other dogs of the area were also missing. It seems, the missing dogs fell prey to this leopard. It also means that this leopard would have been hiding in the same area for sometime and would have hunted dogs. But locals could not make out why the dogs went missing. We are now making efforts to capture it at the earliest,” Dr Nasir said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/kanpur-leopard-enters-vssd-college-campus/articleshow/87969153.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Rise in unmet need for family planning among married women, says NFHS||CHANDIGARH: There has been a significant rise in the number of unmet needs for contraception among married women in Punjab who want to avoid pregnancy but do not use any method. The percentage of unmet need for family planning in married women aged between 15-49 years has increased from 4% recorded in 2015-16 to 9.7%, according to the latest National Family Health Survey-5. Experts have not ruled out the possibility of restrictions imposed during the Covid pandemic behind the change in trend. There were also reports of contraceptive shortages during the period. Unmet need for family planning refers to fecund women who are not using contraception but who wish to postpone the next birth by spacing or by stopping childbearing altogether. Women are considered to have unmet need if they are at risk of becoming pregnant, not using contraception, and either does not want to be pregnant within the next two years or are unsure if or when they wishto be pregnant. In about 41% of the districts, the percentage of such married women needs for both contraception and spacing was found higher than the state’s overall average. The highest total unmet need percentage of 17.7 was recorded in Bathinda, followed by Faridkot where the percentage of such women stood at 15.7%, 15.4% in Ferozepur, 13.4% in Jalandhar, 12.3% in Mohali and 11.9% in Gurdaspur. Only 21.7% of females in the state not using family planning methods were approached by health worker. The data has come as a surprise for Chandigarh-based Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID)’s Professor of Population Studies Aswini Kumar Nanda as Punjab has traditionally been a good performing state on this count. “As data was collected in both pre- and post-lockdown phases change in trend might be temporarily reflecting dynamics of contraceptive use during Covid-19 outbreak,” said Prof Nanda.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rise-in-unmet-need-for-family-planning-among-married-women/articleshow/87969158.cms||Vinod Kumar

Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) national secretary KK Singh has demanded an inquiry into the incident and recovery of expenses from the officials involved in the abuse of power. A picnic was organized for the family members of WCL officers in Chandrapur area at Hanuman temple, Chichpalli, 20km from the city, on Chandrapur-Mul road on Saturday. WCL officials arranged everything for the personal picnic of their family members at the expense of the company. INTUC leader Singh informed that official cars of WCL officers carried their family members to the picnic spot, whereas family members of officials without official cars were taken in a WCL bus. Transport vehicle of the company was used for transportation of material needed for the picnic. Cooks working at WCL guest house were taken to the spot to prepare meals. Even security personnel were deputed at the spot, Singh alleged. He said going on a picnic and having fun is a personal matter and no one is against it. However, using vehicles, assets and personnel of the company for personal recreation is against the rule, Singh charged. He has demanded an inquiry into the matter and action against erring officials. He also demanded recovery of expenses on vehicles and staff from salaries of responsible officers. WCL area general manager Muhammad Sabir claimed to have no knowledge of the incident. However, he agreed that using company vehicles and assets for personal recreation is against the rules.

Manchadiparambil Chanthu, 72, who procured a high court order for doing farming in his fields, harvested paddy from his pokkali fields at Maruvakkad in Chellanam panchayat on Sunday. At Maruvakkad, there are 430 acres of paddy fields. Of these only 261 acres are cultivable. “As per the agricultural calendar for Maruvakkad, April 15-November 14 is the period for paddy farming while the land can be used for saline aquaculture in the remaining months. As the fish such as prawn grown in the paddy field during the aquaculture give more monetary benefits, the office-bearers of Maruvakkad Padasekhara Samithi would like to do aquaculture throughout the year. So, they would break the bund between the paddy fields and backwaters during April itself so as to facilitate aquaculture, it is the period allotted to paddy cultivation though. Once the bund is broken, saline water from backwaters would flow into the paddy fields,” Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi general convener Francis Kaluthungal said. “Though Chanthu wished to start paddy cultivation in his 2.5 acres, he couldn’t start it due to the saline water intrusion. The agriculture department and revenue department which are supposed to support paddy farmers didn’t extend helping hands to Chanthu. Then, he moved the court which ordered that agriculture calendar should be followed,” Kaluthungal said. Then, Chanthu started paddy farming on August 7, a couple of months behind the normal schedule. On Sunday, Justice P K Shamsudheen inaugurated the harvesting of paddy from Chanthu’s fields. He asked the government to take measures to give protection to the farmers who want to cultivate paddy in their fields in the area.  “Paddy cultivation has already proven to be profitable. Moreover, following paddy-aquaculture calendar designed for saline fields in the area will help reduce the impact of global warming as well,” Shamsudheen said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/for-72-year-old-chanthu-his-harvest-is-a-big-victory/articleshow/87968414.cms||---

This is one of the biggest seizures of high-end iPhones in recent times. Sources said it could be the tip of the iceberg as there is price difference of Rs25,000-30,000 on each phone, and that why there is rampant smuggling of 13Pro phones. On specific information, DRI Mumbai unit on November 26 inspected two suspicious consignments at air cargo at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai. Officials said there were 2,245 13Pro phones, 1,401 13 Pro Max, 12 Google Pixel phones and an Apple smart watch. Officials seized the consignment under the Customs Act of 1962 and are probing the importer’s role. iPhone13 models went on sale in India from September 2021, with a base price of Rs70,000, and some higher end models costing up to Rs1,80,000. Import of mobile phones attracts a Customs duty of around 44%.  “Prima facie the ‘importer’ used fictitious KYC and third party’s import-export code (IEC). We have some clues and will nab them soon,’’ said a DRI official. Detection of attempted smuggling of high-end phones of latest models in such large numbers shows how quickly smugglers establish networks for latest products.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/dri-seizes-3k-iphones-worth-rs-42cr-at-airport/articleshow/87969943.cms||Ahmed Ali

The minister said that the purpose of holding a festival in Karkala, is to popularise the cultural, religious and architectural heritage of his constituency. Karkala, which is also known as Karla, is located about 55 km from Mangaluru. The remote town located close to the Western Ghats in Udupi district has several monuments, that makes it historically a significant place in coastal Karnataka, said minister Kumar. “Karkala, which was built by king Bhairava Arasa, has a prominent place in the cultural history of India. The land has a large number of natural and historical landmarks, including Gomateshwara statue, Jain Basadis including Saavira Kambada Basadi (thousand pillar Jain temple), Venkatramana Temple and St Lawrence Shrine Basilica of Attur, Kudlu Falls, and several other tourist spots. We have plans to introduce all these prominent spots to people across the nation. Through the Karkala Utsav, we have plans to attract tourists from all parts of the state and nation. The festival will be held from December 18 to 27. The cultural richness of Karkala should reach the nook and corners of the nation, and thereby people should understand the art and culture of Karnataka,” the minister said. Hundreds of artistes from various cultural troupes will present their talent at a procession to be held as part of the festival on December 24, he said. Since the number of daily cases of Covid-19 in Udupi district is falling drastically, the minister is confident of holding the festival in the third week of December. The district has been recording an average of five cases per day. The minister has shared a promo created for the Karkala Utsav 2021 on social media, announcing the festival. Meanwhile, the minister said the government will also take initiatives to hold Karavali Utsav in Mangaluru in January, if the pandemic is under control.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/karkala-utsav-planned-in-kannada-culture-ministers-town/articleshow/87967557.cms||---

---||Dehradun||CTR illegalities: ‘Selective transfers’ of 30 sr IFS officers raise eyebrows||Dehradun: Two days after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami ordered the transfer of head of forest force (HoFF) Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden JS Suhag and chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Anup Malik, environmentalists and a section of IFS officers have expressed their dismay over 'selective action’ in the matter pertaining to illegal constructions in the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR). Many are pointing out why the DFO, Kalagarh, under whose watch maximum illegal structures came up, hasn’t been suspended. Also, why wasn’t director, CTR, removed and former chief wildlife warden, JS Suhag, continues to be CEO of CAMPA. Incidentally, Bhartari was removed even though the state government had itself asked him to file a chargesheet against Suhag, Rahul and Kisanchand in October. Responding to these concerns, the additional chief secretary of Uttarakhand government, Anand Bardhan, told TOI, “Government has made this decision in its own wisdom.” Meanwhile, Supreme Court advocate, Gaurav Bansal, who took the matter before the Delhi high court and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), raised doubts on the intentions of the state government. “The entire exercise of transfers of IFS officers shows that government is not serious about taking action against the real culprits. It is shocking to see that the government has transferred Bhartari. It seems that he was punished because he directed Sanjiv Chaturvedi to investigate the scam, who refused to do so, citing legal technical loopholes,” Bansal said. Inaction against DFO of Kalagarh, Kisanchand,has also drawn flak from environment lovers. “The DFO is neither being suspended nor arrested for such a high-level corruption scam. NTCA committee and MoEFCC report has clearly mentioned about his active involvement in the scam. The NTCA even stated that he forged government documents,” said Reenu Paul, an environmental activist. Incidentally, the secretary of Uttarakhand government, Vijay Yadav, on October 29 had directed Bhartari to file a chargesheet against Kisanchand, JS Suhag and Rahul. But it could not happen as 2 IFS officers, Sanjiv Chaturvedi and BK Gangte refused to probe the matter, citing its legality.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ctr-illegalities-selective-transfers-of-30-sr-ifs-officers-raise-eyebrows/articleshow/87967543.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||Delhi again looks up to its saviour — wind||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality stayed in the “severe” zone for a third consecutive day on Sunday, but some relief is expected over the next two days. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the capital stood at 405. The air quality is likely to improve on December 5 and 6 with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting relatively stronger winds in play, along with slight chances of rain. Track the pollution level in your cityA thick layer of smog appeared over the city on Sunday as the visibility dropped to 400m-800m at Safdarjung from early morning till 1 pm. According to the IMD, light winds in the range of up to 5-7kmph helped improve the visibility up to 800-1,000m later in the day. The visibility remained relatively higher at Palam in the range of 800-1,200m till 10.30 am, which later improved to 1,200-2,200m. Experts said there was no improvement in the air quality on Sunday as the pollutants could not disperse due to calm winds during the night, light winds during the day and high moisture, low temperatures and low mixing layer height. The minimum temperature was 10.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal. However, officials said some improvement is expected from Monday. “Winds are likely to be relatively stronger on Monday afternoon and also for some hours on Tuesday. The weather is likely to be cloudy on December 1-2 due to an active western disturbance affecting the region. Delhi may get some easterly winds on the two days,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. However, the air quality may deteriorate on December 3 and 4. It is expected to improve again on December 5 and 6. “Another active and strong western disturbance is likely to impact Delhi on December 5 and 6 when stronger easterly winds are likely to prevail. There are chances of rain during the period,” said Jenamani. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, stated: “Local surface winds are likely to increase moderately on December 29 and 30, which increases dispersion of pollutants, leading to slight improvement, but AQI may remain in the ‘very poor’ category. From December 1, wind speed and temperature are likely to decrease, reducing ventilation and leading to a slight deterioration in the air quality. Low-mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of the pollutants.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-again-looks-up-to-its-saviour-wind/articleshow/87968420.cms||---
---||Shimla||Slighted in Shimla: Mystery of room 701||SHIMLA: Who directed the staff at Shimla’s Circuit House to change the room allotted to former Himachal CM Prem Kumar Dhumal? He left his supporters to solve the mystery after he abandoned the BJP’s core group and state working committee meeting on the third day for an abrupt return to Hamirpur in the middle of a serious defeat analysis and forward planning for the 2022 assembly polls.  For two days, Dhumal stayed in room 701, and on the third, he was asked to move. Sources claim that the former CM felt slighted after someone from the general administration department (GAD) objected to booking him that room on telephone when it was reserved for the state guests. GAD’s joint secretary wrote to Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation’s senior manager to ask him why he had made his own bookings and failed to accommodate the state guests. While this explanation is due, Dhumal’s insult has sparked a debate in social media. Ever since Jai Ram Thakur became CM, Dhumal’s camp feels ignored and this incident before the 2022 assembly elections will fuel that anger further. Rebels or revolt, Congress must chooseAs the Congress tries to settle AAP’s rebels within, its own older ranks in those segments threaten to revolt. A few inductees have encroached upon the other Congressmen’s constituencies, like the woman MLA from Bathinda district has gone active in Muktsar. AAP’s rebel MLA from Barnala district who joined the Congress is facing resistance from a veteran woman, who is a former candidate. In the presence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi the other day, the Congressmen whose home turfs have been invaded, made it clear to him that they were in no moodto tolerate this. This could be a problem for the party. Kejriwal’s suspense, Mann not thrilledAAP’s Punjab chied Bhagwant Mann is apparently tired waiting for supremo Arvind Kejriwal to announce the CM face. The Sangrur MP is hopeful, while his supporters have even run a ‘Mann for CM’ campaign in the state. Seeing no impact of it on the party’s central leadership, they have abandoned this pressure tactic. A few months ago, Kejriwal wanted a Sikh face for CM race. Then he said the candidate will be from Punjab only. Further and further delay makes it clear that Mann may not be the first choice, else the party wouldn’t still be searching for a suitable candidate. The Mann camp hasn’t lost all hope, though, as it believes there is no alternative to him. AAP is reported to have approached even a senior farmer unionist but the unions are still engaged in their protest on Delhi’s border. To appear to be keeping the door open for Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, Kejriwal has hit CM Channi with barbs. It did nothing except confuse his own supporters but and political class, when political situation of Punjab continues to be in a flux. ‘Poll star’ Bibi finds bearings from SukhbirWill the Shiromani Akali Dal pick Jagir Kaur once again to lead the Sikhs’ single largest representative body, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). The election is on Monday. Looking at the competitive political field, the party might want to use the former Akali minister’s services in the coming Punjab assembly elections. The decision was expected on Sunday , so not only the senior party member but also SGPC’s office-bearers were camping in Amritsar, waiting for party president Sukhbir Badal to arrive and hold a meeting to take the call. Holy cow! Jaihind scare in HPSC officeHaving shot into the limelight for his association with social crusader Anna Hazare and then Arvind Kejriwal, Navin Jaihind is desperate to retain his lost political ground in Haryana, ever since he left the Aam Aadmi Party. For visibility, he made the best use of making an appearance before Panipat police when he took shankh (conch) blowers along. He also "raided" the Haryana Public Service Commission’s office in Panchkula to "purify the premises" after the ‘jobs on sale’ scam. His entry led to chaos, not because of any fear of violence but due to the apprehension that he might sprinkle gomutra (cow urine) all over the office as part of the purification ritual. Haryana minister Anil Vij finds his matchKnown for his quick wit, Haryana minister Anil Vij faced an awkward moment in a television debate with farmer unionist Rakesh Tikait when the latter said his high-brow background must account for his lack of social behaviour. Vij had asked Tikait why the farmers had not celebrated the announced repeal of agri-marketing laws with a bhangra. Tikat retorted: "Do you celebrate when a soldier dies? You go into a shock. We have lost 750 comrades, and you talk about celebrating. It’s for this reason that I say that all those studied in expensive schools lack social manners." Channi, ‘the social media star’Since Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi keeps an action-packed schedule ever since taking over, he gives sufficient material to social media content creators, both positive and negative. While the fan pages display his rustic one-liners, this opponents target him for his attempts to project self as ‘aam aadmi’ and his claims of prompt resolution of the long-pending issues of delegations who queue up to meet him at the end of the day. Taking a swipe at him, AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said it appeared that Channi didn’t even consult bureaucracy before making any promise, just to check if it was even viable.

However, four residents of Gadag – Yellosa Kode, Parashuram, Iranna and Ramesh – have been going on a padayatra each year for the past three decades, walking 115km from the Joda Maruti temple in their home district to Achanur village in Bagalkot. Walking roughly 20km each day, the four men complete their journey in a week’s time. On Sunday, these four devotees, along with 80 others, started off on their annual pilgrimage from the Joda Maruti temple.Khode, 67, the oldest of the lot, a priest at Achanur Hanuman temple in Vaddarageri Oni, said that the padayatra he was going on this year was his 35th. “Devotees of Hanuman believe that their wishes will come true if they undertake the padayatra to the God’s temple in Achanur, and in many cases, their prayers have been answered. We plan our journey in Karthika Masa, and inform the public about it as well. Anybody can join us. Along the way, we sleep at different places, and reach Achanur on the sixth day. We walk on barefoot, and for us, this padayatra is akin to meditation, which improves both our physical and mental health,” Khode told TOI.His fellow traveller Parashuram Ramagiri, 50, who is also a priest officiating at the Durga Devi temple on the premises of the DC Mill in Gadag, said that the padayatra, which he had completed 31 times and was setting out for the 32nd time, had made him a better human being. “We make a plan for our padayatra, and decide on places to spend the night at different places. We perform puja at the Achanur temple, and return by train,” he said.Iranna Kumbar, 53, a hamali or porter at a grain market in Gadag district, is eager to set out on the padayatra for the 31st time. On the impact this annual ritual had on his life, Iranna said that it had helped wean him off bad habits. “It has helped me stay away from alcohol. I have been completely sober for the past six years. Devotees in villages along the route are preparing food for us, and providing accommodation voluntarily,” Iranna said.Ramesh Kalabuagi, 45, the youngest of the lot, is a politician, who has been going on the pilgrimage for the past 25 years. “We never experience any fatigue during our walk, and we chant slogans such as ‘Achanuru Ajjana Angaara, Deshakkella Bangara’ to keep our spirits up. The four of us have been regularly undertaking this pilgrimage for the past 25 years,” he said.They are planning on reaching Achanur on December 3 this time round.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/these-four-devotees-have-been-walking-115km-to-hanuman-temple-each-year-for-three-decades/articleshow/87966824.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Prakash, 65, has conserved more than 200 medicinal plants in his small tract of land. The award has been instituted by the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare. Prakash has divided his agricultural land into different plots, and developed one of them into a nursery of medicinal plants. Hundreds of tubers and creepers have been grown there naturally. Prakash has followed the multi-crop method to replicate the Western Ghats’ forest. He has been propagating multi-tier and multi-crop agro forestry models for the past four decades. Experts have identified nearly 3,000 medicinal plants in the Western Ghats forests, particularly the ones native to the Malnad region. “Most of them were on the verge of extinction. I have tried to cultivate some of them in my land. Thirty varieties are now available in my nursery. I want to graft and develop 200 varieties which have been preserved in the farm. Me living in a forest has helped me experiment,” Prakash said, adding: “Many agriculturists have visited my farm and got inspired. I’m happy about my research on turmeric varieties. I have identified four turmeric varieties in the Western Ghats.” Ullasa M Y, assistant professor at Keladi Shivappa Nayaka University of Agriculture and Horticulture Sciences, has helped Prakash prepare a report for submission as an entry for the award. Ullasa said the progressive farmer has conserved nearly 200 varieties of medicinal plants. “He has developed 30 endangered species which are of commercial value. He grows them by following natural farming method,” the assistant professor explained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/shivamogga-farmer-conferred-award-for-conserving-endangered-medicinal-plants/articleshow/87967579.cms||---

All the southern districts in the state fared well in development indicators, according to the report. The multidimensional poverty index includes parameters like health, education, and standard of living, which includes three dimensions of health, education indicators on nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, maternal care, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, bank accounts, and assets. According to the report, just 6.62% of the population of Mandya district is below the multidimensional poverty level. There are no major industries in the district, and agriculture is a major economic activity undertaken in this region. Hassan is in third position, with 6.64% of the population below the multidimensional poverty line. Mysuru is in the fifth position, with a poverty level of 7.8%. The other districts of the region, like Kodagu (8.7%-7th place), Chikkamagalur (11.2%-12th place), Shivamogga (12.7%-15th place), and Chamarajanagar is in the 21st place with 18.2% of the population below the multidimensional poverty line, according to the report. In all these districts, the poverty level is high in rural areas. According to sociologist G K Karanth, the closer a district, town, or village is to a booming city like Bengaluru, Mysuru or Mangaluru, the greater are the prospects for prosperity and survival. The southern districts of Karnataka have fared far better in this respect, because of their proximity to the more prosperous towns and cities, than in the northern and north-eastern districts of the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/poverty-lower-in-south-karnataka-districts-states-niti-aayog-report/articleshow/87967367.cms||---

Under the umbrella of Gujarat Government Doctors Forum, faculty of the six government medical colleges linked with GMPA, doctors working with the eight medical colleges under the Gujarat Medical Education and Research Society (GMERS), the Gujarat In-Service Doctors Association, Gujarat Medical Services Class-2 Association apart from others have decided to go on strike. “We had already submitted a memorandum to both Gujarat chief minister (CM) and health minister intimating them about our pending issues and the protest plan on November 22,” said Dr Hiren Prajapati, president of GMERS Faculty Association and member of the forum. “We have informed the state government on the kind of harassment and exploitation that doctors are facing from officials of finance and health departments,” he said, adding that the bureaucrats are yet to implement resolutions that were passed by the state government. Earlier this year, medical college teachers in the state had gone on strike. It was after intervention of the then state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja that the strike had winded up. “The CM had agreed to all the basic demands for which resolutions were also passed with time-frame and deadline but the same resolutions are not being implemented,” he said. “We have also decided to take out rallies in six cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar on December 4,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/doctors-across-gujarat-to-start-protest-from-today/articleshow/87967896.cms||---

Besides pitching for six demands of farmer unions, the joint platform of CTUs and SKM will take forward the ongoing movement together for formal repeal of the four labour codes which, the trade unions believe, would affect the livelihood of workers across the country under a liberal hire and fire regime. Though the codes propose a minimum wage for workers and provide for widening social security net for them, it also gives greater flexibility to companies with less than 300 workers to hire and fire without government permission. "We will jointly and more vigorously keep on heightening our struggles to collectively voice our determined opposition to the destructive policies of the present government that go against the interests of the toiling people as well as national interest, to decisively defeat the policy regime and consciously bring about a change in the situation. That is our mission, the mission of the workers and the peasants of India," said the CTUs and SKM in a joint statement. The success of farmer unions in getting farm laws repealed has acted as a catalyst for this bigger alliance at the national level. The SKM, meanwhile, on Sunday once again urged the government to resume "dialogue with farmers" (talks), saying the Centre cannot hope to end the farmers' protests in undemocratic, unilateral ways. Referring to agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar's statement on Saturday that the decision of withdrawal of cases filed against farmers and also of compensation to kin of those who died during the movement would be taken by states, the SKM said, "Punjab already has commitments on both these issues. Given that all the other states are BJP-ruled states, and given that the agitation arose due to the anti-farmer measures of the BJP-ruled government of India, it is important that the commitment has to come with the Union government, which has to ensure that BJP-ruled states comply with the commitment." The Morcha said, "It is estimated by Haryana farmer leaders that around 48,000 farmers have been implicated in numerous police cases for peaceful protests in the past one year. Several face serious charges like sedition and attempt to murder, rioting etc. In Uttar Pradesh, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh too, cases have been filed against farmers as part of this struggle." Besides legal guarantee to MSP, the other demands of the SKM include withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Bill, scrapping of provisions of fines for stubble burning in the Commission for Air Quality Management law, withdrawal of cases against farmers registered during the protests in different states, sacking and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and compensation to kin of around 700 farmers who died during the protests and allotment of a site at Singhu Border to set up a memorial for them. All opposition parties are expected to raise these demands during the winter session of the Parliament, beginning Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/skm-and-central-trade-unions-join-hands-to-pitch-for-demands-of-farmers-and-workers/articleshow/87969945.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The man moved the tribunal seeking monetary compensation. He stated that on September 21, 2008, he had gone to a hospital in Thane city for the treatment of his wife. After treatment, they went to Court Naka and boarded a TMT bus. When they alighted from the vehicle at Lokamanya Nagar, another speeding TMT bus knocked him down from behind causing him grievous injuries, including a fracture to his right femur. After initial treatment at Thane civil hospital, he was moved to another hospital for specialised treatment, for which he incurred huge expense. A case was also registered against the TMT driver for rash and negligent driving. The victim claimed the accident occurred solely due to negligence on the part of the bus driver, and sought compensation stating he was earning Rs 10,000 at the time of the incident, and the accident had caused him permanent disability. While his claim was opposed in the tribunal, TMACT member R N Rokade directed the TMT undertaking and the insurance company to jointly and severally pay the victim a sum of Rs 2.9 lakh, along with an interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of application.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-78-year-old-man-maimed-by-tmt-bus-gets-rs-2-9l-relief/articleshow/87969947.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

The machine has not been used in years and officials also hint that it has little utility in the hospital.On November 15, the senior medical officer (SMO) wrote to the deputy medical commissioner regarding the apheresis machine, which is an amicus cell separator used in dengue treatment. The letter (a copy of which is with the TOI) stated that the apheresis machine installed at the blood bank of the civil hospital was out of order and the engineers have given Rs 10,45,746 estimate for its repair. The letter requested to either issue funds for its repair or provide a new machine.Another letter sent by the civil hospital about the breakdown of the machine said it has not been used for a long time.A civil hospital staffer, requesting anonymity, said, “This machine has not been used for years now. I don’t understand why the officers have asked for funds to get it repaired. A kit worth Rs 9,000 is required for the patient who wants to get treatment with this machine. The patients coming to the civil hospital are poor and cannot afford a Rs 9,000 kit. Besides, the patient also has to arrange for a donor on their own who should have a minimum of 2.25 lakh platelets. Due to all these factors, the apheresis machine has not been used here for a long time. Getting it repaired or replacing it with a new machine would be a waste of money.”Deputy medical commissioner Dr Surinder Singh said, “I have sent the repair estimate to the seniors in Chandigarh.” When asked why the machine has not been used in years, Dr Singh said, “Its kit is costly and patients do not go for it. Almost a decade ago, this machine was purchased, then there were only three apheresis machines in Ludhiana, one at the civil hospital and two at private hospitals. That time, patients from other districts and some from private hospitals used to come to the civil hospital to get treatment. However, gradually all private hospitals purchased the machine and its usage in the civil hospital reduced.”“Now blood, platelets and plasma are being provided free of cost at the civil hospital, therefore there is no such need for this machine,” he added. However, the authorities could not justify the need of getting it repaired when there was no usage.  What is apheresis machine? Apheresis machine receives blood removed from a patient or donor’s body and separates it into its various components like plasma, platelets, white blood cells and red blood cells.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/civil-hosp-sends-rs-10-45l-estimate-for-repair-of-cell-separator-machine/articleshow/87967590.cms||Payal Dhawan

District cane officer (DCO) Vijay Bahadur Singh said, "Action has been taken against Shamli mill, Unn mill and Thana Bhawan sugar mill." The DCO added, "We have been told that the management of these sugar mills is trying to sell sugar stock stored in the mills so that they could clear all dues of the farmers." After giving enough time to pay the dues of the farmers, three sugar mills failed to pay back, hence, district magistrate (DM) Jasjit Kaur ordered filing of cases against these mills, the DCO said. Slamming the authorities, Rajan Jawala, a local farmer whose Rs 3 lakh is still pending with Unn sugar mill, said, "We are suffering. No one is paying attention to this issue. The new crushing season is about to start but the sugar mill has failed to pay my last year's dues. So, how are we going to get the early payment for this season?" Another farmer, Deepak Kumar Sharma, said, "The Shamli sugar mill owed me Rs 4 lakh and there is no one who can give me a satisfactory answer when I would get back my money. Now, I heard that the Shamli administration has filed a case against the sugar mill." According to sources, these sugar mills had cleared Rs 833.92 crore of the outstanding Rs 1,142.96 crore till now, which is over 70% of the amount. But action is being taken for the "pending dues". DM Jasjit Kaur had recently presided over a meeting of district officers and reviewed the payment issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/3-sugar-mills-booked-for-non-payment-of-farmers-dues/articleshow/87967603.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Hubballi||Tickets booked, but trains not available; UTS app users frustrated||Hubballi: The ‘Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS)’ app launched a few years ago by the Indian Railways has been immensely beneficial for train commuters, helping them book tickets in the unreserved compartments for last-minute journeys, renewing railway passes and purchasing platform tickets, without having to wait their turn in the queue. However, following an update a few months ago, the app appears to have developed a glitch, and tickets are being booked for trains that are not available. Commuters are learning about the delay or non-availability of trains only after making the payment. The app’s failure to reflect availability of trains is making once-regular users of the app wary of turning to it now.Almatti-based contractor Chandrashekhar Palaniswamy, who has been using the app regularly for the past three years, said, “Earlier, the app provided information about trains that were available. But after the Indian Railways updated the app six or seven months ago, this option is no longer available. The app is only showing the types of trains available.”A travelling ticket examiner (TTE) in Davanagere said that, when he sought to penalise a group of passengers who had purchased tickets on the app for a passenger train, but were travelling by an express train, they pointed out that the app had booked tickets for the train that was available. “We verified their claim on the app, and brought the error to the notice of our superiors,” he said.Hubballi-based Mayur Patil, another frequent user of the app, said, “After I booked a ticket for a journey to Gadag, I was informed that there was no train for available for four hours. But the ticket is valid only for one hour. My attempts to cancel the ticket were to no avail, since the app informed me that paperless tickets could not be cancelled. I subsequently raised this on ‘Rail Madad’, but all I have been told so far is that it will be brought to the attention of a higher officer. This is an unfair trade practice, wherein we are losing money owing to lack of information.”Patil was none too pleased, when directed to another helpline number, the woman employee who spoke to him, asked why he fretting the loss of a mere Rs 40. “She started lecturing me about not ascertaining the availability of a train before booking the ticket,” Patil recalled.Many passengers have also pointed out that some TTEs are not honouring the ticket purchased on the UTS app.‘Tickets not booked for a specific train’The UTS mobile application was developed by the Centre for Railway Information Systems. Since these tickets are booked for unreserved seats, they are not specific to any train, but only the starting point and destination of the journey.

KVIC has roped in four Khadi institutions from Varanasi and Ghazipur districts in Uttar Pradesh for processing raw Pashmina wool and weaving it into the woolen luxury fabric that has huge demand world over. The four Khadi institutions are Krishak Gramodyog Vikas Sansthan, Varanasi, Shri Mahadev Khadi Gramodyog Sansthan, Ghazipur, Khadi Kambal Udyog Sansthan, Ghazipur and Gram Sewa Ashram, Ghazipur. These KVIC recognized institutions have started procurement of raw Pashmina wool from Leh-Ladakh and brought it to Delhi on November 15 for processing, which involves dehairing and converting it into roving. The rovings will be sent back for spinning to Leh where Khadi artisans, who have been provided 100 new model charkhas by the KVIC, will use them. “This move will ensure full utilization of the entire quantity of de-haired Pashmina wool and will also open new opportunities for local artisans besides availability of genuine and affordable Pashmina wool products in Varanasi,” KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena told TOI on Sunday. “KVIC will also provide online marketing support to these khadi institutions. It will be a path-breaking initiative as the production of Pashmina would be done outside J&K and Leh-Ladakh region for the first time,” he added. Pashmina weaving in Varanasi will start from January next year. As many as 20 Khadi artisans from Sewapuri Ashram in Varanasi will be given 30-day training in Pashmina weaving for which two master trainers from West Bengal have been roped in. These four Khadi institutions of Varanasi division have started processing of raw Pashmina wool in Delhi. “Nearly 200kg of Pashmina wool processed in Delhi will be supplied to artisans in Leh by the first week of December. These Leh artisans will spin the wool by December-end and then it will be brought to Varanasi for weaving,” said Sandeep Singh, secretary of Krishak Gramodyog Vikas Sansthan, Varanasi. The two master trainers from West Bengal are highly trained in making muslin which involves ultra-fine weaving that is very much like Pashmina weaving, he added. “During a meeting of KVIC chairman with the Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh R K Mathur recently, the LG informed that around 50 MT raw pashmina is produced in Leh-Ladakh each year out of which only 15MT dehaired wool is actually produced after cleaning and processing. Out of this 15MT dehaired Pashmina wool, only 500 kg is utilized in Leh-Ladakh by a few small units for manufacturing Pashmina products, which is causing loss of employment in Ladakh. The Khadi institutions of Varanasi purchased 500kg of raw Pashmina wool from Leh recently and brought it to Delhi for processing. The processing of raw Pashmina wool at Delhi was launched on November 20 by KVIC chairman. “The processed Pashmina wool would be sent back to the artisans in Leh-Ladakh. The Pashmina Raw Wool Processing Centre in Delhi will ensure round-the-year supply of Pashmina roving to the artisans in Leh-Ladakh where all activities remain suspended for six months due to extreme cold,” the chairman said. Saxena said that KVIC, after one-month training, provided 100 new model 8-spindle charkhas to local artisans of Likir, Saspol, Shakti and Leh to start spinning Pashmina wool. The four institutions from Varanasi division have adopted the artisans and have decided to pay Rs 20 per hank spinning charges. At present, artisans working on traditional charkha in Leh-Ladakh produce only 2-3 hanks of Pashmina wool per day and earn less than Rs 100 per day. But now, using the 8-spindle charkhas, they will be able to produce up to 15 hanks per day and earn Rs 300 per day. KVIC has also provided 25 high-quality 48-inch-wide looms to artisans in Leh that will minimize the effort in weaving and help produce all sizes of fabric. KVIC will provide more charkhas if the response is good and work increases.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/artisans-in-kashi-to-start-weaving-pashmina-boost-leh-ladakh-biz/articleshow/87968423.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ex-SP MLA Vijay Mishra, 6 others join BJP||Lucknow: Former SP MLA from Ghazipur, Vijay Mishra, who was a minister in Akhilesh government defected to BJP along with supporters on Sunday, just days after sitting SP MLA from Saidpur reserved seat in Ghazipur, Subhash Pasi, joined the saffron camp. Besides Mishra, six others from BSP and Congress also joined the BJP. Mishra had won the Ghazipur seat in 2012, defeating BSP’s Raj Kumar by a wispy margin of less than 250 votes. He then switched over to BSP after Akhilesh denied him a ticket in 2017 polls. Mishra, who has significant influence over upper caste electorate in east UP, has been languishing politically for past many years. Former UP Congress Committee general secretary, Jay Narayan Tewari, also joined BJP. Tewari hails from Gorakhpur. Likewise, Manoj Diwakar, a former BSP cadre and leader of UP Dhobi Mahasabha, too switched over to BJP. Another BSP member, Jagdev Kureel, a Jatav, too joined the saffron brigade. Among other inductions included former IAS officer Ashok Kumar Singh, Ram Shiromani Shukla, former MLA from Pratapgarh and a businessman, Akhilesh Verma.UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said, leaders of the various political outfits have joined BJP influenced by the nationalistic and developmental agenda of PM Narendra Modi’s government and CM Yogi Adityanath-led UP government. He, however, reiterated that induction does not imply they are getting a ticket in their constituencies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ex-sp-mla-vijay-mishra-6-others-join-bjp/articleshow/87969196.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Varanasi||New sugar mill to be set up in Deoria: CM||Gorakhpur: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath slammed the previous Samajwadi Party and BSP governments for selling off sugar factories in the state and announced that a new sugar mill will be set up in Deoria. “Deoria, which was once known as the sugar bowl, will soon get a sugar mill,” said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while inaugurating and laying foundation of 412 development projects worth Rs 200 crore 92 lakh at Raghuraj Inter College in Bahiyari Baghel, Deoria, on Sunday. The government will set up a sugar mill in Deoria and officials have been asked to identify land for the purpose, the CM said. Attacking the previous governments, he said, “SP, BSP governments sold 21 sugar mills and while the BJP government is starting new ones. Deoria was once known as sugar bowl, but the previous governments did not care and hit the earnings of farmers and deprived youth of employment opportunities by selling sugar mills,” he added. “I don’t understand how they can still stand in front of you and say shamelessly that they will bring development. I want to ask them what they were doing when they had the time,” said Yogi. “They were busy in their family and family feuds. They have all the relations of Mahabharata, including mama, chacha, bhatija, bua who used to rob the rights of people. Before 2017, ration was grabbed by mafia, but now it is reaching the poor without any discrimination. Antyodaya card holders will get free ration till Holi. It will include one kg each, dal, oil, sugar and salt along with wheat and rice and Grihasthi card holder will also get one kg each of dal, oil and salt,” the CM added. Terming the opposition as supporters of rioters and mafia, the CM said festivals are celebrated peacefully now. “Riots were common during Durga Puja and the houses of poor were burnt. Now, when the illegal properties of mafia are being bulldozed, the opposition parties are opposing it. Mafia is like Bhasmasur and those who gave them shelter are Mahabhasmasurs,” he said, and warned people not to get trapped by the opposition again. Recalling that the medical college in the name of Maharshi Devraha Baba was inaugurated by Prime Minister Nadrendra Modi on October 25, the CM said, “In 70 years after independence, Uttar Pradesh got only 12 medical colleges, but in last five years, our government is establishing 33 medical colleges,” he said. Yogi appealed people to get vaccinated against Covid and said, “By tomorrow, 16 crore people in the state will be vaccinated, which is more than the population of many countries.” “During Covid pandemic wave, Babua-Bua, Chacha-Bhatija, Bhai-behan were in home isolation. They would have run away if Covid had struck during their regime. The Centre and governments as well as BJP workers were working during Covid and I was moving across the state to help people,” he said. The development in the state is due to the power of the double engine government, said Yogi and appealed to people to vote for BJP in the forthcoming election.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/new-sugar-mill-to-be-set-up-in-deoria-cm/articleshow/87968424.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Farm outreach: UP drive to bring max farmers under flagship crop insurance scheme||Lucknow: Less than a fortnight after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government’s decision to annul the three contentious farm laws, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP is set to mobilize the farming community by launching a statewide drive from December 1 to bring maximum number of farmers under the Central crop insurance scheme — Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). The flagship scheme entails coverage and financial support to farmers in the event of crop failure due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. The move comes close on the heels of the start of the winter session of parliament from Monday, when the Centre is likely to move a bill to repeal the three farm laws. The week-long drive will be carried out by the UP government in coordination with the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare (MoA&FW) and financial institutions, including commercial banks and regional rural banks. This marks the ruling BJP’s attempt to stem the simmering disquiet among farmers, who threaten to continue the stir till their demands, including a legal guarantee for MSP and sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son Ashish is an accused in Lakhimpur violence, are met. As per agriculture department records, updated till August 31, Uttar Pradesh in 2019-20 had a total cultivable area of more than 35.5 lakh hectares with around 47lakh farmers insured under PMFBY. This, in effect, translated into Rs 16,743 crore insured sum. Records show UP was way behind Maharashtra and Rajasthan, where 1.45 crore and 85 lakh farmers respectively, have been insured under PMFBY. In fact, UP accounted for just over 7% of 6.12 crore farmers insured under the scheme nationally. The state agriculture department has decided to carry out the campaign in 75 developmental blocks across 75 districts, where number of insured farmers are on a lower side. In a communique sent to district magistrates, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said, emphasis should be laid on aspirational districts and districts with a substantial population of Scheduled Tribes. The areas where the scheme is proposed to be taken up rigorously include Sewapuri in PM Modi’s constituency of Varanasi; Campierganj block in CM Yogi’s political backyard of Gorakhpur and Pathar Deva assembly seat of UP agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi. Besides, an awareness drive vis-a-vis PMFBY is proposed to be scaled up in Nawabganj (Bahraich), Sirsiya (Shrawasti), Utraula (Balrampur), Lotan (Siddharthnagar), Vijaipur (Fatehpur), Ramnagar (Chitrakoot), Chatra (Sonbhadra) and Naugarh (Chandauli). Special vehicles to spread awareness in different districts about the scheme will be flagged off by Shahi from Lucknow on December 1. Plans are also afoot to stream the success stories of farmers in 75 blocks on social media, including Twitter and Facebook. The state government will also use the audio-visual media to air special programmes on the scheme..||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/farm-outreach-up-drive-to-bring-max-farmers-under-flagship-crop-insurance-scheme/articleshow/87969191.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Delhi||Delhi: Peak power demand tipped to be highest in 3 winters, discoms confident of meeting it||NEW DELHI: With winter setting in, discoms expect Delhi’s peak power demand to go up to 5,400 MW this season, surpassing the peak winter demand of both 2019 and 2020. Discoms say that they are geared up to meet the demand and ensure reliable supply. Last year, the winter power demand had peaked at 5,021 MW, which was lower than the peak power demand of 5,343 MW in 2019. This winter, however, the peak power demand is expected to reach 5,400 MW. In January this year, the demand for electricity went up due to cold wave conditions and on 23 days in the month, the peak power demand was higher than the corresponding days in January 2020. On January 1, the peak power demand of the capital had shot up and breached the 5,000 MW mark for the first time in the previous season as the mercury plummeted to 1.1 degree Celsius, the lowest till then. In the winter of 2019-2020, the power demand had peaked at 5,343 MW and the power discoms had expected the figure to breach 5,400 MW in 2020-21 but that figure wasn’t reached. The peak power demand recorded in the winter of 2015-16 was 4,125 MW, which increased to 4,168 MW in the next winter and to 4,511 MW after that but dipped to 4,472 MW in the winter of 2018-19. A BSES spokesperson said that the backbone of the discoms’ power supply arrangements during the winter months included long-term agreements from power plants, including hydro and Delhi-based gas fuelled generating stations. Additionally, BSES is also receiving more than 440 MW of solar power, 250 MW of wind power, 25 MW from waste-to-energy, etc. “Apart from these, BSES discoms are using avenues like banking, reserve shutdown, power exchange and ensuring sufficient spinning reserves to dispose of surplus power as well as ensuring reliable power supply, as also making arrangements to get power during summer months,” the spokesperson said. A spokesperson of Tata Power DDL said that the discom has made adequate arrangements of up to 200 MW over and above the expected peak demand. “We are also using a mix of smart technologies like Machine Learning and AI for better load forecasting to ensure a reliable power supply to our consumers,” she said. She further said that the company’s Battery Energy Storage Systems at Rohini and Rani Bagh would also support in providing continuous and reliable power to key consumers during any exigency and the company has conducted preventive and condition-based maintenance of all its critical electrical installations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/peak-power-demand-tipped-to-be-highest-in-3-winters-discoms-confident-of-meeting-it/articleshow/87968437.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Names of the remaining eight are under consideration as clearance for them is yet to come from the central leadership. Sources said the local Congress leadership was pushing hard for the presence of Kanhaiya Kumar in the city. The party feels that Kumar, who recently joined the party, is a good orator and his influence could be put to good use. “Since most voters in the city belong to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Kumar will be highly influential for them and his presence will make an effect,” a senior leader said. With the election commission only approving 10 star campaigners for political parties in the upcoming MC elections, sources in the Congress said they wanted charismatic and popular leaders. Sources in the party said that names of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat were also in the list but confirmation is awaited. “While party leaders are demanding cabinet minister of Punjab like Raja Warring, former Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and some other sitting cabinet ministers of Punjab, the final confirmation is yet to come. A few local Congress leaders have personal relations with Punjab leaders and they can call them in small programmes and gatherings,” sources said. Box: Bansal playing key role Sources said former city MP and Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal is playing a key role in this exercise. He is working hard to bring good orators and influential leaders to the city for rallies and gatherings. Bansal and Congress local president Subhash Chawla are meeting on a regular basis to take major decisions like selection of candidates, ensuring good star campaigners, election planning etc. Although the party’s Chandigarh in-charge is being kept in the loop, Bansal is leading this exercise.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/kanhaiya-channi-in-cong-star-campaigners-list/articleshow/87968422.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Hyderabad||Long and short of it: DSP aspirants say 23-year-old height criteria must be tweaked||HYDERABAD: Amid anticipation that Telangana government will issue a notification to fill deputy superintendent of police (DSP) posts, unemployed youth aspiring to become DSPs have started petitioning ministers and senior IPS officers seeking amendment of height criteria. They also demanded parity with the criteria laid out for IPS aspirants who take UPSC exam and criteria followed by other states. The unemployed youth, who are planning to take the TS Public Service Commission (TSPSC) Group-I exam with an aim to become DSPs, want the government to relax the criteria of height from the existing 167.6 cm to 165 cm for men and from 152.5 cm to 150 cm for women. “The criteria to have a height of no less than 167.6 cm has been followed since 1998. But during our research, we found that in 20 other states in India, the height criteria followed by them for recruiting DSPs is 165 cm. Even in the UPSC, the height criteria for an IPS aspirant is 165 cm for men. We want the Telangana government to reduce the height criteria to 165 cm as it will help a large number of aspirants,” Manoj Kumar, an aspirant from the city, told TOI. Apart from petitioning home minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali, finance minister T Harish Rao, director general of police M Mahendar Reddy and IPS officers, several unemployed youth unitedly have opened multiple Twitter handles demanding the amendment. “When we brought up this issue on the disparity, some IPS officers expressed shock. When a height criteria of 165 cm is needed to become an IPS, what is the logic in having 167.6 cm for a DSP in Telangana,” an aspirant questioned. A senior official in the home department told TOI that he was unaware of the height criteria issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/long-and-short-of-it-dsp-aspirants-say-23-yr-old-height-criteria-must-be-tweaked/articleshow/87969193.cms||---

The applicant, Isanaka Vedavathi, submitted a representation to the NGT stating that the edible oil units have caused pollution. The committee was first appointed in March 2020 to ascertain the status of functioning of edible oil refinery units at Krishnapatnam. It inspected the edible oil units in October 2020 and submitted the report during December 2020. Of the seven units operating in the region, five edible oil units raised objections to the committee report. NGT in February 2021 directed the committee to go into the objections and come with their findings on that aspect. The committee convened a meeting with the edible oil units in March 2021 to understand the issues raised by them. During the meeting, the five units informed the committee members that they have upgraded the treatment units, laid effluent conveyance system and are presently fully complying with all the consent for operation conditions stipulated by APPCB. The panel inspected the five units, which filed objections to the committee report from July 29 to July 30, 2021. The panel, after ascertaining the ground level implementation of the action plan, submitted a second report during August 2021. Following the NGT order, APPCB issued directions to the edible oil units and directed the edible oil units to pay the environmental compensation to the APPCB within a week. The joint committee conducted a virtual meeting with the edible oil industries, Krishnapatnam Port area, SPSR Nellore district on October 2021.

SKM said Union minister Narendra Singh was incorrect and unreasonable in saying that with the constitution of the PM-announced committee their demand on MSP stands fulfilled. “It is patently unjustified and illogical to claim that a committee to deliberate on the issues of crop diversification, zero-budget farming, and making the MSP system more transparent and effective is about fulfilment of farmers’ demand on MSP ,” it claimed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/skm-to-wait-for-centres-response/articleshow/87969211.cms||---

I have chopped down the crops.” He said horticulture and other officers had visited the vineyard and assured him of compensation. Belagavi deputy director Mahantesh Murgod said: “We have started the inspection and we covered 3,278 hectares. Such weather leads to bad yields. We are sending all the crop damage details to the government and the farmers will get compensation of Rs 18,000 per hectare, along with insurance claims by April next year. Belagavi and other parts of north Karnataka received heavy untimely rain recently that has caused huge damage to paddy and other crops. The low yield has also triggered high prices in retail markets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/crop-ruin-hits-grape-growers-in-belagavi-govt-to-compensate-farmers/articleshow/87966829.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UPTET paper leak: CM Yogi Adityanath orders slapping of NSA,Gangster Act against accused||LUCKNOW: Taking a serious note of the paper leak of Uttar Pradesh Teacher’s Eligibility Test (UPTET), chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday directed the officials to invoke the National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangsters Act against the accused. He asked the officials to organise the examination within a month and ensure that the admit cards of candidates are accepted as their free pass to board UPSRTC buses for being ferried to the examination centre. “Those who are involved in the misdeed must know that a case is being registered against them under Gangster Act and their property will be confiscated along with imposition of the National Security Act,” Yogi said, while addressing a public gathering in Deoria. “As soon as we got to know that a gang had access to the question papers, we decided to immediately call off the examination. It will be re-conducted in a transparent manner within a month. No extra fee will be charged from any examinee and the government will arrange for their free conveyance through UPSRTC buses,” the CM added. Issuing a stern warning to those who tend to vitiate the transparent recruitment process, the CM asserted: “If someone is trying to play with the future of the youth, he should be aware of the consequences. Be it a job or any test, utmost transparency must be maintained.” The CM said the state government had given government jobs to more than 4.5 lakh youths in Uttar Pradesh with full transparency and a similar process would continue in future. Taking swift action, the Special Task Force (STF) of the UP Police arrested 26 suspects – 16 from Prayagraj, four from Lucknow, three from Shamli, one each from Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar and Kaushambi. “The Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Board (UPBEB) will conduct the UPTET again within a month. The government will bear the entire expenditure of the re-examination,” said additional chief secretary, UPBEB, Deepak Kumar. UPBEB has notified that candidates will not have to pay any fee again. The fresh date for the examination will be notified in due course of time.

Hundreds of books have been added to the jail’s existing library, covering genres such as management, science, motivation and literature. Nitin Vaychal, superintendent of the Arthur Road jail, said the NGO had recently helped them vaccinate the inmates as well. The books were donated by citizens to Project Mumbai, which in turn took them to the jail. “Many citizens have donated books which are in good condition. There is an encyclopedia, books in English and Marathi, books written by management gurus etc.” said Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai. The jail currently houses more than 2,500 prisoners. “We keep the books in the library and also send them to different barracks where inmates borrow them and return after reading,” said a jail source. “The library is a source of knowledge and while reading inspirational books, inmates also get positive feelings about life,” said Joshi. A senior jail official said they were planning to get more books after receiving good response from readers. “Some prisoners bring books into jail. We find many of them are interested in reading. Many inmates also read novels and story books in different languages. We have to improve the condition of libraries in various jails and want to get more books,” said the jail official. Joshi said that they are also starting a toy library for the children of inmates at the Byculla women’s prison. “We are bringing toys to Byculla jail and there are volumes of Amar Chitra Katha also for the children there,” he said. Joshi added, “This initiative was a combination of citizen volunteerism through Project Mumbai in a different way as many people stepped out and purchased books and toys, knowing they would be used by us to set up a library in the prisons. It validates our belief in Mumbai as India’s kindness capital.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-inmates-get-into-jails-good-books-donated-by-ngo/articleshow/87969988.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Lucknow||Raja Bhaiya, who? asks Akhilesh in Raghuraj borough||Lucknow: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav who was on a visit to Pratapgarh on Sunday, disrupted talks of his party joining hands with Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya when he tried to portray as if he did not know who the latter was. “Ye kaun hain? Kin ka naam le rahe ho aap? Ye kaun hain? (Who is he? Who are you talking about?)” Akhilesh said when asked by the media why was he unhappy with Raja Bhaiya. Recently speculations of Raja Bhaiya reaching out to SP ahead of the UP polls had gained momentum when the Kunda MLA called on SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav at the latter’s residence. Talking to TOI, Raja Bhaiya had, however, completely dismissed such talks. Responding to a specific query, Raja Bhiaya had said his party Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) was open to alliance politics. The six-time independent MLA Raja Bhaiya was seen close to SP and was a minister in the Akhilesh cabinet. However, despite promising to vote in favour of Samajwadi Party in the Rajya Sabha elections held in 2018, Raja Bhaiya went for the BJP candidate on grounds that his vote would have helped his bete noire Mayawati as SP was backing a BSP canidate for the sake of forming an anti-BJP grand alliance. Later, SP entered into an alliance with BSP, which further alienated Raj Bhaiya from Akhilesh Akhikesh was so miffed with this move of Raja Bhaiya that he deleted a tweet in which he had thanked Raja Bhaiya a day before for vouching his support to SP. Addressing a public meeting in Pratapgarh as a part of the campaign for Lok Sabha polls, Akhilesh had announced that SP will have no association whatsoever with Raja Bhiaya in future as he had “misled” the SP chief. Addressing another gathering, Raja Bhaiya shot back saying that he never wanted to go back to SP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/raja-bhaiya-who-asks-akhilesh-in-raghuraj-borough/articleshow/87969216.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Delhi: Winter’s here, IGI plans to cut through the fog||NEW DELHI: Delhi airport operator DIAL on Sunday said it was all geared up to deal with the winter fog in the capital, which may disrupt flight operations from mid-December — like it does every year. While a ceilometer is installed at the airport to ascertain the fog depth in advance, air traffic controllers, airlines, ground handlers, the meteorological department and the airport staff are working together to ensure that all terminals are prepared to deal with the situation. But with the airport operator already struggling to maintain social distancing amid the increased passenger traffic, which according to the data accessed by TOI has touched 70% of the pre-pandemic days, the dense winter fog is likely to pose much bigger challenges. The DIAL spokesperson said: “Amid all the challenges, preparations like efficiently putting in place Delhi airport’s collaborative decision-making cell, which has representatives of the air traffic control, domestic airlines and DIAL, will be done timely.” The airport is well equipped to handle operations safely during the periods of poor visibility, according to Airports Authority of India spokesperson JB Singh. “The runways are equipped with low-visibility procedure so that flights can take off and land efficiently,” added Singh. Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) is a set of procedures established at an aerodrome in support of CAT-II/III approaches and landings and of takeoffs with runway visual range below 550 meters. With the help of the procedure, which is used 30 minutes before an aircraft takes off or lands during poor weather conditions, flights are able to operate with ease. “To ensure the comfort requirements of the recently increased number of passengers at IGI during instances of flight disruptions and cancellations and in view of the Covid norms for social distancing, the number of chairs and recliners is being increased,” the DIAL spokesperson added. While Air India claimed that their pilots have received special training to operate aircraft in episodes of low visibility due to fog, Singh said the training to make pilots CAT-III-B-compatible was expensive and only a few pilots had undergone it. CAT-III-B is a special training provided to pilots in India to operate flights during low visibility. “When runway visibility range drops below 50 metres, flight operation to the airport is closed and such trained pilots are supposed to divert the flight to another airport. However, the flight can take off and land with zero visibility from the support of low-visibility procedure, but the same is not the case with the runway visual range,” said Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/winters-here-igi-plans-to-cut-through-the-fog/articleshow/87968448.cms||Zumbish
---||Chandigarh||Market intervention better suited to ease farmers’ marketing concerns||CHANDIGARH: Even as the protesting farm organisations are demanding a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP), the experts and the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP) have been laying stress on market intervention by the government to offer a level-playing field to the farmers for sale of their produce. In its ‘Price Policy for Rabi Crops: The Marketing Season 2022-23’, the CACP has recommended that “to encourage diversification towards oilseeds and pulses, farmers need to be assured of remunerative price for pulses and oilseeds through effective implementation of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS)”. To ensure remunerative prices to farmers, the Union government had launched an umbrella scheme, Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan in September 2018. The scheme has three components — Price Support Scheme (PSS), PDPS and a pilot of PPSS — in addition to existing schemes of the department of food and public distribution for procurement of paddy, wheat and nutri-cereals/coarse grains, cotton and jute. In its 2022-23 rabi price policy, the CACP has observed, “Although PSS has made remarkable progress in terms of procurement of pulses and oilseeds in the last few years, PDPS and PPSS need to ameliorate their performance and reach. Moreover, unlike cereal crops where active procurement by the public agencies is in force, for oilseeds there are limited procurement operations and also in the long run enhancing public procurement will not be tenable unless sufficient private players are allowed to participate in procurement of oilseeds. For effective involvement of private entities, efforts must be made to persuade states to implement PDPS and PPSS earnestly thereby opening a channel for smooth procurement of oilseeds in a sustainable manner.” Noted agriculture economist Professor P S Rangi, who has worked with the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, and Punjab State Agricultural Marketing Board, said it may not be feasible to offer the MSP on all crops but market interventions PSS and PDPS can help farmers offset their losses. “Market intervention by the government can set a benchmark price, which can be the lowest rate at which various players buy the farm produce,” said Prof Rangi, who was also the marketing consultant with the Punjab State Farmers and Farm Workers Commission. Professor Sukhpal Singh of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, said market intervention is needed for crops not covered under the MSP regime. “The state governments have to take lead in market intervention, you can’t look up to the Centre all the time. The state governments, in particular Punjab, have not done enough in this regard. That is why the demand for MSP has come up,” said Prof Singh, who is the chairperson of the IIM Ahmedabad’s Centre for Management in Agriculture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mkt-intervention-better-suited-to-ease-farmers-marketing-concerns/articleshow/87969238.cms||Ikhhlaq Singh Aujla
---||Lucknow||Shivpal Yadav meets Azam Khan in jail, says SP family should unite for polls||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav’s estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav, who is heading a separate political outfit Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), on Sunday called on senior SP leader Azam Khan in Sitapur jail. Talking to reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Azam, Shivpal said the entire ‘Samajwadi pariwar’ should unitedly go to the polls. Shivpal’s meeting with Azam, the Muslim face of SP who is in jail since February 2020, comes a month after the PSP-L chief offered him to join his party while addressing a public meeting in Rampur, the hometown of Azam Khan. Once seen as one of the top five leaders of SP, Azam too had earlier signalled that he was not happy with the SP leadership. However, Akhilesh visited Sitapur jail to meet Azam. Thereafter, senior leaders Ram Govind Chaudhary and Ahmed Hasan, leader of the opposition in the state assembly and council, respectively, met Azam in jail. Talking to media persons, Shivpal lambasted the BJP for its dictatorial attitude towards people. “It is dictatorship. The government is not listening to anyone,” he said. Asked about the possibilities of his party siding with the SP in the 2022 polls, Shivpal said everything would be made public at the right time. “Ye ranneeti ka hissa hota hai (This is a part of strategy),” Shivpal said, when asked about the silence over his party’s alliance with the Samajwadi Party and outcome of his telephonic conversations with Akhilesh. Responding to a question about his approach towards 2022 assembly polls, Shivpal said: “Chunav ke baare mein yehi hai ki sab log ek ho jao… poora Samajwadi pariwar ek ho jaye… aur ek hokar chunav ladein (I would say the entire Samajwadi family should unite and then go to the polls).” Shivpal had earlier announced that Samajwadi Party would be his first preference in terms of going for an alliance ahead of the elections, but also pointed out that despite his calls, Akhilesh had not responded positively. Later, responding to a media query at a press conference, Akhilesh said he had spoken to ‘chacha ji’ on phone and assured senior members of the Yadav clan that Shivpal and his people would be “duly honoured” in the elections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/shivpal-meets-azam-in-jail-says-sp-family-should-unite-for-polls/articleshow/87969219.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

He said paper leaks not only leave the already disillusioned unemployed youth frustrated but also affect them financially. “This is not happening for the first time under this government. Papers leak and withholding of results are the new normal. How was the paper leaked in the first place without the involvement of the government machinery? Such incidents show that corruption is at its peak in education and related sectors. Perpetrators of the crime have no fear of law or police,” Akhilesh said. President of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L), Shivpal Yadav, also targeted the BJP government for the paper leak. “This is the third time under this government that such a crime has happened. More than the paper leak, it is the inconvenience caused to lakhs of students who have to brave the cold and spend the night at bus stations and railway stations to reach their examination centres,” Shivpal told media persons during his Sitapur visit on Sunday afternoon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/uptet-paper-leak-smacks-oflarge-scale-corruption-akhilesh/articleshow/87969224.cms||---

This was the highest number of signal-jumpers recorded in a single month so far, this year police said. On an average, around 1,000 motorists are booked for this offence, police said. Despite constant action, there is no let up in the number of offenders, police said, adding that violators often cause traffic snarls, and accidents in worst-case scenarios. From the beginning of January to the end of October, the police have challaned over 12,000 motorists. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Seetaram Gaikwad said they were continuously taking action against motorists caught breaking rules. “At the same time, we are also raising awareness among the general public about following traffic rules,” he said. “Following traffic rules is essential to preventing road accidents. However, I have observed that many a time, traffic police are taking action against bikers without helmets, allowing other vehicles to jump signals,” Sanjay Dhumne of Nashik Road said. Many motorists said that some traffic signals in the city, such as the one near the multiplex at Bodhalenagar, is seen operating beyond 11pm and that it makes no sense to follow the signal when the junction is free of vehicles. Motorists also complained about too many road signals within a stretch of a kilometre or two. Senior railway officials from the Bhusawal division said that they were considering starting an extra window given the increase in the number of travellers. The existing staff could be redistributed to man the fourth counter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-city-2110-booked-for-jumping-signals-in-oct/articleshow/87966866.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Lucknow||Int’l flyers landing in city to undergo 8-day mandatory home quarantine||Lucknow: All the international travellers coming to Lucknow from Monday onward will have to quarantine themselves at home for eight days. Furthermore, all international and domestic passengers arriving at the Chaudhary Charan Singh airport will have to undergo mandatory but free RT-PCR testing now. Domestic passengers will be screened first and will be tested if found symptomatic for Covid-19 infection. Besides, random sampling among domestic passengers will be done at the airport. These orders were issued by district magistrate Abhishek Prakash on Sunday to check the spread of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, which has been declared a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation. The DM said that the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) will constantly remain in touch with these travellers through phone calls during the isolation period. After eight days, these travellers will be tested again through the RT-PCR method. The quarantine period will be over, if the test report comes negative, but in case of a positive result, they will either be hospitalised or will have to be in home isolation for 10 more days. Chief Medical Officer Dr Manoj Agarwal said that health department teams will also visit houses of those in self isolation to check whether they are following the norm or not. The DM order also said that all the flyers, both domestic and international, will have to declare their 15-day travel history at the airport. "The names, address and phone numbers of all the travellers will also be noted at the airport itself so that ICCC can keep track of their status in future," he said. The DM said that about 1,800 international and 4,500 domestic travellers arrive daily at the airport. These travellers come from different places, including Mumbai, Hyderabad, Goa, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Dubai, Sharjah, Muscat, Abu Dhabi, Jordan, Kuwait and Jeddah. Samples of those testing positive, domestic or international travellers, will be sent for genome sequencing. All major hospitals in the city have been asked by the health department to get the RT-PCR test done of all the patients who have recent international travel history. Meanwhile, five UP cities have been put on high alert against the new strain of Covid-19. These are Agra, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Lucknow and Kanpur. An official spokesperson said: “While there is no need to panic, adherence to Covid protocols is required. State surveillance officer Vikasendu Agarwal said meeting has been held with health officials and experts of 75 districts of the state. “Guidelines have been issued by the state government to ensure thorough screening of Travelers who have returned from abroad within 14 days,” he said. BOX 83 active Covid cases Meanwhile, the active Covid case load dropped to 83 on Sunday even as nine persons tested positive to the infection while an equal number of persons recovered from the infection. Speaking about the progress of vaccination, health officials said over 15.90 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/intl-flyers-landing-in-city-to-undergo-8-day-mandatory-home-quarantine/articleshow/87969244.cms||---

Chairing a meeting with the health department officials to review Covid-19 situation, the CM asked them to make arrangements and ensure sufficient stock of medicines in hospitals to meet the challenges which might be posed by the new variant. The CM also directed the officials to maintain a special vigil on people arriving in Bihar from other countries and quick test of samples if anybody showed symptoms. Dr Subramanium, the WHO representative in Bihar, gave detailed information about the new variant of Covid at the review meeting. Quoting latest reports, he informed the CM about spread of the new variant in different countries, its infection capacity and impact as well as the opinions of experts. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit told the CM that the state’s health department was fully alert over the new variant. Highlighting the importance of vaccination in checking further spread of Covid-19, Nitish asked the officials to ensure second dose vaccination of all those who had taken their first dose. The CM asked the officials to launch special drives from time to time to ensure that no person is left out from vaccination. The CM said state health headquarters should monitor all those districts where ratio of vaccination and Covid-19 test is comparatively low. “People should be made aware of the importance of test and vaccination through propaganda campaigns,” he said. Nitish also called upon people to maintain alertness and follow Covid protocols till the infection is fully controlled. Earlier Amrit made a detailed presentation before the CM over the latest position of Covid-19 in the state, district-wise vaccination and current status of tests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nitish-asks-officials-to-be-on-guard/articleshow/87967259.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi: CM Arvind Kejriwal fast-tracks 34 NDMC proposals||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday directed officials to ensure that the benefits of free 20KL monthly water supply scheme reach the residents of multi-storey residential complexes in New Delhi Municipal Council areas. A meeting of the council was held on Sunday in which NDMC chairman Dharmendra was also present. During the meeting, 34 long-pending proposals were approved, including permission to the layout plan for the redevelopment of Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar and Sarojini Nagar. A decision was taken to give every house in BK Dutt Colony free water connection and benefits of the free water scheme in addition to the waiving of metering charges amounting to Rs 7,500. Right now, these residents are deprived of the scheme’s benefits because of the complexity of tracing water and sewerage connections passing under the rows of houses. “New water pipelines were laid out in the area about four years ago so that the connections could be given from scratch, but a lot of residents still hadn’t taken connections. The major reason behind this was the connection charges amounting to Rs 7,500,” said the chief minister in a press release. “Residents will only need to submit their ID proof and electricity bill. The ID can be of any address to help as a proof whereas the electricity bill will automatically verify the address and ease things out,” he added. An NDMC official said that societies built in East Kidwai Nagar, New Moti Bagh and other colonies, which were functioning on a bulk water supply model, were also likely to benefit from the scheme. Kejriwal directed officials to eliminate the problems of the residents of these societies at the earliest. “The residents did not have any end-user point water meters. This led to a situation where they could not get benefits of the 20 KL free water scheme. The officials suggested that the water meter be installed near the outlet so that water can be measured and the problem of the residents solved,” stated the press release. Mechanical sweeping has been approved at places such as Connaught Place, Hanuman Mandir and Baba Kharak Singh Marg, among others. Kejriwal said that these places are famous all over the country and visited by lakhs of people every day. “The mechanical sweeping can be an effective option to fix the cleaning system. We have to ensure that the area gets cleaned as per the best international standards,” he said. The issue of pay scale arrears of NDMC employees was also discussed. The CM took note of the employees’ grievances and assured that a meeting with all stakeholders and employee unions would be held soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cm-fast-tracks-34-ndmc-proposals/articleshow/87968465.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Caution advised as new Covid strain threat looms large||CHANDIGARH: Masks are protective for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, especially when a new Covid strain -- Omicron has emerged, feel PGI immunologists but many residents have turned negligent about masks. “There are chances that we might go back to square one. Data of genome sequence of the variant suggests that it is highly transmissible. It has over 30 mutations, which were only two in the Delta variant,” said Prof Sunil Arora, immunologist, PGI. He added, “There are ongoing studies to see if the variant will escape immunity produced by vaccines or produced by natural antibodies.” Prof Arora explained that it is natural for viruses to mutate in the process to make them fit for survival. “But if there is vaccination, mutant variants are not produced as there is hardly any replication of the virus. Those who have not taken the second dose must realise the danger and get themselves the second jab. There have been studies which have seen that the first dose offered 48% efficacy while complete dose produced 61% protection.” He also warned people against travelling by public transport and asked them to avoid crowded places. What epidemiologists recommend now is strict compliance with Covid appropriate behaviour. “Till it is known how virulent this strain will be, we need to wear masks and observe social distancing whether we are vaccinated or not,” said a public health expert. With the global alert of Omicron, the city has started to enhance testing. “Testing gives an indication of the trend. Presently, we are doing about 1,500 cases and increase will indicate how positivity rate is progressing. Testing all persons in OPD, whether local or outside, will give better indication. If situation demands in due course, we may go for area-wise mass testing,” said UT health secretary Yashpal Garg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/experts-advise-caution-as-new-strain-covid-threat-looms/articleshow/87968459.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Allahabad||Over 3.60 lakh eligible recipients covered in week long vax drive||Prayagraj: Over 3.60 lakh eligible recipients were covered under the week long mega vaccination drive in Sangam City. Interestingly, eligible recipients living in brick kiln centres, unapproachable villages and far flung areas were covered. The drive started from November 22, taken up in all 20 blocks of the district, ended on November 27. While ramping up vaccination drive, health officials claimed to have focused to cover all rural areas and roped in hundreds of teams of CHOs (Community Health Officer) and ANMs (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) separately with an aim to administer at least first dose in five gram panchayats of all 20 blocks each that witnessed lowest vaccination. The health teams had covered miles of distance on foot to enter far flung villages and motivated over 300 families to take jabs who had earlier refused to take vaccine. With this, as many as 43,96,056 doses have been given to eligible recipients inPrayagraj district including 31,79,948 of first dose and 12,16,108 of seconddose. District Immunization Officer (DIO) andAdditional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr. Teerath Lal told TOI that, “We have covered a total of 3,60,983 eligible recipients under the six days mega vax drive in the district”. He added,“On November 22 (51,487), November 23(57,964), November 24 (53,296), November 25 (59,815), November 26 (60,591) and November 27 (60,953) recipients were given either first or second doses.” Dr. Lal further added that health teams have worked on a micro plan, including formation of vaccination teams, survey of left recipients, public mobilization, routine monitoring, role and responsibilities of the vigilance committees to take up vaccination in rural belt of the district and yielded the desired results. He, however, claimed that health teams for the first time were successful in motivating resistant families for vaccination, and eligible recipients of over 300 such families were given jabs. Senior Medical officer (SMO) Dr Anupam Dwivedi, however, said that ground health workers – ANMs and ASHAs- had played a major role to cover left recipients in far flung villages as they visited each and every house in blocks. The health teams had covered the schedule plan to cover left recipients after finding out the details of the recipients who were earlier not vaccinated. Till now, as many as 43,96,056 doses were given so far, including 22,96,506 menand 20,97,656 women (either first or both doses), in the Prayagraj district. Moreover, the four weeks of this month has also witnessed active participation from women for vaccination and this was aptly proved by the facts that out of 8,02,407 doses given between November 1-27, as many as 4,24,069 women recipients received the doses, while the number of male counterparts was restricted to 3,78,060. Officials of the district health department have set a target to administer Covid-19 vaccine to around 45.16 lakh beneficiaries, including 33 lakh recipients aged between 18-44 years, and 12.10 lakh beneficiaries aged over 45 years. Officials claimed that over 70 percent of targeted recipients of all age groups were atleast given first dose, while 27 percent of targeted recipients are fully vaccinated till now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/over-3-60-lakh-eligible-recipients-covered-in-week-long-vax-drive/articleshow/87968463.cms||---

This move comes as a relief to commuters and residents of Nashik Road, who frequently use the highway stretch. The work on 2.5km stretch of the highway has been pending for several years. This forced Nashik Road commuters to use a very narrow road that witnessed heavy bus, truck, and cars traffic. There also have been number of accidents on this road.The work of widening the highway (NH 50) from Sinnar Phata to Sinnar began in 2015, with a completion deadline of 2017.After 80% of the work was completed, a toll plaza at Shinde village became operational in November 2017. However, the stretch between Nashik Road and Darna river was left untouched as an activist had moved Bombay HC against cutting of trees along the highway for the purpose of widening.However the HC allowed the trees to be cut in an order in October 2018, but the work was delayed for a number of reasons. Over the past year, work on the stretch had progressed at a snail’s pace. But work has gained momentum over the past few days and is now expected to be completed by the next monsoon. A large number of residential colonies have come up along the 2.5km stretch in the past few years.The existing road will be converted into a four-lane thoroughfare with a 5.5m median and service roads. “The construction would be over by January-end and that motorists could start using the highway from February,” said officials.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/pending-road-work-near-sinnar-phata-starts/articleshow/87966874.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Communal rift in Amravati puts the lens on Mumbai-based Raza Academy||MUMBAI: Visiting violence-torn Amravati recently, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis demanded “a ban” on Raza Academy and dared the Maha Vikas Aghadi regime to act against it.“Everyone knows which party's A and B team Raza Academy is. You should check who is in pictures with Raza Academy's people,” he said. The Academy’s members have been seen in pictures with Shiv Sena and Congress leaders. Mumbai-headquartered Raza Academy, a hardline outfit espousing Sunni Islam, called for a bandh on November 12 to protest alleged anti-minority violence in Tripura. The Academy’s founder-general secretary, Saeed Noorie, claimed the bandh was meant to be voluntary and remained largely peaceful across the state, except in Malegaon and Amravati where shops were burnt and property damaged. “There is no statement, audio or video clip to prove we asked people to hold demonstrations or rallies. We told people not to force anyone to shut his establishment. We don’t know who were these miscreants who created trouble,” said Noorie. However, the Academy’s role in the controversy remains under scrutiny. This is not the first time the Academy has hit the headlines. On August 11, 2012, when a little-known Kurla-based organisation Madinatul Ilm organised a meet at Azad Maidan to protest anti-minority violence against Muslims in Myanmar and Assam, Noorie was among Muslim clerics on the stage addressing a restive audience. After the meeting, rioting broke out, two people were killed and 63 injured, many of them police personnel . Police said the riots cost Rs 2.74 crore in damage to public and private property, and vowed to recover it from the rioters. Noorie was questioned; the case drags on. “None of the 17 clerics the cops called for questioning were found involved in instigating the rioters. There were some outsiders who created trouble,” Noorie told TOI. Founded in 1978 as a publishing house to promote books penned by 19th-century scholar Imam Ahmad Raza Khan, Raza Academy came into focus in the 1980s when it campaigned against a plan to demolish the green dome of the mausoleum of Prophet Muhammad in Medina. The demolition didn’t happen but the Academy found sizable traction. Since then it has cast itself as a defender of Shariat rules and as an outfit active in opposing what it sees as "anti-Muslim" actions.  To mark the demolition of Babri Masjid, it denounces the act annually by calling out an azaan at four places in the Mohammed Ali Road area at 3.45 pm on December 6. Over the years, it has broadened its role against what it sees as liberal deviations within the faith. From opposing Bangladesh-born writer Taslima Nasreen’s visits to India to A R Rahman’s compositions for celebrated Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi’s magnum opus on the Prophet’s life, Raza Akademy has played to ultra-orthodox sentiment. Noorie even opposed the appointment of a woman as deputy CEO of Haj Committee of India a few years ago. However, other community leaders backed her, disregarding the Academy's letter to the Centre to keep Haj affairs "clean of women."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/communal-rift-in-amravati-puts-the-lens-on-mumbai-based-raza-academy/articleshow/87969986.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

But the people resolved to restore the river,” he said. Terming it as “Sabka prayas” (collective effort), the PM termed rejuvenation of Noon river as a brilliant example of “people’s will doing wonders”. During his ‘Mann ki Baat’ session on June 28 last year, the PM had lauded the UP government for rejuvenation of river Kalyani in Barabanki. A state government spokesperson said dozens of rivers have been revitalised since 2018 as part of its vision to protect the environment. In 2018-19, the government rejuvenated six rivers, namely Aril, Mandakini, Karnavati, Varuna, Morva and Gomti, spanning 94.48 kilometres under MGNREGS at the cost of Rs 4.42 crore. In 2019-20, 19 rivers, spread over 26 districts and spanning 843.84 kilometres, were restored at the cost of Rs 35.23 crore. These rivers included Tedhi, Manorama, Pandu, Varuna, Sasur Khadedi, Sai, Gomti, Aril, Morwa, Mandakini, Tamsa, Nad, Karnavati, Ban, Sot, Kali Purvi, Darhi, Ishan and Budhi Ganga. The spokesperson said as many as 698 ponds and 216 drainage networks were renovated while 33.36 lakh saplings were planted as part of the river restoration project in 2019-20. In 2020-21, 25 rivers in 36 districts, namely Tedhi, Manorama, Pandu, Varuna, Sasur Khadedi, Sai, Gomti, Aril, Morwa, Mandakini, Tamsa, Nad, Karnavati, Ban, Sot, Kali Purvi, Darhi, Ishan, Budhi Ganga, Kunwar, Kalyani, Belan, Sirsa, Kivad and Utgan were restored at the cost of Rs 67.06 crore.

According to students, the firm had been serving stale food for the last one month and even after repeated complaints no action was taken. On Friday, the students refused to have dinner. On Saturday, as soon as they had meals, a number of them complained of nausea and were rushed to hospital. Upset with no action being taken to improve the food quality, girl students staged a protest by blocking the road late at night at Mohan road. “At times the same food is served to us which was cooked the day before. More often students were falling ill with complaints of diarrhea and food poisoning. Not just the quantity is less and the same menu is served everyday but stale food is being served,” said a class XI student Aditi (name changed). Another girl student Anamika said, “When no action was taken despite several incidents of students falling ill, we took to the road to raise our voice.” Meanwhile, the district administration took cognizance of the incident and an FIR was lodged by the social welfare department (under which the school comes) on the direction of DM Abhishek Prakash. District youth welfare Officer, Lucknow has been directed to investigate the case. Sub-divisional magistrate, Sadar, Pramod Pandey said, “The officials of the social work department have decided to form a committee of students for checking food quality. Meals will be served to students only after it is checked by students and teachers who have been given food inspection responsibility.” Deputy Director Social Welfare Srinivas Dwivedi said, “An FIR has been lodged on behalf of the headmistress against the catering firm. Services of the firm have been terminated with immediate effect.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/firm-supplying-food-to-para-school-booked-after-students-take-ill/articleshow/87969247.cms||---
---||Allahabad||HC denies bail to rape convict, saysthe offence demolishes social fabric||Prayagraj: The Allahabad High Court denied bail to a man convicted of committing rape on his cousin sister and observed that such offences demolish the social fabric. Rejecting the plea for bail of the appellant Devesh of Pilibhit district while hearing his criminal appeal, Justice Anil Kumar Ojha observed, “It is an admitted position that appellant and victim are siblings (cousin brother and sister). Such offence demolishes the social fabric. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, particularly the fact that the victim has supported the prosecution version, I am of the firm opinion that appellant is not entitled to be enlarged on bail.” The rape survivor had become pregnant and gave birth to a male child. While denying bail, the court took into account the admitted position of the case that appellant and rape victim are siblings and the DNA of the child matched with the appellant. Earlier, the appellant’s counsel submitted that he had been wrongly convicted and the trial court had misinterpreted the evidence on record. There was an unexplained delay of one month and twenty-four days in the lodging of the FIR and the evidence of eyewitnesses is not admissible in the eyes of law, he said. The counsel also argued that the victim was major at the time of the incident and the appellant has not committed the alleged offence. The conviction of the appellant is not justified on the basis of simply matching the DNA of the appellant with that of the victim’s son because they are relatives and since they are descendants of one ancestor and from the same family tree, they have the same DNA. The state counsel opposed the bail application saying the victim became pregnant and gave birth to a child whose DNA matched with that of the appellant. The offence committed by the appellant is heinous and his bail application should be rejected. After perusing the case records, the court in its decision dated November 10 noted that the victim had supported the prosecution story before the court and stated that she became pregnant on account of the rape and gave birth to a child.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-denies-bail-to-rape-convict-saysthe-offence-demolishes-social-fabric/articleshow/87968470.cms||---

Son of a farmer, a visually impaired MA (history) student Sanjay Verma and another BVA student from an agricultural background, Amit Kumar who suffers from polio, will be conferred gold medals during Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University convocation to be held on Monday. “My parents faced several financial challenges, especially at the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. Not just crop loss but selling crops at throwaway prices at the time of the pandemic added more to our financial struggle. My father Dhanushram didn’t give up and worked harder to bear my educational expenses,” said Sanjay who bagged two gold medals: Dr. Shakuntala Misra Memorial Gold Medal, awarded to the highest scoring visually impaired student at Post Graduate Level and Amit Mittal Memorial Gold Medal, awarded for the highest scoring differently-abled student. He lost both his eyes due to a blood clot when he was 19 years old. “I was broken, as my life had completely changed after the incident. I was blessed to have good teachers and parents who told me that there are a number of children like me who are doing great in life. Then I talked to other visually challenged persons and learned from them how to study using braille. Since I was not blind since childhood it was very tough for me as my senses were not that strong,” he said. Another son of a farmer Amit Kumar, who suffers from polio, will be conferred Rohit Mital Memorial Gold Medal for being the highest-scoring differently-abled student. “Our financial condition was not very good due to low farm income. It worsened when my mother, Shivkumari Verma, suffered a paralysis attack and I had to use my scholarship money for her treatment. My friends pooled money for me to pay my university fees. I want to become a sculptor and use the money earned for social work,” said Amit. “I was five years old when my left leg stopped working. I was very depressed and wondered why it happened to me. For me, the journey was tough, as like other students, it was not possible for me to stand for hours and make sculptures but I didn’t give up. My parents inspired me and said that one should be thankful to whatever God has given us,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/he-lost-vision-at-19-but-not-focus-this-ma-topper-is-grit-personified/articleshow/87969256.cms||---

The MSEDCL has started a drive to cut power supply to agricultural feeders. The farmers require power to run motors installed in wells and canals for irrigation. The consumption of power starts increasing once the monsoon season ends and the crops start growing. The most dominant crop in Kolhapur and Sangli district is sugar cane, which requires a large amount of water, hence, the power consumption for agriculture purposes is also high. According to MSEDCL divisional office, around 2,800 farmers from Kolhapur have cleared power dues worth Rs 1.28 crore and 2,400 farmers from Sangli district have cleared 1.24 crore worth dues. A senior MSEDCL official said, "We have launched a concession scheme for the farmers. They will get 50% amount waived if the dues are paid in a single installment. The scheme is getting a huge response from the farmers and they have time till March 31 next year to get the benefit. However, we will continue our drive to disconnect the power supply." The farmers’ outfits are angry over the drive initiated by the MSEDCL. They are protesting outside the local MSEDCL offices. The outfits are also threatening to hit the MSEDCL staffers. To avoid any injury to the staffers, the MSEDCL has decided to snap the supply to Distribution Panels (DP's). Mahesh Kharade, Sangli district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said, "The arm twisting by MSEDCL will not work. We will not pay the dues until the bills are corrected. The billing done during lockdown was inaccurate and many received bills with the inflated amount."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/farmers-in-kolhapur-sangli-clear-msedcl-dues-worth-rs-2-5-crore/articleshow/87966907.cms||---

Mandhare said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a review (via video conference) of the preparedness of the administrations across the state. The CM emphasised on increasing testing and tracking people who have the history of foreign travel. “As per information from subject experts, Omicron spreads three times faster than the Delta-plus variant. We have, therefore, decided to get full information on people who have come to Nashik recently. The data will be sourced and health screenings will be performed,” Mandhare said. The officer said that checks will be kept on people coming in to Nashik by road if they have landed at other airports in Maharashtra or elsewhere. The administration will also carry out genome sequencing of the fliers to get a clearer picture on the matter. “Since genome sequencing test results take time, we have decided not to wait for any positive case in the state. We will carry out genome sequencing of every person who flies in so that we can find out if the person was infected or not and with which variant at the earliest. This will help in taking corrective measures to contain the spread,” the collector said. Mandhare added that the state government would issue some revised guidelines on protection, prevention and preparedness and the same would be followed in totality across the district. “While testing will also be increased, as far as preparedness is concerned, we will get some guidelines that will be followed,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-collector-for-genome-sequencing-of-foreign-fliers/articleshow/87966900.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While stating that he was ready to visit schools in Punjab as well, the deputy CM added that there has been an “unprecedented revolution” in Delhi’s public education over the last six years. Sisodia also urged Singh to release a list of 250 government schools in Punjab so that the education model of both the states could be compared. “It is a matter of great pride that education is finally becoming an important issue in the politics of the country. When chief minister Arvind Kerjwal announced to fix the decaying education system in Punjab, Singh had responded saying the Punjab government has worked a lot for education in the state. We had decided to visit 10 schools, but Singh wanted 250 schools. So, we have released a list accordingly and we would urge him to release a similar list as well,” Sisodia said. Stating that Delhi government schools recorded 99.96% pass percentage in Class XII board results this year, Sisodia further said, “This year, around 500 children from Delhi government schools have qualified NEET, 500 children JEE Mains and 70 JEE Advanced. Delhi government has developed world-class infrastructure in government schools, provided leadership training to the heads of schools from institutions like IIMs and sent teachers abroad for training to provide quality education – the result of which is that Delhi government schools have become better than private schools.” “We will also visit the schools of Punjab and then debate about the education model of both the states so that the people of Punjab can understand which state’s education model is better,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sisodia-releases-list-of-250-govt-schools-calls-punjab-min-for-debate/articleshow/87968498.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Covid-19: Mask up, don’t let your guard down||COIMBATORE: People seem to have let their guard down against Covid-19 in the absence of strict enforcement of preventive measures. Pointing out that people were now caring less about wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing at public places, health officials said such a behaviour could trigger the virus spread, which had come down in recent weeks. K Parthiban, 45, a pharmacist from Ramanathapuram, said while the face mask was mandatory to travel in public transport in the city earlier, the situation had changed now. “I travel in TNSTC bus to Gandhipuram daily. There was a time when people were asked to get down from buses for not wearing a face mask. But now conductors are neither insisting on it nor do they wear one.” S Shalini, 20, a graduate student of a city college, said she was finding it odd to wear a face mask after the college hours. “None of my friends wear them while returning home from college, as the caseload has dropped. I also don’t wear face mask, as I don’t want to spoil their mood.” D Shanmugam, a schoolteacher from Keeranatham, said many parents were allowing their wards to walk on the streets without a face mask, while making them wear one before entering the school. Representative of a textile outlet at Town Hall said they had stopped asking customers to produce vaccination certificates, as they were insisting on checking the temperature instead. The district administration had made it mandatory for the people to produce vaccination certificate to gain access to places of mass gatherings from September last week, as part of its efforts to encourage people to get inoculated. Malls, theatres and shopping centres have, however, put up boards stating face mask was mandatory. “But there is no effective monitoring. In Kerala, shops are fined Rs10,000 for allowing people without face mask, while the people are fined Rs500. Such measures are needed to enforce Covid norms. Otherwise, cases will go up, forcing another lockdown,” said R Raveendran, a member of Namma Kovai NGO. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said people were of the feeling that they were safe without face masks, as there was no spike in virus spread after Diwali, when they had crowded shopping centres and recreational facilities. “Such an attitude may backfire, as the virus is still in the community. Cases may go up, if people don’t follow Covid norms.” District collector G S Sameeran said they were planning to tighten the enforcement, considering the Omicron variant that was identified in a few countries. “Covering the eligible population with the second dose of vaccine will be ensured in the coming days. This will help the community develop antibodies to check the spread.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/mask-up-dont-let-your-guard-down/articleshow/87968495.cms||Sampath Kumar

On Friday, 3,57,764 commuters travelled by Metro on the North-South line. Metro had reintroduced tokens from Thursday when the the number of commuters jumped to 3,47,313. On Wednesday, Metro had clocked 3,31,908 passenger counts along the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor. The 15,405 jump in the number of commuters on the first day of tokens being re-issued as well as the 10,451 rise on the second day have made the Metro authorities hopeful that they would achieve the 4 lakh mark in the next few weeks. Before the pandemic, around 6.2 lakh commuters took the Metro every day. But with only smart card holders being allowed to board the trains, the carrier has only witnessed a steady rise in the number of commuters. Meanwhile, Metro is also gearing up for high token sales. On Friday, Metro sold 43,665 tokens against the sale of 32,951 tokens on Thursday. Metro is looking at the sale of 60,000 to 70,000 tokens daily and the authorities have fed around 3 lakh tokens into the system. They have also brought in UV sanitizers for the sterilization of the tokens. During the pandemic, tokens — which would cost Rs 5 for the shortest 2km journey — were not issued. Passengers would only be allowed to use multiple-travel smart cards costing minimum Rs 120, of which Rs 80 is security deposit. Infrequent travellers avoided the Metro as they were reluctant to lock their money by buying smart cards. Many commuters returned the smart cards at the end of the day to take back the security deposit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/metro-passenger-count-crosses-3-5l/articleshow/87968503.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

With the growth of the information technology (IT) industries, the disposal of electronic waste has become a major concern due to the rise in e-waste. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav had directed the civic officials to put such a system in place. NMC already has a solid waste management system, under which garbage is collected in 250 garbage vans. Hence, the NMC administration has taken some measures to set up collection centres. The whole logistic system will be created by the agencies, said NMC officials. “We are yet to decide whether to allow six spaces to the agencies on nominal lease rate, charge royalty or lease rate of 8% of ready reckoner (RR).

According to another airport official, round-the-clock operations will enable spacing of flights and help reduce crowding. “The winter schedule will be operational from December 1 and more flights are expected till March next year. Total daily flight movements at the airport are expected to be between 160-180,” said the airport official. “Flight bunching has been a problem but we expect the issue to be resolved from December 1 onwards,” the official said. Flyers have hoped that the situation will improve. Kamal Sharma, a frequent flyer, said catching late evening or early morning flights is not an issue but overcrowding must be resolved. “It is a good sign if airport authorities say crowding will reduce from December 1, but how that will actually play out remains to be seen,” said Sharma. Another flyer, who travelled to Kolkata recently, said they booked a flight from Mumbai instead of Pune. “I will see how the situation is from December 1 before flying out from Pune,” said the flyer. In October last year, the airport turned to 12-hour operations — from 8am-8pm — due to runway work. Since May-June this year, after the second wave of the pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the number of daily flights and number of passengers at the airport. The total flight movements, except for second and fourth Saturdays when runway work is carried out, is 120-130 presently. With the number of passengers increasing despite being 12-hour operational presently, the airport has had to handle 1,500-1,800 passengers per hour. Before the pandemic hit, the airport was handling 700-800 passengers per hour during its 24-hour operations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/airport-to-finally-resume-24-hour-ops-from-dec-1/articleshow/87968512.cms||Joy Sengupta

The demand is high from the residents of the industrial areas of Sinnar and Ambad. Those who frequently commute by train said the booking counters at the Palika Bazaar centre, near Canada Corner, were not enough. There is another reservation centre on Nashik Road, but that is at least 8km away, making the Palika Bazaar facility the more convenient option. “This is the reason that most citizens prefer booking tickets at this centre. However, only three counters are operational and there is always a rush,” said Sunil Singh, who often travels to Madhya Pradesh. These counters are flooded with enquiry and reservation ticket requests, largely because commuters are now allowed to board trains in Maharashtra without confirmed tickets.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/increase-number-of-booking-counters/articleshow/87966922.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Two years of MVA full of corruption & let-down, says state BJP chief||Pune: Two years of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state has been marred by controversies and is full of corruption, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said in Pune on Sunday. He blamed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for the government's failure on all fronts and said he will have to take responsibility for the actions, including reappointment of suspended police officer Sachin Waze. “State ministers had to resign over allegations of corruption. The ruling leaders are taking decisions and imposing them at any cost. Their style of functioning resembles the Mughals,” he said at a press conference. Patil said the state had to function without active participation of the chief minister for many days and nearly 10 months without the speaker of the state assembly which shows the inability of the ruling parties. “The state government could not fulfil any commitment made to the people. Even promises like reservations to the Maratha community could not be fulfilled. No strata of society is happy and satisfied with the government. It has failed to fight legal battles effectively, leading to defeat in court cases. As a result, political reservation for OBCs could not be retained,” he said. Patil alleged that the government has also failed to pacify the agitating state transport employees, creating a complex situation. Any talks that senior BJP leaders are not happy with his performance were baseless, he said. On NCP leader Nawab Malik’s allegations that he was being kept under surveillance by investigating agencies, Patil said that he should approach the state home minister, who also belongs to the NCP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/two-years-of-mva-full-of-corruption-let-down-says-state-bjp-chief/articleshow/87968517.cms||---

The entire district has more than 23,500 beds earmarked for admission of the covid patients. While 8,232 beds have been reserved for covid patients in Nashik city limits, 15,022 beds are available in the rural areas. Dr Ashok Thorat, a civil surgeon said, “We are prepared for the third wave. We have an excess quantum of oxygen storage in case of an emergency. We have also proposed LMO plants at Sinnar, Pimpalgaon (Baswant), Malegaon and Kalwan.” Each LMO tank has a 10,000 litres capacity, which is way beyond the 24 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants installed at the various sub-district and rural hospitals. The NMC has reserved 8,232 beds for the Covid patients, with 3,367 beds at the NMC hospitals and facilities. Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC said, “The focus has been on ensuring the availability of oxygen for the patients and accordingly, 3,500 oxygen beds and 2,930 general beds have been made available. In addition, we also have 1,000 ICU beds and 800 ventilators at our disposal.” In the case of paediatrics, 1,218 beds have been reserved at the government and private hospitals, in addition to 427 oxygen-support beds, 146 ICU beds and 31 ventilators. 56 ICU beds have also been reserved by the health authorities for neonates across the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nashik-health-dept-for-lmo-tanks-at-sub-district-hospitals/articleshow/87966923.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The havildar and three others were arrested in a cheating case by the Nigdi police on November 9, based on a tip-off by the military intelligence. During custodial interrogation, the havildar told Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch officials that he had received the examination question paper on his mobile phone. Pimpri Chinchwad assistant commissioner of police (crime) Prashant Amrutkar and Pune cyber police inspector D S Hake told TOI on Sunday that they are investigating how the havildar got the question paper, and his role. “We are probing all possible aspects of the case,” Amrutkar said, without giving further details. Police officials from the Pimpri Chinchwad commissionerate said the crime branch had seized the mobile phones used by the suspects to circulate the question papers of various examinations. “A forensic investigation of the seized mobile phones will have unfolded several details. However, it seems that the Pimpri Chinchwad police have not made a lot of progress so far. We have sought details but are yet to get it,” said a senior officer from the Pune police. “The havildar is a native of the Nashik district and developed a vast network through private training academies across the state. He has also established contacts with serving army personnel posted with various units. With their help, he has been successfully running the racket for the last few years. We are also probing his link with the Army’s paper leak case in which we have made eight arrests, including officers,” said the police officer. When contacted Hake said, “We are getting help from various agencies, including the military intelligence, to make progress. Since the havildar is in judicial custody, we can’t record his statement. But after his release from custody, we will question him in this case .”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/health-dept-paper-leak-focus-on-havildar-held-in-cheating-case/articleshow/87968521.cms||Sandip Dighe

Mamta went to the house of the tenants and found Pawan with his throat slit inside a room that was locked from outside. The tenants were not present in the house.

---||India||From deals to pacts, expansive India-Russia defence agenda next month||NEW DELHI: From clinching deals on Kalashnikov assault rifles and very-short range air defence missile systems (VSHORADS) to a military logistics pact, upgraded combat exercises and more joint projects, Russia is now looking to challenge the US as India’s pre-eminent strategic partner and defence supplier. Ahead of the annual Modi-Putin summit here on December 6, coinciding with the inaugural two-plus-two dialogue between their foreign and defence ministers, hectic negotiations are currently underway to put finishing touches on a wide-ranging strategic-defence agenda. While there is now deep India-US strategic congruence across the spectrum, with New Delhi also inking defence deals worth over $21 billion with Washington since 2007, Russia wants to assert its long-standing special strategic partnership with India. Russia, incidentally, has notched up military sales worth well over $65 billion to India since the early-1960s. Russia is also apprehensive about India’s determined push for self-reliance in defence production. But it can take heart that the decks have finally been cleared for the long-pending Rs 5,124 crore project to manufacture over six lakh AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles at Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of UP, even as the $1.5 billion deal for India to acquire VSHORADS from Russia is also now in the “final stages”, said sources. The shoulder-fired Russian anti-aircraft missile system IGLA-S, which was selected over French and Swedish systems in the fray, is designed for use against visible enemy targets like aircraft, helicopters and drones. “The Army requires over 5,000 such missiles, launchers and associated equipment. The deal, when it happens, will include an initial off-the-shelf purchase followed by technology transfer to Bharat Dynamics for subsequent production,” said a source. The long-pending project for 200 twin-engine Kamov-226T light helicopters to replace old single-engine Cheetah and Chetak choppers of Army (135) and IAF (65) for around $2 billion, however, remains stuck at the technical evaluation stage. While the first 60 Ka-226T choppers are to come in a fly-away condition, Russia is yet to meet India’s requirement for 70% indigenous content in the remaining 140 to be manufactured in a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and Rostec Corp/Russian Helicopters. India, however, is planning to next year ink the deals for 21 MiG-29s, along with the upgrade of the 59 such fighters already with the IAF, as well as 12 additional Sukhoi-30MKIs, with advanced electronic warfare capabilities, additional supplies and spares. The two deals together will cost over Rs 20,000 crore. The two countries are also set to ink the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS), which will make Russia the seventh country with which India has such a reciprocal pact after the US, Australia, Japan, France, South Korea and Singapore. The bilateral talks next month will also include fast-tracking of deliveries for the five S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile squadrons under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract in October 2018. With India now getting initial deliveries, the first S-400 squadron with two missile batteries, long-range acquisition and engagement radars and all-terrain transporter-erector vehicles will be operational in the north-western sector by early next year, as was first reported by TOI. India also wants to induct the Akula-class nuclear-powered attack submarine called Chakra-III, under the $3 billion 10-year lease for it in March 2019, by 2025-2026.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-deals-to-pacts-expansive-india-russia-defence-agenda-next-month/articleshow/87969965.cms||Rajat Pandit

According to the Grape Exporters’ Association of India (GEAI), farmers may get lower rates from traders as they will have to manage their costs. Manik Patil, the director of GEAI said grape prices in the international and domestic markets may be affected by a huge increase in prices of shipping freight and packaging material. There has been a huge rise in freight charges in the past three years. This year, the shipping freight charges have doubled from $4,000 (Rs 3 lakh) a container to $8,000 (Rs 6 lakh) a container. Moreover, packaging material prices have also increased by 30%. Earlier, a 5kg box would cost Rs 46, which has now increased to Rs 60 per box. Recently, a delegation of GEAI led by its president Jagannath Khapre met Piyush Goyal, the union minister of commerce and industry to discuss the issue. Khapre said, “Earlier, the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) grant for export of grapes was 5%, but it was cancelled around two years back. Now, the centre has replaced the MEIS grant with the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) grant, which is only 3%. We have asked Piyush Goyal to increase the RoDTEP grant from present 3% to 8% on the export of grapes.” “Moreover, we have also sought an increase in transport subsidy from Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per container to help the exporters cope up with the rising export cost,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/increase-in-shipping-freight-packaging-material-costs-likely-to-affect-grape-prices/articleshow/87966926.cms||Tushar Pawar

The number of active patients has dropped to 153 so far, against 198 patients reported on November 21. There was marginal growth in the new cases from November 17 to 21 and the tally of active patients had increased to 198 from 163 during this period. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said that there has been a marginal fluctuation in the number of active cases, but the situation is not that alarming. “The active cases have dropped because the vaccination of beneficiaries has increased to over 80%,” said Nagargoje. Nagargoje added that even though the Coivd positive cases have declined, there is a need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the spread of infection. The NMC administration has decided to conduct surprise checks at the wedding halls to ensure that people attending functions are following Covid safety protocols. Total 18 teams of health officials and employees will conduct surprise checks at the halls and those found without masks will be penalized.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/covid-cases-drop-by-22-in-nashik-city/articleshow/87966928.cms||Tushar Pawar

He also claimed that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) parties contesting the elections together would actually benefit BJP. Darekar said the government had failed on all fronts. He added that people are now angry with the functioning of the three-party government that failed to do justice to farmers, to MSRTC employees and even the common man. The law and order situation found a special mention in his address, especially against the backdrop of the murder of a BJP worker on Friday. “The BJP worker was murdered by Vinod Barve — who can be seen with district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. The latter was also praising him. The picture says a lot. This is motivating criminals in the city and the district,” Darekar alleged. He added: “The law and order situation in the city had fallen to the lowest level with three back-to-back murders. The citizens are left to defend themselves. The guardian minister should immediately step down.” Darekar criticized the government for its alleged failure to provide relief to the farmers and the MSRTC workers. On whether the leader of opposition felt it was a challenge for BJP given that the MVA parties are willing to contest the elections together, Darekar said “It would benefit BJP.” The MVA fielding one candidate from a particular party would mean the party workers from other two parties will not get the chance to contest the elections. They would not keep quiet. This would only help BJP, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/darekar-mva-parties-contesting-elections-together-will-aid-bjp/articleshow/87966933.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Mahesh Sakhya, a resident of Nakshatra Apartment, has accused Munira Panwala, Riyaz Vichi and Dharmesh Bharbhaya of duping him under the pretext of investing money in a business. According to the police, Sakhya and his wife had met Munira at a marriage function in 2016. They gradually became friends and later Munira told the duo that she wants to start a beauty parlour. She asked Sakhya to lend her Rs6 lakh which he gave. Police said that Munira realised that Sakhya is a rich man and so began asking him for more money in the name of investing in business. Munira took Rs 12.1 crore from Sakhya in separate instalments, but returned only Rs 1.25 crore. When she didn’t return him the rest of the amount, he got suspicious and started gathering details about Munira. He soon learnt that instead of starting a business, the woman had bought properties. When he asked her to return his money, Munira threatened him of using her black magic skills to kill his entire family. Sakhya then approached the police a few days ago with his cheating plaint. Cops who investigated the complaint filed an FIR against the trio on Saturday. In a late night development, cops arrested Munira Panwala and Riyaz Vichi, while the third person is yet to be arrested.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/rajkot-bizman-cheated-of-rs-11cr-files-plaint-against-3-2-nabbed/articleshow/87967847.cms||---
---||Trichy||Permanent solution after rain stops: Min||Trichy: Municipal administration, urban and water supply minister K N Nehru has said that authorities have started acting against illegal structures built over drains and canals in the city. Claiming that the previous government failed to focus on the city’s water management infrastructure, the minister promised to provide a permanent remedy for flooding in Trichy city. He was speaking after inspecting inundated residential areas in Trichy city on Sunday. Encroachments on canals, where surplus water from city merges with the rivers, was cited as one of the major causes of the flooding. Urging people who have encroached on drains to voluntarily remove the illegal structures, the minister said that the district administration has started evicting encroachments posing hindrance. “Nothing was done constructively for this area (inundated areas in Trichy city) in the past 10 years. Next year, people will not witness such troubles, a permanent solution will be provided once the waterlogging recedes,” Nehru said. Rivers such as Koraiyar, Ariyar and Kudamurutti flowing through the city and suburban areas are in spate after collecting rainwater from the catchment areas in rural Trichy, neighbouring Pudukottai and Dindigul districts. Hence, it is the reverse flow of water to residential areas and hindrances in draining stagnant rainwater that have caused waterlogging. “A proposal has been initiated to construct concrete retaining walls with shutters for the rivers flowing through the city. Ariyar division of public works department (PWD) is working on a detailed project report (DPR) for a Rs 100crore water management infrastructure plan,” Nehru said. The minister said that water pumping infrastructure will be facilitated for areas abutting rivers so that stagnant water can be drained quickly. He inspected the temporary measures to plug breach in Koraiyar and Kudamurutti rivers using sandbags. The minister later distributed essential commodities to the affected population in the waterlogged areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/permanent-solution-after-rain-stops-min/articleshow/87968532.cms||---

Officials said the proposals would cover main roads and residential roads in 19 civic body wards and that the locations were chosen based on the completion of underground drainage and drinking water projects. Even before the onset of the northeast monsoon, several roads here were difficult to commute and the recent rains have only aggravated it.

As representations were made, the civic body was recently instructed to identify the worst-hit areas to renovate the main and residential streets where there will not be overlap of work for drainage and water projects. Kattur in Thiruverumbur falling under Ponmalai zone, Woraiyur, Vayalur road neighbourhoods in K Abishekapuram zone and interior roads of Srirangam were included in the road package.

---||Delhi||Omicron scare: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal writes to PM Modi with plea for flight curbs||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to immediately stop flights from countries affected by the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said all government departments were on a high alert and appealed to people to avoid unnecessary gatherings. “I have requested hon’ble PM to immediately stop flights from those countries, which are affected by new variant. Any delay could be very harmful,” Kejriwal tweeted and shared the letter on Sunday. The CM had requested the PM to stop flights from the affected countries on Saturday too. “Our country has fought a tough fight against corona for the last one-and-a-half years. With great difficulty and due to the selfless service of millions of our Covid warriors, our country has recovered from corona,” the CM wrote in the letter. “We should do everything possible to prevent the new variant of concern, recently recognised by WHO, from entering India. A number of countries, including the European Union, have suspended travel to the affected regions. I urge you to stop flights from these regions with immediate effect. Any delay in this regard may prove harmful if any affected person enters India (sic),” Kejriwal wrote. A meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority is slated to take place on Monday where experts will give a presentation on preventive steps that can be taken keeping the new variant in mind. Apart from public health experts, representatives of the civil aviation ministry are likely to join the meeting, which will be chaired by LG Anil Baijal. According to sources, passengers deboarding from international flights from affected countries are likely to be quarantined. “In view of the threat from new Covid variant from African countries, we have requested experts to make a presentation to DDMA on Monday and suggest what steps we shud take. We will take all steps necessary to protect u and ur family (sic),” the CM had tweeted on Friday. On the sidelines of a press conference on Sunday, Sisodia said government departments, particularly the health department, had been directed to enhance their infrastructure and other necessary facilities to tackle any possible threat from the new variant. “Fear and concern are necessary about the new variant of Covid. All government departments are on a high alert. I appeal to people to not unnecessarily mingle and to take all precautions,” Sisodia said.“We are all alert about the new variant. A DDMA meeting has been called on this. If even a single person carrying the new variant comes to Delhi, it will spread fast, so please do not mingle unnecessarily,” he said. The new B.1.1.529 variant of Covid, which was first detected in South Africa and Botswana, and even in faraway Hong Kong, has a higher number of mutations and might be more transmissible.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/cm-writes-to-pm-with-plea-for-flight-curbs/articleshow/87968568.cms||---

The government’s attempts to make vaccination mandatory to access commercial and public spaces seem to have prompted a section of those who are hesitant to complete their vaccination. Madurai too saw good response as the day remained mostly rain-free in most southern districts. As many as 79,183 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Madurai. Of these, 41,168 were from rural areas while 1,446 took the jab at government hospitals. According to CoWin portal statistics, Trichy district as of Sunday evening vaccinated around 78,000 people. Health officials said that reminders through SMS and calls to registered mobile numbers helped increase second dose vaccination. While there were fears that rain may dampen the drive, there was only drizzling. “A section of people who had been skipping their second dose for weeks have taken it today,” a medical officer with Trichy corporation said. Information about the spread of the new variant of Covid-19 (Omicron) has also persuaded a section to take the jab. Mobile vaccination teams managed to reach out to interior residential areas in Ariyamangalam zone to cover the eligible people. Cinema halls, old age homes and youth hostels were covered by the teams. In Theni district, around 41,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated, of which around 30,000 were those taking the first dose who now make up 71% of the population. In Dindigul and Kanyakumari, more beneficiaries took the second dose. In Dindigul, 44,293 of the total 76,797 beneficiaries were those taking second dose. In Kanyakumari, as many as 53,624 beneficiaries took the vaccine jab on Sunday, of which only around 9000 were those who took the first dose. “With second dose being due for a large number of people now, many prefer to get it done during a mega vaccination drive,” said a health official in Kanyakumari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/patronage-surges-for-mass-vax-campaign/articleshow/87968563.cms||---

---||Trichy||Reassess crop loss, enhance relief, say delta farmers||TRICHY: Delta farmers have urged the state government to reassess crop loss after the rain stops and announce revised compensation. They say that the continuing rain across the delta region has submerged more acres of paddy. About 11,000 acres of samba paddy fields have been submerged in Thanjavur district, school education minister and district in-charge Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said after inspecting the fields on Sunday. Residents of Andarkoil near Manapparai in Trichy district on the Trichy-Dindigul highway blocked the road alleging that around 30 houses had been inundated due to the rain. Vehicular traffic on the highway was affected for more than an hour due to this. Though Mamundi river is the draining canal of the area which flows near their houses, some people had not been letting rainwater flow along their land into the river, the protesters alleged. Police and revenue authorities pacified them and promised to take immediate action. Meanwhile, in Trichy district, about 1,000 acres of paddy fields have been submerged as the Ariyaru developed a breach on its bund near Punganur. PWD authorities were working to set it right, officials said. Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said Thanjavur district has received 60% more rain this monsoon compared to 2015. Muthalaimuthu canal having filled to its brim was unable to drain water from the fields. Once the rains are over, efforts would be taken to desilt entire canals, the minister said. “Farmers said standing crops withstand rainwater for up to 36 hours. If the water continues to stay furthermore, there is no guarantee that the crop will survive. So, they have appealed to scientists to begin research for a variety that would withstand flood up to 10 to 15 days. We will take their demands to the notice of the chief minister,” he further stated.  Meanwhile, farmers and functionaries of the community have urged the government to reassess crop damage in the delta and enhance compensation commensurate with the money spent by them, said N Veerasekaran, Bharatiya Kisan Sangam state spokesperson, in Trichy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/reassess-crop-loss-enhance-relief-say-delta-farmers/articleshow/87968577.cms||---

The meeting chaired by deputy sarpanch Armstrong Braganza discussed the issue of recent development in low lying fields and rivulets, mostly in the jurisdiction of the Corporation of the City of Panaji. The members lamented that various works are being done in the area of Merces, but the villagers and biodiversity are suffering the adverse impacts. Though the area falls within village limits, the residents have no say about the way the works are carried out, a gram sabha member. The villagers had recently stopped an attempt by a contractor undertaking expansion of national highway 66 by blocking an inlet of the Mandovi to broaden the stretch. The channel is one of the main links for tidal flow from the river to a network of water bodies in a vast khazan from Taleigao and Panaji to St Cruz and Merces. The burying of the inlet near the culvert would have caused flooding of the highway. Later, they forced the contractor to restore the flow. The lack of repairs to roads dug for laying cables was discussed. A member complained the roads are not repaired for months together. Members demanded that the panchayat obtain an undertaking from contractors regarding restoration of roads. Another member raised the issue of the chaos at the Merces circle and danger to motorists and pedestrians at the junction due to convergence of traffic from various sides and demanded proper management. A few other issues, including speed breakers, budget and collection of taxes were also discussed. A member complained the roads are not repaired for months together.

The department had installed CCTV cameras and watchtowers on the busy track B to monitor movement of elephants. We plan to extend the facilities to Track A also,” he said.To prevent elephant deaths on tracks, meetings were held between the railway and the ministry of environment and forest in New Delhi in 2010, Ramasubramanian said. “The railway demanded Rs 29.40 crore from the ministry of environment and forest to install fencing, drains between Madukkarai and Walayar stations and an underbridge between Ettimadai and Walayar stations. But there was no development. We now plan to bring such facilities to track A and will write to the railway ministry to install the facilities using its funds.” As much as 1.8km of track A and 2.8km of track B pass through the reserve forest, district forest officer T K Ashok Kumar said. “We held talks with officials of the railway’s Salem division about protecting wildlife and they have promised to cooperate with us,” he said.Meanwhile, Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S Ramadoss urged the state government to book the railway protection force personnel in Palakkad, who detained forest department officials who reached there to probe the elephant deaths. “The Tamil Nadu government should take strict action against the personnel,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/more-forest-staff-to-be-deployed-along-rly-tracks-to-save-jumbos/articleshow/87968582.cms||---
---||Madurai||Maternity protection right can’t be infringed: Madras high court||MADURAI: Observing that the right to maternity protection cannot be infringed at all, Madras high court directed authorities to reinstate an anganwadi worker who was terminated from service for availing leave for over seven months during her pregnancy. Petitioner K R Kanimozhi, an anganwadi worker at Vadavanpatti village in Sivaganga district, had conceived twins through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) after being childless for 11 years. As doctors advised bed rest for the entire gestation period, she submitted a leave letter during October 2013 and extended the leave periodically. She delivered the babies in June 2014, but the authorities issued a show cause notice and subsequently terminated her from service in 2014 for absence of duty beyond six months citing a GO passed in 1995. She filed two petitions before HC Madurai bench in 2014 challenging the termination order and seeking reinstatement with monetary benefits. The authorities in their counter stated that she had availed of 229 days leave — seven months and 11 days— which attracted termination having exceeded six months. Justice S Srimathy observed that the concept of maternity protection to women was recognised on November 29, 1919 by the International Labour Organization. The Bombay Maternity Benefit Bill introduced in 1929 was the first law for working women in India. Thereafter, Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, was enacted which provides 12 weeks maternity leave. This was amended in Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017, wherein the period of 12 weeks was extended to 26 weeks. The judge said it is very unfortunate to note the 1995 GO has not taken into consideration the concept of maternity protection. When the Act clearly grants 12 weeks (26 weeks after amendment) protection to pregnant women, the authorities ought to have passed the GO in consonance with the statutory provision. The judge held that the 12 weeks period cannot be taken into account while calculating the six months period stated in the GO. After deducting 12 weeks period (3 months), the petitioner availed leave for only four months and 11 days, which has not exceeded the six months period stated in the GO. That apart, the judge observed that as per rule 18(1) of the Tamil Nadu Government Fundamental Rules, the employee is entitled to take leave exceeding six months on production of medical certificate. Since the petitioner had produced a medical certificate, she is also entitled to relief under the provision. Hence, the judge set aside the termination order and directed the authorities to reinstate her in service forthwith.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/maternity-protection-right-cant-be-infringed/articleshow/87968580.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Hate speech has affected freedom of speech, caused social unrest: Madras HC||MADURAI: Madras high court has observed that hate speech has widely affected freedom of speech and expression in recent times and given rise to social unrest and public disturbance. Social networks have become the most ordinary tool for spreading hate speech. Justice K Murali Shankar observed that while freedom of speech and expression is an internationally recognized right, it is not regarded as absolute when it conflicts with other rights and protections. The judge observed that Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution provides the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, Article 19(2) provides for reasonable restrictions on this freedom in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. The court made the observation while hearing the petitions filed by YouTuber and Naam Tamilar Katchi functionary, ‘Sattai’ A Duraimurugan, seeking bail in two cases registered against him by Kanyakumari and Thanjavur district police. On October 9, he had made derogatory remarks in a YouTube channel against chief minister M K Stalin and late CM M Karunanidhi. A case was registered by Thanjavur district cyber crime police. Participating in a protest against exploitation of natural resources at Kanyakumari on October 10, he had made derogatory remarks against Stalin. A case was registered in this regard by Thuckalay police. He was subsequently arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The petitioner had filed an undertaking affidavit stating that he will not make any derogatory remarks against any person or any personal remarks against political leaders in future. However, the additional public prosecutor submitted that despite filing an undertaking affidavit before HC in August, when he was granted bail in another case for posting derogatory video in his channel, he has been involved in two other similar offences for which he is presently seeking bail. Taking into account the affidavit filed and considering the fact that the petitioner was facing health problems, Justice Murali Shankar granted bail to him and directed him to pay Rs 25,000 for each case to the chief minister’s public relief fund.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hate-speech-has-affected-freedom-of-speech-caused-social-unrest-hc/articleshow/87968584.cms||Kaushik Kannan

In a letter to the Union finance minister, Sihma members said the move would increase cost of finished products, which will subsequently impact sales. The GST council, in its previous meeting, raised tax up to 12% from 5% on several textile and apparel items, and footwear from January. GST rate on woven garments of any value has been raised to 12% from 5% on products priced up to Rs 1,000. Industry experts said it would impact working capital requirement, besides sales that were gradually increasing following Covid crisis. The new tax will impact hosiery manufacturers, Sihma president A C Eswaran said. “GST concession on products below Rs 1,000 should be restored to benefit the lower income group. The concession can be offered to products below Rs 500. A pair of hosiery may cost Rs 500 and increased GST rates will further increase the cost,” he said. “We hope that the government would not further put the working class under stress in such testing times.” tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/hosiery-makers-slam-revised-gst-rate-on-apparel/articleshow/87968586.cms||---

The central health ministry has directed the states/UTs to enforce active surveillance measures at airports. Based on this, restrictions like mandatory 7-day quarantine have been re-imposed on international passengers coming from the countries identified as ‘at risk’ due to the presence of the new variant. The travellers will include those coming through airports, seaports and land borders. Mandatory RT-PCR test and seven-day quarantine are applicable to all passengers with travel history related to Israel, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore, Mauritius, New Zealand, Botswana, Zimbabwe, China, Bangladesh and Hong Kong. Besides, all countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, have been identified as risk nations and additional restrictions are applicable to passengers coming from there. The state health department has deployed special medical teams in all four airports — Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Kozhikode and Kannur— to monitor the health-checking activities. Special medical teams have been deployed at these airports for monitoring the situation. Additional health checking counters have been opened to ensure smooth conduct of thermal scanning and Covid test sample collection. As per the new guidelines, mandatory filling up of self-declaration forms (SDF) and uploading of negative RT-PCR test reports are applicable for all international travellers. Airlines have to ensure availability of negative RT-PCR reports before allowing the travellers onboard. Travellers coming from countries ‘at risk’ have to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing on arrival. If they test negative, there will be home quarantine for seven days. Re-test will be held on the 8th day and if negative, self-health monitoring must be held for next seven days. The contacts of the suspect case will be the co-passengers seated in the same row, three rows in front and three rows behind along with identified cabin crew. Also, all community contacts of such travellers who have tested positive (during home quarantine period) would be subjected to quarantine for 14 days and tested as per ICMR protocol. The samples of those turning positive would be sent for genome sequencing laboratories under the aegis of Indian SARS Covid-2 Genomic Consortium for further analysis. Positive patients will be admitted at separate isolation facilities and given treatment as per standard protocols. The central government has signed agreements with 99 countries for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates for individuals fully-vaccinated with nationally-recognized or WHO-recognized Covid-19 vaccines. None of these countries are identified as ‘at risk’ nations and the passengers coming from these countries will be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days. But a sub-section (5% of the total flight passengers) will have to undergo RT-PCR testing on arrival. If they test negative, self-health monitoring for 14 days is applicable and if tested positive, samples will be sent for genomic testing. However, children under five years of age are exempted from both pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic for Covid-19 on arrival or during home quarantine period, they shall undergo testing and be treated as per laid down protocol.

---||Delhi||Delhi: As fresh Covid threat looms, daily challans go under 4,000; officials cite shortage of staff||NEW DELHI: With the Covid-19 situation in Delhi largely being under control for the last three months, a slight dip in the enforcement of Covid-19 safety norms is also visible. District authorities, however, say that manpower crunch and the air emergency that Delhi has been facing are also behind the dip. On Saturday, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had instructed senior officials to ensure strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour in public places and functions, according to sources. While punitive action was taken at a major scale after the second wave of Covid-19 cases against those violating Covid-19 safety norms, such as not wearing a face mask, spitting in public, not maintaining social distancing, etc., the numbers have been dipping since reaching a high of around 7,000 challans being issued a day in the month of July. On August 28, 6,268 challans were issued by district authorities across the national capital for violating Covid-19 safety norms, while it was 2,584 on Sunday and 3,681 on Saturday, November 27. In the month of August, the figure remained above 6,000 till August 30 and then dipped to around 5,500. The number of challans being issued till September 15 remained firmly around 5,500 but from September 16 onwards, hovered around 5,200. The month of October saw the figure dip below the 5,000-mark and on average, remained around 4,500 October 17, after which the numbers fell below 4,000 till October 30. The month of November saw more than 4,000 challans being issued till November 4 and the numbers have remained below 4,000 since then. “We want to continue our stringent drives against violators in public places but are facing a manpower crunch. With Delhi facing an air emergency, district-level staff have been deployed to keep a check on people violating air pollution norms too. Also, with schools restarting, very few staff from the education department are available now,” a district official said. “However, we are going to ramp up enforcement in public areas, especially marketplaces and busy road intersections,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-fresh-covid-threat-looms-daily-challans-go-under-4k-officials-cite-shortage-of-staff/articleshow/87968603.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Thane||Thane: South Africa returnee tests Covid positive in Dombivli, sample sent to check for new strain||KALYAN: A 32-year-old merchant navy engineer who returned to his Dombivli home from Cape Town via Dubai and Delhi, has tested positive for Covid-19 and his samples will be sent for genome sequencing to check for the new Omicron variant. The engineer tested positive at Delhi airport itself on November 24, but was picked up in Dombivli on Sunday as a part of a drive started by municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to check on the 466 people who returned from Omicron-detected nations from November 12 to 26. Although asymptomatic, he has been placed in a government quarantine centre and his samples will be sent to Kasturba Hospital’s new genome sequencing laboratory early on Monday, said health officials from Kalyan-Dombivli civic body. Earlier, when the health officials called up the engineer to enquire about his health status, he wasn’t too forthcoming about his travel details. The health team found out about his Covid status after his brother went to a private laboratory in Dombivli to get tested for the viral infection; he told the lab officials that his brother had returned from South Africa and was Covid positive. KDMC health officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil said, “The lab immediately informed me about the case and our staff visited the engineer and brought him to the quarantine centre at the Art Gallery in Kalyan.” She said the patient is asymptomatic and stable. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said 97 out of the 466 travellers who arrived at the city airport from “countries of concern” between November 12 and 26 were from Mumbai. “We have contacted each one of them via phone and our staff even visited them. We found that none tested positive for Covid on return or during a retest after a seven-day period,’’ said Kakani. The BMC will, however, follow up with RT-PCR tests on Monday. Details of the remaining names on the list have been shared with the civic authorities concerned. The emergence of the Omicron variant in southern Africa has led to worldwide curbs on travellers from the countries where the variant has been detected. It is thou-ght to be more transmissible than the Delta variant, which caused the second wave in India, but South Africa health officials have been quoted as saying that it has so far caused mild disease in patients.

The additional public prosecutor submitted that the police have filed the final report in the case before the Tirunelveli principal district court and that the case has been posted on November 30 for fixing the date for trial. Taking cognizance of the submissions, Justice G R Swaminathan observed that section 309(1) of CrPC contemplates that in every trial, the proceedings shall be held on a day to day until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined, unless the court finds the adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded. The judge observed that the occurrence has attracted considerable attention in the media and it appears that there is also a communal angle in the case. This is a case in which the trial court shall bear in mind the statutory mandate set out in section 309 of CrPC. Since the additional public prosecutor sought time to get instructions from the state government with regard to payment of compensation, the case was adjourned to December 13. The court was hearing the petition filed by S Subramanian, a resident of Seevalaperi who is the brother of the deceased person Chidambaram alias Durai. The petitioner stated that his brother Chidambaram belonging to the konar community was the priest of the Sudalai Madasamy Temple at the village. He stated that the people from the thevar community in the village had started to encroach properties belonging to the temple. He stated that though the people of the Konar community sought the officials to survey the temple land, no steps were taken in this regard. Following the dispute, the people from the thevar community murdered his brother Chidambaram on April 18.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/priest-murder-case-daily-hearing-ordered/articleshow/87968591.cms||---

As the water reached the dam’s full reservoir level of 24ft, the sluice gates were opened fully on Saturday night, which again was a rare event. People living along the banks of Upparu river were warned not to venture deep into the river, as it was in spate. Upparu dam irrigates about 6,000 acres land in Dharapuram and Kundadam belt in Tirupur, where coconut and other crops like maize are cultivated. However, only if there was enough and more water in Thirumoorthy dam, water from there would be released to Upparu dam. For the past 20 years, water has not raised above 13ft in the Upparu dam. Every year, farmers would stage protests demanding the authorities to release water from the Thirumoorthy dam, but in vain. However, this year the dam started receiving water steadily for the past two months due to rain in catchment areas in Kundadam, Kethanur and Pappanuthu. Water from the Thirumoorthy dam also reached the dam resulting in Upparu dam reaching 24 feet. The release of water from the dam has brought cheers to villagers in the locality who started visiting the dam to have a view of the brimming dam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/rain-upparu-dam-brims-after-20-yrs/articleshow/87968590.cms||---

Arrivals from the three Omicron hotspots — South Africa, Zimbabwe and Hong Kong — will be required to wait at the airport for their test report and only those found negative will be allowed to leave, say sources. Those testing positive will be sent to designated Covid centres. Arrivals from other at-risk countries will be allowed to leave after their samples are taken, and the result will be conveyed to them electronically, with the same protocol for those testing positive or negative.

Those coming from Botswana, South Africa, Hong Kong and some European countries where the variant has been detected will now have to undergo home quarantine. Spot tests will also be conducted at airport. “Fully vaccinated persons will be quarantined at home and their condition will be closely monitored while partially-vaccinated and unvaccinated persons will undergo spot testing. In case a traveller tests positive, samples will be sent for genome sequencing to find out if it is of the new variant,” said director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao. He added that health minister T Harish Rao had held a review meeting with state officials to chalk out a strategy in light of the situation. The public health director also urged people to take vaccines and pointed out that so far coverage of first doses in the state has touched 90 per cent while second dose coverage is around 45 per cent. He also reminded that 25 lakh persons have crossed the due date for their second dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/surveillance-up-spot-checks-back-at-rgia/articleshow/87969542.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Reaching out to unvaccinated 12 lakh in Delhi remains a challenge||NEW DELHI: Even as concerns surrounding the Omicron variant of the coronavirus are growing and experts believe that vaccination is the best bet against it, more than 12 lakh adults in Delhi are yet to receive a single dose of vaccine against the disease. Though 58% of eligible Delhiites are now fully vaccinated, district authorities are facing a huge challenge reaching out to the unvaccinated population despite door-to-door surveys and mobile vaccination teams. Till 7.30 pm on Sunday, Delhi had seen a cumulative 2,24,99,276 vaccine doses being administered, including 1,37,94,255 first doses and 87,05,021 second doses. With the number of people eligible for vaccination in Delhi being around 1.5 crore, 58% of adults in Delhi have been fully vaccinated and nearly 92% have received at least one dose of vaccine. Considering the approximate number of Delhiites who are above the age of 18 years and eligible for Covid-19 vaccination, more than 12 lakh adults haven’t received a single dose of vaccine. The Delhi government has been carrying out an extensive house-to-house survey to complete the coverage of Covid-19 vaccination as part of a ‘targeted approach’ to reach out to the remaining eligible beneficiaries. The survey is being carried out by civil defence volunteers to identify the population that has been left out of the vaccination drive. The government is also carrying out an extensive information, education and communication (IEC) campaign to create awareness. “We are trying our best to reach out to the unvaccinated population through surveys and phone calls. Everybody has to get vaccinated and full efforts are being made to ensure that,” a district official said. “However, there is a section of beneficiaries that we are facing a challenge in vaccinating,” he said. “Initially during the vaccination drive, jabs were not permitted for pregnant women and the perception has remained. As a result, we are aware of some pregnant and also lactating women who are avoiding getting vaccinated despite our best efforts,” the official said. “Then there is a section of the population who want to get vaccinated but are unable to reach centres, such as people who are very old or have reduced mobility. We are carrying out vaccination of bed-ridden beneficiaries too, but that is not possible at a mass level,” he said. The official further said that while mobile vaccination teams, which have doctors and paramedics, were deployed at district-level, they also had limitations. “The vans set up tables or canopies outside lanes but can’t reach every home. Also, unlike administering polio drops from door to door, observation of half an hour is mandatory for vaccine doses against Covid-19,” he stated. “Then there are people who are absolutely refusing to get vaccinated and those who are not fully aware of the need to get vaccine doses. We are trying our best to reach out and convince them to get vaccinated.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/reaching-out-to-unvaxxed-12-lakh-remains-a-challenge/articleshow/87968644.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Hyderabad||New Covid variant may spread six-times faster: Experts||HYDERABAD: The newly-emerged variant of concern B.1.1.529 (Omicron) may not respond to monoclonal antibody therapy or cocktail treatment, experts fear. Based on preliminary analysis of infections in South Africa and elsewhere, experts suggest that it has six times higher potential to spread (R value) than the Delta variant that had triggered the second wave in India. It could also evade the immune system and may cause breakthrough infections. Dr Vinod Scaria of the Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB), said Omicron has 32 spike mutations and some of them suggest possibility of S-gene dropout. This means some primers targeting the spike gene locus might not work. The Delta variant, which caused heavy infections and mortality, responds to monoclonal antibody therapy. However, its offspring, the Delta plus, did not respond to this therapy considered a miracle treatment for Covid-19 in initial stages of infection. After the Delta plus, Omicron is the second variant of concern that may not respond to monoclonal antibody treatment. According to Mercy Rophina, research scholar at IGIB, the new lineage carries a total of 53 variants precisely including 32 spike protein variants. “Most of the observed variants are found to possess resistance against and other functional implications. Six variants spanning spike receptor binding domain (G339D, S373P, G496S, Q498R and Y505H) are found resistant to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) including etesevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab, imdevimab and their cocktails,” Rophina tweeted. In a series of tweets on the new variant, Dr Vinod Scaria said that at least one case of B.1.1.529 in Israel seems to have received a Covid-19 vaccine booster suggesting the variant can cause vaccine breakthrough infections. “The disease severity is yet to be known, which is the most important point to consider. While vaccine breakthrough infections per se are not the major concern (Delta also caused vaccine breakthrough infections), transmissibility and clinical outcomes (severity and mortality) are the key points,” he said. Rophina, who is from Dr Vinod’s lab, compiled the structural context of the immune escape mutations in Omicron. Dr Vinod said three mutations in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site possibly suggests better cell entry (and may be transmissibility). He, however, added that properties of single mutations don’t always add up when they occur in combination. Nevertheless, they give potential directions to explore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/new-covid-variant-may-spread-six-times-faster-experts/articleshow/87969521.cms||Syed Akbar

Several mosque committees have come forward to hold Covid-19 vaccination camps in association with local primary health care centres. MIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi will formally launch the vaccination drive at Masjid Mohammad Mustafa in Rajendranagar mandal on Monday. The special drive is being taken as a similar step in 2017 to vaccinate children against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) was met with severe resistance. The state government had then taken the help of religious leaders including those from the 140-year-old Jamia Nizamia deemed university to vaccinate children in Old City. The drive was highly successful, and the Central government had in fact praised Telangana state for its exemplary show in overcoming vaccine resistance. According to a preliminary survey, the vaccination saturation in the minority dominated areas of Old City is relatively low. The survey covering over 3,000 households in the catchment area of 20 slums revealed that 35% adults are yet to be vaccinated with first dose and 67% with second dose. The vaccination drive in mosques will be carried out by about 100 volunteers, counsellors, vaccinators, data entry operators, supervisors and support staff from mosques. The drive will continue for six months in about 100 slums. It will also cover door-to-door vaccination. Three mosques in Rajendranagar, Hasanagar and Shaheen Nagar which run primary health care centres on their premises will take the lead. The vaccination drive is in collaboration with Helping Hand Foundation (HHF), a local NGO, and SEED, an NGO based in the USA. “The door-to-door survey that will be taken up as part of the vaccination drive will enumerate the number of people, who have taken first and second dose and the ones that are not vaccinated. Camps will be organized at various points to facilitate the vaccination. Vaccines will also be given at the doorsteps for senior citizens and the physically challenged,” said HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. Imams in mosques will announce during Friday prayers about the need for vaccination against Covid-19 to curb the spread of the pandemic and emergence of new variants. The Imams and other religious leaders will also dispel rumours and myths on vaccination. During the 2017 drive on MMR vaccination, religious leaders had accompanied health workers to persuade people to get their children vaccinated||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mosques-to-host-vax-camps-to-fight-covid/articleshow/87969516.cms||Syed Akbar

The meeting is likely to finalise the strategy to be adopted on quarantining international passengers flying into the city and entering the state through road and rail network. The cabinet meeting is likely to take a decision on increasing the number of Covid-19 tests in view of the new threat from Omicron. Officials will discuss regulations and curbs to be imposed on shopping malls, theatres, pubs and other public gathering places to minimise the scope of viral spread. The Centre on Sunday asked states to increase testing, monitor hotspots and improve health infrastructure. In a letter to the chief secretaries of states, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan stated that “in view of the possible threat, it is imperative that the intensive containment, active surveillance, increased coverage of vaccination and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour must be enforced in the field in a very proactive manner.”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cabinet-meet-today-to-prep-t-for-omicron/articleshow/87969533.cms||Roushan Ali

In Rasoolpoora, the most-populated civilian ward in the Cantonment and home to one of the largest slums in the country, TOI spotted garbage piling up in the Annanagar area. Residents of the locality said that this garbage had not been cleared for over a week now. “We feel proud that a building as magnificent as the Metro Rail Bhavan stands in our area but Rasoolpura, located just a few meters behind the building, stinks of sewer water. An issue which has been lying unresolved for years,” said Gaddam Nagesh, a 67-year-old resident. Another resident from Annanagar, C Ramchandra, said that inundation every monsoon remains a problem that has not been done away with. He said that nalas in the area are shrinking and that de-silting them is problematic as both sides have been encroached. While once, the slums in the area were mere shelters, many have now turned into small colonies with very narrow by-lanes which do not permit the movement of emergency vehicles. Coming to real estate aspirations in the area, height restrictions imposed by Airports Authority of India (AAI) do not permit the construction of high-rise buildings. The current floor space index (FSI) is also another hurdle when it comes to such buildings. “A merger of civilian areas with GHMC is the only remedy,” said Dheeraj, a bank employee residing in the area. Former SCB vice-president and board member who had been elected for two consecutive terms (2008-13 and 2015-20) Sada Kesava Reddy told TOI that he had sanctioned works worth Rs 10 crore in his first term and another Rs 18 crore in his second for the ward’s development. “I cannot say that major issues have been 100 per cent resolved. Certain issues such as an outer road to ease traffic, culverts, bridges and widening of nalas still need work,” Kesava Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/in-scbs-ward-ii-residents-feel-merger-the-only-remedy-to-develop-area/articleshow/87969493.cms||Sunil Mungara

The court was hearing a revision petition against an order,which had dismissed his complaint alleging offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust and forgery committed by a secretary of Servants of the People Society. The complainant had moved an application before a magistrate court, seeking registration of FIR against the secretary. The magistrate court had dismissed the application while imposing a cost of Rs 25,000 on him. He had moved the sessions court against the order. The sessions court said the revision petition not only deserved to be dismissed, but the revisionist also deserved to be saddled with the cost for his “mischievous approach.” Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal said liberal access to justice should not be construed by anyone as a means to lead chaos and indiscipline and frivolous petitions should be penalised with heavy cost.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Many hospitals, but Old City struggles on health front||HYDERABAD: The Old City continues to gasp for proper healthcare facilities, especially for critical ailments. This, in spite it having four state-run tertiary centres, nearly 40 primary health centres and basthi dawa khanas, as well as scores of small hospitals. Osmania General Hospital, the only general tertiary centre, is often overlooked by residents who prefer privately-run multi-speciality hospitals elsewhere, unless they can’t afford paying for treatment. Petlaburg Government Maternity Hospital and Koti Maternity Hospital cater to pregnant women, but are swamped. Niloufer Hospital is the only centre for paediatric cases, leaving a need for more tertiary care general and paediatric centres. A major disadvantage for residents in this part of the city is that none of these major centres are located in the heart of Old City. This means that people tend to give preference to the numerous locally mushrooming hospitals or private hospitals farther away. Speaking about the limited number of large hospitals, Saeed Shaikh, a resident of Karwan, said, “Apart from two corporate hospitals having set up branches in upper middle class areas, none have branches in Old City.” Availing services at government-run centres is a hassle for many. Hundreds line up outside basthi dawakhans, which close down by noon. Added to this, is the high incidence of lifestyle and chronic diseases in Old City, as per surveys by local organisations. “This (limited facilities and worsening health conditions) has a significant impact on socio-economic front as it puts marginalized families in a vicious debt trap,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari founder helping hand foundation (HHF), which is running four PHCs in the Old City.  Askari said, “The resources at PHCs and basti dawakhans — that provide the first line of treatment — in terms of doctor and nurse availability needs to be increased, along with out-patient hours.” The absence of sufficient government-run options pushes people to private facilities, he said, adding, “expenses are a burden on a significant population, who find it extremely difficult to come out of debt.” For Anjum Saba Afsheen (27) from Chanchalguda a three-day hospitalization during the pandemic left her in debt. “I was having continuous fits. On tests, a brain tumour was detected. Since we were told that I won’t survive without immediate surgery, my family took a bank loan , apart from borrowing from relatives and friends to pay Rs 5.75 lakh bill. We are yet to return it,” said Anjum, who left her job due to her health. She depends on her brother who is the sole bread winner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/many-hosps-but-old-city-struggles-on-health-front/articleshow/87968648.cms||Amrita Didyala

Keeping the rise of flyers in view, the airport authority also envisaged enhancing facilities at the airport, which will soon get CISF security protection within a short time. The new taxi track aims to cut down flight’s take off time at the runway. Accordingly, the new terminal building will be equipped with all modern facilities to facilitate more international flight operations from the airport. Surat airport located on Bardoli-Hazira highway is spread over an area of 784.37 acres and belongs to the Airport Authority of India. At present domestic airlines including Air India, Alliance Air, SpiceJet, IndiGo, Go First, Star Air and Ventura Air connect the Diamond City to Delhi, Goa, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Bhavnagar, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Patna, Bhuvaneshwar and Kishangarh with its schedule flights in A320, A321, Boeing 737-800 aircraft. International flight operations also started from December 7, 2019 four times a week from the airport connecting Sharjah. Approximately 240 aircraft movements took place every week in 2019-2020. But, the lockdown hit flights and passenger movement which dropped drastically after March 2020. However, after the reopening, every week two international flights and almost 40 domestic flights are operating daily from the airport. Aman Saini, director, Surat airport said, “If we talk about physical progress, 41% work of terminal building is completed and 28% of taxi track is done. We hope to complete both next year. Currently, we have two aerobridges and after this new building comes up three more aerobridges will start.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/hi-tech-facilities-at-upcoming-terminal-taxi-track-to-make-surat-airport-fly-high/articleshow/87967998.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Home guard, 2 others, held for accident cover-up||HYDERABAD: Three persons, including a home guard, were arrested by Rachakonda police over an alleged attempt to help an accused in a hit-and-run case escape by taking a bribe. The home guard’s role came to light after Ghatkesar police nabbed the accused lorry driver. The police said B Shiva, a home guard in Ghatkesar police station, E Balaraju, a former home guard of Vanasthalipuram police station and his friend Dima Srinu were arrested based on the confession of lorry driver J Narasimha. On Thursday, Narasimha, who was driving a lorry, allegedly hit a car killing its occupant. B Shiva, who was driving patrol vehicle, reached the spot. Shiva asked the lorry driver to move ahead and park his vehicle. Meanwhile, in a coincidence, Balaraju telephoned Shiva to inform him that he along with Srinu had come to Ghatkesar police station in connection with the release of a vehicle, which had been there for a year. Shiva asked Balaraju to come to the crime scene and go to Narasimha and take his details. He did so in order to avoid the accused from seeing him in uniform and identifying him. Balaraju and Shiva, pretending to be Ghatkesar police constables, took Narasimha’s details. They called Shiva and updated him. Shiva then told Balaraju to demand Rs 20,000 from the lorry driver, as there was no witness to the accident. The driver paid the money and escaped. “Later, when we probed the case based on CCTV images, we identified the lorry. When we questioned the driver, we came to know that two persons, who claimed to be policemen, were bribed,” Ghatkesar inspector N Chandra Babu told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/home-guard-2-others-held-for-accident-cover-up/articleshow/87968658.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: After quarters, visually impaired batter eyes semis||DEHRADUN: His consistent knocks, best batsman tag for three consecutive seasons and a historic feat – state’s maiden entry into the quarterfinal stage of Nagesh Trophy, a premier domestic tournament for blind cricketers – justify the batting prowess of visually impaired Gambheer Chauhan, 20. For the first time, the team won all five league matches since the inception of Nagesh Trophy in 2018-19. The opener scored 394 runs in six matches, including a ton, against Puducherry. Though the Himalayan team lost the quarterfinal match, the players were satisfied as it was more about mettle than medal, they said. When the first edition started in 2018-19 season, Uttarakhand figured 23rd on the domestic list, but by the 4th edition in 2021-22, it clinched the 8th spot nationally. "Next year, we will aim for the semifinals," said Naresh Singh Nayal, coach of the Uttarakhand blind cricket team. But reaching the semifinals will depend on how Chauhan, a B2 (partially blind with visibility up to 3m) category player, fares. He has scored more than 1,100 runs in 20 matches that he has played in the premier blind T20 cricket competition. Coming from a humble background, Chauhan who belongs to Baila village of Chakrata block in Dehradun, does farming too. After the death of his father last year, he has been shouldering the responsibility of his mother and three siblings. The prize money he gets helps him run the house. Apart from that, his coach, people linked with his alma mater, National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities, and some locals also take care of his finances. "My focus is on the game right now. We train twice a day and make full use of the facilities at National Institute for the Empowerment of Persons with Visual Disabilities. My coach, Naresh, is trying to get a scholarship for me," said Chauhan. "India national blind cricket team’s captain Ajay Reddy has been an inspiration to me. I don’t want my disability to come in the way of my goal," he said. Chauhan was to compete in a tri-series against England and South Africa in March 2020, but the series got cancelled due to Covid-19. The cricketer is also a keen footballer and has participated in training camps of the national blind football team.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/after-quarters-visually-impaired-batter-eyes-semis/articleshow/87967977.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Amit Shah asks Amul to bat for organic farmers||GANDHINAGAR: Making a fervent pitch for organic farming, Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah asked Amul to work towards creating a network to market organic produce of farmers. He said that although the task is difficult, it will give farmers a fair price for their produce and reduce the country’s dependency on fertilizers. “I know this is not an easy task, but I want to tell the Amul team, someone has to take up this difficult work. When Tribhovandas Patel began the task (of organising cattle rearers) it was a difficult task,” Shah remarked. He added that, if required, the Centre was willing to assist financially. “If certain investment is necessary, bring a scheme. We will take it before the PM and bring about a solution,” the Union cooperation minister said. “There is a serious problem in the country because of fertilizers. It is damaging the soil. The prevalence of fertilizers has increased so much, that it is causing damage to the bodies of citizens,” said Shah He added that too much fertilizers is causing cancer and other serious ailments among people. “Organic farming products are good for both the health of people as well as the soil. “A large number farmers have realized this and adopted organic farming. But the main problem is that the farmers are not getting fair price for their produce,” the minister said. Providing examples, Shah said that organic wheat and wheat grown with the help of fertilizers are sold at the same price in the market and potatoes grown through organic farming fetch the same price as those grown by using fertilizers. “In some parts of the country and the world, there is an arrangement where farmers get up to three times the price if they grow crops using organic method,” said Shah, adding that about 2 lakh farmers in Gujarat have taken up organic farming, using cow dung and other natural nutrients for plants. “It will be difficult for these farmers to give up this experiment and the only way to increase the number of farmers taking up organic farming is by helping them get their right price for their produce,” Shah said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amit-shah-asks-amul-to-bat-for-organic-farmers/articleshow/87967981.cms||---

Senior scientist Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Theoretically, it is possible that the new variant of concern (Omicron) may challenge vaccines’ efficacy. But, we know that our vaccines prevent hospitalisation and death. People must take two doses of the vaccine and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, especially that of wearing a mask, to ward off infection from such variants.” Gangakhedkar is one of the 26 members of WHO team appointed to examine the origins of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 that cause pandemics. “There is not enough data yet to understand Omicron’s ability to evade vaccine or a natural infection-induced immune response. Hence, we should continue to enhance coverage in vaccine roll-out so that hospitalisation does not increase. Unvaccinated people must take two doses of the vaccine and those who have taken one dose must take the second dose at the earliest,” Gangakhedkar said. “More studies are needed to delineate whether previous exposure to the Delta strain or currently available vaccines will shield us against severe illness due to Omicron,” infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force, told TOI.  Prasad Kulkarni, Serum Institute of India’s vaccine expert, said that given the experience of other variants, including the highly contagious Delta, it is most likely that the vaccines, as well as the past infections, will give protection from Omicron. “So, we may not have to worry too much,” he said. “I don’t see any need for concern over Omicron. Prior infection and vaccination would definitely help against this variant in causing severe cases,” said Arvind Kushwaha I Community and preventive medicine expert AIIMS, Nagpur||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-covishield-covaxin-can-protect-against-omicron-claim-experts/articleshow/87969780.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The children along with their parents had come to Jaipur to meet their relatives residing in Bani Park. Out of eight cases reported in Jaipur, two were of the kids who have allegedly left for the US. “Before going to the US, they had got their Covid test done at a private diagnostic centre, the report of which came on Saturday. When we received information from the lab about the two kids testing positive, our teams reached the house where they were staying in Bani Park for contact tracing, but they informed us that they had already left Jaipur in their private vehicle and were travelling to the US,” said Dr Sharma, adding the health authorities confronted them how they allowed them to travel flouting Covid norms. “They said the children did not have any Covid symptoms and were healthy. They also have a declaration from a pediatrician mentioning that the children do not have Covid symptoms,” said Dr Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/kids-who-tested-covid-ve-fly-to-us-with-parents/articleshow/87968685.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Two other people fell ill after inhaling smoke. The fire had erupted in the electric duct on the second floor which spread up to the ninth floor of Ganesh Meridian building. As it was a Sunday, most offices in the 12-storeyed commercial building were shut. “This eliminated the need for an intense fire-fighting and rescue mission. The exact origin of the fire could not be ascertained so far,” said officers of the Ahmedabad fire and emergency services (AFES). A fire officer said, “The fire could have sparked from a half-lit cigarette or bidi thrown in the garbage bin or due to a short circuit.” “Kishan Meena, 16, who worked as an office boy at one of the firms on the second floor, panicked on seeing the fire, jumped and fractured his leg. He has been admitted to Sola Civil hospital,” said the fire officer. Nimit Shukla, a lawyer with an office on the sixth floor, fell ill after inhaling the smoke. He was rescued by the AFES personnel. The fire officer said they had to break several windowpanes to vent out the smoke. Sixty-four fire brigade personnel and three officers used seven fire tenders to douse the flames in half an hour. The smoke billowing from the building could be seen from Sola flyover where a traffic jam took place after the fire caught the attention of the commuters. Six shops gutted on Relief Road As many as six shops were gutted in a fire at a commercial building on Relief Road on Sunday. The fire took place at a garments shop in Aakar commercial centre. The fire spread to the third floor, damaging other shops. Six fire fighters, one hydraulic machine, two ambulances and 68 fire brigade personnel were deployed to the spot. They took 45 minutes to douse the fire. Traffic was halted till the fire was doused completely.

In his complaint with Navrangpura police on Saturday, victim Dharmesh Sharma, a 47-year-old resident of Chanakyapuri, filed a complaint for him and six others against accused Ramakant Sahu, a resident of Nikol who runs a financial consultancy office in CG Road area. Sharma, who runs a clock shop, said he had met Sahu when the latter was a bank representative and had provided him with a credit card this May. “In June, Sahu approached me again and said he had left the bank job. He told me he was helping those who suffered financial crisis during Covid-19 pandemic to secure loans. He told me that the government was providing subsidized loans under the ‘Vajpayi Bankable Scheme’ and that he could help me get a loan.  Sahu also approached Ashwin Mistry of Chanakyapuri, Asaram Verma of Chandlodia, Chandrika Nishad of Ghatlodia, Nitin Rathod and Zakir Qureshi of Saraspur and Murtuza Ahmed Shaikh of Shahpur. He duped them by getting them to pay processing fees for the loan,” Sharma told police. Sahu cheated them out of Rs 1.5 lakh before going incommunicado on July 25. Later, the victims approached police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust against Sahu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/seven-lose-rs-1-5l-in-covid-loan-fraud/articleshow/87968711.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: With tech park, EDMC wows one-stop solution for waste||NEW DELHI: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation has started trial runs on various technologies at its newly constructed Technology Park at New Jafrabad to process different kinds of municipal solid and liquid waste at one place. The one of-its-kind pilot project has been developed over a 1,000-sq-metre land provided by DDA. An EDMC dhalao has also been converted into a waste seg regation and processing facility. While the work on the project started in 2018 under the Waste to Wealth Mission at the behest of the principal scientific adviser, government of India, it is expected to become fully operational from December end, a senior EDMC official said. The project includes decentralised processing of all kind of solid and liquid waste through five different technologies/plants at one place, including collection of floating waste from drains, use of segregated waste for generating fuel in a controlled environment, processing of daily solid waste collected from the neighbourhoods and eliminating open waste dumping points (dhalaos). “The park has five units/plants of different capacities. A unit has been installed at a 52-cusec drain to collect all floating material and these are processed on the tech park premises. This drain is running parallel to the tech park site. Then, there are gasification and plazma pyrolysis plants, each of one tonne capacity. These plants will process combustible waste in a controlled environment with no emissions. The floating material, which mainly consists of plastic, wrappers, paper and related material, will be processed and incinerated into general fuel,” the official said. To meet the intake requirement of these plants, there is also a plan to install machines at the Gokalpur, Gandhi Nagar and SSBL drains soon for collecting floating material from there. Since these are pilot technologies, they would be tested and validated for a year by the PSA office. Thereafter, they will be managed by EDMC itself. Officials claimed that the focus of project was on achieving zero garbage dumping at sanitary landfill sites and treating all kind of waste in a decentralised way. “The STP plant is of 5KLD capacity. It will recycle the drain water for operation of technologies and the irrigation of green areas,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/with-tech-park-edmc-vows-one-stop-solution-for-waste/articleshow/87968691.cms||Vibha Sharma

Difficulty in accessing healthcare services caused many patients to skip sessions which had a long-term impact. The number of dialysis patients registered under the Aarogyasri scheme of the state government went up from 5,598 in 2014-2015 to 10,848 in 2019-20. But the following year, as the pandemic hit, the numbers went down to 10,610. “A majority who had enrolled did not visit for timely dialysis sessions during the pandemic due to the fear of the virus. Also, there had been huge rush at centres and due to the limited number of beds and technicians available during the peak pandemic, many could not avail services even when they wanted. As these patients are more prone to getting severe Covid, many could not make it,” said an official from the state health department, adding that the load on the government dialysis centres went up by nearly four times during pandemic. A large number of patients who availed services at private hospitals too could not afford the additional cost of treatment during the pandemic due to the use of PPE kits and other safety gear. Many of them succumbed too. Patients who couldn’t access services at private hospitals veered to government centres. “Many chronic kidney disease patients undergoing dialysis in private hospitals had to spend three to four times the base cost of dialysis per session during the peak of pandemic. This put tremendous pressure on their pockets and many switched to free dialysis in state-run hospitals, which significantly enhanced the load on the public health system,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, founder, Helping Hand Foundation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/covid-cloud-250-dependent-on-dialysis-at-govt-centres-died/articleshow/87968675.cms||Amrita Didyala

Another five inmates who are suspected to be infected have also been hospitalised. The area has been declared a containment zone. Importantly, 60 of the 62 infected were fully vaccinated, the health department said.  An inmate was the first to test positive on Friday after he was screened at a private facility. Thereafter, a team of government doctors visited the Matoshree old age home in Sorgaon village in rural Bhiwandi on Saturday and tested 109 inmates, said Dr Manish Renghe, district health officer. Following the tests, the cluster of cases was discovered. Among the relatives of the staffers who came positive are a pregnant woman and a girl aged two and a half years. It is one of the biggest clusters to be detected in recent months from Thane district. Among the 62, all 55 elders are fully vaccinated, as are four of the staffers, with one having taken a single dose. Among staff relatives, the pregnant woman is fully vaccinated. An international academic report that came out in May this year outlined the risk factors for Covid-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs). As frontliners battling the pandemic, they are most at risk of acquiring the infection for being directly or indirectly exposed to infectious material. While the pandemic has placed immense pressure on health systems, experts have pointed out the need for healthcare providers to ensure vaccination and devise protocols on how best to distribute scarce resources equitably between HWCs and patients.  The 55 Matoshree inmates, all above 60 years of age, were admitted to Thane Civil Hospital for treatment early on Sunday. Of the total infected, one male patient is admitted in ICU while six others are in general wards. Among the total positive cases, 39 are male. Around 41 patients have comorbidities, while 32 are showing symptoms. The pregnant woman and child have been admitted to the civil hospital.  Dr Renghe said Sorgaon has been declared as a containment zone and the district administration is keeping a tab on the health of other inmates. “We are taking adequate steps to curb further spread of the infection,” he said. At least 15 samples from the cluster are likely to be sent for genome sequencing, he added.  Meanwhile, 108 new patients were added in Thane district on Sunday, taking the total count of positive patients to 5.69 lakh. No death was reported in the district, maintaining the tally of Covid fatalities at 11,581. The count of active positive patients was 1,062 on Sunday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-62-in-bhiwandi-old-age-home-covid-ve-60-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/87969341.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The government’s decision comes in the wake of its initiative to promote caravan tourism in the state. According to top government sources, motor vehicles department (MVD) offices have been receiving inquiries for operating camper vans that are common in several western countries, but permissions were denied as the interpretation of the existing rules proved to be a hindrance. After the government announced its caravan tourism policy, the tourism director had forwarded a proposal based on submissions from tour operators, seeking permission to operate camper trucks, built with camping facilities on light goods vehicles (LGVs) chassis with cargo body and having a maximum seating capacity of five persons. The government set up a technical committee under the motor vehicles department (MVD) to examine the proposal in detail and compare it with the design parameters and the permitted limits in the central motor vehicles rules (CMVR) 1989. The committee reported that building a closed body or reconstruction of the existing one can be permitted if changes are not made on the basic features of the chassis frame. Hence, such construction or reconstruction is admissible subject to the maximum statutory limitation of the rear overhang of such vehicles, which can be up to 60% of the wheelbase, as per the rules. On the basis of the committee’s report, the transport commissioner cleared the proposal for approval. Camper trucks are widely operated in several states within the country as well. “The decision can be a major fillip to the tourism sector, which is a major industry in our state and it cannot remain isolated from the modern trends in the tourism sector. The proposal of the tourism director is in conformance with the CMVR,” secretary (transport) Biju Prabhakar said. Because of the prevalence of multiple stringent environmental laws, the lack of accommodation facilities has been holding the tourism sector back in exploring several exotic locations. “Of course, such laws are mandatory to secure our fragile environment, but a viable solution is also required for ensuring that the tourism sector also does not suffer. The permission for operating camper trucks is one such win-win solution for such a problem,” principal secretary (tourism) V Venu said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/caravan-tourism-to-ride-on-camper-vans/articleshow/87968046.cms||KP Saikiran

This was the third such email in a week. At 1.37am on Sunday, Gambhir received an email that stated: “Your Delhi Police and IPS Shweta (DCP) cannot uproot anything. Our spies are also present in the police. All the information is being received about you (sic).” A police officer told TOI: “We are trying to find out the source of the email. This time, the threat was sent from a new email ID.” Gambhir had received similar threats on Tuesday and Wednesday. This prompted the police to intensify security around his Rajinder Nagar residence. The first email, sent on Tuesday, read: “We are going to kill you and your family.” The second email stated: “We intended to kill you, but you survived yesterday. If you love the life of your family, stay away from politics and Kashmir issue (sic).”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fresh-threat-to-gambhir-3rd-in-a-week/articleshow/87968719.cms||---
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Link officers to assist prosecutors||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has attached two link officers with every special public prosecutor (SPP) involved in handling the Northeast Delhi riots cases. Sources said the move came in the light of adverse observations made by courts about the absence of the SPPs from hearings. Now, the link officers will attend a hearing if the SPP is absent. According to the police, link officers are also special public prosecutors. The order accessed by TOI stated that a very crucial issue regarding the absence of SPPs handling riot cases had cropped up on different occasions and, accordingly, pointed out by the DCP (Northeast) office. "The court has also pointed out this issue and commented that such absences impede the proceedings unnecessarily," the document read. "Keeping in view the severity of the issue and in the interest of successful trial of riot cases, a mechanism has been evolved in the form of appointment of two links SPPs in respect of every SPP for better representation of riot cases before the court (sic)," it added. According to police sources, the issue was also discussed at a meeting held with SPPs and senior officers of Delhi Police. An additional sessions judge had written to the Delhi Police commissioner as well, telling him to look into the matter. According to the order, 12 SPPs were assigned two link officers each, who in the absence of the former, can attend the court proceedings. Deputy commissioner of police (Northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain, who wrote the order, has told the SPPs to follow the mechanism strictly so that no such issue emerged in future. When asked about the absence of SPPs, an officer (requesting anonymity) said health issues and engagement in other courts were among the reasons. "We have also sent a proposal to the Delhi government for giving district police two more SPPs," the officer added. When contacted, DCP Sain confirmed the development and said they had taken various corrective steps in this matter. Meanwhile, five inspectors who were involved in probing riot cases, were recently transferred to different units of Delhi Police. "PHQ has now reattached these inspectors with riot cells (formed at the police station and district level)," a source confirmed. A central review cell was also created in the Northeast district for riot-related probe. The central review cell comprises legal experts and is supported by police officers. "The prime focus of the review cell is to ensure compliance with court directions and a review of pending investigation cases," an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ne-riots-link-officers-to-assist-prosecutors/articleshow/87968725.cms||Abhay Singh

The state education department had announced the reopening of schools from Std I onwards on Thursday during the state cabinet meeting, but without an official notification, the schools have said that they would not issue any circular to their parents and students although they were prepared fully to welcome the children. Vidya Pratishthan’s Magarpatta City Public School has reopened for Stds VIII to X and is getting full attendance. Principal Chandrika Banerjee said, “We have a strong task force and we are following all the SOPs laid down by the government. Our students and their parents are relieved. Parents have appreciated the ways in which we have been taking care of our students. We would like to reopen our school for Std I to VII as well. We are awaiting the decision taken by the civic body and the official notification. We are all prepared to welcome our children back to school. They are eager to come back too.” Principal of C P Goenka International School, Rashmi Gupta said that they will wait for the government resolution then seek parent consent and provide hybrid classes. “Our school is already operating for Stds VIII to XII and Covid protocols and hybrid models are in place. They will continue. It is a mixed feeling, and a few parents want to send their children to school, but others want to wait forvaccinationd,” she added. A study by Azim Premji Foundation among 16,000 students in five states in age group six to 11 found that 92% had lost one specific language ability and 82% lost some mathematical ability.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/schools-wait-for-notification-on-reopening/articleshow/87968721.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Surat||Three loot Rs 15L from 80-year-old garment businessman in Surat||SURAT: An 80-year-old garment businessman and his grandson were robbed of Rs 15.25 lakh in cash on Friday night near the city light area while returning home from their store. Three unidentified robbers were riding moped and allegedly threw chilli powder on their faces before the loot. Umra police have registered an offence against unknown accused and are investigating. According to police sources, Anand Lalchand Panjabi runs ‘Mahima fashion’, a ladies garment store at Moti Begumwadi while his grandson 18-year-old Yash Jethanand Aburani helps him in the business. On Friday night, both of them were returning home to Chandan park society in the city light area at about 9pm. While passing near Tirth studio, a moped came in front of their car and the riders forcefully stopped the vehicle. Before the two could understand the situation, one of the moped riders opened the door on the driver side and sprinkled chilli powder on Yash’s face while also slapping him hard and trying to pull him out of the car. Meanwhile, another attacker sprinkled more chilli powder on the elderly man’s face too. Amid the ruckus, a third accomplice looted two bags containing Rs 15.25 lakh cash from the car and the trio fled the scene. Yash called up his father, who took them home. After their suffering from burning sensation became bearable, the duo went to Umra police station and filed a loot complaint. Police suspect the attack to be an insider job and said that the accused must be knowing about the money and their daily route. Cops are gathering CCTV footage from the area to identify the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/3-loot-rs-15l-from-80-year-old-garment-bizman-in-surat/articleshow/87968036.cms||---

While the construction of smart footpaths on the stretch between Dengle Bridge and Tilak Bridge resulted in the electricity connection here being disconnected, senior PMPML officials had no clue about the work conditions of their junior employees. “There is no electricity in the control room located in the PMC area near the bus shelters. Things have become increasingly difficult and working without electricity in the evening and at night is a major problem. We have to depend on our mobile phones for light after the sun sets,” a PMPML ticket checker told TOI. The PMC area has around five to six bus shelters and 200-odd PMPML buses carrying out 10 times the number of rides. “This is the busiest area as far as PMPML operations go. Our job is to ensure that the buses leave on time and the drivers report to the control room before and after trips. For the last two months, there is no power in the control room. We have heard that the PMC is constructing smart footpaths in the area and hence, power has been disconnected. There are no streetlights either as a result,” another checker said. Shrinivas Kandul, head of the electrical department at PMC, told TOI that there was no electricity here mainly due to Pune Metro work. He admitted to TOI, “Due to the construction, the electricity poles have been removed. We have spoken with Metro officials and have discussed a plan to provide temporary power in the area. We will do it soon.” PMPML traffic manager Dattatray Zende told TOI, “We will immediately talk to officials on ways to sort out this problem,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/no-power-for-pmpml-staffers-near-pmc-hq/articleshow/87968744.cms||Joy Sengupta

His wife Shilpa, 42, and son Keosha, 14, and his daughter will join him in the spiritual journey. “I decided to renounce family life and conveyed the decision to my family. They immediately suggested that they do the same,” Sanghvi told TOI. “We have seen all aspects of life. We have seen the struggles of a middle-class family and also the riches the business brought us that enabled us to see countries from Europe to Africa and also the US and Singapore.” He added: “But seeking the blessings of a guru will eventually bring happiness.” In a historic event, no fewer than eight families are taking diksha under the guidance of Yogtilaksureshwarji Maharaj. In all, 75 diksharthis will be part of the event on Monday. The organizers said that 14 are crorepatis and come from Gujarat and Maharashtra. Amish Dalal, 55, is a practising chartered accountant and company secretary based in Mumbai. “My firm’s turnover is in crores. But after all these years, it’s not what gives me happiness,” said Dalal. “I seek the grace of religion and walk on the path of self-discovery.” Dalal’s family hails from Khambhat in Gujarat and he was a top ranker in his student days. Ravindra Shah, a trustee overseeing the event, said that the diksharthis are from 7 to 70 years and come from all walks of life. In all, 38 men and 37 women will take diksha. “It’s perhaps the biggest diksha mahotsav at which so many diksharthis will become Jain sadhus and sadhvis,” said Hitesh Mota, one of the organizers. “At an earlier event, about 69 had taken diksha.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/75-including-all-from-8-families-to-take-diksha/articleshow/87968084.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Pune||Covishield, Covaxin can protect against Omicron, claim experts||PUNE: Covishield and Covaxin jabs can prevent hospitalisation and death that may come with the new Botswana variant Omicron (B.1.1.529), the nCoV’s most mutated version as yet, virologists and infectious diseases experts have said. Senior scientist Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Theoretically, it is possible that the new variant of concern (Omicron) may challenge vaccines’ efficacy. But, we know that our vaccines prevent hospitalization and death and the same may be potent against the Omicron variant. People must take two doses of the vaccine and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, especially that of wearing a mask, to ward off infection from such variants.” Gangakhedkar is one of the 26 members of WHO team appointed to examine the origins of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 that cause pandemics. “There is not enough data yet to understand Omicron’s ability to evade vaccine or a natural infection-induced immune response. Hence, we should continue to enhance coverage in vaccine roll-out so that hospitalisation does not increase. Unvaccinated people must take two doses of the vaccine and those who have taken one dose must take the second dose at the earliest,” Gangakhedkar said. The vaccines’ second dose ensures that it boosts not only the virus-specific antibodies but also the T cells (T-lymphocytes) which are memory cells and part of the broader immune response against the virus, Gangakhedkar said, advising strict adherence to the two-dose regime. Disease-causing properties of this variant like transmissibility, potential to cause severity, and immune evasion either from vaccination or previous infection with other variants is unclear as yet. “More studies are needed to delineate whether previous exposure to the Delta strain or currently available vaccines will shield us against severe illness due to Omicron,” infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force, told TOI. India’s advantage lies in the knowledge that a majority of the population has encountered the virus and acquired immunity, senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said. “Natural infection exposes the whole virus to the immune system of our body priming the memory or T cells to recognize any future intrusions by the same or closely related viruses which include new variants,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/covishield-covaxin-can-act-against-new-variant-experts/articleshow/87968722.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Birdcount returns after pandemic break, some rare sightings delight enthusiasts||NEW DELHI: Much to the delight of nature lovers, some rare species were sighted during the Delhi Winter Birdcount 2021 on Sunday. Though the report on the diversity of the birds will be compiled in a couple of days, birders expect the final count to be 250, just like the previous years. In 2019, around 250 species were sighted at the Delhi Winter Birdcount, while the number was 241 in 2018 and 252 in 2017. However, the annual exercise was not conducted in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Among the rare sightings made this year were Eurasian griffon at Yamuna river, great bittern at Najafgarh lake, Marshall’s iora, and white-bellied drongo at Mangar village and Bhondsi forest. Birders said after many years, successful nestings of black-necked storks were seen at Sultanpur National Park. At the park, heronry is vibrant with nesting of painted storks too. “Another interesting sighting was of brood parasitism made at Sanjay Van where a jungle babbler was seen feeding the common hawk-cuckoo,” said Chandra Bhushan Maurya, a birder. For the bird count, nearly 20 important sites were covered in Delhi-NCR. The small groups of birders, along with volunteers, registered the sightings on eBird portal, which is the global database to record the species. Most of the birds were registered through direct sightings, but some were recognised through their sound. “Most forest and garden birds, both migratory and resident, make distinctive sounds, calls and songs. Experienced birders are able to identify them through their sound,” said Kanwar B Singh, one of the organisers of the event. At Najafgarh lake, winter ducks have begin to arrive in good numbers. Key sightings of winter ducks included greylag geese, northern pintail, common pochard, northern shovellers, gadwall and Eurasian coot. Raptors, such as greater spotted eagles, imperial eagle, osprey, hen harrier, marsh harrier and booted eagle, were also sighted. A flock of about two dozen Eurasian cranes was the highlight here. Though a rare sighting of Eurasion griffon was witnessed on the Yamuna, birders feel that the site has been disturbed. “Not many bird species were seen at the Yamuna as the site has been disturbed. Mining along the river banks, cultivation and less water have disturbed the habitat of birds,” said Singh. The teams had covered the river stretch from Palla to Okhla. While there was a delayed arrival of migratory birds this year due to frequent rain and late withdrawal of monsoon, birders feel that most species have now arrived. "After a late arrival of migratory birds this year, most of the species have reached the region, but their numbers seem low in comparison with last year. The surplus rain led to waterlogging and many waterbodies became suitable spots for the birds. As migratory birds found good habitats mid-way, some of them did not travel a long distance," said birder Jaswinder Waraich. Apart from migratory birds, many resident and passive migratory birds were seen in the city. Some of them were citrine wagtail, ashy drongo, Indian grey hornbill, oriental magpie robin, common hawk-cuckoo, brahminy starling and Indian spot-billed duck.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/birdcount-returns-after-pandemic-break-some-rare-sightings-delight-enthusiasts/articleshow/87968750.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The commission has already informed some schools, prompting them to rejig their offline classes and exam schedule. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls will be the first Covid-period election when schools are open for offline classes and examinations. In several city schools, which will be used as polling booths, ISC exams are being held. And they must hold the environmental science Paper-1 on December 17 and accounts paper on December 20. The polling day (December 19) is a Sunday. Jodhpur Park Boys’ School was informed by the SEC that its premises will be used as the Distribution Centre and Receiving Centres (DCRC) for EVMs. The school expects it will receive the formal orders on Monday. “Because it is a DCRC, we expect the school to be handed over (to SEC) immediately and we expect to get it back on December 23,” said principal Amit Sen Majumdar. The school had already prepared its schedule for the Class X tests in an offline mode along with class IX year-end papers. “These will be postponed,” he said. New Alipore Multipurpose School was closed on November 26 as the SEC conducted training for poll officials. The authorities say they will get to know on Monday whether the SEC will be using the school premises for other poll-related activities. “In that case, we have to rejig our school schedule,” said a senior teacher. The BSS School also has polling booths but hasn’t received any intimation till now, said principal Sunita Sen. Some city schools, which will conduct ISC examinations on December 17 and 19, are waiting for SEC instructions. A few others have already been informed. Future Foundation school in Tollygunge has been informally conveyed that it will continue to have polling booths like in the past. “There are polling stations in our school. It will be the same this year. Given the fact that we must conduct the ISC examinations the very next day after the elections, we will make adequate arrangements. But we are waiting for a formal information to decide on the arrangements to be made,” said principal Ranjan Mitter. La Martiniere also has polling booths. La Martiniere secretary Supriyo Dhar said: “Arrangements will be made once we get the final information.” Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujay Biswas also said they were waiting for the SEC information. “Our school has polling booths. We are waiting for the detailed information.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/class-rejig-for-civic-election/articleshow/87968724.cms||---

It was in September 15 that the state had reported 49 cases. With the president on a two-day visit to the state, health department is testing all its staffers before deploying them on duty. “The 19 duty officers who tested positive for Covid have come from different parts of the state like Pauri and Chamoli, etc,” said Dr Praveen Kumar, chief medical officer, Pauri Garhwal. Of the 19, one dozen are cops while the remaining are officials from different departments of state government. The new strain has increased the worries of state authorities, with contact tracing as well as genome sequencing becoming all the more imperative to contain the highly contagious ‘Omicron’ variant of Covid-19. Incidentally, just like the previous year, this year too, in the same chronology, first the cases came from IGNFA, then Chakrata and now Pauri, raising fear and concern among locals regarding the possibility of a third wave of Covid in the state. Meanwhile, two days ago, a junior commission officer and three others in an Army battalion in Dehradun district were found to be Covid positive. “The JCO’s 57 contacts were traced and tested for the virus, of whom three from his battalion were found infected. Everyone is doing fine and they are simply under the supervision of health authorities for their speedy recovery,” said Dr Rajive Dixit from health department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/19-officers-on-prez-duty-found-covid-positive-ukhand-records-highest-daily-count-at-36/articleshow/87968067.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Ahmedabad||Container rates confine exports||High ocean freight prices coupled with container and vessel shortage continue to haunt exporters as the spike in shipping costs has taken a toll on exports of several goods. These include low-value commodities such as dehydrated onions, salt, and plastic products. Although container rates have eased in the recent weeks, they are still double or triple of what they were before the pandemic. The container rates have hardened at a time when manufacturers across industries are battling spiralling raw material and fuel costs. Dehydrated onions: Movement dries up For instance, increased shipping charges have made the exports of dehydrated onions, considered a low-value product, unviable. American buyers order dehydrated onions from India only when the cost is lesser than in their own country. "American importers are currently not placing any orders as high freight rates have driven up the landed cost of dehydrated onions," said Vittal Koradiya, an exporter from Mahuva. The coastal town of Bhavnagar district is the hub of onion dehydration industry in India. Russian and European buyers have turned to China and Egypt, respectively, for sourcing dehydrated onions. The proximity factor helps in lowering freight charges. According to industry players, 75,000 tonnes of processed onions were exported in 2020-21. However, exporters hope to end the current fiscal with 65,000 tonnes. Clothing, apparel & chemical makers face delays  Container availability has become a challenge for most exporters, which in turn is leading to major delays in shipping consignments. Industry players suggest that containers for shipments which were available within a day are now taking at least 20 days to a month. This is leading to substantial delays in shipments. "With the availability of containers being erratic, export shipments are getting significantly delayed," said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India. Mehta added: "In such cases, international buyers are either insisting on sending shipments by air or cancelling orders." He said in both these scenarios, exporters will be at a loss because they will either have to shell out more to ship the order or end up losing the order and revenues. Order delays and cancellations are also affecting the profitability of exporters. Industry players said that in some cases, clients are getting the consignments air-lifted. "The entire apparel consignment of the winter collection should have been shipped by now," said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham, Gujarat state council. "However, due to the container shortage, the shipments are significantly delayed." Thaker added: "Some orders are still being shipped and the manufacturers are losing their goodwill that comes with timely delivery." Thaker went on to say: "At the same time, exporters have to bear higher costs for the same shipments."Some shipping lines have increased freight charges by 100% to 400%, said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). Patel added: "With the increased cost of shipments, the profit margins of manufacturers are getting thinner, which is impacting the viability of business." He went on to say: "With stretched payment cycles and lower profitability, the overall growth of the industry is being impaired." Salt makers feel the pinch For low-value commodities, the cost of shipping gets higher than the value of the products. Salt is one such item, exports of which to China declined by 30% last year and the reduction is expected to be the same this year as well. Chinese buyers are not placing orders due to high freight rates, said salt manufacturers. India’s salt production is estimated to drop to 1.70 crore tonnes in 2021-22 from 2.20 crore tonnes in 2020-21 due to the cyclone Tauktae and the extended monsoon this year. The reduction in production will push the consumption of salt that could not be exported due to firm shipping charges, salt makers added. Gujarat alone accounts for 76% of India’s total salt production. Ceramics, agriculture sectors take a hit Ceramic exports remained buoyant even amid the pandemic-induced slowdown. However, the circumstances have changed this year due to container shortage and high freight rates. "The container freight costs have started easing but they are still very high and nowhere near normal," said K G Kundariya, former president, Morbi Ceramic Association (MCA). "The volume of ceramic exports has come down by 50% over the past four months and the volume was down 30% two months before that." Ceramic tiles worth Rs 13,000 crore are exported annually from Morbi, which is India’s largest cluster of the ceramic industry. High ocean freight rates have escalated the cost of the locally made agriculture equipment by 30-40%, said Dinesh Khanpara, president, Gujarat Agriculture Machinery Manufacturing Association. "We make agri-equipment at rates cheaper than that of our competitors in the European countries," Khanpara said. "However, the surge in container charges has deprived the local manufacturers of the cost advantage in the export market." He added: "India’s traditional buyers from African and Gulf countries are now ordering from European manufacturers." He said European products now cost as much as Indian products.

Media persons in Kanyakumari district were taken on a tour of the centre on Sunday. Research is on in this centre to produce flowers of varieties preferred by consumers with good quality and in colours that are in demand. The collector said that the aim of the research center was to produce quality flowers in varieties such as sampangi, arali, rose, kenthi, chrysanthemum, cockscomb firecracker flower, and vadamalli and enhance their production. Cultivation of exotic flowers like orchids, anthurium and telegonina, which would have longer stems to make them suitable for decorations, have longer life and are resistant to pests and diseases were also being under research here. Intercropping of flowering plants with cash crops like banana and coconut was also under study. Growing of flowers that were not under mass cultivation besides producing jasmine in the off-season was another important work at this station. Arali, a flower that is found in almost all the districts in the state, grow on the roadsides and in commercial and also private gardens. The varieties of this flower were brought from across the state and research showed that the arali flower, N1-15 grown in Rasipuram is robust and produces quality flowers throughout the year, he said. The oil extraction from flowers for production of scent and other cosmetics would help farmers immensely when the flowering season is at its peak and flower fetch less prices, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/research-underway-at-thovalai-floriculture-centre-for-mass-cultivation-of-rare-flowers/articleshow/87968757.cms||---

The Pune rural has recorded vaccination of 92% (32.75 lakh) beneficiaries against its target of 35.75 lakh adults. The collector has asked the respective gram panchayats to prepare a list of the villages, which are lagging behind in the vaccination by Sunday and even take the help of the private organization to achieve the target. The district collector has asked gram sevaks, health department staff members, Asha and Anganwadi helpers to visit households and prepare a list of the beneficiaries. It should include beneficiaries that are yet to take the first dose and those who are due for the second dose. Deshmukh said the 57.03% second dose rate was quite slow considering the district had ample availability of the vaccine. To make people aware of the vaccination, the collector has asked for urgent awareness drives to be conducted via social media and the gram panchayat information board. He has asked to put the list of unvaccinated people on the notice board of respective villages and counsel the beneficiaries. According to Deshmukh, from December 1 onwards, every single beneficiary should be vaccinated with at least the first dose. If anyone is left out, the respective village’s gram sevak, talathi, health officials and other government officials would be held responsible and action under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 would be taken against them. The Pune ZP health department said at least over 450 villages in the district were now 100% vaccinated with the first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/collector-for-first-dose-completion-in-rural-parts/articleshow/87968746.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Netas get into campaign mode on first Sunday after list announcement||KOLKATA: Some went for shopping at local markets, some went to meet morning walkers at local parks and even played football and badminton with young voters, while some others visited the highrises or went for traditional door-to-door visits. TMC and Left candidates across the city reached out to voters on the first Sunday after the announcement of candidates. Former councillor and borough chairman Sushanta Ghosh, who is contesting from a new ward, started the day early. He went to markets and popular joints across Kalilapur and other areas before visiting two complexes — Happy Nook and Rail Vihar. “The plan is simple. Meet the voters and get to know their pain points. And no time is better than a Sunday morning for that,” said Ward 108’s TMC candidate Ghosh. Bhowanipore’s Ward 70 candidate Asim Basu had singer and former BJP minister Babul Supriyo by his side as he campaigned among local clubs playing football with young voters. Mamata Banerjee got 1,700-vote lead from this ward in the bypoll — for the first time in three elections. “Our party’s slogan is Khela Hobe and there is no better way to kick off a campaign than with an early-morning game of football,” said Babul. Beliaghata MLA and veteran leader Paresh Pal, who had lost the civic election from Ward 29 in 2015, was back with fresh zeal while campaigning from a new ward — Ward 31 — as he visited multiple local clubs, playing badminton and carom with the members. “Everyone knows me here and I know all of them. I don’t need to campaign only during the election,” said Pal. While some TMC poll veterans like Debasis Kumar, Mala Roy and Debabrata Majumdar went from door to door, meeting voters in Garcha first Lane or Dover Terrace and Tollygunge, Atin Ghosh started his day from Hatibagan. “The puja committees and local clubs have have been putting up flex, banners and distributing leaflets for me. That leaves me with some time to campaign for other candidates,” said Ghosh. Outgoing mayor Firhad Hakim was on the road in Chetla with his daughter Priyadarshini. A large group of supporters, wearing masks with Hakim’s photograph, were with them. “I keep in touch with voters in my area all through the year. But still I take these campaigns very seriously as it gives us an opportunity to take note of their grievances,” said Hakim. For the CPM, several wards in Behala saw the party cadres finishing “walling” for its candidates at several places. Wards 126 and 127 are presently held by the CPM. Many old timers remembered the times when the party never lost from these seats. “The issues in KMC elections are more local and the battle will be different,” said a senior CPM leader. The Left Front has also enlisted a number of Red Volunteers. “During Covid, we, the red volunteers were on the road helping people. People wouldn’t forget that,” said Ward 123 candidate Prasenjit Mukherjee. Congress leaders like Prakash Upadhyay and Santosh Pathak were also on the road reaching out to people on Sunday morning. “At ward 29, none can beat me,” said Upadhyay, who had won the last two elections from this ward.

---||Mumbai||Maha Vikas Aghadi improved health infrastructure, turned crisis into an opportunity: Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: The health infrastructure raised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) during the Covid-19 pandemic are permanent and will enable Maharashtra to fight diseases and epidemics in future, said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, on the second anniversary of his government. Most of the MVA government’s tenure, Thackeray said, has been spent on combating the pandemic.  “There is no negativity in the government and administration while tackling the pandemic. We did not panic during natural and human-made calamities, rather converted a crisis into an opportunity. Everyone can see the huge difference in health and medical infrastructure before the pandemic and now,” said the CM, in a written communication as he recovers from a spine surgery at a private hospital. The government, he said, spent Rs 2,600 on upgrading hospitals and 14.4 lakh people have been treated free of cost under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Referring to infrastructure development works in the state, he said the Mumbai-Nagpur Balasaheb Thackeray Samruddhi Expressway would be commissioned soon. Terming Mumbai ‘India’s growth engine’, Thackeray said the coastal road and trans-harbour link would revolutionise travel in the entire metropolitan region. The government is creating a strong network of roads and metros across the state even as it is mindful of protecting the environment, he added. Thanking citizens for supporting the “people’s government”, Thackeray said the MVA has fulfilled its promise of loan waiver to farmers. Under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Karjmukta Yojana, the state has waived off over Rs 20,000 crore in loans. Farmers, he said, suffered on account of various natural calamities, but each time the state offered relief more than prescribed under the National Disaster Response Fund norms. The MVA is also working on a master plan on relief measures to be offered to farmers in case of calamities. The state also offered financial aid to workers from the informal sector, and orphans and widows who have suffered due to Covid. His government, the CM said, has been recognised internationally for its efforts on mitigating the effects of climate change. “The Inspiring Regional Leadership Award was bestowed on the state at the recently held COP26 conference in Scotland. The state also bagged the maximum number of awards in the Centre’s Swachchta Survey,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cm-mva-improved-health-infra-turned-crisis-into-an-opportunity-in-mumbai/articleshow/87969801.cms||---
---||Pune||Keen to upskill, 8 blind girls learn basic German||PUNE: Eight visually challenged girls have cleared the A1 certification exam (first level) in German language from the Goethe Institute-Max Mueller Bhavan, Pune. Shravani Nandwadekar from Kolhapur, Vaibhavi Gavli from Dehu, Akshada Muthe and Monica Bhalerav from Aurangabad, Pooja Raykar from Uruli Devachi, Chaitrali Gayakwad from Osmanabad, Kaveri Khairnar from Kondhapuri, and Pradnya Gaware from Ahmednagar, battled odds to learn the language. All eight are students of the National Federation of Blind, Maharashtra’s Jagriti School for Blind Girls, and marked their achievement in one go. “It started with a vision of learning a foreign language – a skill that they enjoyed, which could also give them a good career opportunity,” Aarti Takawane, the teacher who proposed the foreign language course in the curriculum, said. They began with online classes twice a week, but without a hands-on learning in German Braille. “They showed keen interest and dedication and picked up the language. Within eight months, they were ready to take the A1 certification examination. We coordinated with Max Mueller Bhavan and the staff was supportive,” German teacher Shailaja Rege said. Conducting the A1 exam for these girls was an experience. “We were amazed by the enthusiasm and confidence,” Sonal Atre, examination in-charge at Goethe Institute, said. The exam date was on October 30, the day the MSRTC strike began. Some examinees came from villages and public bus transport was the only option to reach the centre on Boat Club Road in Pune. “We were worried about making it on time for the exam. I am in Std X and it was very difficult to study the regular syllabus along with a foreign language. But, our teachers helped us space the studies. We did not want everyone’s efforts to go in vain,” Shravani, one of the students, said. Everyone was brought together and a private car was arranged. At the centre, the exam paper was in German Braille, which confused the girls. After some initial setback, they managed to read the paper and respond. All eight girls are now set to study A2 level. “I have started receiving calls from other blind schools across India for mentoring students. Our second batch includes four boys from the Bhosari Blind School,” Takawane said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/keen-to-upskill-8-blind-girls-learn-basic-german/articleshow/87968758.cms||Rucha Limaye
---||Kochi||Cops take Syju for evidence collection||Kochi: Crime branch probing the mystery behind the deaths of three persons (including two models) in an accident near Vyttila, on Sunday collected evidence along with Syju M Thankachan, who had followed the ill-fated car in an Audi car. A senior officer with the investigation team said that Thankachan was made to identify the Audi car in which he followed the victims on the fateful night. “The Audi car was inspected in his presence on Sunday. We also made him identify other persons who had attended the party on that night. We are questioning him thoroughly to identify the exact conversation between him and those in the car which met with the accident when he followed them,” said the officer. A magistrate court in Ernakulam had on Saturday granted Thankachan in three-day custody of police. The remaining accused in the case, including the owner of the hotel where the party took place and the driver of the ill-fated car, were earlier granted bail by the court despite police seeking them in custody. However, the court had approved the custody application in the case of Thankachan. Thankachan was arrested for allegedly stalking the women and abetting culpable homicide caused due to over speeding. Police sources said that the investigation team will also probe the alleged links of the accused with people involved in drug cases. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer and Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan and their friend Mohammad Ashiq had died in the accident when they were returning after a party at a hotel in Fort Kochi on November 1. The investigators later found CCTV footage showing the car of Thankachan following their car. The police team had earlier seized Thankachan’s mobile phone as part of the investigation. Police submitted before the court that he knew that Abdul Rahman, who was driving the ill-fated car was drunk. Police said that he was stalking the models by following their car from Hotel No 18 after the night party in the early hours of November 1. Police submitted that his actions made those in the ill-fated car panic, and it eventually led to the speeding and the accident.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cops-take-syju-for-evidence-collection/articleshow/87968104.cms||---

In government schools, teachers have had to try to bridge the learning gap with a 45-day refresher course since schools reopened for Class XII in September. They covered Class XI syllabus and important foundational concepts for Class XII. “We have had to focus only on basics for students till mid-October. In the past month, we have delved into Class XII syllabus,” said S Vennila Devi, Class XII Chemistry teacher at Government HSS, Paraipatti. Teachers said their focus is only on board exams and students have also started getting into the mindset. A district-level model test for 50 marks will be conducted for Class X to XII students in government schools starting Monday. “With the reduction in syllabus, it is more manageable for teachers. Also, now students have started to come to school regularly fearing exams. Once they keep writing exams, they will be able to be better prepared,” said K Anand Raman, legal secretary, Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Headmasters’ Association. K Muthukumar, a Class XII student at a government school, said he was not able to study well in Class X and XI. “I’m only an average student and at home, there is no one to teach me. I have to rely only on studying in school. So, writing board exam is a little scary but teachers promised to help and I’m hoping going to school regularly helps me,” he said. In private schools, teachers said that in case of higher classes like Class IX to XII, online classes have been effective to an extent and students are able to do well in tests conducted. “At the same time, subjects like Science and Maths are always more difficult for students in online classes,” said S Shanthi, a Class XII Physics teacher. Private schools are looking to also start holding special classes after school hours for students from January once rains recede.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/students-teachers-put-in-extra-efforts-for-xii-board-exam/articleshow/87968760.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Mumbai||3 lakh step out for jab in Maharashtra after Omicron scare & campaign||MUMBAI: Maharashtra saw its highest Sunday turnout in seven weeks with nearly 3 lakh stepping out to get vaccinated. Some officials believe the Omicron scare drove people to make a dash for the jab, while others credited the ‘har ghar dastak campaign’ for the uptick in numbers. It also helped Maharashtra reach the single dose coverage for 80% of its population. Either way, more than 2.91 lakh took the vaccine across the state till 10pm, according to CoWin. If the previous seven Sundays are considered, the vaccinations ranged between 43,000 to 1.76 lakh. The best Sunday turnout so far was seen on October 10, when 4.29 lakh people took the shot. Typically, Fridays and Saturdays would see a rush at the centres before the Sunday lull. Several districts don’t hold vaccination drives on Sunday, including Mumbai. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the impact was more of the ‘har ghar dastak campaign’ and the new restrictions imposed by the chief minister, such as the requirement of double vaccination to board public transport. “News about Omicron has just arrived. It will take some more time to reach every nook and corner. We think the good response was because of restrictions announced by the CM and the door-to-door campaign,” he said. Dr Sudhakar Shelke, district health officer of Aurangabad, however, said the fear of the new variant, combined with the ‘har ghar dastak campaign’ pushed people out of their homes on Sunday. “This could be one upside of having a new variant. All those who were on the fence may agree to get vaccinated,” he said. In Aurangabad, vaccination during the weekdays has been inching upwards after the district authorities linked it to purchase of petrol to collection of ration. Among districts, Aurangabad, carried out more than 40,000 vaccinations on Sunday. Beed, which is at the third lowest position among districts, also saw a turnout of nearly 30,000. A district health officer said that in a meeting held with CM on Sunday, they have been told to create awareness about the emerging variant and use that to motivate people to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, the ‘har ghar dastak campaign’ that was started on November 3 to push single dose coverage to 100% by November 30, is likely to continue for a while. About 1.82 crore people are yet to take a single shot in Maharashtra. Desai said they are aiming to finish first dose coverage by December now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-3l-step-out-for-jab-in-state-after-omicron-scare-campaign/articleshow/87969365.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Jaipur||In a first, Rajasthan boy seeks child panel’s help to stop his wedding||JAIPUR: In a first, a 19-year-old boy from Sikrai in Dausa has sought the help of the state child commission to stop his wedding which is scheduled for Monday. The boy, who has completed his Class 12, claimed that he wanted to study further. The child panel has directed the district administration to take the necessary measures as the legal age for boys to get married is 21. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, "This is possibly the first time that a boy has asked us for help to stop his impending wedding. He called to say that his wedding was to take place on Monday. He sent me the photo of the wedding card and his Class 10 mark sheet as proof of age. I spoke to the officials of district administration and asked them to stop the wedding." Beniwal said it was admirable to notice that even boys were coming forward to stop underage marriages. The recently released Fifth Edition of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) showed that 28.2% of boys were married before the legal age as against 25.4% of girls, who got married before the legal age. Rajasthan has witnessed a significant reduction in early marriage for boys in the rural areas from 44.7% in 2015-16 to 33.2% in 2019-20. For NFHS 4 and 5, early marriage among boys in the urban areas remains unchanged at 16%. It also showed that in Rajasthan as compared to 2015-16 the percentage of women between 20 to 24 years who were married before turning 18 came down to 25.4% which is a decrease of 10% from NFHS-4. This decrease was also visible in men between 25 to 29 years, who were married before turning 21 and in 2020-21, 28.2% of men fell in this category as compared to 35.7% in 2015-16.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/dausa-teen-seeks-child-panels-help-to-call-off-his-wedding/articleshow/87968764.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

After the pandemic lull, expectations are high from the upcoming wedding season, including some big, fat NRI nuptials that will be held over the next three to four months. The industry is upbeat in its hope to turn the clock back to a period of good sales. But in the meantime, the industry is dealing with increased prices and shortage of raw materials. Industry experts put pre-Covid wall-clock manufacturing figures at about 1.5 lakh to 1.75 lakh pieces daily. They said the number has reduced to just 60,000 pieces daily over the past year. President of Morbi Clock and Parts Manufacturing Association, Shashank Dangi, said: "Seven of the 10 wall clocks sold are used for gifting. This is the first full-fledged wedding season after the pandemic, especially the second wave." Dangi added: "We hope for good business, though our industry is facing a 40% rise in prices of raw material." There has been a 40% rise in packaging material costs and a 25% rise in plastic material costs. Prices of colours and glass too have gone up by 30% each. "High prices of raw materials as well as their shortage are hitting us hard," Dangi said. "Earlier, we generally got 20 to 30 days’ credit on raw materials, but now have to pay in advance." Dangi said that the rise in container costs has added to the woes of clock manufacturers. Import of glass from China diminished after it became unviable for importers owing to high container charges. Same was the case with the import of ‘movement’, an essential clock component, from the Chinese market. A movement that cost Rs 13 now comes for Rs 20 because of high container charges.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/morbi-clock-units-tick-on-with-hope/articleshow/87968815.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The Department of Telecom (DoT) also asked Starlink to comply with the regulatory framework for offering satellite-based communication services, and refrain from booking/rendering satellite internet services in India “with immediate effect”. DoT made it clear that the company should “get licence before offering satellite-based services”. The department, in a statement, said it has come to notice that Starlink has started pre-selling/booking of the satellite based Starlink Internet Services in India. The same is also evident from the website of Starlink wherein satellite-based internet services can be booked by users in Indian territory, DoT noted. “Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications, Government of India has pointed out that ‘Starlink Internet Services’ is not licensed to offer satellite-based internet services in India being advertised to the public,” the statement said. Offering satellite based services in India requires requisite license. “It is hereby informed to the public at large that the said company has not obtained any license/authorization for rendering satellite based internet services that are being booked on their website,” it said. Given that Starlink is not a licensee, “the public is advised not to subscribe to Starlink services being advertised”, it added. The statement by DoT is a tempoprary setback to Musk-led SpaceX’s satellite broadband arm Starlink, which has been bullish about its India market plans, and had started taking pre-bookings for satellite broadband services.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/elon-musks-starlink-net-service-has-no-licence-shun-it-govt-to-public/articleshow/87970014.cms||---

It was encouraging to see children pitch some creative ideas, which when scaled, have the potential of bringing about tremendous social impact.” Under the business blasters programme, all participating students are given a seed money of Rs 2,000 per student. Yash, a student who was heading the team that pitched their idea of “Speaksters,” said, “Our idea was born out of certain necessities brought on by Covid-19. We took our online classes on our phone and missed having the clarity that speakers can provide. My team is working on not only developing the product but also marketing.” “We have priced our speakers at Rs 299, which will be high quality, low cost and high performing Bluetooth speakers,” said Yash, who belongs to a migrant family from Kanpur. Officials said the show will witness students’ business ideas, shortlisted from 51,000 ideas submitted by 3 lakh students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-show-to-provide-a-launchpad-for-biz-ideas/articleshow/87968784.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said that the checking at the border checkpost will be stepped up and personnel from other departments will also be deployed in shifts, apart from the health and police personnel who are currently on duty, from Monday onwards. However, he said that the inter-state bus services operated by the state transport corporations of both the states, which had resumed recently, will continue. “We have asked the RTCs to ensure and check the RT-PCR test reports at the boarding point itself,” he added. The deputy commissioner said that a RT-PCR testing centre will be opened at the border checkpost at Thalapady to facilitate checking of travellers. People travelling to Karnataka on a daily basis will have to produce a negative RT-PCR test report not older than seven days while other travellers should produce a negative test report not older than 72 hours. Dakshina Kannada authorities said though border surveillance was in force during the last four months, it was relaxed in the last one month. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/karnataka-ups-rt-pcr-checks-at-border/articleshow/87968798.cms||---

Only 56 Covid patients in the district are now in ICUs and just 80 are on ventilators as compared to 227 patients in ICUs and 203 on ventilators in Pune a month ago, the data showed. A district health department official said, “Critical patients (those requiring oxygen support) have reduced even in terms of daily admissions in hospitals. The percentage of ICU Covid patients to total active patients has also reduced during the latest week. It was 3% during the November 18-24 period in comparison to the 6% (of total active cases) during the week before.” The official said the percentage of Covid patients on ventilator to total active patients has also reduced during the latest week. “It was 4% during the November 18-24 period in comparison to the 5% (of total active cases) in the previous week,” he said. Besides, weekly Covid mortalities have also dropped by half in Pune over the last few weeks, with less than 25 deaths being recorded on an average each in the last four weeks. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, told TOI, “We have about 39 Covid patients admitted currently and only about six of them are on ventilator. During the peak of the second wave, there were about 140 patients on ventilator. We have noticed that most patients do not need admission as the current vaccines are working. Home quarantine works for them as the disease is getting less severe.” Dr Piyush Chaudhari, infectious diseases specialist at Jehangir Hospital, told TOI, “Of the total Covid patients, less than 20% are showing severe disease requiring oxygen support. In that too, less than half are those requiring prolonged stay, invasive or non-invasive ventilator support. Most of these patients are from outskirts or peripheries of Pune.” According to Dr Chaudhari, case numbers have become stagnant for the past few weeks. “One major reason is vaccination increasing during the second wave, as well as many people already having contracted the infection, thus making a bulk of the population immune to the virus. Many hospitals have come down to using just one ward for Covid lately due to the drop in patient numbers. It was the other way around in March-April, when very few beds were available for non-Covid patients,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/four-fold-drop-in-covid-patients-requiring-icu-ventilator-in-pune/articleshow/87968786.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Madurai||Mastanpatti marooned for two months due to encroachment||MADURAI: Mastanpatti in ward 29 of Madurai Corporation has been marooned due to overflowing water from the local tank since the last two months. One of the main reason for the flooding is encroachment of the PWD channel that carries the surplus water from the Mastanpatti tank when the Vandiyur tank overflows, say residents. This place was brought under the Madurai Corporation ten years ago and many houses have been constructed encroaching PWD land along the channel. Subbaiah (name changed), a resident, said that most of them are government employees and therefore cannot stage protests or demand action for their ward, but the attitude of the PWD was making it very difficult for them to live in this area as they had purchased plots and constructed houses after proper approvals. As the channel has been encroached, they say that PWD authorities discharge water into the residential area, marooning many houses, instead of clearing the encroachments along the channel. Water stagnation has also led to snakes, insects and scorpions entering homes, they add. Water stagnation has continued for over two months and now many of them are falling sick due to waterborne diseases, say the residents. “We are very tensed because people are falling sick and now that they say covid cases are rising it is a matter of grave concern,” said Sakthi, a resident. They have also petitioned district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar, and not wanting to wait till the authorities act they have stopped the flow from the channel by unloading two loads of sand in lorries along the channel. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan had directed the PWD to take steps to clear the channel over a month back, but it is still not done||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mastanpatti-marooned-for-two-months-due-to-encroachment/articleshow/87968774.cms||---

Parmar thought that her mother may have seen some squirrel with pale fur texture. But two days back, she heard loud squeaking of squirrels on the mango tree in the premises of her house in Gorwa. “I looked out and what I saw was absolutely unbelievable. I spotted a white-coloured male squirrel hopping around on the tree. Some other squirrels were attacking it and hence the loud squeaking continued for some time,” Parmar, a clinical pharmacist, told TOI. She immediately brought her camera and clicked some photos of the squirrel. “It is a leucistic squirrel and appears different from the normal squirrels. Hence it was being targeted by other squirrels,” Parmar, who works in a hospital in Surat, said. Leucism is a condition wherein birds, mammals and reptiles have reduced pigmentation that is marked by pale colour or patches of reduced colouring. Last month, an ornithologist had spotted a white-coloured myna in the GSFC compound. It was for the first time that a leucistic myna was photographed in the state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/rare-white-squirrel-spotted-in-gorwa/articleshow/87967968.cms||Tushar Tere

Staff and students at educational institutions are going to be subjected to RT-PCR test, to prevent the infection from spreading across the district. The surge in cases in neighbouring Kerala, which borders Chamarajanagar, has put authorities in the district on alert. Furthermore, the fear of the new ‘Omicron’ variant of the novel coronavirus has prompted the authorities to be doubly careful. The authorities in Chamarajanagar are subjecting as many as 1,100 people to RT-PCR test, on average, every day. Now, intent on curbing the spread of the infection, the authorities have decided to double their target, with instructions being issued to ASHA and anganwadi workers to identify individuals displaying symptoms of the infection, and ensuring they are tested at the nearest primary health centres (PHCs). Instructions have been issued to all taluk health officers to visit each of the 115 state-run hostels managed by the social welfare, backward classes, minorities and tribal welfare departments, and ensure that students displaying symptoms of Covid-19 were immediately subjected to an RT-PCR test. Chamarajanagar taluk tribal welfare officer Shivamurthy said that students residing in government hostels, returning from homes had been mandated to furnish a certificate confirming that they were not infected with Covid. “Graduate and post-graduate students must have been administered both doses of vaccination, while those who have not received both the doses will not be allowed to stay at hostels,” Shuvamurthy told TOI. Chamarajanagar district health officer Dr KM Visveswaraiah said that deputy commissioner Charulatha Somal had issued directions to intensify testing across all education institutions. “Directions have also been issued to ramp up testing even in the villages bordering Kerala,” he said. Authorities in Chamarajanagar have also been very successful in tracing those who have come in contact with infected patients, and the district administration will hope that this continues in the face of the new threat. Meanwhile, vigilance has been stepped up across all public places, and law enforcement officials are ensuring compliance to safety guidelines, by mandating all shopkeepers to wear masks, and make sure their customers do so as well. Public announcements are being made in all towns and thoroughfares, calling on people to adhere to safety norms. Meanwhile, at the borders, people failing to furnish the report of the Covid test are not being allowed to enter the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/after-schools-and-colleges-turn-covid-clusters-testing-ramped-up-in-chamarajanagar/articleshow/87967462.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Four of gang that lured scores with work-from-home jobs arrested||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit on Sunday claimed to have busted a fake work-from-home (WFH) job racket and arrested four people. According to investigators, the accused offered data entry and WFH jobs and, then, extorted money. “We received complaints that websites like https://theresumesearch.com, https://www.jobsearchnet.in and https://resumetofill.com were engaged in cheating people by promising them work-from-home jobs,” DCP (IFSO) K P S Malhotra said. These websites gave people tasks that were impossible to complete and, later, extorted money by threatening to drag them to court. A search on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal was conducted and it was found that there were more than 60 complaints lodged by different victims. During the investigation, a team under ACP (IFSO) Raman Lamba nabbed four people, including a woman, from Delhi. They were identified as Rohit Kumar, the registrant of the website, Mohit Singh and Tarun Kumar. Tarun and the woman, whose name was not disclosed, were telecallers. “Rohit had created these websites and, then, started calling unemployed people for data entry jobs,” the officer said. Investigators said the fraudulent job portals collected resumes of people looking for data entry and work-from-home jobs. They also sent messages to the user, claiming that they could provide similar online work. “Job seekers are made to sign legal agreements that if they fail to complete the work on time, they would have to pay a penalty. They are then given impossible tasks,” an investigator said. Having failed to complete the task, the applicant pays the charges due under the agreement. However, the fraudsters keep on demanding more money by sending legal notices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/4-of-gang-that-lured-scores-with-work-from-home-jobs-arrested/articleshow/87968796.cms||---
---||Pune||Rickshaws go off the roads in Pune after CNG supply disruption||PUNE: The supply of CNG in the city was badly disrupted on Saturday and Sunday after a puncture and a fire in the main conduit on Friday in Bibvewadi halted it. It had a cascading effect in which fewer autorickshaws were on the road on the weekend and commuters had to wait for over 45 minutes to get the transport. There were long queues of autorickshaws outside fuel pumps for CNG in many places across the city on both days. “The Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) has assured us that the supply of CNG will resume on Sunday, but it has not happened so far. There are serpentine lines in front of many petrol and gas pumps across the city and many people and dealers are hassled. The MNGL is not providing us with proper answers on when the supply will be restored,” a fuel dealer told TOI. Deepak Sawant, managing director of the MNGL told TOI that GAIL, which supplies CNG to them, had taken up an annual maintenance of their main pipeline on Saturday. “The work was supposed to get over on Sunday, but was extended by several hours. GAIL employees are working round-the-clock and the supply should resume soon,” Sawant said. Normal supply was restored on Sunday evening, he added. Many autorickshaw drivers in the city said they were not plying their vehicles on Sunday too due to shortage of CNG. “On Saturday, we couldn’t get any CNG and today too the condition remains. Hence, I decided not to ply my vehicle today. It is a loss for me considering that Sunday witnesses many family outings and it is a day of business for us. If the maintenance work had to be carried out, it should have been done in the late evening hours,” Babu Sonavane, an autorickshaw driver, said. At a petrol pump located on Shankarsheth Road near Swargate, autorickshaw drivers were angry about not getting CNG. “I have been standing in the queue since 6am and the petrol pump attendants are not giving clear replies. When we inquire, they say that CNG cylinders are on their way. On Saturday too, there was no CNG and today too the situation is the same. There are around 300 auto drivers waiting to get gas at just this pump,” Ibrahim Inamdar, an autorickshaw driver waiting at the pump, said. Commuters said that they have had to cancel their outings on both days as they could not get autorickshaws to travel by. “We had plans to catch a movie, but despite waiting for two hours, we could not find an autorickshaw, and hence we dropped our plan,” Sujit Talpure, a resident of Kondhwa, told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rickshaws-go-off-the-roads-after-cng-supply-disruption/articleshow/87968792.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kochi||Holy mass: Most Kerala dioceses adopt new format||KOCHI: The decision of the Syro-Malabar Church to implement a uniform way of conducting the Holy Mass across the Church from Sunday, which marked the beginning of the liturgical calendar, remained unfulfilled as the existing style of conducting the mass continued in many churches in dioceses like the archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly, Irinjalakuda and Faridabad diocese on Sunday. However, most dioceses in the Church changed to the format prescribed by the synod on Sunday and bishops of various dioceses of the church within and outside the state conducted the Sunday mass in the new format. Cardinal George Alencherry, the head of the Church, led the change by conducting the mass in the new format at Mount St Thomas, the headquarters of the Church. “This is a new beginning. This reformation is for increasing the unity and togetherness of our Church. I congratulate all the bishops, priests and the laity who have welcomed this change and cooperated with it and thank them in the name of the Church. A new era is beginning in our Church, an era of peace and total unity,” Cardinal Alencherry said in his Sunday homily. He said that the sense of unity now prevailing in the Church was thought to be an impossibility years ago and now it was slowly becoming a reality. In the Syro-Malabar Church, various dioceses had been following different modes of celebrating the mass, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in certain dioceses and facing the altar in certain other dioceses. The style of mass approved by the synod is a combination of both. On Saturday, bishops of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, Irinjalakuda diocese and Faridabad diocese had issued exemption from following the Synod-approved mass. As of Sunday, most churches in the SMC follow the style prescribed by the synod except for the dioceses which have been granted exemption. Mass in which the celebrant faces the congregation is continuing in these dioceses. Meanwhile, Fr Celestine Inchackal, vicar of Prasannapuram Holy Family Church in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, ignored the exemption granted by metropolitan vicar Antony Kariyil and conducted the synod-approved mass. “The major archbishop is also the head of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. Mar Antony Kariyil is serving as the vicar of the major archbishop. The latest information that was sent to us was that of the major archbishop,” Fr Celestine Inchackal said during the mass. He said that the bishops have written to Rome regarding clarity on issues, including on Canon 1538, which was used to give dispensation. Apart from Prasannapuram, almost all other churches and pilgrim centres in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese continued their traditional mass. There are also reports of the faithful protesting against vicars in churches at Delhi coming under the Faridabad diocese, for not conducting the mass prescribed by the synod. The second summit of the 29th synod of the Church had envisaged a complete transformation into the new way of conducting the mass by the Easter Sunday of 2022.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/most-dioceses-adopt-new-format/articleshow/87967061.cms||---

He engaged in a fireside chat about his book titled ‘So now you know’ at the third edition of the Vidarbha Literary Fest (VLF) 2022. The event is supported by The Times of India. The session was held at Mimosa Hall, Chitnavis Centre, on Saturday. The conversation was moderated by marketer, content writer and photographer Prachi Arya, who has come out as a bisexual. Cultural editor of Verve and a strong force in the LGBTQ+ community, Tejuja chronicles his life while growing up as a gay man in India in this memoir. Tejuja gives us a glimpse into his sexual awakening and how he and the people around him came to grips with it. Highlighting widespread bullying experienced by the LGBTQ+ community, Tejuja said, “Bullying is a real problem which not only exists in-person, but it has pervaded spaces on social media platforms like Clubhouse, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It is relentless and people use the choicest of slurs.” Speaking about the lack of representation of the LGBTQ+ community in Bollywood, Tejuja noted, “They are trying to be inclusive but it’s just tokenism. Whether it’s ‘Shubh mangal zyada savdhan’, ‘Ek ladki ko dekha toh aisa laga’ and now, ‘Chandigarh kare aashiqui’, they don’t know how to portray us. They don’t even want to hire us to guide our own stories, forget casting people from the community.” In his message to people who want to be LGBTQ+ allies, Tejuja said, “Read relevant literature and understand our space. Ask us and we will educate you. The onus lies on you to take that step.” In his opening remarks, VLF secretary Sachin Jahagirdar said, “This series of events that we conduct every month is a teaser for the main VLF event slated to be held in February 2022. Nagpur is suddenly blossoming with activities related to books which is a great sign. We, as VLF, are proud to be pioneering this culture in the city.” The interaction was followed by a brief Q and A session where Tejuja engaged with the audience. The event was conducted by VLF volunteer Aarushi Golchha.

The development comes in the wake of an STF raid at Almora jail that exposed how prisoners were using mobile phones to carry out illegal activities. In January this year, an extortion racket being run from Haridwar jail was busted. Inspector General (prisons), Pushpak Jyoti, told TOI that CCTV cameras will be installed in all 11 prisons in the state, adding that, "Besides CCTVs, in-principle decision has been taken to install security poles and baggage scanners in all jails as well as part of increasing security arrangements." Baggage scanners will help check packages, which are brought by families of undertrials, as presently physical checking is done before they are handed over to the inmates, said Pushpak Jyoti. The increased CCTV network will also help prison authorities keep a round-the-clock vigil even in the barracks, said a senior official. Jails in Uttarakhand are overcrowded. There are a total of 11 jails in the Himalayan state, including one central jail, two sub-jails and one open jail. The IG, prisons, added that three new jails are being constructed in Udham Singh Nagar, Pithoragarh and Champawat districts to check overcrowding.  There are around 6,700 inmates lodged in the jails in Uttarakhand against the capacity of 3,540," said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/days-after-drug-bust-in-almora-jail-govt-plans-cctv-cameras-scanners-in-prisons/articleshow/87968111.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Police said that the statements of her neighbours and friends, who were in the know of the couple’s relationship, were also being collected. Also, governor Arif Mohammed Khan visited Mofiya’s family on Sunday. After the meeting, Khan said the incident was unfortunate and tragic. He added that he would want young girls to become courageous and fight back against the dowry system. Meanwhile, the investigation team is trying to complete a round of preliminary investigation before interrogating the accused. Police have filed an application seeking custody of the accused and expected to get the trio in custody on Tuesday. However, the accused have also moved a bail petition before the magistrate. Mofiya’s husband, Mohammed Suhail (27), his mother Rukhiya (55) and father Yousuf (63) were remanded in judicial custody on Thursday. Police had invoked sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against the accused. Meanwhile, a copy of the initial FIR registered for unnatural death, soon after Mofiya was found dead, surfaced on Sunday. It had direct allegations against the circle inspector named in her suicide note. “…when both parties were summoned to the station and a discussion was going on, the deceased Mofiya Parveen got upset and slapped Muhammed Suhail on his face. SHO (CL Sudheer) who saw this rebuked her and talked in a strong tone. Over this factor and due to the feeling, that she will never get justice from the SHO, she died by suicide,” the original FIR based on the complaint of her father Dilshad had said. But, police said that this was based on the initial report and the FIR was altered to add more sections after the investigation progressed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/governor-visits-mofiyas-kin-police-interview-doctors/articleshow/87967064.cms||---

The citizens could also feel the chill factor in the air particularly during the early morning hours. However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials have forecast warmer days, besides, forecasting very light to light rainfall on November 29 and 30 in the Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune district. The weather in the city remained mostly sunny with a cold breeze on Sunday. “Due to the moisture incursion in the atmosphere, the city’s minimum temperature was likely to increase till December 2. Residents will not feel the typical winter chill factor at least for the next couple of days. From December 3 onwards, there is a chance of penetration of northerly wind into the state and then the minimum temperature will fall across the state including in Pune,” a senior met official said. Barring a few days, the chill factor was not there in November and the night temperature was higher than the normal range, the met officials said.

Over the past three days they have been flitting in and out of the sixth floor home of Manju Malhotra, a septuagenarian residing at Sunset Heights. They grab food from boxes kept near the window sill. Malhotra just had a carpenter come over and get locks fixed to the window. “Unable to enter, they started to chatter aloud and then barged into my neighbour’s home and sat next to the gas stove,” she says. Madhu Poplai of Pali Hill Residents’ Association said this monkey business is an annual affair. “Four monkeys used to roam the locality December till mid-January. This time, there are six who enter homes, open fridges, take food.” The association has sent out a message to members, urging them to keep windows closed and not feed them anything, said Poplai. Monkeys, by nature, are curious and intelligent. “If they find a place to get food easily, there’s no reason they would miss the chance,” says wildlife activist Pawan Sharma. “Also, if a monkey discovers an easy source of food, it passes on the message to others of its group."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/monkeys-go-scale-pali-hill-raid-kitchens-grab-food-in-mumbai/articleshow/87969415.cms||Richa Pinto

BJP MLA Ashish Shelar claimed that the MVA has been furthering the political careers of sons, daughters, and nephews. MVA has ignored farmers, women, OBCs, Marathas, Dhangars, scheduled castes and tribes, students and workers, said Patil, adding: “If given an opportunity, the people will vote out this government. It has failed in addressing all matters, including Covid-19.” Shelar said when Mumbaikars were asking for reopening of local train services and religious places, pubs and bars were opened. Referring to controversies surrounding NCP leader and fomer home minister Anil Deshmukh, Shelar alleged: “Recoveries, dealings with matka kings and bookies, factionalism in police force, corruption in transfers...began in the state.” Referring to Ajit Pawar, he said the NCP chief’s love for his nephew led to him being given a key portfolio. “...central probe agencies have found that he has amassed properties worth Rs 1,000 crore.

Vivek Bhatt, of city-based Garden Blossom, said, “These are all outdoor plants and all that one has to do is to take any bulb and plant them. There are some imported bulbs as well and they can be grown in pots anywhere. Some of them are more conducive to hilly areas because of the weather, but because Delhi has extreme climates, the plants do well here too.” The two-day expo also offered some solutions for those who are inclined to use home-grown vegetables for their salads. Available in three layered kits, tanks are also attached to them, providing a constant source of nutrients, and one can grow anything from lettuce and spinach to coriander — all indoors. Tanisht Chaturvedi, an agronomist from Barton Breeze, said, “There is a water channel attached to the kit as well apart from glowing lights, which can help the plants to grow. Light is required for the plants to grow vertically. Instead of worrying about whether the vegetables have been grown next to a polluted Yamuna or some other unhygienic place, one can now grow their own vegetables at home itself.” Chaturvedi added that separate kits for bell peppers and tomatoes could also be procured by those interested. Those kits would, however, be for the outdoors, he said. Adding to the urban farming phenomena, which is growing increasingly popular these days, unique water conserving planters were also on display at the expo. Developed by Karnal-based Nitin Lalit, founder of Alpha Planters, these have been made out of recycled caps of bisleri bottles and milk pouches. “Usually, water is not used judiciously as people end up watering plants multiple times a day. To save carbon footprint, we developed these planters, which are 40% recycled, and we are now working to make it 80% recycled. These planters are completely water conserving and the maintenance needed is almost nil. The amount of water required also reduces as the base stores the nutrient-filled water,” Lalit explained. Stating that the aim was to move beyond the idea of “square-foot gardening,” Lalit added, “We are aiming for square-inch gardening. The sets developed by us can be used to grow vegetables on the terrace, balcony or to develop kitchen gardens. It can be done anywhere and one can set it up within five minutes.” Watch Grow at home: These DIY hydroponic kits are gateway to indoor-farming||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/homegrown-veggies-in-your-salad-expo-plants-the-seeds-of-indoor-farming-idea/articleshow/87968842.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The CB had arrested Mavunkal on September 25 in a case registered against him under sections 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471(using forged documents as genuine) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC. He was arrested for allegedly duping various persons of nearly Rs 10 crore. He had decorated his mansion at Kaloor like a museum and had kept several ‘antiques’ on display, which were seemingly fake.

The keyman, Bhausaheb Kangne, was on duty near the Parsik tunnel, which is after Thane station. During his inspection around 10.20 am, he noticed the fracture and raised an alarm. Trains on the Down fast line were halted, and subsequently diverted to the Down slow line. Once the fracture was repaired, the Down fast line was back in service. CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar said, “The department will felicitate the keyman for his alertness which prevented a mishap.” The track damage may be due to sudden fluctuation in temperatures, as there was a dip in mercury levels early in the morning, sources said. “There could also be wear and tear due to continuous movement of heavy traffic over a period of time,” the official said, adding that every possible cause was being explored.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-staffer-detects-crack-in-rail-averts-major-mishap/articleshow/87969820.cms||Somit Sen

Despite the government advisory that such teachers should not come to school, it has been reported that a few among them are attending offline classes, he said. The minister has warned that such teaching and non-teaching staff who are yet to take the vaccination should not come to school. The school authorities should not force such teachers or non-teaching staff to come to school. Even when the vast majority of teachers were vaccinated, the non-cooperation of some cannot be justified. The safety of students is paramount. The fact that certain teachers are reluctant to take vaccines is a matter concerning the health of the students, which is not acceptable, the minister said. The minister said there are reports that these teaching and non-teaching staff are showing reluctance to take the vaccination due to certain religious beliefs and also due to certain health issues. “The government is firm on its decision that all the teaching and non-teaching staff should be vaccinated if they want to come to school. If these people are still coming to school, then it should be treated as defying the government rules. If they are not willing to accept the government decision, the education department will be forced to provide the list of these people to the concerned health authorities,” he said. Plus One classesThe Plus One classes will begin from Monday in the First Bell 2.0 digital classes which is being aired through KITE Victers channel. From 7:30am to 9:30am, there will be three periods for the Plus One students.

KPCC expelled Divakaran from the party for contesting against the official panel in the elections to the Indira Gandhi Cooperative Hospital in Thalassery of which he is currently the president. In a press release, KPCC general secretary T U Radhakrishnan said that Divakaran’s move – to contest in the hospital society election against the official panel – amounted to serious indiscipline. The election to the hospital governing board is scheduled to be held on December 5. Though Divakaran had been steering the hospital for over two decades, Kannur DCC had not endorsed the panel led by him this time. It is learnt that Divakaran was not ready to include some of the nominees of KPCC president K Sudhakaran in the panel which had led to the party coming up with another panel for the election. The society has around 5,000 members. Kannur DCC president Martin George said that former DCC secretary E G Santha, who is contesting in the panel led by Divakaran, has been suspended from the party. Also party’s Mambaram mandalam president K K Prasad who has been supporting Divakaran’s panel has been removed from the post. Divakaran had been critical of the KPCC president in recent times. In the backdrop of the verbal spat between the chief minister and Sudhakaran (both students of Thalassery Brennen College), Divakaran had said that a person like the KPCC president should exhibit a level of maturity. He had also raised allegations against Sudhakaran in connection with the fund collection done by K Karunakaran Charitable Trust some months ago.

The Ganeshkhind Road, especially the stretch between Range Hill Chowk and University junction, is prone to frequent congestion even during the non-peak traffic hours. The authorities demolished the University Flyover in August-September 2020 and since then the University junction and Ganeshkhind Road have been witnessing traffic jams. “Metro work will take at least 12 metre of the carriage width of the Ganeshkhind Road to erect pillars and subsequent construction activities. This will lead to traffic chaos on the road. So, we requested the PMRDA to employ services of 200 traffic wardens who will manage the vehicular movement with the traffic police,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame. At present, the University Chowk witnesses traffic congestion or vehicle movement at a snail’s pace because of the Metro work. “Secondly, there are too many potholes and uneven road surface areas on the Ganeshkhind Road. This decreases the speed of the vehicles on the road. We have asked the PMRDA and PMC authorities to fill the potholes, which will help increase the speed of the vehicles, which in turn will reduce the traffic jams,” Shrirame said. “We have also told the PMRDA authorities to widen the Ganeshkhind Road, especially near the University Chowk and at Baner village (where the road is still narrow) to avert the traffic jams,” he said. A senior PMRDA officer said, “We will provide wardens to the traffic police as soon as the work will start. We have also asked the contractor, who is executing the Metro work, to provide wardens. The other things would be discussed with the PMC officials for further action,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/200-wardens-to-mind-traffic-on-university-road-sought/articleshow/87968858.cms||---

Addressing the media after inaugurating an academic conference on the Malabar Rebellion of 1921 – organized by Samastha Kerala Sunni Yuvajana Sangham (SYS) – he added that the controversy was not suited to the state’s secular character. “It is not such divisive issues which Kerala society should discuss today. The controversy is being raked up to create communal division in society. The secular society of Kerala should be vigilant against such attempts,” he said. Later, speaking at the valedictory session of the conference, All-India Sunni Jem Iyyathul Ulema general secretary Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar said that when there are attempts to create hatred and communal feelings in society by spreading falsehood, the public should act in a mature and composed manner after understanding facts. “The fact that Muslims only eat halal food is not something new. But what is going on is an attempt to deride by repeatedly raking it up. It is not permissible for Muslims to eat food made from animals or birds which have been beaten or suffocated to death. Many hotels put up halal boards to denote that they provide dishes made of animals which have been properly slaughtered. Also many non-Muslims are working in hotels run by Muslims,” he added. He said that everyone knows that food at those hotels are not prepared in any special manner as alleged by people spreading religious hatred. Mohammed Abdul Hakeem Ashari, Hussain Randathani, P Sivadasan, P J Vincent, KS Madhavan, among others spoke at various sessions. SYS state president Syed Thwaha Saqaffi presided over the function.

Air passenger footfalls rose by 56% in October this year. Some 5.58 lakh passengers travelled from the city airport in October this year, against 3.58 lakh passengers in the same month last year. Travel operators and city hoteliers attribute the increased movements to the revival of leisure travel as well as corporate travel for events, conferences and exhibitions. “During the festive season, a lot of corporate and leisure travellers travelled to Ahmedabad. Many came to attend weddings. This gave good business to hotels,” said hotelier Narendra Somani. Of the 5.58 lakh passengers that travelled through the city airport, 65,722 were international passengers and 4.93 were domestic. Overall travel sentiment improved significantly over the past few months. So much so that in October footfalls increased by 20%, compared to 4.6 lakh passengers in September. “With Covid-19 cases decreasing, people are regaining confidence to travel. Moreover, with restrictions eased or completely lifted in parts of the country, their sentiment is strengthening. Thus, business travel in domestic market has gone up to near pre-Covid levels. With the festive season and long weekends, leisure travel picked up. All of this led to a high number of air travellers,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents’ Association of India , Gujarat. One of the reasons for increased passenger footfalls is the approval from the aviation regulator, the directorate general of civil aviation, for airlines to operate at 100% capacity.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/air-passenger-footfalls-up-56/articleshow/87968892.cms||Niyati Parikh

Elaborating on the reasons, he told TOI, “My eldest son, Digvijay, his wife and two children live in my house. For quite some time, Digvijay has been continuously demanding a share of the property, and this has caused much trouble to me. My son doesn’t respect me, and often misbehaves with me. There is no reason for me to care about him. I have been asking him to focus on the business that I have developed over the years but he is instead trying to grab my property. That is why, I have made up my mind to transfer the property to the district magistrate so that it can be properly utilised by the government after my death.

The state government had announced a package for the surrendering Maoists in 2018.  Lijesh, a deputy commander of Kabani Dalam of the CPI (Maoist), was working in the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) for several years before he surrendered before Wayanad police. He was a native of Amarakkuni in Wayanad. While surrendering, he had said he had decided to surrender after he realized the futility of the Maoist movement. The state government’s surrender-cum-rehabilitation policy for the Maoists that has been in force since 2018 has multiple provisions that would ensure a house, education and vocational training for the surrendered Maoists that would help them earn their livelihood for the rest of their lives. The policy has been framed by dividing the LWE cadres in various categories on the basis of their position in the organization and the nature of the crimes in which they have been involved. As per the policy, besides disclosing the real names and identities of the members and their organizations, the surrendered cadres should also reveal the details of financiers, harbourers and couriers. They will also have to disclose information about operation tactics, strategies, life in the organization, arms, active cadres and cadres who work in urban areas, frontal organizations and the link between frontal organizations and the cadres. After their surrender before a police officer, they will be placed under the observation of a nodal officer for the next three to five years which will be treated as a quarantine period during which he will be under close surveillance. A district rehabilitation committee will consider the social and economic background of the surrendered cadre, his age, general education, preferred kind of rehabilitation, viability of the rehabilitation package in the case of the surrendered person, etc. A rehabilitation package will be worked out, and a compensation package will be finalized, of which a portion will be released immediately, and the rest will be deposited in the joint account of the cadre and the nodal officer of the area appointed by the government. The cadre will also be eligible for a house under a government scheme, and will also be given stipend for continuing education if he or she wishes to. If the person is too old to continue education, he or she can opt for open schooling. They will also be given training in vocational skills, and if they are willing to marry, they will be provided an additional sum of Rs 25,000 for marriage. In addition, the government has also announced incentives for various arms being surrendered by the cadres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/surrendered-maoist-offered-house-stipend/articleshow/87968899.cms||---

Cohesity is expected to offer the highest package of Rs 1.46 crore (or 1,95,000 USD), followed by Glean, that has a package of Rs 1.12 crore (or 1,50,000 USD) on offer. These packages also include incentives and other stock options. The annual placement season will kick off virtually at all the major IITs on December 1. After a slow season last year in the pandemic, students are expecting this year’s placements to start on a good note. While cloud data management company, Rubrik, too will be offering a US role for a package of Rs 75 lakh (or 1,00,000 USD), HiLabs is yet to confirm. Most of the top software roles are usually taken by students from the computer science and engineering department. A couple of other firms offering US roles are also planning to recruit from the campus. Microsoft, which usually picks students for international profiles, has confirmed only domestic ones for this year’s placements, said a final-year student. “Direct US placements have anyway declined in the past few years, irrespective of the pandemic,” he added. Of the international roles on offer, a large number will be from companies in Japan and Singapore. Among the Japanese firms offering attractive packages are Sony Japan, Hyundai (research & development) and Rakuten. Some international profiles, which are not located in the US, will be paying in USD too, said a student. Other IT majors such as Apple, Google, Oracle, Uber, will be visiting the campus (virtually) only with domestic roles. Regular recruiters from the consulting and investment banking sectors such as the BCG, Bain, McKinsey, Blackstone, will be among the day one recruiters. The packages of these firms are in the range of Rs 30-45 lakh some are even up to Rs 60 lakh. Around 1,900 students from the institute have registered for the placement, but not all of them will be participating in the drive. “We will be in a better position to see how the placement season will be after the first two to three days. It is difficult to predict now, but so far, the situation appears promising,” said a student.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-more-us-offers-likely-at-iit-b-campus-placements/articleshow/87969840.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kochi||Price rise: Kerala schools urge govt to raise mid-day meal allowances||KOCHI: When the schools reopened on November 1, the state government had directed all schools to implement the mid-day meal (MDM) scheme from the very first day. However, the high price of essential commodities like groceries, vegetables and cooking gas have struck a blow to the mid-day meal scheme implemented in schools in the state. School authorities said the government’s current mid-day meal allowance of Rs 8 per student needs to be increased as they could not meet the expenses. In many schools, money from other funds like PTA funds, are used to keep the scheme running. In some schools, teachers are paying from their pockets to buy groceries and vegetables. As per the MDM circular issued by the government in October, schools which provide food for 150 students will get Rs 8 per student per day as allowance while schools with 500 and over 500 students are allotted Rs 7 and Rs 6 per student per day, respectively. These rates have not changed since 2016 and the schools are seeking a revision. The rice needed for every school and the salary of cooks are provided by the government directly but all other items, including cooking gas have to be purchased by the schools using the allowance. Under the scheme, which is applicable for Classes I-VIII, students have to be given egg once in week and boiled milk, twice a week. A weekly menu is prepared by all schools must have at least two dishes, besides rice and a curry. “The prices of vegetables and groceries have risen but the allowance remains the same. The hike of cooking price is another issue as an LPG cylinder will last for maximum three days. Most schools don’t have enough money in the PTA funds. Now, teachers have to arrange money on their own to meet the expense of MDM scheme,” said a headmistress of an aided school in Pathanamthitta. The issue is severe in those schools were number of eligible students are lesser. Due to Covid restrictions, each day only 50% students are attending the school. “If vegetables are procured in bulk quantity, schools can get discounts from sellers but due to fewer number of students it is not possible.” said an education department official in Ernakulam.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/price-rise-schools-urge-govt-to-raise-mid-day-meal-allowances/articleshow/87968923.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

While last year the number of questions were brought down to 76 and the time duration was two hours instead of three, this year, only 66 questions had to be attempted. The changes were introduced last year on account of the pandemic. Most aspirants found the verbal section, which had the maximum questions, to be the toughest. “Accounting for the slight difference in difficulty across the three slots, a score of 82-85 should fetch a 98 percentile. A score of approximately 70 would get a 95 percentile this year,” programme director at a leading coaching Institute, Hemang Panchmatia estimated. IIM-Ahmedabad conducted CAT 2021. More than two lakh candidates had registered for the test this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-cat-2021-sees-drop-in-number-of-questions-to-be-cracked/articleshow/87969843.cms||---

He was speaking during the Kannada Rajyotsava celebrations hosted by the Institution of Engineers (India), Mysuru branch. Kannada, which is 2,500 years old and is third after Sanskrit and Tamil, is among the oldest Indian languages. “The Kannada land and language has a glorious history. Our Kannada language is superior to English. Until the 17th century, English was considered a language only used by chefs and cooks as French was more popular. But later, the English language flourished,” he said. Gowda said that the English language has become richer after adopting Greek and Latin words. “By implanting words taken from Greek and Latin, new words were created in English. Similarly, people who speak Kannada can use Sanskrit, Halegannada to enrich the language,” he said. Theatre director and film actor Mandya Ramesh said that to protect Kannada, people must read, write and speak the language. “While there should be no limitation in learning Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Tamil or other languages, Kannadigas must learn to live in Kannada,” he said. Padma Shri awardee KS Jayalakshmi, the editor of the Sanskrit daily Sudharma, and KPTCL retired chief engineer BS Prabhakar were felicitated at the event. Jayalakshmi said that there was a notion that learning Sanskrit was difficult and won’t help in landing a job. “Learning different languages will not be a loss. We have to promote Sanskrit along with Kannada,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/words-from-other-languages-must-be-incorporated-in-kannada-says-former-vice-chancellor/articleshow/87967531.cms||---

While one of them smeared chilli powder on the face of the jeweller, Santosh Jadhav (37), blinding him momentarily, the others snatched a bag with the cash. Jadhav has sustained multiple injuries to the neck, ribs, abdomen, left elbow, palm and wrist. He has been admitted to MGM Hospital, Kamothe. He was in Navi Mumbai to buy gold ornaments, said senior inspector Smita Jadhav of Kamothe police station.  Around 7am, Jadhav disembarked from the private bus that had come from Beed, his hometown. He was walking towards a friend’s car that was parked a little ahead from where the bus had halted. His friend had come to pick him up, said the police. Jadhav was carrying a bag with the cash in it. Just as he was walking towards the car, one of the three assailants pounced on him from behind and flung the chilli powder and also smeared some on his face. Even as he was squinting from the attack, the other two men snatched his bag and assaulted him with the weapon, injuring him. Despite the momentary blinding, Jadhav claimed that he managed to catch a glimpse of the weapon which resembled a ‘koytaa’ (sickle), the police said, adding that Jadhav even tried hard to foil the robbery, but failed. He shouted for help but few people were around. A police team has been sent to Beed to inquire if it could be an inside job. Deputy commissioner of police Suresh Mengade said that the crime branch is also probing the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-jeweller-steps-off-bus-attacked-robbed-of-rs-19l/articleshow/87969861.cms||George Mendonca

Pleasant weather prevailed during the night on the weekend, as the mercury even went a little lower in the morning hours, fractionally below the minimum temperature recorded on Saturday. As forecast by IMD, Panaji, the minimum temperature started going down a couple of days back and mercury stood at 21 degrees C on Saturday. The reading at Old Goa was identical while it was just a degree more, 22 degrees C at Mormugao, also on Sunday. In 2020, the mild winter chill was missing and Goa experienced warm nights almost throughout the season. The mercury hardly dropped below 20 degrees C while during the mild winter chill that Goa experiences, it often hovers between 18 and 19 degrees C for some days in spells and once in a while drops to 17 degrees C. But light rain or thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely in a few places till December 1. “Minimum temperatures are likely to rise on Monday, according to the direction of wind pattern shown by numerical weather prediction models,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji, said. The mercury falls if the sky is clear, but cloudy skies trap the heat in the atmosphere. Combined with a change in wind direction, nights may be slightly warmer during the next few days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/temperature-drops-but-may-rise-due-to-cloudy-skies/articleshow/87968991.cms||---

TN stopped the tunnel discharge at 1pm when the water level was 141.65ft. By 10pm the water level rose to 141.90ft. TN also reduced the water release to the Periyar to 140 cusecs with only one spillway shutter raised up to 10cm since Saturday. A KSEB dam safety source said that TN was going to fill the reservoir up to 142ft. “They aim to ensure that the water level reaches the upper rule level and claim that the dam is safe,” said the official. “The water level is nearing the upper rule level. Once the water level touches the upper rule level Tamil Nadu may release more water to Periyar or through a tunnel,” he said. Meanwhile, the water level in Idukki reservoir declined from 2,400.80ft at 6am on Sunday to 2,400.66ft at 6pm. On Saturday, the power generation temporarily halted at Moolamattam power plant after the generators tripped off and caused the water level to increase for the next few hours. The power generation at the Moolamattam power plant on Saturday was 13.328mu. A KSEB dam safety official said that the catchment area of the dam is now receiving low rainfall and the water inflow from Periyar also is less. If extremely heavy rainfall does not occur, the present water level will decline within days, said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/mullaperiyar-water-level-rises-as-tn-stops-tunnel-discharge/articleshow/87968956.cms||---

Majority of farmers are concerned about challenges of water management. Many farmers in Vikarabad shared their thoughts on crop switch with STOI, saying that there has to be mapping of paddy appropriate land and fields not favourable to conversion. Sharing the concerns of farmers not only in the district, but also in the state, N Mohan Reddy of Kothagadi village in Vikarabad district, who is into vegetable and paddy cultivation, stated, “If an acre goes into paddy cultivation, the nearby farmers are also forced to cultivate paddy due to canal supply. Water from high-flowing areas reach the soil of low-lying farms nearby, and upper land may not be suitable for non-paddy cultivation”. This time, he explained, he is cultivating paddy for domestic consumption, not for sale. Tatlavat Lakshman, who cultivates different crops including paddy in nine acres, stated that in his village, Nagaram in Dharur mandal of Vikarabad district, many farmers prefer the comfort of paddy due to lack of understanding of other crops. “This season, I am reducing my extent. There must be some planning on paddy areas because some fields have been under the staple cultivation for years. There cannot be a single rule for every farm. Local specific land conditions must be analysed. Farmers should be given more information about their conditions and appropriateness,” he told TOI. VK Narsireddy, another farmer from Yennepalli village, observed that farmers were worried as to what would happen to other crops if they change at once. Only Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had a higher area under paddy cultivation in the second cr0op season (rabi) in the country. Telangana’s paddy extent was quite low in the early years of the state’s creation during the second season (rabi) but over the last two seasons, the paddy extent has nearly doubled, with nearly 50 lakh acres under cultivation. According to experts, paddy mapping is the necessity of the hour. Agricultural land parcels which have changed to paddy cultivation during the last two seasons could be converted, but there must be a clear identification of farms under canal irrigation with tanks and irrigation facilities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/paddy-farmers-concern-about-crop-switch-want-mapping/articleshow/87968958.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant of the virus. Nodal in-charge of the rapid response team Dr Bhudev (who goes by the first name only) said the foreign nationals from Lithuania, Spain and Switzerland tested positive for coronavirus in the RTPCR tests conducted prior to their scheduled departure to their native countries. Only one of them -- a woman from Lithuania -- was fully vaccinated. All of them (who are Krishna devotees) were staying at Girdhar Dham in Vrindavan and had come to India on a tourist visa. The other two Covid positive patients are locals, Dr Bhudev said. Girdhar Dham, where 16 people were staying, has been declared a containment zone. A total of 44 people who came in contact with these Covid positive patients were also tested for the disease and their reports are awaited. Health officials said the woman from Lithuania is 30 years old, the Spanish is a 44-year-old woman and the Swiss national is a 47-year-old male. Their condition is stable and they have been isolated in the ashram. District magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said testing of foreign nationals, who come from countries identified as ‘at risk’, will be done. “All precautions will be taken to curb the spread of the disease,” he said, adding that health officials are on alert.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/3-foreigners-test-covid-positive-in-vrindavan-amid-omicron-concerns/articleshow/87967162.cms||---

The women, who are in different stages of pregnancy, have been sent to the medical college, situated nearly 100km away from Attapadi, as they developed some complications. Health officials are angry and helpless seeing the plight of tribespeople in Attapadi. They feel the government should stop spoon-feeding tribespeople and instead make themselves self-sufficient in agriculture and other sectors. “Attapadi has been declared as a taluk. If the government is upgrading this hospital to a taluk hospital, tribespeople will get the service of more speciality doctors and other infrastructure. Though there are eight specialities in the hospital now, no senior doctors are there in gynaecology, neonatal and medicine,” said Dr R Prabhudas, tribal health nodal officer. When junior doctors have some doubts, they call senior doctors in hospitals outside the area and refer the patient based on their advice. Scanning of pregnant women is conducted only when a doctor from outside visits the hospital every two weeks, Prabhudas said. There is also no facility for CT scan. The tribal hospital witnesses a footfall of around 200 tribespeople every day in OP and 80% in IP. Most of the cases are related to anaemia and malnourishment. It also sees 50–60 deliveries of tribal women per month. Of this, around 15 are low birth weight. “Earlier, 50% of newborns had low birth weight. It has reduced now due to the intervention of the government. But the government needs to do more for long term effects. We have been writing to the government for the last 10 years, raising various issues, including the lack of CT scan facilities, but to no avail,” added Prabhudas. Rajendraprasad of Thampu, an NGO, said the government listens only to officials, SC promoters and panchayat members. “The government should also listen to the tribespeople and know what they want. Their requirements are very less. It should come to the ground level. The government should bring the tribespeople to their traditional agriculture for a self-sustainable approach,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/pregnant-women-from-attapadi-referred-to-tsr-medical-college/articleshow/87968235.cms||---

Addressing the gathering after laying foundation stone of the Taposthal, Channi said the research centre would showcase the message of the three epics. For ages these epics had been source of life and inspiration for entire humanity, the CM said, adding that the research centre would act as a catalyst for disseminating the message of among the masses in simplest form. The state government was trying to rope in Shankaracharya for the project, he added. Bhagwan Parshuram Taposthan would be developed as an architectural marvel, he announced, adding a cheque of Rs 10 crore had already been handed over the district administration. “Rs 75 lakh will be spent on development of place related to Mata Renuka, the mother of Lord Parshuram,” he said. As the CM was addressing a function of Brahmin community, he said to ensure proper care of the stray cattle in the state, the Brahmin Welfare Board would be entrusted the task. The funds would be provided to the board for proper upkeep of the stray cattle, he added. Channi announced to make a budgetary provision of Rs 2 crore for Bhagwan Parshuram Chair in the Punjabi University at Patiala. He also announced a grant of Rs 21 lakh for Khaati village panchayat. Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the state government had provided platform to the (Brahmin) community for strengthening them. Thanking the CM for announcing grant of Rs 10 crore for development of the place, he said, “now, after the CM has thought so much for well being of the (Brahmin) community, it is moral duty of the community to support CM Channi and the Congress in coming days.” CM compares Badal with Dhritraashtra Citing example from Mahabharat to attack the Badals, the chief minister said the Kauravas were ruined due to puttar moh (love for son) of King Dhritraashtra. “In the same manner, the Akalis are in shambles due to the love of SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal for his son. Mahabharat is a treatise regarding the statecraft and is still relevant and poor situation of the Akali Dal is an example of it,” he said. Kejriwal, an outsider and rumourmonger Claiming that Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal had little knowledge about Punjab, Channi said the Delhi CM was groping in dark for fulfilling his lust for power. “Besides being an outsider, Kejriwal is a rumourmonger, who knows nothing about state but pokes his nose into everything, but such type of cheap politics will never be successful in the state,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/channi-woos-brahmins-with-research-centre-on-three-epics/articleshow/87968972.cms||---

The event was also attended by CDLU vice-chancellor Professor Ajmer Singh Malik along with Amit Sangwan, editor of the newsletter and director public relations of the university. The governor also talked about the new education policy and said the policy aimed to expertise students in professional aspects. He shared his vision for the university with Malik and said he wanted new job-oriented courses to be started in the varsity so that professional skills could be imparted to the students that would eventually build a strong nation. Prof Malik put forth various student welfare schemes put in place by the university at the occasion. He said the newsletter launched by the department of journalism and mass communication would provide hands-on experience to the students in guidance with the teachers. He said the newsletter would be an insight into the kaleidoscopic activities of the department. He encouraged the students and teachers of the department for this new feat. ‘Important contribution of alumni in making universities self-reliant’ While addressing the online alumni meet function, Haryana governor and chancellor of Chaudhary Devi Lal University, Sirsa, Bandaru Dattatreya called upon the alumni to come forward to contribute in making the universities self-reliant. He said the alumni should adopt their mother institutions and set the target of taking the government grant of the university to zero. Describing the alumni as the capital of the educational institution, the governor said all universities should create a separate alumni cell and create a database from the first batch till date. He added that if all the universities were successful in doing this, then soon they would be completely or partially free from government grants.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/media-vital-to-democracy-dattatreya/articleshow/87968986.cms||---

The accident took place on Saturday evening when Dangal Singh (42), a marginal farmer, was working on the terrace of his house. He apparently accidently touched the overhead cable and was instantly electrocuted. Hearing her husband’s screams, his wife, Jashoda Devi (38), rushed upstairs and tried to rescue him. She, too, sustained burns. The couple was rushed to the government medical college in Shahjahanpur, where Dangal Singh was declared dead. Yashoda succumbed to injuries during treatment. The couple is survived by three daughters and two sons but there is no breadwinner in the family. The oldest daughter is 17 years old. On their part, power department officials said the power lines were laid before the houses in that row were constructed. The construction of these houses was done without proper approval, they added. Manbahadur Singh, SHO of Mirzapur police station, said, “The bodies were handed over to their kin after autopsy on Sunday. No official complaint has so far been filed in this matter.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/man-electrocuted-wife-dies-in-bid-to-rescue-him/articleshow/87967223.cms||---

Kuch Nahin Hota Yaar. This attitude could lead us to a serious predicament. Wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing are must. It is important to ensure everyone is vaccinated with two doses," said Thackeray The chief minister, on the second anniversary of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, chaired an online Covid review meeting on the new variant Omicron with divisional commissioners, district collectors, police commissioners and CEOs. Members of the state task force also attended the meeting. District administrations have been directed to take utmost care as an increase in Covid cases would result in another lockdown which the state could not afford, warned Thackeray at the meet, held on Sunday evening. Testing of passengers arriving at domestic and international terminals is to be stepped up. “All district administrations are to take up all necessary steps… without awaiting instructions from the Centre," he said.  Administrations will have to check on the availability of oxygen, medicines and complete audits of fire systems in hospitals. Thackeray expressed concern on the decrease in testing and directed procurement of testing kits that can detect the new variant. Task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said Omicron has replaced the Delta variant within two weeks, which shows how deadly it is. "While Delta had two mutations, Beta had three, Omicron has over 50. Doctors and experts are still investigating whether it responds to current medicines and vaccines. The rate of infection is far higher than that of the Delta variant,” he said. Dr Joshi said the only way to avoid Omicron is to wear two masks, move in the open and get vaccinated with a double dose. A surgical three-ply mask and a N95 maks would be optimal, he said. "If someone is wearing a cloth mask, it should be doubled with a surgical mask. Those who are using N95 needn't use a double mask,” he said. The taskforce has also said that the immediate priority before booster or an additional third shot is immunisation of unvaccinated people. "The threat from Delta is very much alive and it shouldn’t be allowed to return or cause outbreaks in sporadic spots," he said. The taskforce has further recommended quarantine for people coming from ‘at-risk’ nations. "The debate right now is whether to put them in home quarantine or institutional," said Joshi. The Centre is likely to announce a quarantine policy.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/double-masks-2-dose-vax-must-to-avoid-omicron-cm-uddhav-thackeray/articleshow/87969421.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh’s Covid recovery rate hits pre-second wave level||VISAKHAPATNAM: Even amid the growing global concerns over the new Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of the SARS-CoV-2, Andhra Pradesh is back to pre-second wave levels in terms of recovery rate (99.2%). The present active caseload is only about 0.1% of the cumulative infection numbers in the state. The last time the state recorded such a recovery rate was in the first half of February – before the onset of the second wave. There were hardly 600 active cases in the third week of February, a few weeks into the roll-out of the mass vaccination drive. But the active caseload surged past the 2-lakh mark by May, the month that overwhelmed the state’s health care system. There was a severe shortage of oxygen beds, oxygen supplies and even vaccines due to the unprecedented explosion of new cases. There were many days in May that recorded a record 25% case positivity rate. The state took only 110 days to record 8.9 lakh cases in the second wave, equivalent to the total cases surfaced in Andhra Pradesh in the entire first wave from March 2020 to February 2021. The state started showing early signs of stabilisation in daily infections in July. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of the novel coronavirus has dominated the second wave in Andhra Pradesh. At least 70% of the total samples sequenced from May belonged to this lineage, which is said to be more transmissible before the recent classification of Omicron. The change in the landscape of ‘variants of concern’ can be understood from the fact that the Delta variant was found in only 2% of the total sequenced samples in March in Andhra Pradesh. The share of Delta cases found in these samples increased to 38% in April and consequently to 81% in May. Genomic surveillance has found the Delta variant in 70% of the total samples even in July. Director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences and state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that even though there are easily manageable daily case numbers, the Omicron variant has put India on alert again. “The state health department is closely following the situation,” said Dr Rambabu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/aps-recovery-rate-hits-pre-second-wave-level/articleshow/87967244.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors worried about declining antibody||KOLKATA: Doctors who must come in close contact with their patients but have got their second vaccine more than eight months ago, are worried about their declining immunity. ENTs and dentists are particularly anxious and have been getting their antibody level tested frequently. Many have got inadequate antibodies and could be at risk, say microbiologists. A prominent corporate hospital in Kolkata has tested around a dozen such doctors for antibodies over the last two months. A majority were found to have less than 10 ‘trite’ which is inadequate to fight the Covid-19 virus. A dental surgeon who completed vaccination in March said he has been feeling quite helpless since his antibody count has dropped. “I got myself tested twice and the last count shows it’s inadequate. The nature of my job is such that I can’t avoid getting close to my patients. Despite the enhanced protection that I have been using, the risk of an infection is high. I am desperate for a third vaccine, though that, too, doesn’t guarantee protection any longer since the South African variant is on the prowl,” he said. Dentist Saradindu Pal said he doesn’t take off his mask or gloves even for a minute during the 8-10 hours he spends with patients every day. “Yet, there is a risk involved since I completed my vaccination eight months ago,” said Pal. There is yet no WHO guideline on a safe antibody count. “Tests reveal that they wane appreciably in six months to a year. Unlike the rest of the community, doctors completed their vaccination more than eight months ago and have obviously suffered an antibody dip. They are worried about it and several have got tested. The count has dropped significantly for some, including some ENTs and dentists, who are obviously jittery,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chowdhury. A section of medics, however, said a slide in antibodies will not make them more vulnerable to Covid since T-cells, B cells and memory cells, generated by vaccines, provide resistance as well. “They don’t wane in less than a year and may remain effective for several years. Unless there is a significant mutation, they will continue to offer protection. So, everyone in the community should get vaccinated and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour. Doctors are not necessarily at a greater risk,” said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-worried-about-declining-antibody/articleshow/87968242.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Nagpur||MSRDC gets 75% land for new township on Samruddhi corridor||Nagpur: One of the 20 townships proposed under Samruddhi Mahamarg is all set to become reality in Arvi tehsil of Wardha district. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has received 75% of the required land. Named Krishi Samruddhi Kendra, the new townships are considered a difficult task, as the land is being acquired under land pooling system instead of direct purchase or acquisition. MSRDC vice-chairman and managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar inspected works on the corridor as well as the site of new township proposed in Arvi tehsil on Saturday, and other packages in Western Maharashtra on Sunday. “Major works of package-I (Nagpur to Wardha district) have been completed. Work of last leg is going on. We are forcing contractors to expedite works so that stretch from Nagpur to Shirdi can be started whenever decision is taken by the government. Otherwise, contractors have time till July 15, 2022. We would have completed the works 1.5 years in advance had Covid-19 pandemic not hit,” he said. Mopalwar added that notification of toll charges will be issued within 15 days. “I also reviewed development of tolls, 20 petrol pumps, emergency management systems, and other basic amenities. We plan to extend the expressway to Gondia district, for which tender will be issued on Monday,” he said. During his visit in August, MSRDC minister Eknath Shinde had announced the stretch from Nagpur to Shirdi will start for traffic by December end. MSRDC is worried about delay of package-I. MSRDC officials said, “Concretization of only 5 of 31km is remaining in package-I and will be completed by December end. Works on all 140 structures, including flyovers, bridges, under and over passes etc have been completed. Some 65% works on wildlife overpasses are complete,” they said. As per data given to Mopalwar by MSRDC officials, the new township proposed in Arvi tehsil will require 1,169.19 hectare of which 75% is in possession of MSRDC as on date. This is one of six nodes selected to be developed under phase-I and only one in Nagpur division. The township will be situated on both sides of the 120-meter wide expressway in six mouzas. A team of MSRDC officials led by additional collector Nishikant Sukhe has reportedly kept target to complete acquisition of 90% land within next couple of months so that works can begin in six months. “Township plan is being prepared by a private company in Ahmedabad. We could get land for construction of road as project-affected-persons were given five times of ready reckoner value, and sales statistics value immediately after handing over the land. For townships, we are taking land under land pooling system. In this, PAPs would get 30% of their total land in developed manner after 3-4 years. Therefore, PAPs are taking time,” MSRDC officials said. After handing over the land, PAPs will receive Rs30,000 per acre for rain fed land, Rs45,000 per acre for seasonal irrigated or seasonal cash crops land, and Rs60,000 per acre for irrigated land as crop compensation for a period of 10 years. This amount will be increased 10% every year to take inflation into account.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/msrdc-gets-75-land-for-new-township-on-samruddhi-corridor/articleshow/87969020.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two MSRTC staffers held for stone pelting; 50 FIRs lodged||Mumbai: The state bus service has been badly hit for over a month now as 80% workers continue to remain defiant while 20% who are back on duty are afraid to operate buses. A total 32 incidents of stone pelting on ST buses across Maharashtra to deter many drivers from taking out buses on the road. So far 50 police FIRs have been lodged. The bus corporation suspended 93 more staffers on Sunday. On Saturday night, a bus conductor from Jamner depot was arrested after a long chase on the road and in the fields. The conductor was hiding behind a truck on the road while the ST bus was leaving the depot for Jalgaon. He reportedly hurled a huge stone on the bus in order to break the windscreen. The bus halted, and a policeman in plain clothes who was travelling in the bus, along with the bus conductor, chased the culprit and caught him after a few hundred metres. The arrested MSRTC staffer has been booked by police and suspended from service. Similarly, a 35-year-old ST bus driver was arrested for allegedly damaging a bus run by his colleague on Kalyan-Bhiwandi route by hurling stones at the vehicle on Saturday evening. The accused, identified as Vitthal Khedkar, reportedly threatened his colleague bus driver Suresh Sawant (57) who resumed duty after the state government hiked salaries. Over 6,000 full time employees have been suspended for being part of the agitation so far. A few of those suspended returned to work on Saturday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-two-msrtc-staffers-held-for-stone-pelting-50-firs-lodged/articleshow/87969888.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolkata||ISC exam on, ICSE starts today: Schools gear up to handle two batches of examinees on campus||KOLKATA: Over 30,000 examinees across 350 schools will be writing their ICSE examination that starts on Monday.  The exam will now happen simultaneously with the ongoing ISC examination, that started on November 22. The mathematics exam for ISC that was scheduled on Monday has been postponed, so schools will just have the ICSE candidates on campus on Monday. From Tuesday onwards, campuses will have both ICSE and ISC candidates coming in two shifts and schools have prepared different strategies to handle so many kids on campus for a physical board exam for the first time since 2019. ICSE candidates will get their papers at 10:50 am and finish at noon. After this, schools will ensure that candidates leave the campus latest by 12:30 pm and then sanitisation will be done. ISC candidates will start coming in from 1 pm and will be made to sit in separate pre-sanitised rooms before they are ushered into the exam halls/rooms. The Heritage School has two separate sets of buses by which they will bring in the 182 candidates of ICSE and 208 of ISC. The school will have 16 teachers going to other schools for invigilation and evaluation and 16 more coming in for the same purpose. “We have arranged for two huge rooms where the ICSE and ISC examiners will sit for evaluation,” said principal Seema Sapru. St Xavier’s Collegiate School has 230 boys writing ICSE and 225 writing ISC from the two gymnasiums in the senior school and primary school with sanitisation in between. Since schools will manage with a limited number of teachers on campus, many like La Martiniere for Boys and Girls, DPS New Town and Rammohun Mission have asked classes IX and XI to attend online classes when the exams are on.  “It was a short but memorable time. We look forward to having them back with us in school in January,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of LMG. “In the online mode, we can merge sections and substitute teachers can manage them easily,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohun Mission school where 172 students will write ICSE from Monday. At St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, there are 150 ICSE examinees and 131 will write ISC papers. Sanitisation will happen in between. CBSE schools are also preparing for the major papers to start from Tuesday and many have asked IX and XI students to attend online classes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/isc-exam-on-icse-starts-today-schools-gear-up-to-handle-2-batches-of-examinees-on-campus/articleshow/87968272.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The victims were on their way to a wedding. Police have seized the truck and arrested the driver, Zubair Khan, a resident of Moradabad. The trio died on the spot after sustaining severe head injuries, police said. They were identified as Pawan Kumar (62), Susheela (59) and Rinki (8). They were residents of Gyanpur locality in Majhola area of Moradabad. Naresh Kumar, Pawan’s cousin, told TOI, “He was a head constable in UP Police and had taken voluntary retirement in 2019, after the death of his father, five months ago.” Akhilesh Bhadauria, additional SP, said, “We have arrested the truck driver and sent him to jail. An FIR has been registered under IPC sections 304a (causing death by negligence) and 269 (rash driving) at Pakwada police station.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/retd-cop-wife-grandkid-die-as-truck-hits-their-bike-on-up-highway/articleshow/87967276.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Kids dying, need robust donation policy on organs’||Mumbai: It is time for India to have a robust policy for paediatric organ donation, said Chennai heart transplant surgeon Dr K R Balakrishnan. Parents of younger children are more likely to be open to donating organs, but administrative norms and reluctance to approach families often tend to become a hurdle, he said. “Many children waiting for organ transplants die due to a shortage of available organs. At the same time, we have paediatric hospitals that see many brain deaths in children. We have to bring the two together by roping in such hospitals urgently to meet demand for paediatric cadaver organs,” said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also director of Jaslok Hospital’s new heart and lung transplant programme. “At a philosophical level, parents may be willing to donate to make some sense of the loss of the child,” he said, adding that with 40% of India’s population being under 18, the need for organs was massive. In 2017, a doctor couple from Amravati failed to donate organs of their three-month-old daughter Meera after she was declared brain dead. Despite the willingness of parents, the infant’s organs could not be harvested due to lack of clarity of rules at the time. Doctors said the big challenge in the absence of paediatric donations was fitting infants with adult organs. Dr S K Mathur, who heads the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee, said guidelines are clearer now, but paediatric donations are low due to the same lack of awareness that continues to hamper adult donations. “Awareness has to be created among paediatric intensivists,” he said. For adults the interval between two tests to diagnose brain death is six hours. It varies in infants, children between one-five years and 6-12 years. About 27 years after the country’s first heart transplant, India records more than 250 annually. “But only 20-30% account for paediatric transplants,” said Dr Suresh Rao.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-dying-need-robust-donation-policy-on-organs/articleshow/87969439.cms||---

The three suspects, who were held at Manwat in Parbhani district, also promised the victim help in finding secret treasure hidden in the house. In his complaint, the 36-year-old businessman said he was in touch of the three accused during the period between June 3 and November 13. “The conmen told the complainant that his house was under the influence of black magic done by his enemies and a witch. To negate such evil effects, the accused sought Rs 7,02,000 in cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 2,93,200,” the police said. When the victim did not get any relief or benefit assured by the conmen, he sought his money and gold back. The trio denied. “The accused threatened the victim to transform him into a cock using black magic. They also threatened him of dire consequences if he revealed any details to others,” the police said. Acting on the victim’s complaint, the cantonment police have booked Sitaram Maharaj, Shankar Maharaj and Asif Qureshi, all resident of Manwat in Parbhani district. The police have invoked enabling provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, as well as IPC sections of 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) among other charges. Further investigation is on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/conmen-offer-to-negate-effects-of-black-magic-dupe-bizman-of-rs-10l/articleshow/87966728.cms||---

City which bagged all- India third rank in Swachh Survekshan - 2021 is facing difficulty in continuing with the initiatives. Vijayawada city was rated as ODF++ in Swachh Survekshan rankings and also given five-star rating for its initiatives related to cleanliness. The civic body had made intense efforts to make the city open urination-free. Urination spots were identified and transformed into beautiful gardens. Public toilets were installed at multiple locations. But the civic body is failing to maintain the toilets properly. Majority of public urinals in the city are in bad condition. Water system there has become dysfunctional. “We can use toilets only when they are clean and hygienic. We can see public urinals at multiple locations in the city. But the issue is their maintenance. Stink emanating from them is unbearable. We can’t even walk near them, let alone using them,” said K Ramesh, a street vendor. One the other hand, composting units arranged at Rythu Bazaars have become non-functional. None of them is in use and vendors are dumping vegetable waste in canal bunds and discarded bins. Garbage dumping is improper and waste gets piled up at Ajith Singh Nagar transfer station. “VMC should focus on continuing swachh initiatives throughout the year. Instead of huge publicity campaigns, like the one held in the three months during the survey, officials should educate the people throughout the year. Public toilets are stinking and people continue to urinate in public in a few spots. Similarly, canal bunds continue to be dump sites. This should be rectified,” said Donepudi Shankar, CPI city secretary. Authorities of health and sanitation wing said they are focusing on core issues in sanitation and taking necessary measures to improve the swachh rank.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/vmc-swachh-initiatives-lose-momentum/articleshow/87967300.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Kolkata||From mandatory attendance to sanitisation funds, Kolkata colleges fight fake WhatsApp notices||KOLKATA: College authorities are grappling with a new problem after the reopening of campuses. Fake notices are doing the rounds on the official WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels of the students with fake signatures of the official signatories of the institutions either asking for money for sanitisation of the college, seeking help for illness of a professor or principal or even spreading rumours like college has been reopened to all the students with mandatory attendance. Several principals have forwarded these fake notices to the cops and even lodged official complaints after such notices created panic among students and many of them even ended up paying the money. Such incidents have also been reported from colleges in the districts. Asutosh College has informed the Cyber Police Station of the Kolkata Police about a fake notice circulating on the students’ WhatsApp group demanding money for sanitisation of the college. The notice was printed on a fake notepad with the details of the college and forged signature and college stamp. “The college did not issue any notice demanding money for sanitisation of the campus. The college is bearing all the expensed related to sanitisation and other safety protocols. It was an attempt to defame the college. We have already informed the Cyber Crime PS and forwarded the details,” said Apurba Ray, vice principal of the college. Campuses have only reopened partially after the pandemic and only a section of students have been called for in-person classes or lab work. But in a north Kolkata college, a notice on WhatsApp counterfeiting the signature and stamp of authorised signatory said all the students must attend classes as attendance is mandatory. “I have not yet lodged a formal complaint but forwarded the fake notice to the local police station,” said the principal, who did not wish to be named. Since the pandemic, schools and colleges have been facing this problem of fake notices in students’ groups which cause panic among students and their parents. Earlier such fake notices were limited to examination routine, but principals say these fake notices are now disrupting their functioning. Somebody created a fake profile of the principal of Kharagpur’s Hijli College and started asking the contacts for money impersonating the principal. A complaint has been lodged with the district cyber crime cell. “I have lodged a complaint. The person who created the fake account was asking money from the contacts,” said Asis Kumar Dandapat, principal of the college.

---||India||LAC open to salami slicing by China due to grazing curbs||NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing border standoff with China, Indian Army’s restrictions on grazing in the traditional pasture land has left areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh vulnerable to ‘salami slicing’ by the People’s Liberation Army and affected livestock rearing, the sole livelihood of nomadic inhabitants, who act as the ‘eyes’ of the forces. “The Chinese have given unfettered freedom to their nomads to move freely. They very often use their nomad community to transgress on our land in a step-by-step approach,” Konchok Stanzin, LAHDC Councillor representing Chushul constituency, had said in a memorandum to defence minister Rajnath Singh during his November 18 visit to the area. Separately, Stanzin told TOI that Indian nomads are restricted by the Indian Army from grazing their livestock on the traditional pastureland stretching from Hot Spring, Fingers (features on the north bank of Pangong Tso) to Nyalung Yokma and Nyalung Gongma, features on the south bank of Pangong that the Army refers to as Kailash range, Rechin La, Rezang La, Black Top, Gurung Hill and Phurtsur Karpo. Government estimates peg the number of livestock at 79,250 in the Changthang area, requiring 4,775 quintals each of feed and fodder for 30 days through the winter. “In summer, herders move their flock to inland meadows and valleys. But in winter, the pastures along the LAC have the typical grass that sheep, goat and yaks sniff out from under snow,” Stanzin said. “The Chinese send livestock and then send soldiers in civilian clothes as herders to pitch tents for staking claim on our land. These traditional grazing areas are important and our nomads must be allowed there with their livestock so they can detect any trespass,” he said, referring to reports of Chinese yaks grazing in Tharsang valley north of Marsimik La. People in the know said restrictions are a result of the de-escalation process in Pangong and Chushul areas, where both armies were eyeballing each other since May 2020 clashes in Galwan valley along the Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road India opened west of Chushul in 2019.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lac-open-to-salami-slicing-by-china-due-to-grazing-curbs/articleshow/87970076.cms||Sanjay Dutta

They target citizens in the US and Canada, luring them with $5,000 assistance to tide over crisis caused by Covid pandemic, and taking away $2,000 from them instead. These call centres are run in small shops, cars, autorickshaw or even on scooters are mainly located in eastern Ahmedabad, mostly in GIDCs. Police sources said, “The crooks call foreigners, ask them if they have suffered a financial setback during Covid and offer them instant relief of $5,000. If the person agrees, they ask the victim to pay $2,000 to avail of the instant aid. Once the money is paid, the criminals disappear.” Using the dark web, these accused also send messages to foreign nationals, showing that some amount has been credited to their account. “They create fake cellphone number or dummy bank website through which they send messages,” said the officer.  Earlier, scamsters duped foreigners by offering payday loans or threaten to implicate them in a false narcotics case. “With increased awareness, targets realize they are being conned and dial the security agencies. So, the criminals have come up with a new modus operandi,” said another officer. Many of them operate from Vatva GIDC and industrial areas of Narol where they set up call centres in interior units, he said. This method is also being used by fake call centres in Mewat and Alwar to dupe Indians.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/from-abad-with-loan-us-targets-hit/articleshow/87968339.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||DK to test Kerala students who arrived in last 15 days||MANGALURU: Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner Dr K V Rajendra has said the health department will launch a drive to conduct RT-PCR tests on all students from Kerala, who have arrived on campuses in the last 15 days. The move comes in the wake of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai directing the district administration to enhance border surveillance to prevent the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19. Meanwhile, all interstate travellers are being screened on the border. The district has already deployed police on interstate borders and is allowing commuters who have RT-PCR negative reports. The DC said: “The test positivity rate in Kerala is still around 8 per cent and the chief minister has given directions that interstate surveillance needs to be strengthened. Personnel from police stations of respective areas on borders will man the check posts in the districts. Similarly, officials from other departments will also be deployed to conduct round-the-clock border surveillance in three shifts.” In the last four months, border surveillance was in force, but it was relaxed in the last one month, he said. “Since the CM has given directions, we have decided to reintroduce strict border surveillance. The CM also has directed that those who are commuting daily need to be screened. Hence, we will prepare a list of daily commuters between Kasaragod and Mangaluru and start a testing facility on the border in Talapady.” On interstate KSRTC bus services between Dakshina Kannada and Mangaluru, the DC said it will continue but passengers will have to carry RT-PCR negative reports. “We will check passengers on buses and other vehicles randomly on the borders. Meanwhile, another round of screening will also be launched soon for all students on campuses in addition to the screening of Kerala students. More technicians will be appointed to collect swabs and conduct RT-PCR tests on students,” he said. Dakshina Kannada has many border routes that connect Kasaragod and it is a challenge for the district administration since both districts share common bonds, he said. “Nearly 30-40% of people in Kasaragod depend on Mangaluru. Though the positivity rate in Kerala is high, it is less in the Kasaragod district. Hence, we will implement a surveillance mechanism without troubling commuters much,” he added. District awaits SA passengers list Asked about the Omicron virus variant spreading from South Africa and other red-list countries, the DC said the district is waiting for a list of passengers from the government. “The government will send a list of all passengers, who have arrived from countries affected by the Omicron variant. The list will include details of all passengers who have arrived in the past 15 days. Meanwhile, the passports of those who are arriving from Dubai via Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) will also be checked to ensure whether they have visited those countries. Even if the passengers from the red-list countries arrive with RT-PCR negative reports, they will be made to undergo a test here again and sent for one week’s quarantine. A meeting of MIA authorities will be held soon as per government directions,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/dk-to-test-kerala-students-who-arrived-in-last-15-days/articleshow/87967317.cms||---

It is for one and all,” President Ram Nath Kovind said on Sunday at the convocation of Patanjali University, where he was the chief guest. The university, which offers graduate, post-graduate and diploma courses in yoga science, physical education, psychology, physical education and Sanskrit among others, organised its first convocation on Sunday. The President, who also inaugurated a new campus building of the institution, lauded the university’s chancellor, yoga guru Ramdev for his contribution to “the popularisation of yoga and for doing good for a large number of people by inspiring them to practice yoga”. Kovind said before Ramdev made it a household practice, as “people are now seen practicing anulom vilom even in railway waiting rooms and airport lounges”, yoga was considered a means of penance – reserved only for seers and sanyasis. He said that thanks to Ramdev, the UN declared June 21 as International Yoga Day, which was first celebrated in 2015. Then in 2016, the UNESCO included it in the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list. Kovind also recalled how Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel had once said that “yoga is the best gift that India has given to the entire humanity” after learning it from an Indian trainer. He added that he was proud of the fact that through yoga, the country had forged a way to become “rogamukt and bhogamukt” (free of disease and indulgence) and “attain life's higher goals”. According to Ramdev, Patanjali Yogpeeth, which funds the university, will start work on a global university in 2022 and when it is ready by 2025, 1 lakh students can study here. President Kovind also visited Rishikesh’s Parmarth Niketan ashram where he participated in the evening aarti on the banks of the Ganga.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/yoga-doesnt-belong-to-any-one-religion-or-culture-prez-at-patanjali-univs-1st-convocation/articleshow/87967333.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

With the peak wedding season here, this is unreasonable,” said HRAWI senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty. Hoteliers said the cap for open-air spaces ought to be 75% instead.  Shetty also pointed out that putting the onus on ensuring covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) on the proprietors is “very difficult and impractical”. Meanwhile, senior officials from BMC’s disaster management wing said the 25% limit was given because there might be a risk of people crowding such events and then there may not be any control unless brought to the notice of the concerned authorities.  “25% limit is actually correct, there is no anomaly,” officials added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-why-25-cap-on-open-air-venues-ask-hoteliers/articleshow/87969446.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Aurangabad||Complaints of pvt vehicles overcharging increase||Aurangabad: Amid the ongoing strike called by Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) employees, the complaints against private vehicle operators for overcharging on different routes have been increasing. Several passengers said the private buses and other vehicles were charging at least 50% more than the actual ticket charges of state transportation buses. While the regional transport office (RTO) Aurangabad had said that it has deployed squads at bus stands and other pick-up points to keep a check on overcharging by private operators, passengers said such a measure was of no use. “I was asked to pay Rs 250 per head by bus operators at the CIDCO bus stand for travelling from Aurangabad to Beed, though the fare on an MSRTC bus is around Rs 170. I could not spot RTO authorities at the site to end the broad daylight loot,” said Shripad Beedkar, who works in the private sector. As MSRTC buses were off the road till Sunday morning, Aurangabad-Pune, Aurangabad-Jalgaon, Aurangabad-Nagpur are among other routes where private buses are plying extensively. A section of passengers also alleged that RTO authorities were mute spectators to the instances of overcharging. Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the government authorities should help the passengers during these times. “The RTO should keep a record of private buses plying on different routes daily and the fares charged from passengers. Some token action against errant operators is also essential to set a deterrent,” he said. Aurangabad regional transport officer Sanjay Metrewar could not be reached for his comments. A day after the incidents of stone-pelting at some buses in some parts of Maharashtra took place, only around 33 MSRTC depots witnessed operations across the state till Sunday afternoon. The majority of the employees have still not returned to work, pressing for the demand of merging the MSRTC with the state government to end disparity in salaries and other benefits.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/complaints-of-pvt-vehicles-overcharging-increase/articleshow/87966743.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state average rainfall in the post monsoon season so far has been 425mm against the normal value of 192mm. The weather has been dry over Goa for the past two days. Changing wind patterns will however bring light thundershower activity over Goa, this week. “Light to moderate rainfall will be experienced at isolated places over Goa for four to five days from November 28. There will be a slight increase in the rainfall distribution of rainfall over Goa thereafter owing to the possibility of the formation of a circulation over the east central Arabian Sea from November 30 onwards,” IMD said. Based on the present conditions, the IMD has urged citizens to be updated with the nowcast. Due to squally weather and wind speeds reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to even 60 kmph, fishermen have been issued a warning against venturing into the sea during those days. The minimum temperature however may increase by one to two degrees Celsius from November 29 onwards owing to the change in wind patterns and cloudy mornings. There will be a reduction in rainfall from December 4 onwards, with near-dry conditions prevailing then on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/states-post-monsoon-rainfall-122-surplus/articleshow/87969104.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Business buzz grows around schools after reopening||KOLKATA: From food joints to churan sellers, stationery stores to photocopy centres, the return of students to schools have brought cheer to traders. Father-son duo Naresh and Dinesh Singh — who have been running the Hedua Chaat for the last eight decades, catering to as many as five schools and colleges in the area — were practically out of business for one-and-half years. “We would open our shop at 8am and shut by 5pm. But the pandemic made life difficult. Our business had come down to 30%. The first week of reopening of schools and colleges has seen business return to 80% of what it was prior to the pandemic,” said Singh, who has a stall outside Scottish Church Collegiate school. Standing outside La Martiniere for Boys school was 55-year-old Md Shamim, aka Churan Chacha, who is back after a gap of 20 months. “I have been selling churan and pickles outside this school for 25 years now. When the pandemic hit, I had no idea what to do and somehow managed to run my family selling my wares at weddings and other occasions. But I used to miss the children and their affectionate call of ‘Churan Chacha’. I am glad to be back,” said Shamim. Two popular eateries outside St Xaviers’ school and college — Delight and food truck Yummee — were also happy to be back. “Our business centres around students. We struggled to even make Rs 500 a day when the institutions were shut. But since reopening, we have started getting back old and new customers,” said Md Sameer, owner of the food truck. Also back in business are school stationery and photocopy operators. “We used to photocopy lakhs of pages in a day at a very cheap rate of 40 paise per page. But pandemic took away my customers. I ended up in a debt of over Rs 3 lakh. But, I am back in business and hopeful of a full recovery,” said Dipankar Das of Ashu Communication behind Asutosh College.

---||Hyderabad||Health staff have task cut out on convincing men for vasectomy||HYDERABAD: In what could be quite a task, health officials have their hands full in motivating men to opt for family planning surgeries. While the focus has always been on conducting health camps for women to undergo tubectomy, this time it is about convincing men to opt for vasectomy. The Union ministry of health recently said this fortnight was dedicated to conducting special drives to sterilise men. “It is not an easy task. So far, we have been able to convince about 10 men to undergo vasectomy surgery,” said Rangareddy district medical and health officer Dr KV Swarajya Lakshmi. She told STOI that two doctors have been trained to conduct the non-scalpel vasectomy. “The idea is to have at least 100 men opt for the family planning operation,” she said. Authorities in Rangareddy district have taken up a special drive to conduct family planning operations from November 29 to December 4. Additional collector S Tirupathi Rao asked the officials to undertake a campaign even in villages to educate men on opting for the vasectomy. Sarpanches, panchayat secretaries and officials of health, panchayat raj, education and welfare departments will all be involved in the campaign. An official said village men will be educated as the surgery would take only 15 minutes and that they could go back to work in two-three days. Surgeries will be done at Shamshabad area hospital on December 1, at Shadnagar area hospital on December 2, at Chevella area hospital on December 3 and at Kandukur primary health centre on December 4. “Men should not have any doubts about vasectomy. They can go to work from the very next day itself. There will be no health issues,” Dr Lakshmi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/health-staff-have-task-cut-out-on-convincing-men-for-vasectomy/articleshow/87969054.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Seven months on, govt yet to act on committee report||Thiruvananthpuram: Almost seven months after a committee appointed by the government submitted its report on the participatory pension scheme (national pension scheme, NPS) implemented for the state government employees, the government has not taken any decision on it, while keeping the report under wraps without revealing the committee’s recommendations. After the committee submitted its report to the government on April 30 this year, the report reached additional chief secretary (finance) Rajesh Kumar Singh who examined and forwarded it to finance minister K N Balagopal on July 20 this year, as is clear from the electronic file records of the government. The file is now resting on the table of the finance minister. It is reliably learnt that the government is going slow on the report as the committee has recommended that the scheme can be continued, which is against the LDF’s pre-election assurance in 2016 that the scheme will be withdrawn if the LDF government comes to power. The Satish Chandra Babu committee was appointed on November 6, 2018 by the previous UDF government to revisit the NPS implemented for the employees who had joined the service after April 1, 2013. The tenure of the committee, which was originally appointed for a period of six months, was extended four times. An RTI query seeking the recommendations of the committee’s recommendations to the government was declined by the government, citing that since the matter is “under examination” and the decisions on the report “is crucial to a large number of government employees”. The finance minister had stated in the assembly in August this year that the committee’s recommendations include continuing the NPS scheme by taking into consideration the future financial position of the government. It had also recommended that the government’s share should be increased to 14% (which is 10% here at present), provide death-cum-retirement gratuity (DCRG) to employees under the NPS, offer ex-gratia pension to those employees who are retiring without completing 10 years under NPS, and provide option to continue in the statutory pension scheme for those employees who had received their appointment order prior to April 1, 2013, but could join the service only after this date due to administrative reasons. Out of almost five lakh government employees in the state, as many as 1.4 lakh employees are presently under the NPS. Even though the NPS has been implemented in the state, the state government is yet to provide the full benefits of NPS to the employees under the scheme, citing that providing all the benefits under it would mean that the state government has fully endorsed the scheme. The government had spent Rs 70 lakh for the functioning of the committee to revisit the NPS, including the honorarium for the chairman and the members and other expenses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/seven-months-on-govt-yet-to-act-on-committee-report/articleshow/87968370.cms||KP Saikiran

Water supply to some areas in Salt Lake was affected till Sunday afternoon as the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities filled up the five MGD capacity water reservoir at Central Park throughout morning. However, the water pressure is expected to get back to normal by Monday morning. “KMDA completed the upgradation by around 4am on Sunday after which the pumping station was opened. However, water pressure was very low at most places in Salt Lake as the reservoir had to be fully filled. Normal supply resumed from around 4.30pm,” said a BMC official. KMDA went in for phased shutdown of the pumping station to complete upgradation in which bellmouths were fixed with the two new pumps that were recently installed to raise its capacity and supply more water. BMC will soon receive an additional 4 MGD of water, 2 MGD from the New Town treatment plant and another 2 MGD from Tallah. “Sector V now receives around 2 MGD of water from Tallah. The plan is that once filtered water is supplied from New Town, Nabadiganta authorities will no longer have to take the 2 MGD for Sector V that it gets from Tallah as water could be supplied for Bidhannagar,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/salt-lake-water-supply-back-normal-flow-likely-by-today/articleshow/87968329.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Making this announcement in his speech marking the conclusion of the two-day ‘Vari Deeksha’ organised by Kisan Congress here on Sunday, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy said an all-party delegation would also submit a representation to governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on November 29 on paddy procurement. Revanth blamed TRS and BJP governments for the paddy procurement crisis. “The TRS government intentionally slowed down procurement of paddy produced in vaanakalam. Thousands of farmers are waiting at their farms and procurement centres with lakhs of tonnes of unsold paddy, which has started to sprout due to unseasonal rains ,” he alleged. “The talk in political circles is that the only assurance CM KCR got from powers that be in Delhi is that BJP state leaders will not talk about paddy farmers,” he alleged. “PM can issue directions to FCI to procure the entire paddy from Telangana. Instead of prevailing upon him to issue such orders, the state BJP leaders are speaking about issues like free education and health. When farmers are on the verge of facing an economic disaster due to non-procurement of paddy, how can BJP leaders be insensitive that they are talking about coming to power in Telangana,” Revanth said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/cong-to-raise-paddy-issue-in-parliament/articleshow/87969059.cms||---

Caught up in some household work, she somehow forgot to move aside her scooter for the labourers to move around more freely. Or, probably, she was in for some Sunday morning lesson on dignity of labour and determinedness. While she rushed outside to assist moving the scooter aside, Modi was asked timidly by one of the construction labourers if she could just ride it to the right distance. Surprised at this offer, Modi asked the woman if she knew how to ride one and Rachila Pargi not just nodded but said, “Yes!” “Needless to say, I was stunned. After seeing her confidence and mustering English, I couldn’t contain my curiosity and prodded her to know more about her and her background. Pargi, 21-year-old, mother of a three-year-old child, told me that she is pursuing Bachelors in Arts back in her hometown in Rajasthan after her husband, also a construction labourer, knew about her passion to study further,” Modi told TOI. “I got married when I was in Class 12. My husband encouraged me to take up graduation and so, I joined Sarvodaya College in Banswara district and am in my first year,” said Pargi, who lives at a roadside shanty in Manjalpura with her husband and child. The woman said that she keeps practising the basic English that she has learnt at her college and also picked up basic skills in computers too. “Once I complete my graduation, I want to take up a job in some company and give my child a good education too,” Pargi told Modi. A thrilled Modi, moved by the simple woman’s tenacity, asserted that she would try to help Pargi in achieving her dreams.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/construction-worker-aims-for-white-collar-job-one-day/articleshow/87968051.cms||Tushar Tere

In Jharkhand, only 0.5% of the surveyed women have confirmed to have undergone screening for cervical cancer. This figure of respondents is better than neighbouring Chhattisgarh and West Bengal where only 0.3% and 0.2% women have been screened. In another neighbouring state Bihar, 0.8% women population have undergone screening whereas in Punjab, infamous for cancer cases as many as 2.5% women confirmed to have undergone screening for cervical cancer. Though this figure, which is under 5% in most of the states, appears miniscule, health experts believe that not all women require scientific screening and only a certain faction of the women in reproductive age group, who are either symptomatic or in high-risk category are required to undergo screening (on diagnostic machine) for detection and treatment. Among the districts, Giridih with 1.9% responses is at the top whereas in Jamshedpur and Dumka, not a single woman in the sample survey responded to have undergone screening for cervical cancer ever. In Ranchi, 0.3% women have undergone screening where the sample size was 979 households comprising 1,182 women and 156 men respondents for the entire NFHS-5 survey. Head, women’s wing of Jharkhand chapter of Indian Medical Association, Dr Bharti Kashyap, who has been spearheading the campaign to hold camps and screen women against cervical cancer and anaemia, said that they have recently fixed a target of 6% of the total women population in reproductive age group for screening. “On our proposal Jharkhand government has decided to screen at least 6% of the women population in every district, who are either symptomatic or in high-risk group because the remaining may not develop cervical cancer at all and do not require screening,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cervical-cancer-screening-in-jkhand-better-than-bengal/articleshow/87968103.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

However, the traders refused and entered into a heated argument. They also slapped and abused him he said. “Some local boys also joined them and assaulted me while they telephoned their associates in Kadru and Doranda. I also rang up my friends, Deepak and Arvind Kumar, who came to my rescue,” Tarun said in his complaint. Tarun, in his FIR, claimed he asked the traders - at least four of them - to remove their woollen garments laden cart to a side of the road so that his motorcycle could pass. Infuriated, the traders entered into a heated argument with Kumar. They abused and slapped him. “Some local lads also joined their ranks and assaulted me while they telephoned their associates in Kadru and Doranda. I rang up my friends Deepak and Arvind Kumar who came to my rescue,” Tarun wrote in his complaint. Meanwhile, a crowd gathered outside the Doranda police station on Sunday morning to demand the release of Tarun, Deepak and Arvind but was dispersed later by the policemen.

Though JPSC earlier this week issued cut-off marks and released its rebuttal over hosts of accusations against it by protesting students over the preliminary test results of seven to 10 JPSC exams released on November 2, the controversy surrounding it is not expected to die soon as the BJP has announced to continue its stir in favour of protestors in the coming days. Talking to reporters at the party office on Sunday along with Hatia MLA Naveen Jaiswal, state BJP president-cum-Rajya Sabha MP, Deepak Prakash, punched holes into the JPSC’s response over the controversy calling those “illogical” and “ridiculous”. Giving an example, he said, “While the JPSC released the cut-off marks after a string of protests, under BC-2 category, where cut-off marks were fixed as 252, the merit list has many people qualifying even on scoring 230. One of the main contentions with the results is that many students with serial-wise roll numbers of a few specific exam centres passed, which raises a question mark over the transparency of the exam. The rules say that the OMR sheets of all the applicants must be uploaded on JPSC website, which too didn’t happen. Considering many lapses, we demand a CBI probe. If the government has a problem with the central agency, it must set up an inquiry under a sitting judge of the high court.” Close to 4 lakh students had appeared in the exams which were held after a long gap in September this year. Results of the preliminary tests were declared on November 2 but it too stoked a controversy like all previous exams held by JPSC since the formation of this state.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bjp-finds-gaps-in-jpsc-reply-seeks-cbi-probe-into-exam-row/articleshow/87968131.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Bird-watchers and forest officials have spotted Northern shoveler, red-crested pochard, ruddy shelduck, lesser whistling duck and plaintive cuckoo at Masariya dam in Belagada panchayat under Ghaghra block, which is 27km away from the district headquarters. Gumla divisional forest officer (DFO) Shrikant said, “These rare types of birds have flown over a long distance from Northern and Central Asia as the dam has been an ideal seasonal habitat for migratory birds.” Sanjay Oraon, who is the mukhiya of Belagada panchayat, said, “As the winter season progresses, the numbers will multiply.” The arrival of the winged guests has led to curiosity among kids and others who are thronging the water bodies to spot them. On Saturday, the secretary of the state planning and development department and the panchayat raj department, Rahul Sharma, Gumla SDO Ravi Anand, Ghaghra BDO Vishnu Deo Kachhap, Navodaya School’s principal Vishwanath Khilar, the school’s teachers and students visited the dam. Ishan Sharma, who is a student of Class VII at Delhi Public School, Ranchi said, “I saw plaintive cuckoo for the first time. I even clicked photographs of different species of ducks.” “It’s really wonderful to spot these rare birds in Gumla and the Masariya dam is an ideal destination for the ducks,” bureaucrat Rahul Sharma said. Sharma has asked the DFO to form a task force for protecting the migratory birds after he learnt that locals often capture them to sell in the markets. He has also asked the DFO to plant trees along the pathway of the dam and erect seating areas for the visitors. “This place needs to be developed into a tourist spot,” he said. Some students, however, expressed concern over plastic and other waste products being littered around the dam and said that they could be harmful for the birds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/masariya-dam-abuzz-with-migratory-birds/articleshow/87968462.cms||K A Gupta

Former party spokesperson Alok Dubey said that they have planned to organise 501 camps across the district till March-end. “As per the directions from AICC president Sonia Gandhi, the state unit is committed to enrol 15 lakh members and from today onwards, special camps will be set up in various localities/areas of Ranchi. On Monday, we have planned it in Ratu road,” he added. He further said that people from all walks of life are showing an interest in the drive. Congress member Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said, “Congress being the oldest party in the country, it doesn’t need any introduction. Through these camps, we are propagating the values and virtues of the party, besides inducting new members.” Another party leader named Rajesh Kumar Gupta said that the camp is also helping them connect with masses and highlight ‘the flaws of the Union government’. He added, “While we have been protesting through various means to rake up public-centric issues like inflation, fuel price hike and mismanagement of Covid-19, among others, all these while, we are also creating awareness regarding the Modi government’s lies to the nation through these camps.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cong-plans-501-membership-camps-in-ranchi/articleshow/87968229.cms||---

Jharkhand Milk Federation (JMF) under the state animal husbandry department is all set to enter into an agreement with the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) that has indigenously developed the Artificial Insemination (AI) technology of sexed semen that ensures birth of female calf last year. NDDB had already worked to provide dairy farmers with ‘sexed semen’ in states like Bihar, Assam and some states in South India. Managing director, JMF, Sudhir Singh said that AI technique was earlier used for improvement of breed and milk production, but choice of gender was not available. “Non agricultural farmers are also venturing into milk farming and they do not require humped bull, otherwise used for tilling farmland,” he said. Singh said that sexed semen is specially processed semen of bulls from which ‘Y’ chromosomes in sperm cells, which lead to the birth of a male calf, are either removed through a ‘sorting’ process or killed. Semen which has only ‘X’ chromosomes can ensure that a female calf is born. “This choice would save a lot of money and burden of the farmers as they would have the guarantee of getting female calf which would grow up to a milk producing cow. The AI facility was available in the state earlier and Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BAIF) used to operate centres across all the districts. The BAIF centres, however, provided semen for breed improvement, thus targeting more milk production. For some technical reasons the arrangement with BAIF was discontinued by the state government almost five years ago. India is world’s largest milk producer, with 22% of global production. Jharkhand still lags in milk production. Farmers have repeatedly raised the demand for AI centres so that they can obtain quality semen for their cows. JMF officials said that the demand for female calves by farmers encouraged them to approach the NDDB for a solution. NDDB has been providing guidance to JMF and assistance to milk producing farmers in the state over the past 10 years. The agreement with NDDB is about to expire and the state cabinet has already approved proposal to renew the MoU with NDDB for another five years. State secretary for agriculture and animal husbandry Aboobacker Sidiqque said that the state is going to sign a fresh MOU with NDDB before March 31, 2024. “NDDB officials would give a presentation about the new AI technology involving sexed semen in next 10 days and a chain of AI centres is proposed to be opened for the farmers,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/farmers-to-soon-get-sexed-semen-to-increase-female-calf-population/articleshow/87970855.cms||---

It has also failed to fulfil the promises it had made before coming to power, the MP said. He added that the vaccination against Covid-19 is also one of the lowest in the country. Addressing the BJP workers and functionaries at Karandih, the two-time MP said that health is one of the most neglected sectors. Promises made by the Soren-led mahagathbandhan before coming to power are yet to be implemented, he added. Elaborating on this, he said that before coming to power, the JMM-led alliance had promised to give jobs to unemployed youths but in the last 23 months not a single youth has got a job. The farmers are waiting for their loans to be waived off, the MP said. He added that the development of basic infrastructure like electricity, drinking water and roads are being neglected by the state government. Mahato said the state government is not holding panchayat polls in the state. Demanding rural polls, he said that the BJP would hold demonstrations at various places in coming days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jmm-govt-failed-to-fulfil-promises-jsr-mp/articleshow/87968228.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||India||‘Cooperation model’ most suited to India’s growth, says Amit Shah||GANDHINAGAR: Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah said here on Sunday that the ‘cooperation model’ is the most suited economic development model for fuelling India's growth. He was speaking at the inauguration of four projects worth Rs 415 crore at AmulFed Dairy. Two of the four projects — milk powder factory and butter plant capacity expansions — are all set to take AmulFed to new heights. The capacity of the milk powder factory has now gone up from 35 lakh litres to 50 lakh litres per day, with the new project that took an investment of Rs 257 crore. The expansion makes AmulFed Asia’s largest fully automated dairy. On the other hand, the new butter plant triples AmulFed’s butter manufacturing capacity from 40 tonnes to 120 tonnes per day. The plant has been built with an investment of Rs 85 crore. Shah said it is a subject matter of detailed study as to which economic model is the best for India. “But our Prime Minister realised when he was Gujarat CM that if there is one model which can benefit all people, it is the cooperation-based model. That is why the PM has started the cooperation ministry,” Shah said. “It is not easy to take benefits of development to all sections of society in a country having a population of 130 crore. There are a number of economic development models that have been propagated. Some are suitable for countries with populations of 2-10 crore,” the Union minister said. Shah said the cooperation model of economic development is not new to Gujarat. “What started off as a movement against exploitation has today become a movement of 36 lakh members of Amul, which is Gujarat’s pride,” the minister said. Commenting on the formation of the Union cooperation ministry, Shah said: “Many people were sceptical about this move. They asked what the point in starting this ministry was. For me though, it is a matter of pride that I am the country’s first cooperation minister. This department has the potential to accelerate development and make people economically strong.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cooperation-model-most-suited-to-indias-growth-says-amit-shah/articleshow/87970103.cms||---
---||Business||Data breach: ‘Make independent and non-executive directors liable||NEW DELHI: Independent directors and non-executive directors on board a top social media, internet or electronics hardware company should also face legal and criminal proceedings for willful offences around data violations and in cases of complicity or negligence, the parliamentary panel on personal data protection (PDP) has said. The committee, that went threadbare into the various provisions of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, advocated the inclusion of the non-executive directors in cases of offences committed by companies. “… the committee desires that a proviso… may be inserted to cover these two categories of directors,” it said, while making the key recommendation. However, the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) — headed by senior BJP leader and former minister P P Chaudhary — said they should be held liable “only if it is shown that the acts of omission or commission by the company had occurred with his/her knowledge or with his/her consent attributable to him/her or where he/she had not acted diligently.” The original PDP Bill had said that apart from action against the company for the violations, those facing action for complicity or negligence would be the executive directors, manager, secretary or other officers of the company. The JPC report, while widening the scope of the officials who will face action, however, requested leniency when a person was successful in proving his or her innocence. “… the person shall be free from ‘proceedings’ and ‘punishment’ once he/she proves innocence… (and) the offence was committed without his/her knowledge or that he/she had exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence.” The recommendations of the panel — which also has members such as Jairam Ramesh, Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha, and Gaurav Gogoi (from Congress), Derek O'Brien and Mahua Moitra (from Trinamool Congress), and Amar Patnaik (from Biju Janata Dal) — have also gone into the issue of companies mandatorily reporting any data breaches to the proposed Data Protection Authority (DPA) within a period of 72 hours. The original bill had not made any mention of a specific timeline under which companies had to report data breaches to the authorities, even as evolved laws such as Europe’s GDPR mandates 72 hours for such notifications. Saying that the present provisions are open-ended and do not mention any specific timeline, the Committee said “there should be a realistic and finite time frame” to report a data breach to the Authority. “The Committee, therefore, recommends… a time period of 72 hours for reporting of data breach.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/data-breach-make-independent-and-non-executive-directors-liable/articleshow/87970128.cms||Pankaj Doval

The new variant that was first detected in South Africa has a large number of mutations and some of them are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests the new variant increases the risk of reinfection as compared to other variants of concern. The variant is said to be highly transmissible, having a growth advantage over other variants. To increase the surveillance, the health department will send 300 Covid positive samples to the genome sequencing lab at the Government Medical College, Patiala, every 15 days. Earlier, 150 samples were sent for examination with a turnaround time of five to six days. No sample has so far tested positive for the new variant and Delta continues to be the most dominating in the state. Delta lineage of the virus has been detected in 211 samples at the Patiala laboratory while 1,100 samples analysed by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) have been found positive for the same variant of concern. The health department has issued instructions to all the districts to keep strict surveillance and to enforce stringent public health measures, including testing and contact tracing, to prevent the spread of the virus. The state government has also directed the airport authorities in Mohali and Amritsar to screen all passengers coming from South Africa and to not let them leave the premises till their report comes negative. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar shared that necessary instructions have been issued to districts and airport authorities to ramp up surveillance. “So far, no sample has tested positive for the new variant. For strict surveillance, the department has increased genome sequencing of Covid positive samples,” he said. With the new variant causing panic, health experts have advised individuals to continue following the preventive measures such as maintaining social distancing, wearing proper face masks, hand hygiene, proper ventilation of indoor spaces, avoiding crowded spaces and getting vaccinated. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research, stated that people need to be careful.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/for-surveillance-of-omicron-punjab-doubles-in-house-sequencing-efforts/articleshow/87969190.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Ludhiana||From tractor to Twitter: How Punjabi netizens turned the table on trolls||JALANDHAR: It was on January 8 that a hashtag in Gurmukhi was among the top trends on Twitter for the first time ever, “jaan_mrange_jaan_jittange” (shall die or win). The declaration was in relation to the farmers protest on the borders of Delhi and how protesters would only turn back if there was a repeal of the farm laws, else they would die at the protest sites. Several non-Punjabi netizens also used the hashtag while tweeting in different languages. This was not just an assertion on behalf of farmers, but of Punjabi netizens on Twitter. The platform had not been much popular among Punjabis before the farm movement. But, given how electoral politics was being fought on Twitter, it was no surprise that the virtual war was fought with just as much intensity on Twitter as on the ground.  When farmers from Punjab left for Delhi, Haryanvi farmers provided them the first protective cover, physically and in building a narrative. Then, the larger Sikh community put its weight behind the protesters, and then farmers from other communities and states also extended support. In the virtual world also, a similar pattern was seen. By the time the protest was going ahead in full steam, people from diverse identities had also started contributing. In last week of November, Punjabi singers and actors Diljit Dosanjh, Amarinder Gill and Gippy Grewal had started speaking in support of farmers. Rana Ranbir was among the first artists to push the campaign. Former MP Dharamvira Gandhi and other social media influencers issued separate appeals through Facebook to Punjabi netizens to join Twitter to run hashtags in support of farmers.  A special handle, @Tractor2twitr, was started on November 29 and a campaign under the same name launched. “As BJP and right-wing ecosystem has a strong presence on social media, especially on Twitter, they were running a campaign against farmers to vilify their agitation. We realised that it was imperative to use all social media platforms, especially Twitter. We also formed a WhatsApp group to run this campaign, but soon it was in auto-pilot mode and Punjabi netizens joined twitter in droves and started countering propaganda against farmers. Our initial phase was to counter false narratives. After a few weeks, we started setting our own narratives,” said Bhavjit Singh, who created the Twitter handle and also conceived the campaign with friends. In the first week of the farmers parking themselves at borders of Delhi, their supporters made Tractor2Twitter and three other hashtags trend for three consecutive days on Twitter, while also pushing up other hashtags in the trending list in support of farm protests. Some influential twitter handles and netizens from other places also chipped in, but Punjabi netizens were again at the core of this activity. Prominent Punjab singer Ranjit Bawa tweeted: “Eve lagda jinve sara Punjab aa gya twitter te (It seems as if all of Punjab has joined Twitter).” On December 7, Diljit Dosanjh and actor Kangana Ranaut had a spat on Twitter. In fact, the war of words between the two pushed more people from Punjab to join Twitter. Soon after, farm groups also launched their official Twitter handle, Facebook page and Instagram account, all under the name of Kisan Ekta Morcha, to ensure they could disseminate information and fight misinformation campaigns.  Not just reacting but setting the narrative Aman Warich, who has also been very active and is also part of @Tractor2twitr team, said initially, pro-government or pro-BJP Twitter handles would run competitive hashtags, but a few weeks later when pro-farmer hashtags would remain ahead, they stopped competing. “Maximum times pro-farm hashtags were on number one or two,” she said. Tractor2twitr founder Bhavjit Singh said a big section of Punjabi netizens push pro-farmer hashtags, while people from other states and communities also pooled in. “We design and make graphics and other content, collate facts and research and then presenting these in simplified form. We ran campaigns in 10 different languages,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/from-tractor-to-twitter-how-punjabi-netizens-turned-the-table-on-trolls/articleshow/87969308.cms||IP Singh
---||Goa||‘Ring Wandering’ takes home Iffi Golden Peacock||PANAJI: Japanese film ‘Ring Wandering’, by director Masakazu Kaneko, was declared winner of the Golden Peacock for the best film at the closing ceremony of the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) on Sunday evening. The film’s director and producer shared a cash prize of Rs 40 lakh between them. ‘Ring Wandering’ reflects war-time memories that continue to echo in present-day Japan. The Silver Peacock for best director was won by Czech director Václav Kadrnka for his film ‘Saving One Who Was Dead’. It is inspired by the filmmaker’s own father’s near-dead experience. Kadrnka took home at cash prize of Rs 15 lakh at Iffi 2021. Union information and broadcasting (I&B) minister Anurag Singh Thakur said 10,000 delegates, including students of filmmaking and filmmakers, watched films with a total screening time of 450 hours during the Iffi in Goa from November 20 to 28. “We will soon have a film city in Goa with the assistance from Union I&B minister Anurag Singh Thakur and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant, who also added that the closing ceremony will be incomplete without naming former defence minister Manohar Parrikar who brought Iffi to Goa. Bollywood actor Madhuri Dixit, who was the guest of honour, at Iffi 2021 closing ceremony, said that it is a wonderful time for women to be in films. “Earlier when I was working in films, women were only seen in the role of hairdressers and make-up artists in the film industry. Now I see that women are there in every sphere of filmmaking. That is the change I see today,” Dixit said. For the first time, the Brics Film Festival was held parallel to Iffi. An independent jury led by Indian filmmaker Rahul Rawail judged the films. Indian lyricist and writer Prasoon Joshi, who was honoured with the Indian Film Personality of the Year award said that he wants to see more youth from small towns in India rising up in the film industry and telling their authentic stories. “I am from a small town in Uttarakhand. I would like to dedicate the award to the mountains from where I come. There is a lot of diversity in the country, but the diverse stories will come out only when they are told by those who come from small towns like me, when they get an opportunity to tell stories from the experiences they have lived,” Joshi said. Veteran Hindi film actor Randhir Kapoor and actor Manoj Bajpayee were also felicitated. “The film festival is a great vehicle to instigate new films, new filmmakers. A country of millions can be a great force in the coming years in filmmaking. And the festival will be the force behind this movement,” Bajpayee said. Uttar Pradesh was honoured for its immense contribution to the Indian film industry. Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, Uttar Pradesh, said that a new film city is coming up on 1,000 acre land in the state, which is set to boost filmmaking in UP. “Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the biggest airport of Asia, which is located very close to the land where the film city is coming up. We will offer all pre and post production facilities under one roof. I request all big production houses to come and film there. We are investing Rs 10,000 crore. It will be given on rent so any big production house can come and take advantage,” Sehgal said. The 52nd Iffi closed with a screening of the Iranian film ‘The Hero’ by Asghar Farhadi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/ring-wandering-takes-home-iffi-golden-peacock/articleshow/87968664.cms||---
---||Goa||A bronze to remember for Goa’s mini basketball team in Bhilwara||GOA: Nobody really gave thema chance. As a 49-member contingent travelled to Bhilwara in Rajasthan for the Mini and Junior National Basketball Championships in 1978, the priorities were clear. The State Council of Sports – later renamed Sports Authority of Goa – sponsored the junior teams for the championships, while the burden of funding the mini teams fell on the shoulders of the parents, none of whom wanted to disappoint their 10 and 11-year olds. Just two years earlier, Goa had finished third at the mini nationals in Kothagudem, Andhra Pradesh. But that did not have any bearing on how the state government allocated funds. The mini teams were left to fend for themselves, and if parents could not afford, the Goa Basketball Association (GBA) had to make up for the deficit. “We were forced to travel in unreserved trains with children sleeping on the floor,” says Girish Lotlikar, a former basketball player who was designated as manager for the tour. “These were young boys and girls, so we had to be extra careful. The locals were hostile to us, the conditions horrible. We spent most of our time protecting the children.” Those who had been to previous nationals knew the food would never be to Goans’ liking, so they took some dry fish and a cook along with them. When they reached the venue, there were not enough raw materials to give the children what they deserved. “I remember clearly that (manager) Malati (Laad) was furious with what was served to the children. We had no choice but to offer bananas, biscuits and bread,” says Lotlikar. The children did not complain. Most of them were travelling outside the state for the first time and were eager to test themselves against the best players in India. When the national championships commenced, the mini boys were completely out of depth. They lost their opening game 10-71 and were schooled in the next game by Punjab, who won 94-11. The girls, though, were in fine form and started their campaign with a 20-5 win against Kerala, considered a strong side at the national level. “We were all excited but never expected to go too far,” says captain Vandana Naik. “In the initial stages, we were simply enjoying, happy to just play. A couple of victories then got us going and we knew we could achieve something, even though we had little coaching and absolutely no facilities.” Basketball was just beginning to look up in the seventies with girls from Our Lady of the Rosary High School in the forefront. CF Vaz, a founder member of the association who later became secretary and president, taught basketball to whoever was interested, travelling on his scooter, encouraging principals and teachers and convincing parents to allow their children to play the sport. The game was largely played on mud courts. “We played basketball all the time,” says Sheela Fernandes, who was part of that mini national team, along with her twin, Neela. “When we got to the nationals, we saw that Punjab and Maharashtra were in a league of their own. They were good teams and we were no match. But against others, we were competitive.” The girls managed to combine effectively and put up a good show because a majority of them –seven out of 10 – were from Our Lady of the Rosary High School. Two others, including captain Vandana, studied at People’s High School, while Mary Immaculate Girls HS contributed one player. After a group-stage loss against defending champions Maharashtra and later Punjab, Goa were drawn to battle Bihar for the third spot. “The decider was a tense game,” remembers Lotlikar, who coached the team prior to the nationals, while Vaz too travelled with the team and guided them. Goa started the decisive game on the wrong foot. They trailed 1-10 in the opening stages but recovered to level the scores at 10-10. Bihar then scored to take a two-point lead with just two minutes left on the clock. Just when it seemed like it was all over, Goa turned it around with two baskets, or four points, with only a few seconds left on the clock. Not surprisingly, the girls couldn’t stop celebrating, even when they were on the train – in an unreserved compartment – back home. After all, this one came against the odds, and when nobody really gave them a chance.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/a-bronze-to-remember-for-goas-mini-basketball-team-in-bhilwara/articleshow/87968668.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Nagpur||After south, ‘dieback’ virus hits neem trees in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: After playing havoc in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the ‘dieback’ disease affecting neem trees has hit Vidarbha region for the first time. It is a fungus (Phomopsis Azadirachtae) reported on neem causing dieback in 1998 in the southern states. The fungus infects trees of all ages and sizes and the results are devastating. Though the disease has not been noticed by common man and farmers or must have been treated as a usual phenomenon, progressive farmer Shrikant Deshpande said during his visit to Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, and other towns in the region during the last 15 days, it has been observed that many neem trees are drying and leaves have turned brown, including the ones in his farm at Dhamangaon. “Several neem trees planted by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in the city showed similar symptoms but before making any concrete statement facts need to be scientifically studied whether it is a virus or fungus, and why it has chosen only neem trees. We are in touch with experts from PDKV-run College of Agriculture, Nagpur, and plan to send samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune,” said Amol Chorpagar, garden superintendent, NMC. Neem (Azadirachta Indica) is a native tree to India. Neem finds very wide application and both wood as well as non-wood products are utilized in many ways. Neem products have antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and other versatile biological activities. However, neem is not free from microbial diseases though having biological activity against various microorganisms. Many bacteria and fungi are known to infect neem. The symptoms of the disease are twig blight, inflorescence blight and fruit rot. The disease results in almost 100% loss of fruit production. According to a research paper by senior scientist Girish K from Karnataka, the ‘dieback disease’ is more pronounced during August-December, though it can be observed throughout the year. The appearance of symptoms starts with the onset of the rainy season and becomes progressively severe in the latter part of the rainy season and early winter season. “The terminal branches are mainly affected. The disease results in the progressive death of the tree, year after year. Twig blight is the major symptom and the disease also results in inflorescence blight and fruit rot resulting in almost 100% yield loss. The disease spreads through conidia that are disseminated by rain droplets and insects,” says Girish. PDKV’s Dr Yayati Tayde, associate dean, College of Forestry, Akola, says, “This is for the first time we have been hearing about the ‘dieback disease’. A scientific study needs to be done by collecting samples as there can be other multiple reasons like lack of moisture and water, damage to roots, girdling, etc.” Dr Sharad Pawar, an emeritus scientist from BARC, and researcher Shrutika Bagul, says, “Neem is one of the most researched trees. The ‘dieback disease’ is caused by the fungus Phomopis. A team effort is needed to control it. Losing these well-grown trees would mean a huge environmental loss to humans. Herbal solutions can be tried to treat the disease.” Going through the research papers it has been found that the disease may be due to lack of minerals, water and groundwater pollution while another feels the problem can be solved by spraying Bavistin, a fungicide to be used with insecticides and fungicides. Environmentalist Prachi Mahurkar says, “I too observed neem trees affected by the disease in my farm in Katol. If it is affecting antifungal and antibacterial trees like neem, one can imagine the strong undercurrents of climate change. At a time when it should be wintry, we are facing the heat. The rains too were prolonged this year. Global warming affecting these trees also needs to be studied.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/after-south-dieback-virus-hits-neem-trees-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87968625.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||From home to school, transition will be challenging for kids of primary section||Nagpur: As schools reopen from Std I onwards from December 1 across Maharashtra, academics see a far bigger challenge than simply bringing the younger kids up to speed with studies. Both Std I and II students will be entering a big school campus for the first time ever. This new experience combined with separation anxiety, wearing of masks non-stop and not having the overly protective atmosphere of nursery and kindergarten schools may be a problem. Premlata Tiwari, principal of Bhola High School, said, “The initial few days are always a bit tense for kids because they have to be away from their parents for a long time. Those kids, whose mothers are housewives, are used to seeing her 24/7. Then suddenly when separated for a couple of hours, some kids do feel separation anxiety and cry. But then in every school teachers are trained to handle such situations and the kid is slowly eased into the new normal.” Lucky Sadrani, principal of Podar International School (Katol Road), said. “Writing practice is going to be a big challenge for kids everywhere. Since they have not even attended KG in physical mode, it is not easy to master the motor skills and learn how to grasp a pencil properly. To make up for these foundation years is the immediate task.” Since classes are now online for primary school kids, they are not in the habit of wearing masks. Once back on campus, that will be mandatory. Sadrani says children are better learners. “I have Std V students on my campus and they are a very disciplined lot. They wear masks properly, better than high school students. I strongly feel that in every school these younger kids will be easy to handle in terms of wearing masks,” said Sadrani. Interacting with strangers on first day of school is intimidating for many children, but academics feel that here, online classes may have solved the problem. Resmi Umesh, principal of Saraswati Vidyalaya (primary), said, “Students are seeing their teachers and classmates daily through online classes. So the familiarity between everyone is already there. This is a big change from earlier where these little kids would have walked into campus where teachers and maybe even classmates are strangers.” Ashok Gavhankar, principal of Raosaheb Thawre School, said getting students to focus might be another challenge. “At home, students can go to the washroom anytime, grab something to eat when hungry even if online classes are on.

Prior to his visit to Geneva for the WTO meet, now postponed due to the latest Covid variant, the minister said democracies are looking at new investment and trade options due to worries over ‘non-transparent economies’, without naming China. Excerpts:One of the issues on the WTO agenda is reforms and doing away with special and differential treatment (S&DT) for developing and poor countries. How do you see it?Any attempt to take away S&DT will fail. It’s not going to happen. The developed world cannot expect developing and less developed countries to come on a par with countries that have multiple times the per capita incomes of the less developed nations. These are areas on which we need a wide consensus building exercise to ensure that S&DT continues, to ensure that the consensus-based approach to negotiations continues, while there may be other areas of reforms on which we are open to discussions. The WTO will have to relook at some of the non-transparent practices that some countries indulge in and will have to address them. It will have to see that countries which are indulging in such practices are taken to task. Since Covid outbreak, there has been a lot of discussion on the need to create reliable and sustainable supply lines. How is that playing out?We have had very successful discussions with several countries, including the USTR (Katherine Tai) recently. EU is concerned about how to ensure supply chains remain open in the event of further emergencies. It’s been a wake-up call and more and more democratic and developed countries are recognising that some economies are dangerous to work with as they can suddenly let you down. Resilient supply chains are probably one of the most critical areas of engagement. One non-transparent economy has been the villain and its entry into the WTO is often considered to be the biggest strategic blunder. How do you deal with that?While we cannot rewrite history, we will have to look at alternate and smarter ways of working among like-minded democratic countries and transparent economies, nations that believe in rule of law and fair play. They will have to build coalitions like the Resilient Supply Initiative between Japan, Australia and India. Look at the two QUADs that India is a part of (with the US, Australia, Japan and with the US, UAE and Israel). But such intent is not backed by initiatives. A recent poll of US companies showed 80% will look to invest more in China...I would not like to talk about what companies in other countries are doing but I will only say that nations across the world are very disturbed and anguished over the way the situation is emerging geo-politically and how it could have an adverse impact in their own countries. Such unfair trade practices ultimately take away jobs in countries that believe in a rule-based system. Just as India is taking steps to protect itself, many other countries are looking to protect themselves from indiscriminate investment or trade linkages with non-transparent economies. The India-US trade policy forum (TPF) is back after four years and by the looks of it you have made some progress. What are the key markers that you have set?The joint statement is so comprehensive, covering a vast range of subjects, that you will not find any other document, either with the US in the past or any other country. The message was clear that the US and India are natural partners and we can do a lot together. They are looking at India to be a much bigger trading partner and a much-bigger geo-strategic role for India. A lot of the historical baggage of several decades has been buried. There are some 40 issues from both sides…Incidentally, we have also agreed that we should move away from this old school thinking about always trying to balance by moving on two issues each. We should look at each other as allies and see what’s the maximum each one can do. Both have differing sensitivities and we respect that. At the same time, we have differing economic prosperity levels. We are looking at more interactions so that misunderstandings don’t crop up.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/non-transparent-economies-dangerous-to-work-with/articleshow/87970182.cms||Sidhartha

Sources said the RPF has framed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to select personnel for the special intelligence branch (SIB) having key functions of collecting secret information on three basic focus areas — disruptive activities, Naxalism and integrity of own force — which are crucial for the security of the Railways. According to an official, RPF personnel keen to shift to the intelligence unit would have to now go through a rigorous process instead of being randomly posted by the competent officers. “The intelligence unit used to be a place where non-performing or controversial personnel would be dumped. Anyone eager to continue at a place for a substantial period too would join the intelligence unit. This approach of posting to the intelligence unit is no more being followed,” said the senior official. As per the new procedure, any staff eager to join the intelligence unit would have to first appear in a written examination followed by an interview before the screening committee. The committee would have an officer nominated by the IB as one of its member, apart from a member from the Railway Board. “After being selected, the personnel would have to spend around five years in the unit before seeking out. A special permission would be needed in case someone is keen to leave the unit before the completion of the term,” said the officer. Those selected would be called ‘intelligence officer’ (IO) and ‘assistant intelligence officer’ other than their regular nomenclature. It’s also learnt that the intelligence unit would be monitored by senior supervisory level officials. “The unit would be made more accountable and responsible for any development which may adversely affect the security of the Railways,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/railways-to-have-own-intel-unit-akin-to-ib/articleshow/87968660.cms||Soumitra Bose

The high court is hearing a public interest petition seeking enforcement of provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and Goa Tourism Shack Policy to stop and abate noise and sound pollution in Anjuna-Vagator. Petitioner Sagardeep Sirsaikar is also seeking action to prosecute and punish offenders, revocation of permissions and sealing premises of those found violating noise pollution rules. Sirsaikar submitted to the HC that he made numerous complaints to the authorities and submitted to the HC that despite the deputy collector of Bardez at Mapusa issuing a showcause notice to Chronicle/Glory Shack, it continues to play music at high decibels. He filed a representation with the North Goa collector informing him about the ill effects of noise pollution on residents of the locality and inaction of police officials and highlighted about parties held on November 12, 13, 18, 19 and 20 at Vagator Ozran beach. The deputy collector granted permission for the parties between 8pm and 10 pm, but the noise continued. He submitted a video clip of a rave party at Ozran beach to the HC and sent a legal notice to the deputy collector and Anjuna police station PI. The high court took Sirsaikar’s affidavit on record and directed that notice be issued to Fernandes, proprietor of Glory Shack. Sirsaikar was represented by Adv Nigel Costa Frias with Adv Gaurish Malik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/hc-asks-shack-owner-to-abide-by-noise-rules/articleshow/87968661.cms||---

All makeshift vaccination centres set up in schools, panchayats, etc will be closed by November end. “From December 1, vaccination will continue every day at around 35 government health centres as schools are asking for their premises back,” director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. Vaccinations will be held at the two district and two sub-district hospitals, six community health centres and 24 primary health centres. “Till the end of the month vaccination teams are focusing on vaccinations as part of the Har Ghar Dastak campaign. Each day they’re going out into villages and vaccinating those who haven’t made it to health centres and taking a review of the situation,” she said. In the bargain the teams have been finding unvaccinated able-bodied persons at home and vaccinating them too. On Sunday 4,314 persons took their second dose and 1,008 their first dose of the vaccine. As on date 10.2 lakh persons are doubly vaccinated and 2.37 lakh partially vaccinated. There is vaccine stock balance of 2.13 lakh doses available with Goa.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/from-dec-1-vax-drives-only-at-health-centres/articleshow/87968705.cms||---

After Centre’s announcement of repealing the three controversial farm laws, farmers are pressing for a law to make purchases at MSP mandatory. Traders and a section of activists say it will upset the entire system. They believe it would “not be feasible” for private traders to buy at MSP if the open market rates are lower. In such a case, the traders may withdraw from markets or resort to evasion. Some farm activists otherwise opposing the three farm laws say an MSP law may not be a very good idea. Shetkari Sangathana president and member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on farm laws Anil Ghanwat said a move to enact such a law in Maharashtra sometime in 2018 had to be withdrawn. “There was stiff opposition. We had coined a phrase ‘vyapari ko jail toh kisan ko phansi’ (if jail for the trader, then death sentence for the farmer). This was to stress that if traders stop buying due to the MSP law, it would ultimately leave farmers in dire straits,” he said. Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), the farmers’ wing of the Sangh Parivar, has also been pushing for the MSP law. “Simply making purchases at the MSP mandatory would not be enough. The government needs to create a conducive environment for it,” said BKS secretary Dinesh Kulkarni. Kulkarni added, “For example, if the imports become cheaper then a proportionate customs duty can be levied to bring the rates to a level-playing field with the domestic market. The exporters can be compensated by a subsidy.” Even ensuring government’s mere presence in the open market can help, he said. “Moong rates had gone down in Madhya Pradesh recently. Following demands, the state government opened MSP procurement centres and soon even the open market rates improved,” the BKS secretary added. Kulkarni said distress-selling of crops below MSP remains an issue and needs to be resolved. Atul Senad, the chairman of agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) at Kalamana, said an MSP law would eventually lead to traders shying away from purchases. “Due to climate change, these days the quality of crops has a lot of variation. There are a wide range of grades and the MSP cannot be the benchmark for all. However, if the traders refuse to buy the lower quality, farmers would be at loss,” Senad added. Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission chairman Kishore Tiwari said the government will have to come forward and bridge the gap between market rates and MSP. Veteran activist Vijay Jawandhia said government intervention is the time-tested method. “Prices of almost all the crops are linked with the international markets. If global rates are low, private traders may not be able to buy at MSP,” he added. Covid scare hits cotton rates Cotton rates that had touched Rs8,500 a quintal on an average are now down by Rs300 due to fears of the newly- emerged Omicron variant of coronavirus, say traders. There are apprehensions that emergence of the new virus may hit demand in the garment sector. Farm activist Vijay Jawandhia, however, said that despite the sentiment, rates in the international market have remained the same at $1.27 a pound. At this rate, the domestic prices should translate to around Rs8,800 a quintal but are on the lower side.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/msp-law-may-not-be-a-good-idea-say-traders-and-activists/articleshow/87968712.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Many promises, but no progress on convention centre||Panaji: The ambitious dream of former chief minister Manohar Parrikar to build an Iffi convention centre seems to have been laid to rest with him. Until his tenure — as the chief minister and as defence minister of the country — each Iffi saw an announcement being made for the building of an ‘Iffi village’ by the film festival’s 50th edition. With the 52nd edition this year already culminating, and no signs of this concept manifesting into reality thus far, the entertainment society of Goa (ESG) is not very optimistic of seeing it materialise by the next year either. “We have been planning it for the past three years but it is still at a primitive stage. As of today, it is not practical in another two to three years because such concepts take time. Though we have a plan, we are moving slowly due to the pandemic and the financial structure of the government,” said ESG vice-chairman Subhash Faldesai. With the state assembly elections scheduled to be held in about three months’ time, the ESG appears to have snoozed its plans to build the convention centre for the time being and has pinned hopes on the next ruling government. “The decision has been taken to have the festival at a large auditorium or convention centre. It would be a world class infrastructural venue when it happens. The next government may take the plan ahead and we look forward to the big convention centre which will accommodate all the delegates and guests at one place with an indoor stadium and film city,” Faldesai said. Chaitanya Prasad, the additional director general for the directorate of film festivals, refused to comment on the subject. After Parrikar had said that a convention centre with a 5,000 seating capacity would be ready for the 50th anniversary of Iffi, the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) held a consultation with 25 reputed business houses to construct the convention centre on a 52-acre plot. They even appointed Knight Frank (India) Pvt Ltd as the transaction advisor for the multi-crore project.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/many-promises-but-no-progress-on-convention-centre/articleshow/87968741.cms||---

President of the association Dr Pratik Sawant told TOI that GARD is standing congruent with the decision taken by the federation of resident doctors association of India. GARD, in a letter to the medical superintendent of GMC, has stated that emergency services in the interest of patients will continue. Sawant said Goa has around 300 new resident doctors who are yet to join as first year residents as their NEET PG counselling has been delayed. The NEET exams held regularly in January were postponed to May and counselling has been delayed. “Since these residents haven’t joined yet, only 2/3rd of the work force has been working and taking the toll of all routine services in addition to Covid duties. This has been happening in Goa and the rest of the country for the past six months,” Sawant said. “The Union government has sought more time in the Supreme Court but the counselling cannot be delayed further. If we have another wave of the pandemic, we will be left with only 2/3rd of the doctors who are the same ones who have been overburdened over the past few months,” he added. The counselling has been put on hold till January 2022 after the Centre last week asked the apex court for four weeks’ time to revisit the income criteria for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/states-resident-docs-threaten-protest-over-neet-counselling/articleshow/87968743.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Mandrem voters’ ire with BJP will see Cong get seat back’||Margao: State Congress president Girish Chodankar on Sunday said that the party would strive to increase its average voter base in each constituency from the current 28% to at least 35% in the 2022 assembly polls. Speaking on the occasion of the induction of independent Morjim zilla panchayat member, Satish Shetgaonkar along with a group of his supporters into the party, Chodankar exuded confidence of wresting the Mandrem seat back from BJP in the forthcoming assembly polls. Mandrem is represented by Dayanand Sopte who had won the 2017 assembly polls on the Congress ticket and later defected to BJP along with Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar in October 2018. Chodankar launched a diatribe against Sopte accusing him of failing to bring any development in Mandrem. “Mandrem MLA fooled the people by promising them development. He is now working only for self-development. People of Mandrem are disgusted with BJP. Their anger will find an expression in the elections and Congress will get the seat back,” he said. He said that Congress would win 24 to 26 seats in the forthcoming polls.Accusing Sopte of corruption, Chodankar said, “Unless one pays Sopte tax, no work gets done.” He said that the motive of the new parties that have entered Goa’s politics was to launch an attack on Congress and thereby give an advantage to BJP. Welcoming Shetgaonkar into the party, Chodankar said that his homecoming has further strengthened the party in Mandrem. Shetgaonkar, who earlier held several positions in BJP, parted ways with the party in the last ZP elections after being denied a ticket and contested as an independent candidate. Chodankar said that the party’s candidate selection exercise was under way and that, as assured by the Congress election observer P Chidambaram, the candidates would be decided by the people and the respective block committees. While the exercise has been concluded in South Goa blocks, it began in North Goa from Sunday, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mandrem-voters-ire-with-bjp-will-see-cong-get-seat-back/articleshow/87968763.cms||---
---||Goa||Old Goa activists say CM must give written assurance||Panaji: The Save Old Goa Action Committee has demanded that chief minister Pramod Sawant cancel the permits granted to the illegal construction in Old Goa instead of giving a verbal statement and assurance. They intend to continue with their agitation until the paperwork to demolish the illegal structure is processed. “We cannot count on the word of the CM when he had previously feigned unawareness about the issue. When the licenses have been issued by the ruling government how can they deny knowledge about it first and then claim that the permits will be revoked? We want to see it written instead of being given promises,” said the committee’s treasurer Hugo Gonsalves. Citizens have expressed their disapproval over the illegal construction by holding protests and large gatherings in solidarity with the activists leading the protest. “People are furious right now because it is a site of heritage which has sentimental value, not just for Christians but even others. This is a site of international prominence. We want the illegal structure in the protected area to be removed and our sentiments to be respected,” a resident of Old Goa said. The protestors had started an indefinite hunger strike from November 23 onwards. They have decided to continue with it until the government revokes the licenses and demolishes the illegal structure. “It’s been almost a week since we started this strike and will continue with it until our demands are fulfilled,” Gonsalves said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/old-goa-activists-say-cm-must-give-written-assurance/articleshow/87968794.cms||---

It may be recalled that sessions for Classes IX and X started following an official circular from the department. Classes VII and VIII also resumed in the physical mode a week and a half after the department gave its permission. However, while doing so, some private institutes had also started offline classes from the pre-primary level to Class VI.

---||Goa||CM, other key posts will be our tie-up condition: MGP||Margao: A day after the members of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party’s (MGP) central committee returned to the state after holding a meeting with its 12 prospective candidates at Belagavi, the party’s Madkai MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said that all those who attended the meeting were unanimous in their view that MGP should forge an alliance with any party that offers it “rightful leadership positions”, including the chief minister’s post. “MGP’s executive committee will decide about the conditions of alliance with the party that wishes to partner with us. However, it’s been decided that we will go with the party that offers us rightful leadership in the alliance,” Dhavalikar told TOI. Asked if he meant chief ministerial position by the term rightful leadership, Dhavalikar said, “Not only chief ministerial post, but there are so many other things. Every MLA of our party should get whatever is due to him in the alliance.” He, however, declined to reveal if MGP was in talks with any party at the moment. However, Dhavalikar said that the party was firm on its decision to go it alone in the polls if the alliance plan doesn’t work out. “We will contest in all 12 seats that we have decided on. Besides, we are working on contesting in six more constituencies,” he said. Stating that the party was confident of winning 10 of the 12 seats, Dhavalikar said they would put in more efforts in the two seats to make them winnable as well. Explaining the motive behind Belagavi as the location for the meeting, Dhavalikar said, “Our candidates were being approached by various parties with lucrative offers over the past few weeks. But none of them fell for the offers. However, in order to ensure that all of them remain united, certain things needed to be explained to them and we chose to have the meeting at Belagavi where all of us could share time together. I am now confident that all the 12 will not desert the party.” MGP spokesperson and the party’s Ponda coordinator, Ketan Bhatikar, who also attended the Belagavi meet, said that all the candidates were against having alliance with BJP as it had “insulted” their party’s leadership. “All the candidates told our leadership, let’s go all alone, or have an alliance with any party that is ready to support our leader as the chief ministerial candidate. I don’t think there is any person who can handle the state better than Sudin Dhavalikar,” Bhatikar told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/cm-other-key-posts-will-be-our-tie-up-condition-mgp/articleshow/87968783.cms||---
---||Goa||Anjuna’s popular weekly flea market likely to resume next month||Panaji: After a one-and a-half-year gap, Anjuna’s famous Wednesday flea market, which is a huge tourist attraction, is expected to become functional next month. There is, however, uncertainty about the opening of Ingo’s Saturday night market at Arpora as the authorities are yet to decide on an application made by its organisers a few months ago. Anjuna-Caisua sarpanch Savio Almeida told TOI that since all activities have resumed, including weekly markets, they don’t see any reason why the flea market should not start. A final decision in the matter will be taken by the panchayat shortly. “When operational, the market will have full Covid-19 protocol in place,” Almeida said. The Anjuna flea market was initiated by the hippies in the 1970s and the sale of foreign goods at the venue drew droves of Indian tourists. While the market grew in size over the years, a majority of the stalls are now operated by Indian vendors showcasing artefacts, clothes and other items. A few decades later, Ingo’s Saturday night market heralded the trend of night markets in the state, with stalls operated by foreign and Indian artists. Visitors could also listen to different genres of music and taste different cuisines at the venue. In recent years, another night market came to be organised at Arpora, but by a different party. Last year, the flea market, as well as the night markets, were not granted permission to operate due to pandemic-induced restrictions. Arpora-Nagoa sarpanch Shrikrishna Nagvekar said an application has been received from the organisers of Ingo’s Saturday night market, but has been kept pending due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We will forward it to the block development officer (BDO) and let the government take a call,” he said and added that the panchayat has not received an application from the organisers of the other night market.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/anjunas-popular-weekly-flea-market-likely-to-resume-next-month/articleshow/87968831.cms||---

While responding to the allegations, Sancoale sarpanch Girish Pillai and other panchayat members asked the villagers to produce proof and asked them not to make allegations on public forum without evidence. “Panchayat does not give permissions for big projects. But project proponents go to higher authorities and get their work done,” Pillai said. The sarpanch assured the gram sabha that the panchayat will join the village in opposing such projects. The villagers also complained of irregular water supply and frequent outages demanding to resolve the issue at the earliest.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/mega-projects-are-affecting-sancoales-natural-resources/articleshow/87968886.cms||---

Saldanha said the houses are located very close to the existing rail track, and if there is a second track, it will run through their compounds or corridors. “Should people leave their houses? Is this development? and if yes, for whose benefit it is carried out?” she asked. Cansaulim sarpanch Ferwin Saldanha said the contractor has told them that the project does not require permission from the panchayat. “Same thing happened while laying tracks for the Konkan Railway. They feel they are above the law,” the sarpanch said.

Slice has raised $220 million in a series-B round valuing the company at over $1 billion. The round was led by Tiger Global and Insight Partners. Other investors include Advent International’s Sunley House Capital, Moore Strategic Ventures and angel investor Binny Bansal. Sources said that the startup received strong interest from global investors in this oversubscribed round, and is still evaluating some investments. Earlier in June, Slice had raised a $20-million series-A round that had valued it at around $200 million. Slice, which started as a ‘buy now, pay later’ payments product, pivoted to offer credit cards in 2019 to address what it saw as a large market gap. Users can sign up, get a slice ‘super card’ (a prepaid visa card with a credit line) virtually, and also get the physical card delivered to their home. Slice, which is shipping around 200,000 cards each month, lets users slice the bill into 3 monthly instalments at zero cost and enjoy up to 2% cashback on each transaction. “Our burn is very low compared to other consumer startups and we are going to use the funds to hire more product and design talent and focus on making more products that are best-in-class in terms of user experience,” Rajan Bajaj, founder and CEO, Slice, told TOI. “Our superior product experience has made us the most popular alternative to existing credit cards. We have a net promoter score of over 75 today — much higher than most banks,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/credit-card-co-slice-41st-unicorn-in-21-raises-220mn/articleshow/87970282.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

According to police, the accused, who has been EPS’s assistant for more than 10 years, was arrested based on a complaint lodged on October 24 by G Tamilselvan, 29, of Neyveli. Tamilselvan in his complaint said he handed over Rs 17 lakh to Mani and K Selvakumar, 45, an AIADMK functionary from Kadayampatty, after they promised him assistant engineer job with the Tamil Nadu transport corporation. But they reneged on their promise. Search on for AIADMK cadre SelvakumarWhen Tamilselvan wanted his money back, they paid him just Rs 4 lakh and also threatened him, the complaint said. “Based on Tamilselvan’s complaint, the district crime branch police registered a case under sections 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of IPC and initiated an inquiry,” DCB DSP A V Elamurugan said. “We arrested Mani at his house near Deevattipatti on Sunday morning,” the DSP said, adding that they are searching for Selvakumar. A few days ago, the Salem district court dismissed an bail moved by Mani. Meanwhile, state secretary of CPI R Mutharasan on Sunday urged the state government to initiate an inquiry with the former chief minister. “These irregularities wouldn’t have happened without his knowledge,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/salem/rs-17-lakh-bribe-for-ae-job-edappadi-k-palaniswamis-pa-arrested-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/87970281.cms||Senthil Kumaran

In her complaint lodged with the Vepery police, Yasmin, 28, said she suspected the hand of a woman who facilitated the sale. A case has been registered and special police teams are searching for the woman, identified as Jayageetha, and the two men. Yasmin, a resident of Kavangarai in Puzhal, told police that she had met Jayageetha, a resident of Tsunami Colony in Ennore, during a visit to a private hospital in Kellys. Yasmin, who was pregnant with her second child, wanted to abort it as her husband had left her and she was struggling to make ends meet. Jayageetha, however, talked Yasmin out of her decision and said she would get a lot of money if she was willing to sell the child to a person known to her. Yasmin delivered a boy at a government hospital in Washermenpet on November 21. A week later, after the mother and son were discharged, Jayageetha asked Yasmin to bring the boy to Purasawalkam High Road. Mom made to sign on blank paper after selling babyAfter Yasmin brought the baby to Purasawalkam, Jayageetha introduced her to a woman named Dhanam and two men. Yasmin handed over her one-week old son to Dhanam after collecting the promised ₹2.5 lakh. She was asked to sign on an empty paper that she was told was a ‘bond’ under the deal. Later, as she was going back home in an autorickshaw with her elder daughter Sharmila, the two men followed her on a two-wheeler. They stopped her auto near Pulianthope on the pretext of seeking directions to an address with the driver. They threatened her, snatched the cash and rode away, police said, quoting from her complaint.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/mom-robbed-of-rs-2-5-lakh-she-got-by-selling-baby-in-chennai/articleshow/87970286.cms||---

While at least four locations between Semmencherry and Kalavakkam were flooded, roads in Thazhambur were under almost six ft of water. Water bodies breached. Water from the Padur lake ran over OMR from west to east, slowing down traffic, while Semmencherry was waterlogged and motorists took the service road. The stretch near Kelambakkam came under a thick sheet of water. Social media platforms were flooded with videos of OMR turning into a stream and part of the bridge near Kelambakkam developing cracks. S Vasudevan, councillor of Muttukadu panchayat, said the road from Padur to Kelambakkam was inundated, inconveniencing motorists, particularly two-wheeler riders. "A street at Padur has been dug to facilitate the movement of water from a lake that had entered the area and which is flowing on OMR," he said. At Thazhambur, about 7km north of Padur, the entire area was under a thick sheet of water. C R Raghunathan, a resident, said the area which is homes to about 10,000 people was cut off from the rest of the city. "There is no boat service available to ferry the locals," he said. Chengalpet administration officials said buses and tractors are available to ferry people. Pointing out that there is a missing link of 300 metres of water channel, an official said steps are being taken to construct a culvert to avert flooding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-rain-parts-of-omr-flooded-thazhambur-cut-off/articleshow/87970309.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Inundation, power outages in several parts irk residents||CHENNAI: As heavy rain lashed the city on the second consecutive day, several areas reported inundation. The worst hit localities were K K Nagar, Ashok Nagar, West Mambalam and the southern region. More than 300 people were moved to shelters and several boats had to be deployed in Semmenchery, Perumbakkam and nearby areas. Raja Mannar Salai in K K Nagar was closed for traffic, with four high power pumps deployed on the stretch. In Manali, Ganapathy Siva Nagar, Irular colony and Balasubramania Nagar were water-logged. Officials set up 850 pumps in different locations across the city. "We could avoid excess water-logging in several areas where short-term interventions were carried out. But complaints continued to pour in due to power outages and sewage water overflow. We are attending to all of them," said an official. The officials also employed workers to break several drains and compound walls that blocked water flow and caused inundation. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, corporation commissioner, said they held several meetings and are hopeful of implementing some long term solutions in the coming months. "We need to do extensive studies in all areas and find solutions. We are working on it," he said. Traffic snarls were a major issue due to inundation in many areas on Sunday. In K K Nagar, many residents were stuck for long on water-logged roads. In Mandaveli, power cuts lasted more than 36 hours. K Gopalakrishnan, civic activist from K K Nagar, said encroachments by shops and temples were responsible for inundation.  GCC officials conducted a meeting with public works department and highways department to work on long term solutions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-inundation-power-outages-in-several-parts-irk-residents/articleshow/87970314.cms||---
---||Kolkata||12 Asiatic black bears spotted in north Bengal in two weeks||JALPAIGURI: There have been at least 12 sightings of Asiatic black bears in Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong in just 15 days, leaving the forest department baffled. Officials have no clue where the animals are coming from. Two persons were attacked in Nagrakata area of Jalpaiguri on Sunday. A forest department team rushed to the spot. Also on Sunday, SSB jawans drove at least five bears into the forest at Sibchu in Jalpaiguri close to Kalimpong district. The presence of two other bears was reported from Soongachhi tea estate in Malbazar and Dhupjhora beside Gorumara National Park. Foresters could not spot the animals but confirmed their presence based on pug marks. On Saturday, a bear was tranquillized and taken to Neora Valley National Park after it entered Grassmore tea estate in Nagrakata. On November 20, an Asiatic black bear entered Matelli tea estate, where it was lynched after mauling a garden dweller to death. The same day, a bear and two cubs were captured on CCTV at Tiger Hill in Darjeeling. “There have been at least 12 sightings of Asiatic Black Bears in just 15 days. Either it symbolizes that the bear population has significantly increased, or there is a habitat loss issue. We believe their number has increased and, hence, they are looking for new habitats,” said Rajendra Jakhar, chief conservator of forests, wildlife, northern circle. Some conservationists suspect a road project from Oodlabari to Gangtok has impacted the bear population there. “This road passes through the fringes of Neora Valley National Park. There’s a possibility that construction activities for the roadworks are prompting the bears to climb downwards,” said Shyama Prasad Pandey of SPOAR. State wildlife advisory board member Animesh Bose, however, said: “The road that is being constructed is miles away from the places the bears are being spotted. We can only hope that the population is not into any sort of trouble.” Jakhar, too, said: “That road is at least 15km away from the places where bears live in Neora. There is very little possibility of the construction work hampering their lives.” The forest department is planning a bear enumeration exercise at Neora Valley National Park. Such an exercise was earlier conducted in 2012 at Senchel Wildlife Sanctuary near Tiger Hill, where the presence of 8-15 Asiatic black bears was noted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/12-asiatic-black-bears-spotted-in-north-bengal-in-2-weeks/articleshow/87968890.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

The tragedy claimed 12 lives of the family of Shibani Muhuri, whose body was being taken to Nadia’s Nabadwip crematorium ground. The six other victims are from five more families, all from Parmadon’s Uttarpara locality. “Shibani’s two sons, daughters-in-law and three grandchildren died on the spot. Five more close relatives of the Muhuri family were also killed. Shibani’s grandson Subhankar, who works in Dubai, is the only living person in the family now,” said Jayanta Biswas, a neighbour. Photo: Sajal MukherjeeThe Muhuri family is a well-established business family owning several garment shops at Sindrani Market. “Shibani, suffering from old-age ailments, died at a relative’s house in Gobardanga on Saturday morning. She had expressed her desire to be cremated at Nabadwip, the holy birth place of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Accordingly, family members, relatives and neighbours first took her body to Parmadon village on Saturday afternoon and around 30 people started for Nabadwip around 12.30 am on Sunday,” said Sanchita Mondal, a local woman. The others bereaved members of Biswas, Sarkar, Roy and Mondal families, and another victim — the driver of the matador van Prasenjit Das — were in a state of shock and mourned the deaths of their dear ones. Photo: Sajal MukherjeeSabitri Biswas, wife of victim Sukumar Biswas, fell unconscious twice after hearing the shocking news. “It was midnight. My husband was sleeping. Some neighbours called him to go with them to crematorium ground. I warned him repeatedly not to go out at that hour. He didn’t listen to my words,” she said, breaking down with tears. State forest minister Jyotipriya Mallick and all four MLAs from Bongaon, including Biswajit Das, Ashoke Kirtaniya, Swapan Majumdar and Subrata Thakur, visited the houses of the victims. Mallick announced Rs 2 lakh as government compensation for each of the bereaved families. “People from a number of families have already left for Nadia and Kolkata hospitals looking for their injured kin,” said Bagdah MLA Biswajit Das.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bagdah-village-in-shock-as-accident-claims-18-lives-from-same-neighbourhood/articleshow/87968844.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||BJP sweeps Tripura civic polls, but TMC emerges main opposition||AGARTALA: Amid a BJP sweep in the Tripura civic polls, Trinamool Congress emerged as the primary opposition garnering a 20.2% vote share in the Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC) election and 24% statewide, where polls were held on November 25. The Trinamool vote share in AMC was in fact more than CPM’s 18.4%. BJP had a 57% vote share. Trinamool pushed the main opposition CPM behind only in Agartala, Ambassa, Teliamura, Sonamura and Sabroom out of 13 urban bodies; CPM retained its second position in all others. But elections couldn’t be held in seven urban localities and BJP secured victory without contest. Trinamool has been known in Tripura politics for the last two decades but this is the first time it has fought elections on its own outside Bengal. Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, without naming Trinamool, said that people gave a befitting reply to the slander by some parties that didn’t have a minimum base. They defamed Tripura with fabricated allegations, he added, before the country and the results indicated people would remain with PM Narendra Modi. “I dedicate today’s victory to the people of Tripura without going to any accusation or pointing a finger at any party or leader,” he said. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said: “It is exceptional for a party beginning with negligible presence to successfully contest municipal elections and emerge as the principal opposition in the state with more than 20% vote share. This is despite the fact that we commenced our activities barely 3 months ago and BJP Tripura left no stone unturned to butcher democracy in Tripura. Congratulations to all the brave soldiers of AITC Tripura for their exemplary courage.” BJP spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty said Trinamool failed despite raising cries of violence and poll manipulation against BJP and moved the Supreme Court seeking direction to postpone the civic polls. TMC has moved the Supreme Court alleging large-scale attacks on party candidates and voters. The matter is yet to be heard. On Sunday, too, Trinamool said several of its candidates were attacked in Tripura. Trinamool state convener Subal Bhowmik denied BJP’s argument and said: “If voting was fair and peaceful, BJP would have lost all seats in Agartala.” CPM state secretary Jitendra Chowdhury said: “Thanks to social media, people of the country saw the violence of BJP in Tripura and the way people voted Left candidates everywhere in the state despite multiple obstructions from the party in power, administration and state election commission. We have full faith and trust in the Supreme Court that our petition will sustain.” Newly formed TIPRA Motha won a seat in Ambassa, defeating BJP. TIPRA chairman and royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman said: “Our nominee Seba Kalai has created history by becoming the first candidate from a regional party in the history of Tripura to win an urban seat defeating BJP.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/bjp-sweeps-tripura-civic-polls-but-tmc-emerges-main-oppn/articleshow/87968976.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Despite the increase in rates, Jio has kept the price of plans lower than Airtel and Vodafone Idea’s which is expected to continue pricing competition in the industry. The company still has kept its lowest rate for 28 days validity plan at Rs 91 for Jiophone users which is the lowest among private telecom operators. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have increased the entry level plan with 28 days validity to Rs 99. The tariff hikes entail JioPhone Plan, Unlimited Plans, and data add on, and range between 19.6% and 21.3%. “In line with its commitment to further strengthen a sustainable telecom industry, where every Indian is empowered with a true digital life, Jio today announced its new unlimited plans. These plans will provide the best value in the industry,” Reliance Jio said in a statement. The statement further said: “Upholding the Jio promise of providing the best-quality service at the lowest price globally, Jio customers will continue to be the biggest beneficiaries”. The new unlimited plans will go-live on December 1, 2021, and can be opted from existing touchpoints and channels. The company announced tariff hikes across 15 plans which include one for JioPhone users, 11 in unlimited category and three in data top up category. In the unlimited plan category, Jio has increased the price of its cheapest plan with 28 days validity to Rs 155 from Rs 129. The cheapest unlimited category with 84 days validity will be priced at Rs 395 instead of 329 at present. The popular unlimited category plan offering daily 1.5 GB daily data usage with 84 days validity will go up by about 20% to Rs 666 from Rs 555 at present. The company has announced that its annual unlimited category plan offering 2 GB daily data usage at 4G speed will be priced at Rs 2,879 instead of 2,399 at present. Airtel and Vodafone Idea last week announced up to 25% hike in their prepaid plans tariffs to improve financials. Several market analysts had said that the final assessment of the impact can be done only when Jio opens up its card on price hike. Airtel and VIL have been maintaining that average revenue per user needs to go up in the range of Rs 200 to Rs 300 per month for sustaining business but they have been unable to hike tariff due to competitive pressure. agencies||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/jio-joins-voda-idea-airtel-in-raising-tariffs/articleshow/87970305.cms||---

This demand is being made as the TRS government has charged the Centre with procuring entire paddy stocks from Punjab while neglecting Telangana. KCR, who presided over the TRS parliamentary party meeting here on Sunday, said a uniform policy will allow the state to set its paddy cultivation target for farmers in tune with the procurement target of the Centre. The CM has also convened a meeting of the state cabinet on Monday to discuss the comprehensive alternate crops plan and policy to be implemented in the state in Yasangi season against the backdrop of central government's firm stand not to procure parboiled rice from Telangana and not making any commitment on quantity of paddy (milled raw rice) to be procured from the state in the future. The TRS parliamentary party meeting chalked out the strategy to be adopted by the party in the winter session of Parliament. KCR laid out the road map for the party MPs to take on BJP-led government by raising various issues in both Houses of Parliament to protect the interests of Telangana and its farmers in particular. The CM said one national policy on uniform food grain procurement is the need of the hour so that none of the states or its farmers suffer due to lack of clarity on annual procurement by the Centre. He said that the farming community in the state and across the country is facing problems due to central government's confusing policies. Committed to farmers, says CM  The TRS government is committed to protecting the interests of farmers and agriculture sector and the winter session of Parliament should be used as one of the main platforms to exert pressure on the Centre," the CM told party MPs. The TRS parliamentary party meeting demanded that the central government end its "dual and illogical policy" on procurement of paddy from Telangana. The CM asked the MPs to take the Centre to task for changing its stance on the paddy issue and stating that it would procure only 60 lakh tonnes of paddy (equivalent to 40 lakh tonnes of rice), while the Centre should actually be procuring 90 lakh tonnes of paddy from Telangana. With Yasangi crop season all set to begin and Telangana farmers getting ready to sow paddy seeds, the CM demanded that the Centre should come out with a year-wise or at least an annual calendar on paddy procurement. The meeting said that the Centre's policy would be a death blow to the farm sector in Telangana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-mps-to-press-centre-for-all-india-policy-to-buy-grains/articleshow/87970380.cms||Roushan Ali

Accor, which has 55 properties in India, is banking on October-December 2022 to be back at the pre-Covid level. Since international travel still has some restrictions, the bounce-back is almost entirely on domestic travellers in the form of holidays, staycations and workations. “We have 6,000 employees in India. During Covid and either no or very low revenues, unfortunately 25% of them had to be laid off. We created a fund for employees from the amount that was to be paid as dividend to shareholders just before the pandemic struck. The recovery following the second wave has been much stronger than anticipated and we have started re-employing the laid off work force in India,” Marc Descrozaille, Accor’s COO for India, Middle East and Africa, told TOI. So far, about one-third of those laid back have been invited to return. Some of those who got this call declined the offer as they had started doing something else during the pandemic, he said. “While occupancy is looking up, average room rates are lagging behind. People are now spending more on hotel stays, food and beverage or upgrading their room. A large number of guests these days are driving in for breaks. Saving on airfares allows them to spend more on hotel stays (not rates which are still low but other amenities),” Descrozaille said. The ongoing wedding season is bringing some more respite for hotels. “Since there are restrictions on the size of gatherings (200 in Delhi for instance), people are spending more (per guest) due to that,” he said. With pandemic fatigue setting in, hotels have to remind guests to adhere to Covid protocol. While footfalls are up, revenue overall are still nowhere close to pre-pandemic levels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/accor-re-hires-third-of-1500-laid-off-employees/articleshow/87970378.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat are the other states with income over Rs 80,000 crore. RBI's most recent publication, 'Handbook of Statistics on Indian States- 2020-21' stated that Telangana's estimated own tax income was Rs 85,300, the lowest among the top six states with over Rs 80,000 crore own income. Maharashtra tops the list with more than Rs 2.2 lakh crore income. It is followed by Tamil Nadu, earning Rs 1.3 lakh crore income through taxes. Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat also have more than Rs 1 lakh crore in tax revenue. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is on the list of states having an annual income of over Rs 70,000 crore. Interestingly, Telangana's standalone income exceeds that of united Andhra Pradesh in the final year of its existence, 2013-14. Where funds are going is key: Experts  Income of united AP was Rs 70,653 crore at the time. In actuality, the state exceeded estimates in the 2020-21, with a revised state own income estimate of Rs 71,328 crore. Since inception, state's income has increased by average of Rs 10,000 crore every year. Telangana generated Rs 29,288 crore in 2015- 15, which increased to Rs 59,177 crore in 2018- 19. Experts say, while having good revenue reflects a state's economic pace, it is more important where funds are going. "Apart from Finance Commission's suggestions on transfer of funds from Centre to states, state's mobilisation of funds is critical. It is better to spend more money on capital expenditure," UoH's school of economics assistant professor Dr Krishna Reddy Chittedi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/telanganas-own-income-zooms-past-rs-80000-crore-joins-top-6-club/articleshow/87970417.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Business||Loss due to conservative accounting: Paytm||MUMBAI: Paytm founder & CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma has said that One97 Communications’s (Paytm’s parent’s) losses were due to conservative accounting, which led to upfront booking of acquisition costs even as revenues from those subscriptions would flow over the next 12 months. One97 Communications announced its results for second quarter of the current fiscal, the first result after listing, on Saturday. The company’s revenue from operations grew 64%, while consolidated net loss widened by 8% to Rs 473 crore. A key driver of the revenue growth was the 52% growth in non-UPI volumes. In an interview with TOI, Sharma said “Our accounting is extremely conservative. We immediately charge 100% of all marketing, cashback, sales and system costs. The reason why ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) has improved is that merchants acquired earlier are generating revenue.” Paytm, which has a payments bank, had earlier expressed intent to seek a small finance bank (SFB) licence that will enable it to lend. However, the RBI on Friday said that it would consider applications for transition to SFB only after five years of a payment bank’s operations. “We are less than one year away from completing five years (on May 2022) and are open to exploring the opportunities should they arise. Also, Paytm Payments Bank’s net worth is Rs 400 crore as against the Rs 300 crore prescribed by the regulation,” said Sharma. Responding to analysts who said that Paytm’s business was hit because of increasing market share of UPI in digital payments, Sharma said, “I have always maintained that it is important to have zero fees on UPI as it helps to create a digital acceptance ecosystem. Paytm makes revenue because once a retail merchant matures, they start accepting other digital payment instruments as well.” He said that as a percentage of gross merchandise value, payment processing costs have come down.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/loss-due-to-conservative-accounting-paytm/articleshow/87970419.cms||Mayur Shetty

Testing and genome sequencing must be stepped up so that there is no lag in detection of a threat, the CM emphasized, pointing out that early warning is key to a swift counter-response. “There is no information on the presence of the new variant in India, as of now, but caution is must,” Chouhan said at a review meeting on the Omicron strain that is causing worldwide concern. “I appeal to the people of the state not to be careless in the least. Follow all the necessary rules to prevent spread of infection,” the CM said. Need to prevent third wave at any cost: CMPrecautions should continue to be taken at every stage. The third wave must be prevented at all costs,” the CM said. Travelers coming from abroad will be monitored. “Those who have come by flight from other countries will be tested and kept in isolation, if necessary. All those who have come here by international flights within a month must be tested for Corona and if any suspect is found, then they should be kept in isolation,” Chouhan ordered. He has called a meeting of crisis management groups on December 1, and ordered the administration to ensure there are enough stocks of Remdesivir and other medicines to tackle any eventuality. “The number of daily tests should be increased, from 58,000-60,000 now to 70,000,” Chouhan said. The state averaged around 55,000 tests a day in the past week in which 110 new Covid cases were detected — the highest in a seven-day period in threefour months. Four deaths in a span of 10 days rattled the state this month. “It gives us the message to be alert. We should be careful of the new variant of Covid. Keeping in mind the possibility of the third wave of Corona, all necessary measures to prevent it should be implemented,” Chouhan said. The CM asked the administration to ensure 100% full vaccination by December, and again urged people to get their second dose of the vaccine. “The use of masks is mandatory. Public programmes will not be banned for now, but all the rules and precautions to prevent infection should be followed,” Chouhan said. About 62.5% of the eligible population in MP is fully vaccinated, the CM said, adding: “A vaccination campaign will be conducted on December 1. I appeal to all to mobilise in full strength so that the remaining people are vaccinated.” “The situation is not alarming now. New cases are mainly coming in two cities — Indore and Bhopal. Their number is also not such that it should create fear in our minds. But caution is a must,” he advised. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and other senior officers were present in the meeting.

Children should not be called to school without the permission of the parents.” “Schools will have to start online classes, so that parents have the option to let their children study online if they do not want to send them to school. So the options must be kept open,” the CM ordered. Parents, who were on the tenterhooks for the past week, apprehensive of sending unvaccinated kids to school, were relieved and thanks the CM. Guidelines after parents resort to petitions, protestsOn November 22, the school education department issued a notification allowing 100% physical attendance in schools but leaving vague guidelines on online classes, which prompted some schools to shut online classes and go offline-only, without bothering about parents’ consent for students’ physical presence. Groups of parents protested, some staged a dharna outside school gates, and some petitioned the administration. The government has issued fresh guidelines, reducing attendance to 50%, and reiterating that parents’ consent is mandatory, as is online education. Schools an hold exams offline, but can’t force parents to send their children. As per the revised schedule, a child could be called for offline class three days a week. “On the first day, 50% children will come to school and the remaining 50% will come the next day. This way they will attend school three days a week, but the option of online classes must be there,” the CM said.

Principal secretary Ashok Barnwal and chief wildlife warden Alok Kumar were scheduled to fly to the African country on Sunday but have postponed it, said sources. The new variant, classified as one of ‘concern’, will further delay implementation of the ambitious wildlife project – the world’s first inter-continental cheetah translocation. The Madhya Pradesh government has pulled out all stops to bring cheetahs to Kuno National Park, but the process gets stalled by one reason or the other, including untimely heavy rain that disrupted logistics. Recently, a massive vaccination drive for stray dogs was carried out within a 5km radius of Kuno as the translocation was expected this November. The park administration identified 400-odd villages, where vaccination of 1,000 stray, feral and local dogs was carried out so that they don’t pass on any disease alien to the cheetahs’ immunity. A three-member panel has been set up to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority in translocation. This team is yet to be trained.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-omicron-scare-hits-cheetah-project/articleshow/87970379.cms||P Naveen

Botswana is one of the countries where Omicron infections have been reported. Jabalpur chief medical and health officer Ratnesh Kurariya told TOI that they initially received information from an airlines that a ‘South African national’ had flown to Jabalpur from Delhi on November 18. As per the passenger list, she was identified as Khumo Oremeet Selyn, a resident of Botswana. “We had her email ID and a phone number. We made calls to confirm, but there is still some confusion. When we contacted that person, she denied having come to Jabalpur and said she was in the embassy at New Delhi,” Dr Khurariya said, adding investigations are underway. The administration is searching at hotels and tourist places, and has released mobile numbers of local health authorities, seeking information on her. Jabalpur SP Siddharth Bahuguna said the administration has not contacted police yet on this.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/omicron-scare-frantic-search-for-botswana-woman-in-madhya-pradeshs-jabalpur/articleshow/87970381.cms||---

Coinstore has launched its web and app platform and plans branches in Bangalore, New Delhi and Mumbai, which will act as its base for future expansion, its management said. “With nearly a quarter of our total active users coming from India, it made sense for us to expand into the market,” Charles Tan, head of marketing at Coinstore told Reuters. Asked why Coinstore was launching India despite the pending clampdown on cryptocurrencies, Tan said: “There have been policy flip-flops but we hope things are going to be positive and we are optimistic that the Indian government will come out with a healthy framework for cryptocurrencies.” The government is planning to discourage trading in cryptocurrencies by imposing hefty capital gains and other taxes, two sources told Reuters earlier this month. It has said that it will allow only certain cryptocurrencies to promote the underlying technology and its uses, according to a legislative agenda for the winter session that is set to start later this month. Tan said Coinstore plans to recruit about 100 employees in India and spend $20 million for marketing, hiring and development of crypto-related products and services for the Indian market.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/singapore-crypto-bourse-enters-india-despite-pending-curbs/articleshow/87970455.cms||---

The strike will comprise withdrawal of elective services, including OPDs and surgeries (excluding emergency services), at all medical colleges affiliated with KARD. While the association had announced a similar indefinite strike on November 9, it was called off after the minister for medical education promised to resolve the issues in 10 days. Karnataka had announced the allowance from April to all resident doctors. Intent to address issue not visible: AssnIt is unfortunate to note that the assurance given by the minister has not been fulfilled. The intent to address the issue is clearly not visible as resident doctors were excluded from the package of Covid-risk allowance announced recently by government of Karnataka. We are left with no option but to display our dissent in this regard,” read a press release from the association. The state had announced the Covid allowance per month from April to all resident doctors. It has not been paid yet. Also, the academic fee was hiked from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1,20,000. The students were not given any concession during Covid even when school fees were reduced. The association has pointed at the repeated postponements of NEET-PG counselling. It urged the Centre and the Supreme Court to expedite NEET-PG 2021counselling and admission, besides fast-tracking the court proceedings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/resident-doctors-in-karnataka-to-go-on-strike-from-today/articleshow/87970490.cms||---

I am confident that some of them will come back after a few years not just as a part of the film industry but also as icons of cinema. The kind of encouragement they got - the master classes by the who-is-who of cinema industry, they are one of the lucky few to have got this opportunity,” Thakur said. The 75 youngsters comprising seven women and 68 male artists, all under 35 years of age, were chosen basis their skills in different fields of film making including direction, editing, singing and screenplay, among others.

In public, Visa has downplayed concerns about the rise of RuPay, which has been supported by public lobbying from PM Narendra Modi that has included likening the use of local cards to national service. But US government memos show Visa raised concerns about a “level playing field” in India during an August 9 meeting between US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai and company executives, including CEO Alfred Kelly. Mastercard has raised similar concerns privately with the USTR. Reuters reported in 2018 that the company had lodged a protest with the USTR that Modi was using nationalism to promote the local network. “Visa remains concerned about India’s informal and formal policies that appear to favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI),” the non-profit that runs RuPay, “over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies,” said a USTR memo prepared for Tai ahead of the meeting. Visa, USTR, the PMO and the NPCI did not respond to requests for comment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/visa-complains-to-us-govt-over-indias-backing-for-rupay/articleshow/87970542.cms||---
---||Jaipur||No perks or minister status for advisors, secretaries: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Legislators appointed as advisors to the CM or parliamentary secretaries will get neither ministerial status nor perks, chief minister Ashok Gehlot clarified on Sunday. Six MLAs were made advisors to the CM last week, while a couple of others are expected to be made parliamentary secretaries in the coming days so as to accommodate leaders who have been ignored during the cabinet expansion and reshuffle on November 21. Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore had objected to the appointment of MLAs as advisors to the CM and submitted a memorandum to the governor, who in turn sought a constitutional stand on the subject from the chief secretary. tnn 'Why is there such an outcry? I'm just taking advice from the MLAs' BJP leaders had been objecting to the proposed appointment of parliamentary secretaries too citing a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits MLAs from holding office of profit of ministerial status beyond the cabinet strength fixed for the state. While addressing the media at the PCC headquarters, Gehlot said, "Why is there such an outcry? I am just taking advice from them (six MLAs). How can anyone question me for doing that? Whether I appoint an MLA, MP, journalist, intellectual or a litterateur as my advisor, that is my prerogative." "We are running a government, we must be knowing what the Supreme Court has said (on MLAs holding office of profit). All governments know that ministerial status and perks cannot be given in such cases. If these (benefits) are cut, who can stop the government from appointing parliamentary secretaries or advisors to the CM," the CM asked. Gehlot clarified that his government had never issued an order granting any benefit to the six MLAs appointed as advisors to the CM and would not do so if parliamentary secretaries are appointed in the future. Targeting Rajasthan's unemployed youth who demonstrated before the Congress office in Lucknow recently, Gehlot said, "Rajasthan has given maximum jobs to people in the country. One lakh jobs have already been given and the recruitment process is on for 77,000 more jobs. Sincere students are studying for these recruitment exams, while others are forming unions and indulging in demonstrations. They won't get jobs by going to Lucknow." The CM had reached the ruling party's headquarters to speak on scheduled Congress rally to protest inflation and price rise on December 12. Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra, who accompanied Gehlot, claimed that around 50,000 party workers from Rajasthan would participate in the rally. Dotasra, who was dropped as minister last week, was hailed by Gehlot as one of the best school education ministers the state has seen so far.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/no-perks-or-minister-status-for-advisors-secretaries-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/articleshow/87970561.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: Outbreaks cast shadow on New Year celebrations in Karnataka||BENGALURU: The Covid-19 cluster outbreak at a medical college in Dharwad has cast a shadow on the Belagavi session of the state legislature, scheduled to begin on December 13. Officials say the government will take a call on whether to go ahead with the session in the north Karnataka district, depending on how the pandemic situation unfolds over the next week. As on Sunday, 306 students and faculty have tested positive at the SDM College of Medical Sciences in Dharwad, and this has led to some concerns over hosting the session at the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha, since Belagavi is only 77km away from the college. If the government is forced to shift the winter session back to Bengaluru, then this will be the third year in a row that Belagavi has been deprived of hosting the session. The latest surge in cases has also put a question mark on Christmas celebrations and New Year revelry as the government has already announced restrictions on events where large congregations are expected. The health department on Sunday issued a notification postponing all social and cultural events and conferences for two months. Officials said these restrictions are expected to extend to religious and festive events. “A decision will be taken on New Year celebrations and other events depending on the developments related to Covid control in the next few days,” chief minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters. The state government is on high alert especially in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi directing states to impose restrictions wherever required. Health minister K Sudhakar has called a meeting of experts on Monday to take stock. Basavaraj Horatti, chairman of the legislative council, who had vociferously pushed for the winter session to be held in Belagavi, admitted the emerging situation has prompted a review of the decision. “Since it is an issue of public safety, the government should be pragmatic,” Horatti said. “While the winter session can be held in Bengaluru with the imposition of strict safety norms, the joint session of the two houses, where the governor will give his address, can be held in Belagavi if the pandemic situation improves by then.” He said he, assembly speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri and officials concerned, will hold a meeting on December 3 in Belagavi to review preparedness for the session. “However, if the situation continues to deteriorate, then we will cancel the December 3 meeting,” Horatti said. While the government had asked experts to study the situation, Dr MK Sudarshan, chairman of the state Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the next seven days are crucial, and curbs may be required to ensure the spread of the virus is checked. “Samples of patients from the clusters have been sent for genomic sequencing to find out the nature of the virus,” Dr Sudarshan said. “It will take another five to six days for the results to be known. We will frame recommendations based on the result and the emerging pandemic situation.” While there has been no case of Omicron, the new novel coronavirus variant of concern, in India so far, Dr Sudarshan said curbs are necessary even if the present spread is found to be due to the older Delta Plus variant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/covid-19-outbreaks-cast-shadow-on-new-year-celebrations-in-karnataka/articleshow/87970581.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||World||Omicron spreads, cases detected in Netherlands, Denmark, Australia||LONDON/AMSTERDAM: The Omicron coronavirus variant kept spreading around the world on Sunday, with 13 cases found in the Netherlands and two each in Denmark and Australia even as more countries imposed travel restriction to try to seal themselves off. Dutch health authorities said the 13 cases of the variant were found among people on two flights from South Africa to Amsterdam on Friday. Authorities had tested all of the more than 600 passengers on those two flights and had found 61 coronavirus cases, going on to test those for the new variant. “It is not unlikely more cases will appear in the Netherlands,” health minister Hugo de Jonge told a news conference in Rotterdam. “This could possibly be the tip of the iceberg.” The discovery of Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” last week by the WHO, has caused worry around the world that it could resist vaccinations and prolong the nearly two-year Covid-19 pandemic. First discovered in South Africa, it has now been detected in Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong. Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe Covid-19 compared to other strains. Many countries have imposed travel bans or curbs on southern Africa to try to stem the spread. Financial markets dived on Friday as investors worried that the variant could stall a global recovery. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel. Most Gulf stock markets ended lower on Sunday, with the Saudi and Dubai indexes suffering their biggest single-day fall in nearly two years. In new cases detected on Sunday, Denmark said it had registered two cases in travellers from South Africa, while officials in Australia said two passengers who arrived in Sydney from southern Africa had tested positive for the variant. Austria was investigating a suspected case and in France, health minister Olivier Veran said the variant was probably already circulating there. In Britain, where two linked cases of Omicron identified on Saturday were connected to travel to southern Africa, the government announced measures to try to contain the spread, including stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country and requiring mask wearing in some settings. British health minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday he expected to receive advice imminently on whether the government can broaden a programme of providing booster shots to fully vaccinated people, to try to weaken the impact.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/omicron-spreads-cases-detected-in-netherlands-denmark-australia/articleshow/87970573.cms||---

Faruqui mentioned that 12 of his shows have been “forcibly cancelled” in the past 2 months following threats to venue and audience. I have become an excuse for their hatred, says FaruquiTrouble began for Faruqui in January this year after his scheduled show in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, was disrupted before it began by a rightwing group allegedly led by a BJP politician’s son, claiming he had hurt religious sentiments through his gigs. Faruqui was arrested and jailed for 37 days till the Supreme Court granted him bail. “Aaj Bangalore show cancel ho gaya (Under the Threats to venue vandalism). We sold 600+ tickets... Month back my team called Late Puneeth Rajkumar sir organisation for charity which we will going to generate from this show in Bangalore! We do have censor certificate of the show and it's clearly nothing problematic in the show (sic)!” he posted, adding: “We called off 12 shows in last 2 months because of the Threats to Venue and Audience.” “Inki Nafrat ka bahana ban gaya hoon Hasa kar kitno ka sahara ban gaya hoon Tootne pe inki khwaish hogi puri Sahi kehta hai, mai Sitara ban gaya hoon (I have become an excuse for their hatred! I have been a support to many by making them laugh. (My) breaking down will fulfil their wish. What they say is true, I have become a star,” the comedian wrote. “I think this is The End. My name is Munawar Faruqui. And That's been my time, you guys were wonderful audience Good bye! Im done. (sic),” he signed off. Faruqui’s post was greeted with shock by his fans with many coming out with messages in support of him, while some unidentified persons trolled him for his decision. Many supporters urged the artist to reconsider his decision and continue performing through socialmedia platforms regularly. Member of Parliament and Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted, “This is deplorable. Stifling freedom of expression takes many forms but threatening a stand-up comedian’s venue is petty and shameful.” Actor and activist Swara Bhasker wrote on Twitter, “It’s heartbreaking & shameful how we as a society have allowed bullying and gaslighting to become normalised. I’m sorry Munawwar!” Badminton star Jwala Gutta replied on Instagram, “Don’t let them win.” Some social media users slammed Bengaluru City Police for the incident with a few calling them “spineless”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/munawar-faruqui-hints-at-quitting-after-bengaluru-cops-cancel-show/articleshow/87970618.cms||---

---||World||WHO skips forward 2 Greek letters, avoiding a Xi variant||When the WHO began to name the emerging variants of the coronavirus, officials turned to the Greek alphabet to make it easier for the public to understand the evolution: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and so on. Now the alphabet has created its own political headache. When it came time to name the potentially dangerous new variant that has emerged in southern Africa, the next letter in alphabetical order was Nu, which officials thought would be confused with “new”. The letter after that was even more complicated: Xi, a name that in its transliteration, though not its pronunciation, happens to belong to the leader of China, Xi Jinping. So they skipped both and named the new variant Omicron. “‘Nu’ is too easily confounded with ‘new,’ and ‘Xi’ was not used because it is a common last name,” a spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, said on Saturday in an emailed response to questions about skipping the two letters. The agency’s policy, he went on, requires “avoiding causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional, or ethnic groups.” The organisation did not initially explain why it jumped from Mu, a lesser variant first documented in Colombia, to Omicron. The omission resulted in speculation over the reasons. For some, it rekindled criticism that the WHO has been far too deferential in its dealings with the Chinese government. “If the WHO is this scared of the Chinese Communist Party, how can they be trusted to call them out the next time they’re trying to cover up a catastrophic global pandemic?” Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas, wrote on Twitter. There is no evidence that the Chinese had any say in naming the new variant, known scientifically as Sars-CoV2 variant B.1.1.529. Some variants have proved less transmissible, but Omicron could be the most worrisome new version since the Delta. Throughout the pandemic, WHO has sought to avoid the once common practice of referring to health threats with geographic terms: Spanish flu, West Nile virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Zika and Ebola. That reflected concerns among scientists about the risk of stigmatising places or peoples, but it was also seen in the early months of the pandemic as deferential to China, which has an influential role in global health affairs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/who-skips-forward-2-greek-letters-avoiding-a-xi-variant/articleshow/87970644.cms||---

Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) will prepare a fresh comprehensive mobility plan and detailed project report on a mass rapid transport system for the city while considering increased traffic in the Tricity, number of private vehicles, crowded points and other factors. The move comes after Punjab governor and UT administrator Banwarilal Purohit gave his approval last week. The study will not be limited to Metro, monorail, skybus and tramway among others. “The UT wants RITES to suggest the best mode of transportation that can provide last mile connectivity to commuters in an easy way,” sources said. As a lot of traffic comes from Mohali and Panchkula, RITES has been asked to prepared the plan and project by keeping the flow and traffic of the Tricity in the mind, so they were realistic and result-oriented. “Without considering traffic flow of Mohali and Panchkula, there is no meaning of any study,” sources said. In 2009, RITES had prepared a mobility plan that has now been termed outdated in view of the current traffic scenario. “The guidelines of the ministry of housing and urban affairs have changed since the UT had planned Metro in 2009,” said a senior UT official. “The ministry has signaled to give financial help for the project. Any consultation with Mohali and Panchkula is not part of the exercise. We are focusing on Chandigarh alone. Once the plan is ready, talks can then be held by keeping the viability on the mode of transport decided,” he added. Although no time-frame has been decided, sources said RITES was likely to prepare the plan in eight to 10 months and then the project report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/rites-to-prepare-fresh-mobility-plan-for-chandigarh/articleshow/87970706.cms||Deepak Yadav

Hospitals in the city, which get a number of patients from foreign countries, have been put on alert and asked to augment infrastructure. In keeping with guidelines issued by the Centre, the authorities have ramped up testing of people arriving from foreign countries, especially those that are “at risk” from the new variant, such as the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. The health department has also sought the cooperation of travellers who have just arrived in the city. People returning from foreign countries have been asked to monitor their own health for at least two weeks from the date of their arrival. Those not fully vaccinated will have to undergo an RT-PCR test on the day they land. After being in quarantine for seven days, the person will have to undergo a second test. “Every passenger has to self-monitor their health for 14 days after returning. Those who are not fully vaccinated will have to undergo two tests. People who have symptoms even after taking both doses of the Covid vaccine should also get themselves tested,” said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer. Covid testing will be intensified in all districts. Haryana has set a target of testing 40,500 people every day. “We have asked hospitals to be on high alert and ensure that all Covid protocols are followed,” said Yadav. International travellers are a concern for the administration all the more because a sizeable chunk of them are patients who come to the city for treatment. All hospitals have been asked to report such patients to the authorities immediately.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurgaon-hospitals-on-alert-tests-to-be-ramped-up/articleshow/87969177.cms||Ipsita Pati

Divided into 20 groups, these birders toured the wetlands in the region to participate in the winter bird count on Sunday. Among the areas they visited were Basai, Sultanpur, the Aravalis, Najafgarh, Jhajjar and other areas of Delhi-NCR. Each of them carried a logbook that had a list of species spotted in the region in the past 20 years or so. Every time they spotted a particular bird, they noted it down in the logbook. Some of the birders were in for a pleasant surprise in the Aravalis, where a few rare species could be spotted. “We saw the white-tailed iora and the Verditer flycatcher, which are rare species for Mangar. These were the two unique sightings during our birding. We went beyond the Mangar trail and also spotted the Olive-backed pipit. The weather, however, was not conducive as it was not very sunny. Although bird activity was less, we could still spot many species,” said Pritpal Panjeta, a member of the Delhi Bird Society. Among the rare sightings made this year were Eurasian griffon at Yamuna river, great bittern at Najafgarh lake, Marshall’s iora, and white-bellied drongo at Mangar village and Bhondsi forest. Marshall’s iora and the white-bellied drongo are endemic to the Indian subcontinent and found in the forests. Experts pointed out that the Chandu-Budhera wetlands and the neighbouring Najafgarh canal were important bird habitats for the region. “Wintering ducks are beginning to arrive here in good numbers,” said Kanwar B Singh, also from the Delhi Bird Society. Key wintering ducks include greylag geese, northern pintail, common pochard, northern shovellers, gadwall and Eurasian coot. Asked what he spotted, Singh said, “Various raptors were seen. They included greater spotted eagles, imperial eagle, osprey, hen harrier, marsh harrier and booted eagle. A flock of two dozen Eurasian cranes and great bitterns were sighted in Chandu.” According to him, the Sultanpur National Park had a good variety of wintering and resident waterfowl. After several years, he said, three nestlings of black-necked storks could be spotted at the national park. “Yes, it was a good day for birding. All the data we have recorded would be uploaded on the e-bird site for documentation. There were a number of winter migratory birds. Sultanpur, Mangar and Chandu have a good concentration of winter birds,” said Pankaj Gupta, a birder. ML Mallik, the conservator of wildlife in south Haryana, said, “At present, there are more than 35,000 birds in the Sultanpur sanctuary. Also, there is a floating population of birds as well that is flying further to the south.” The winter bird count is an annual event where birders travel to different locations across Delhi-NCR and spot various species. This practice helps in maintaining data for an analysis of the diversity in the region in the future. In 2019, around 250 species were sighted at the winter birdcount, while the number was 241 in 2018 and 252 in 2017. However, the annual exercise was not conducted in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/birdcount-returns-after-pandemic-break-some-rare-sightings-delight-enthusiasts/articleshow/87969181.cms||Ipsita Pati

A large number of dera followers put up their presence at many of the districts in politically largest Malwa region though some gatherings were also held in Doaba. The lesson of unity was paramount at each of dera branches apart from taking forward 135 actions of the dera. The followers also stressed upon making efforts to contain drug addiction and openly showcased their anger against the government for actions against the dera head and his followers in sacrilege cases. Sources say the unity of dera followers, at a time when the dera head is facing life sentence in three different cases and dera followers are being seen behind the act of sacrilege in Punjab in 2015, is of utmost importance to make its presence felt. The gatherings in Malwa were held at Bathinda, Muktsar, Faridkot, Fazilka, Ferozepur, Barnala, Moga, Mansa, Patiala, Sangrur, Fatehgarh Sahib and Ludhiana while in Doaba these were at Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. The special investigations team (SIT) probing cases of sacrilege had on November 26 summoned dera chairperson Vipasana and vice chairperson PR Nain for questioning in sacrilege case. Before that SIT members had grilled the dera head at Rohtak jail on November 8. Dera spokesperson Harcharan Singh admitted that dera followers were angry over the treatment meted out to the dera head and followers, but denied any political leanings behind the namm charcha in Punjab. ,Punjab,||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/dera-holds-gatherings-in-15-punjab-districts/articleshow/87970753.cms||Neel Kamal

As per state government officials, the award was presented to him by the National President of the council, Chhagan Bhujbal in a function organised by All India Mahatma Phule Samta Parishad at Mahatma Phule Memorial ‘Samta Bhoomi’ in Pune. Bhujbal honoured chief minister Baghel with a Phule turban, a shawl, award money and a memento. In his address, CM Baghel said that in the history of 5,000 years of India, 3,500 years were ruled by the backwards. The country’s economy was shattered during British rule. In such a situation, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule worked for the establishment of an egalitarian society through social reform. Mahatma Phule was the leading leader of the social revolution, while the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was the pre-eminent social reformer of the political revolution. We are working for the establishment of social justice in Chhattisgarh by following the path shown by these Mahatmas,” said Baghel. Meanwhile, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has been selected for this year’s award for his development works and crucial decisions taken towards providing justice to the deprived sections of the society during his tenure. A copy of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule’s book ‘Kisan Ka Koda’ was presented to the chief minister in the programme. Earlier, the chief minister paid floral tributes to the statues of Mahatma Phule and Smt. Savitri Bai Phule at Mahatma Phule Memorial ‘Samta Bhoomi’. “Mahatma Phule and Savitri Bai Phule devoted their life working for the welfare of the underprivileged and downtrodden, showed them the way of life and earned respect in the society. Mahatma Phule, a fervent revolutionary, looked closely at the problems of his time, understood them and found their solution. He directly attacked the stereotypes prevailing in the society, while working to solve the issues of education, medicine and equality of that time and contributed significantly to the creation of an egalitarian society. He carried forward the works of Mahatma Gandhi”, said Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel in his address at the function while paying homage to Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Savitri Bai Phule. “There was a time when India used to have 23% of the GDP of the whole world. People practised agriculture and craftsmen and artisans used to make artwork. India’s economy flourished back then, making the country popularly known as “golden bird”. This continued in the Mughal Empire, however, India’s economy shattered during the British rule. Agriculture was affected and skilled people were left unemployed. In such a situation Mahatma Phule emerged as a guiding light, who worked for the establishment of an egalitarian society through social reform”, he said. Baghel also paid tributes to Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the architect of Indian Constitution saying that he has ensured equal rights for all of us through the Indian Constitution. He stressed on the need of utilizing goods produced by small artisans to fight capitalism and marketism in today’s conditions. He said that today the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are getting less reservation in proportion to their population. However, everyone is silent on this matter. He informed that quantifiable data is being collected by the state government to provide 27 per cent reservation to other backward classes in Chhattisgarh. This will be presented in the High Court very soon. He said that we are making every possible effort to provide them rights and a respected place in society they deserve. Baghel said that soon after the formation of our government we had taken a historic step of returning 4200 acres of land acquired from 1700 farmers for setting up a steel plant at Lohandiguda in Bastar. Started procuring paddy at support price besides giving input subsidy to farmers under Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana to give farmers fair price for their produce. Referring to the Godhan Nyay Yojana, he said that in this scheme, self-help groups are producing organic manure in state-run Gauthans (cowsheds) by procuring cow dung at Rs 2 per kg. Through this thousands of women have got employment across the state. Now along with organic manure we are also producing electricity from cow dung. With the production of vermi-compost on a large scale, we are moving towards organic farming. Recharging of 12000 drains is being done to stop rain water.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel-conferred-mahatma-phule-samta-award/articleshow/87970914.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Huda City Centre revamp project may not be ready by end of year||GURUGRAM: With nearly 30 to 40 days’ work on the upcoming underpass and flyover pending, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is unlikely to open the Huda City Centre junction to commuters this year. The recent ban on construction activities due to high pollution levels over the last two weeks, officials said, had affected the progress of the project that was expected to be completed by the year-end. “Around 90-95% of the work on the project is complete, but we need around 30 to 40 days more to finish the remaining. Although there are no impediments in the project, the ban on construction, which has been in place for the past 10 or more days, is likely to delay the opening of the project,” a senior GMDA official said. The Rs 43.07-crore project includes a 705-metre-long unidirectional underpass for commuters travelling from Signature Towers towards Subhash Chowk and a 269.5-metre-long bidirectional flyover between Hussain Marg and a sector road connecting the Signature Towers. Additionally, two foot overbridges — one on the road towards Signature Towers and another on the road towards IFFCO Chowk — are being installed. “The flyover is complete and is ready for opening. The underpass is almost ready, we only have to put the finishing touches on it and repair the main carriageway of the service roads running alongside it. The foot overbridges, which are yet to be installed, can be set up after the other structures are opened. So, once the work on the underpass and the service roads are completed, we can launch the project,” the official said. A critical intersection in the city, the Huda City Centre junction is the point where traffic from the Mehrauli Gurugram Road and Netaji Subhash Marg meets. It is also the last station on the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) yellow line. Work on the infrastructure project, aimed at easing traffic congestion at the junction, had started in July 2019 with an initial deadline of 12 months. However, work has been repeatedly delayed due to complications in shifting of utilities, the Covid pandemic and repeated ban on construction over the last two years, officials said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/huda-city-centre-revamp-project-may-not-be-ready-by-end-of-year/articleshow/87968698.cms||Sakshi Dayal

In the meeting, the MCG chief engineer will review the work as claimed to be completed by developer DLF. Officials from the corporation said, DLF has claimed that most of the work related to roads, drainage and sewerage has been completed. The civic body had in October directed DLF to complete pending infrastructure work by December 31, after which the long-pending takeover of the three licensed colonies will begin from the first week of January next year. Following the slow pace of work, MCG had also directed the developer to speed up the pending work on the amenities as per the detailed project report (DPR) before takeover process starts. In the last meeting, DLF had sought more time and said the work, which includes recarpeting of roads and revamp of sewer lines, drainage, water supply, horticulture, community centres and other amenities, will be completed by March next year. But MCG officials didn’t agree to the March 2022 deadline. CM Manohar Lal Khattar, in a recent district grievances committee meeting, also directed the completion of pending infrastructure work in DLF areas by December end. It was said in the meeting that MCG will conduct a survey of deficient infrastructure in the colony, prepare an estimate of the funds required to complete pending works, if any, and submit it to the developer. The developer will then deposit funds as per the estimate and MCG will utilise that amount to complete the work. In 2017, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar announced the government’s decision to take over 11 private colonies in Gurugram — Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Mayfield Garden, Sushant Lok-2 and 3, Greenwood City, Rosewood City, Ardee City, Uppal Housing, DLF 4 and 5. Till date, however, the civic body has taken over only Suncity, South City-1 and 2, Palam Vihar and Sushant Lok-1, while the takeover process of DLF-1, 2 and 3 is still ongoing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/review-of-infra-work-in-dlf-colonies-today/articleshow/87968738.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh
---||Chennai||Time to fly high with Fintech||A large pool of talent at the intersection of finance and technology, an ecosystem of global financial service companies, a sound tech infrastructure, and strong work ethics could help Chennai and other Tamil Nadu cities emerge as fintech hubs. Last week, the government released a fintech policy and proposed to set up a fintech city and a fintech governing council. While this is encouraging, industry observers say the state has to open up in terms of lifestyle offerings while continuing to work on its traditional strengths. The fintech sector stands on three legs: financial services, technology and entrepreneurs. While the first two are well entrenched in the state that houses 250 of the world’s top 500 financial institutions, the entrepreneurial leg needs support. A McKinsey report pegs the fintech opportunity for India at $335 billion between now and 2030. If the state plays its cards well, it could be a winner. “The base is ready, only the structure needs to be built, and that’s where the new policy and industry support matter,” a CEO of a financial services entity said. Industry trackers say to match Mumbai and Bengaluru, Chennai has to work on its social infrastructure, entrepreneurship culture and risk-taking traits of the youth. Fintech startup CredAvenue, which uses tech to connect enterprises with lenders and investors, is built out of Chennai with a team of 450 people. Its founder Gaurav Kumar moved to Chennai 15 years ago to turn entrepreneur with IFMR Capital, now called Northern Arc Capital. “Tech, financial talent and work ethics made me pick Chennai,” says CredAvenue founder Gaurav Kumar. “Given Chennai services more than 250 of the top 500 financial institutions across 50 countries, it can create highvalue jobs at scale,” says Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, pro vice-chancellor, Krea University and former president of MCCI. PayPal, perhaps the earliest example of a fintech innovation, set up its first technology centre in Chennai in 2005. Today, PayPal’s Chennai centre houses engineers, product managers, data scientists who provide solutions to customers worldwide. “The availability of skilled technology talent is critical to PayPal’s future in a fast-changing global payments ecosystem. This was a key factor that prompted us to set up our Chennai centre,” says V Chandramouliswaran, senior director, Global Financial Crimes and Customer Protection & Chennai Centre Head at PayPal. Another early mover is India’s first payments technology player FSS, launched by entrepreneur Nagaraj V Mylandla. The availability of high-quality infrastructure, technology, education and talent attracted FSS, says Jaishankar AL, CEO, FSS Paytech. Chennai is known for going about its business without making much noise, and that has been an advantage and a disadvantage. “The city’s conservative approach is its strength in building profitable fintech enterprises. We should build on this strength,” says Arun Jain, chairman of Intellect Design Arena, and founder, Polaris. Jain is a key driver of FinBlue that gives mentoring, technology support and funding for fintech startups. FinBlue is working to set up a sandbox and is progressing on global tie-ups with developed fintech ecosystems like Singapore, says Jain. Ramakrishnan K, senior MD, Spark Capital says Chennai’s strength has always been its old world solid profit-making businesses compared to Bengaluru, which is more a new-age wealth city. “We live in times of instant gratification and a soft layer of enablement to encourage the startup culture among youth is perhaps missing in Chennai,” he says. Jaishankar feels Chennai should globally showcase its entrepreneurs better. Many others say the city has to open up on the softer aspects. Global fintech hubs of London and Singapore had mushroomed around cafes and bars. This is where Chennai lacks in social infrastructure and cosmopolitan culture essential for community building. “A culture appealing to the youth is a reason why Hyderabad and Bengaluru have overtaken Chennai in attracting startups and global capability centres even without any native finance talent,” says an industry representative.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/time-to-fly-high-with-fintech/articleshow/87970930.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

According to police, a group of men attacked the shopkeeper with iron rods on Friday night after he was unable to give ‘protection money’ to them. The victim has suffered a fracture in his left leg. While the accused has been identified as, Sitam alias Satish, from Wazirabad. “The main accused who was behind the attack has been arrested. We have learnt that the group of men who attacked the shopkeeper were enticed by him,” said a police officer. The victim, identified as Jeetu Singh Rajput, has a furniture shop in Banjara Market which he has been functional for the last 15 years. The episode has also brought to the fore the issue of “extortion”. According to the wife of Rajput, Asha Rani, the locals have been harassing them regularly asking for ‘protection money’. “These men take Rs 6,000 a month from each shopkeeper. If we fail to pay the amount, they issue threats and hurl abuses at us. This time, we didn’t have money and they abused us for that and started beating my husband,” she told police. Shopkeepers on the condition of anonymity said that they have been regularly threatened and harassed by the locals. “Most months are lean when we don’t make enough money to even run our households but we get threatened by the locals and they take whatever we have. Everyone knows this but nobody says it in the open fearing for their lives,” said a shopkeeper, who requested anonymity. An FIR against 15 persons has been registered under sections 147 (riot), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (assault), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 506 (threatening for life) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 53 police station. “The main accused has been arrested and we are investigating the role of other men in the case,” saida police officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/denied-money-goons-attack-shopkeeper-at-banjara-market/articleshow/87968739.cms||Sagrika Kissu

---||Chennai||Narayanan Kamakodi: Dad opposed my idea of going to the US to study||Narayanan Kamakodi has been an obedient son, a modern-day Casabianca. Be it choosing his higher education or abandoning the BPO venture with his brother or joining City Union Bank, Kamakodi has followed the advice of his father V Narayanan, who was CUB chairman. “I am probably the last man of my generation who never questioned his dad,” says the CEO and managing director of CUB. Born in Thippirajapuram near Kumbakonam, Kamakodi is the younger of the two siblings who went to a panchayat union school and later to a town higher secondary school in Kumbakonam which produced the mathematical wizard Ramanujan. “I wasn’t bad with numbers,” he says, recalling his early school days and the Tamil lessons he learned. He later joined Annamalai University and moved to REC Trichy in the second year to complete his graduation in chemical engineering in 1995. “It was a proud moment when I got a campus placement offer from Reliance Industries as planning engineer for their PTA plant in Surat,” he says. After three years with Reliance, Kamakodi decided to get some management education. “Dad opposed my idea of going to the US to study. Dad told me the west would spoil me with their way of life. He said if I still go to the US, it must be to the White House,” says the 47-year-old. So, even after scoring high in GMAT, Kamakodi applied to three Asian universities, and got it in all the three. He chose a Chinese University in Hong Kong for an MBA. As destiny would have it, Kamakodi’s award winning business plan paper at the Chinese University took him to the US and earned him a dinner with former US president George H W Bush. “Here too I was true to Dad’s commandment,” he quips. Kamakodi joined his brother in a BPO business. “It was way ahead of its time and did not proceed as planned,” he says. And then came his dad’s order: “Come and join the bank, but on merit.” He applied and was called for an interview at CUB in 2003. “It was a gruelling interview by four directors and finally they selected me as DGM planning & HRD,” he said. The Board thought it had found a successor to N a r ay a n a n and also someone who would steer the bank with some new-age business ideas. The board was not amused when he made a presentation that the bank should not expand into consortium banking, instead it should dive into SME lending, its core strength. “To me that was a crucial decision. It did not meet the risk appetite of the bank,” he said. And other regional lenders who took the big plunge into consortium banking, including Karur headquartered Lakshmi Vilas Bank went belly up and had to be bailed out by Singapore’s DBS Bank. CUB’s journey wasn’t without ups and downs, but it never missed a dividend; it has remained profitable every year for the past 118 years. Kamakodi has quietly worked his charm with the bank’s investors. During the past decade, the bank’s branches proliferated from 222 to 700, profits rose from Rs 153 crore to Rs 476 crore, and its intrinsic value per share rose from Rs 20.64 to Rs 79.08. Kamakodi is now ready with the next big growth story. “We know that branch banking will drop, but will never become zero. So we have shrunk the size of the branches and tutored all our staff to get as personal as possible. Incremental business from here on should outsmart what we did in the past 15 years,” he says.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/narayanan-kamakodi-dad-opposed-my-idea-of-going-to-the-us-to-study/articleshow/87971012.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
