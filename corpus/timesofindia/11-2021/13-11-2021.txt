Speaking to reporters ahead of a BJP backed state-level ‘Vaishya Sammelan’, scheduled to be organised in Lucknow on November 14, he said that the country belonged to the followers of “Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi) and Patel (Vallabh Bhai Patel)”. He was reacting to Akhilesh’s recent remark comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel. Agarwal has been keeping a low profile since 2018 when he joined the BJP after being denied a ticket to Rajya Sabha by the SP. Cine star turned politician Jaya Bachchan was chosen over Agarwal by the SP leadership, a move that left the former RS MP and seven-time MLA from Hardoi riled. Agarwal’s jibe at Akhilesh marked his aggressive emergence from a relatively dormant political stage to woo the ‘Vaishya’ (trader) community in favour of the BJP ahead of the UP assembly elections. His son, Nitin Agarwal, who now represents Hardoi constituency, was recently propped by the BJP as a candidate for the post of deputy speaker in the UP assembly, a move which was seen as the saffron party’s attempt to bewilder the opposition ranks, mainly the SP, which had fielded its senior lawmaker Narendra Singh Verma, a Kurmi. The BJP has traditionally been banking on the votes of the upper caste, including Vaishya (trader community). Agarwal said that the BJP has been organising conventions for various communities. “The Vaishya sammelan is also part of the BJP campaign,” he said. He claimed that no political party will be able to stand against the BJP which will have the full support of the Vaishya community and win more than 300 seats. Earlier this week on November 7, Agarwal had made a scathing attack on the opposition parties in Hardoi, saying that those who did not believe in Lord Rama and considered Jinnah as their leader have been taught to go to temples. In an apparent reference to BSP, Agarwal had said that those who used to say that toilets should be built in Ayodhya have now started remembering the Ram temple. He had also pitched for a law to be made applicable to those who chant “Pakistan Zindabad”. “They have no right to live in this country,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/those-who-love-jinnah-should-go-to-pakistan-naresh-agarwal/articleshow/87674052.cms||Pravin Kumar
---||World||Afghan foreign minister rules out presence of anti-Pakistan elements on its soil||ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s interim foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, has ruled out the presence of anti-Pakistan elements in his country, saying that the reasons for the conflict that did exist had been eliminated. Muttaqi has been on a three-day visit to Pakistan. He was specially invited by Pakistan to attend the meeting of the Troika Plus, a group comprising Pakistan, China, Russia and the US, on Afghanistan. At a meeting on Thursday, the US, Chinese and Russian representatives gave a clear message to the Taliban government to uphold its international legal obligations, including universally accepted principles of international law and fundamental human rights. Speaking at a separate event in Islamabad on Friday, the Afghan envoy said the Taliban have cleared all areas of anti-state elements that posed threats to others. "We are trying our best and exerting efforts in terms of not allowing the territory of Afghanistan to be used against anyone. The people of this region have suffered a lot and we must no longer let this suffering continue," the minister said. On Pakistan’s talks with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Muttaki said that there have been some improvements. "We are hopeful of a positive outcome from the talks. The ceasefire has taken place between the TTP and the Pakistani government and we are hopeful that this process will be extended," he said. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has provided an opportunity for Pakistan to use its leverage on authorities in the war-ravaged country. One of the biggest challenges that Pakistan has been facing from across its western border was the presence of the Pakistani Taliban there. The TTP is a terrorist organisation formed by its first chief, Baitullah Mehsud, in 2007 after the merger of dozens of armed groups. The group’s aim is to replace Pakistan’s government with an Islamic system that was in place in Afghanistan from 1996 till 2001. It can be described as a Pakistani affiliate of the Afghan Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban had always fought on the side of their Afghan counterparts against Western forces and those of the former Afghanistan government. When the Afghan Taliban were driven out of Afghanistan in 2001, their Pakistani comrades had provided them shelter in the tribal areas, including in their own homes. The Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network had started their spring offensives from their safe havens in Pakistan. Before the onset of spring, the Taliban used to cross into Afghanistan to carry out attacks on US-led Western and Afghan forces. After achieving their objectives, they would return to their bases in North Waziristan and other tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghan border. The first suicide bomber of the Haqqani Network to carry out an attack in Afghanistan was trained by Baitullah Mehsud, the TTP’s first chief. After the fall of Kabul on August 15, Anas Haqqani, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani Network, had visited the suicide bomber’s grave to pay tribute. The Afghan Taliban are believed to have not forgotten that support. Following the Taliban’s return to power, Islamabad’s first and foremost demand of them was to use their influence to stop the TTP from using their country for terrorist attacks against Pakistan. Pakistan had turned to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister in Afghanistan’s Taliban government and chief of the Haqqani Network, for help in starting talks with the Pakistani Taliban, a source familiar with Islamabad’s ongoing talks with the TTP said. The Haqqanis and the Afghan Taliban had subsequently facilitated the talks that culminated in a month-long ceasefire from November 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-foreign-minister-rules-out-presence-of-anti-pakistan-elements-on-its-soil/articleshow/87674218.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The terrorist killed in Srinagar was a relative of one of the accused in the February 2019 suicide attack in Pulwama's Lethpora, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel lost their lives, said inspector general, Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar. Kumar added that this year so far, 133 terrorists, including top commanders, had been killed. IG Kumar said the Gazwatul Hind terrorist Aamir Riyaz, from Khrew in Pulwama, had planned a suicide attack at the Bemina police station in Srinagar but the alert security forces got information of this and killed him during an encounter. The encounter in Srinagar broke out on Thursday evening in the Hamdaniya Colony area of Bemina. An AK rifle, along with some ammunition, was seized from the site of the encounter after the slain terrorist's body was recovered. Meanwhile, police said a district commander of Hizbul Mujahideen was among the two terrorists killed in Kulgam’s Chawalgam. IG Kumar said that police, Army’s 9 RR and CRPF cordoned off the suspected spot and offered surrender to the hiding terrorists. “The terrorists refused to surrender and instead fired at the forces. In the ensuing gunfight, one unidentified terrorist was killed,” the officer said. “With the first light, the operation was resumed by the forces resulting in the killing of the second terrorist, while a search operation is on in the area," he said. Kumar said that they have identified slain HM terrorists as district commander of Hizb Shiraz Ahmad alias Shiraz Molvi and Yawar Ahmad Bhat. The IG said that according to police records, both the slain terrorists were part of groups involved in several terror attacks. “Shiraz Molvi was an A++ categorized terrorist and was active since year 2016 figuring among the list of most wanted terrorists,” he said, adding that “he was also involved in recruiting innocent youth into terror ranks and in spreading a reign of terror by killing civilians as well as political workers in Devsar and Brazloo areas of Kulgam. There are 15 FIRs registered against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorist-killed-in-srinagar-was-assigned-to-carry-out-suicide-attack-jk-police/articleshow/87674288.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The PM will take part in a major programme at Bhopal to mark the occasion, where more than two lakh tribals are expected to join. He will also virtually launch the Birsa Munda Freedom Fighter Museum in Ranchi. On Monday, the PM will first pay floral tributes at Birsa Munda’s statue at Parliament House and then virtually inaugurate the Birsa Munda museum before leaving for Bhopal. The tribal affairs ministry has sanctioned 10 tribal freedom fighters' museums which are to be set up in different parts of the country. Besides highlighting the life story of Birsa Munda, the museum in Ranchi also has statues of 13 tribal freedom fighters, and it will have a light and sound show for visitors. The Union Cabinet earlier this week decided to observe November 15 as a day dedicated to the tribal freedom fighters as India gets ready to celebrate 75 years of independence. Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda said a large number of national and state-level programmes will be held all through the week till November 22 to build awareness about the role of tribal freedom fighters. “It will be for the first time that programmes will be organised on a large scale to pay tributes to tribal freedom fighters who have been unsung heroes of freedom struggle till now,” Munda said. The minister said more than 85 tribal movements of pre-Independence and over 200 tribal leaders have been identified and their contributions are being compiled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-to-launch-janjatiya-gaurav-diwas-celebrations-on-monday-to-mark-birsa-mundas-birth-anniversary/articleshow/87674933.cms||Ambika Pandit

Well, that may not be the end of your woes, as you could be the target of a phishing attack next! In a recent Twitter thread, Delhi resident and social media strategist Vedant Khanduja reveals that he didn’t just have his iPhone stolen, but his login credentials too – despite taking all the necessary post-theft precautions, such as getting his SIM card blocked and contacting the police. What made him – and others with stolen iPhone users – vulnerable is a trick used by scammers to steal login ID. Read on to find out how your panic and desperation to get back your phone can be used against you to access your login credential and other critical data. HOW A DELHI RESIDENT WITH A STOLEN iPHONE WAS TRICKED INTO SHARING HIS APPLE IDIn a Twitter thread, Vedant detailed how his iPhone 12 was snatched by two men on a scooty in a crowded area in Vikaspuri, following which he reported the incident to the police and got an FIR registered and blocked his number. He also put his stolen phone in ‘lost’ mode through the Find my iPhone feature, which ensures that others can’t access or reset the device and a notification will be sent to the original owner if the device uses a Wi-Fi connection. He then received a text saying his phone had been located, and was temporarily switched on. It provided a link he could click on to see the phone’s current location. “I clicked on the link. It prompted me to sign into my iCloud. When I signed in, it showed me a location so I immediately went to the police station and I told them the location.” The police informed him that since the IMEI tracker had been on, they would have received a notification too if the phone had been on. That’s when Vedant checked the link again and realised it wasn’t genuine and that he had fallen victim to a phishing scam. “I realised that when I logged in, a (pre-recorded) video was shown to me and it was not a real location. I then got an email notification that someone accessed my Apple ID from a Windows desktop. I couldn’t recognise the device. I immediately changed my password and removed the Windows desktop from my Apple ID, but it was too late, as my stolen iPhone was already removed from my ID and its ‘Find my’ feature was also switched off,” wrote Vedant. The incident isn’t an isolated one, says Vedant, adding that he received messages from several victims of similar scams after he posted the thread on social media.

---||Delhi||Delhi turns gasp chamber on season’s worst air day||NEW DELHI: The “air emergency” in Delhi-NCR took a more serious turn on Friday as a smog of toxic chemicals thickened sending air quality to its worst level this season. Delhi’s Air Quality Index touched 471 on a scale of 500, higher than 462 reported a day after Diwali. As Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have been over 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 17 and 19 hours, respectively, states have been told to be prepared to implement “emergency” measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), including a ban on constructions, odd-even traffic scheme and closure of schools. Officials said no major change in AQI is expected for four-five days. Pollution is becoming a health crisis with hospitals saying patients are being rushed to the emergency with complaints of chest congestion, bouts of cough and difficulty breathing. Read AlsoAQI touches 'severe mark', Delhi in a haze as relief disappears into thick airAfter a blink-of-an-eye respite on Monday, the city’s air degraded once again to fall in the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reading 404. Weather officials said the air pollution level was likely to fluctuate in this manner between the higher end of ‘very poor’ categoryFriday was the sixth “severe” air day reported in the last eight days. Experts said pollutants have accumulated due to calm wind conditions, high moisture, low mixing layer height and low temperature. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 rose from 26% on Thursday to 35% on Friday. When air quality remains above 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 48 hours, “emergency” measures of GRAP are implemented in the region. As per CPCB data, Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 concentration was at 557.4 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm on Friday while PM2.5 was 373.1 micrograms per cubic metre during the same time. The safe limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. #Delhi airport witnessed low visibility earlier today. (ANI) https://t.co/rIEE8XIIo4— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1636698639000R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Delhi has reported moderate smog conditions through the day with poor visibility at the range of 300-800m. For the first time in this season, poor visibility conditions, especially during the afternoon, were recorded due to smog cover across Delhi-NCR throughout the day.” The visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, ranged from 300-500 metres, while Palam recorded the visibility of 500-800 metres. In comparison, the visibility was better on Thursday afternoon at 800-1200m. “The main reason behind worsening of air quality and smog cover is calm or light winds continuing to prevail through the day along with high humidity level,” said a met official. Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory said, “The back pressure from southeast has resulted in calm conditions in the northern region. The ventilation coefficient and mixing layer height are also low.” Experts said no relief is expected from toxic pollution levels in the next few days. V K Soni, head, environment and research centre, IMD, said, “The wind speed is likely to remain the same for the next few days, hampering the dispersal of pollutants. No significant change in air quality is predicted for the next four to five days.” A smoggy view of Red Fort as air quality worsens in the city, in New Delhi on Friday.

---||India||China biggest security threat, says General Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: China is the biggest security threat facing India, “much bigger” than Pakistan, and the country is prepared to deal with “any misadventure” on the “land borders or the high seas”, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat said. Asked whether China was “enemy number 1” for India at the Times Now summit on Thursday evening, General Rawat said there was “no doubt” about it. “The threat on the northern borders is much bigger,” he said. “We are well prepared for any misadventure... Should they carry out a Galwan-like incident again, they will get it (back) in the same coin as they got last time,” said Gen Rawat. The CDS was referring to the violent skirmishes between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 last year. On the 18-month-long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, he made it clear that India’s immediate priority is to ensure troop disengagement at the friction points with “sufficient separation and distance” to ensure no inadvertent incident takes place. While such disengagement has taken place in “almost all areas” including Pangong Tso-Kailash Range region, some places like the strategically-located Depsang Plains and the CNN junction in Demchok are left. “Disengagement is likely and will happen. But de-escalation appears to be far-fetched because of the kind of infrastructure the Chinese have developed…it will take a long time,” he said. The Indian armed forces, on their part, remain well-prepared for forward deployment for the second consecutive winter in the high-altitude region, and will not pull back till China agrees to withdraw its troops to their pre-April 2020 positions. “We have already stocked up for the winter. We have adequate resources to combat the adversary if he indulges in any misadventure. We will not budge because we are concerned about China re-occupying the positions. If the Chinese are going to stay there permanently, so will we,” the CDS said. Noting that there is “mutual suspicion on both sides”, he added that India will not “let its guard down” because the People’s Liberation Army has better infrastructure on its side and could come back faster to forward locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-biggest-security-threat-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/87675595.cms||---

The Taliban claimed that they have already fulfilled all the demands mentioned at the India conference on Afghanistan, reported TOLO News. The demands made included ensuring Afghanistan did not export terrorism and there was unimpeded access for humanitarian support to people in the country. The Taliban’s claim that it had fulfilled the Delhi Declaration's concerns flies in the face of reports of deprivation and new restrictions in line with religious prescriptions. So far, barring Pakistan, most countries expect the Taliban to provide more evidence that the regime is prepared to be tolerant, inclusive and mindful of civilian distress. “The Islamic Emirate (Taliban) welcomes the India meeting. We are trying to take solid steps in governance, and countries should not be worried about Afghanistan soil being used against anyone,” deputy spokesman for the foreign ministry, Inamullah Samangani, was quoted as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/already-fulfilled-delhi-meet-demands-say-taliban/articleshow/87675637.cms||---

He believes he lost 10 years of his life in the past 18 months thanks to the stress that went hand-in-hand with the excitement of developing Covaxin. In a face-to-face interview, Ella opened up to TOI about the thrill of developing India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, but also spoke about the dangers and controversies that dogged the company throughout. “The past 18 months were tough. I have not battled so much for anything in the last 25 years (since he set up Bharat Biotech),” he says. “I feel as if I have lost 10 peaceful years in this battle.” He says that although Covaxin is not the first vaccine to have been developed by his company, it was certainly the first time that Bharat Biotech was under constant spotlight. “For Covaxin, we were working with a 1,000-litre fermenter with such a high density of live virus that this was enough to infect entire India. It was dangerous.” Pointing out that any death due to infection in the company, that too when there was no vaccine, would have been disastrous, he explains: “Today, we are vaccinated but then there was no vaccine. So, for about 4-5 months, some 20-25 of our critical employees could not go to their families. We took some apartments close to our plant (Genome Valley, Hyderabad) and put them up there till we had the animal challenge studies that indicated the vaccine offers 100% protection.” So how does he deal with the intense scrutiny? Ella says he switches off once he reaches home and does not pick up any calls. Instead he spends his time doing what he loves the most – reading up on the latest advancements in the world of science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lost-10-years-of-life-in-18-months-due-to-covaxin-stress-says-krishna-ella/articleshow/87675738.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two police personnel have been admitted to a hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, the local police said. The police have detained four people in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen — an ASP, an inspector and six constables — were injured. At least three vehicles were damaged in stone-pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said that a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG (Nashik Range) B G Shekhar Patil told TOI that the police had a tough time bringing the situation under control as the group kept throwing stones at policemen. “The police had to resort to a mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” Patil said. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters threw stones at a building with shops in the basement and a hospital on the first and second floors. Some windowpanes of the hospital were broken. Both the DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded SP Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to the tehsildar at around 3 pm, the gathering had started to disperse when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, injuring policemen. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, and unlawful assembly. The injured officers include ASP Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fractured leg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/police-shops-attacked-in-maharashtra-towns-during-protest-against-tripura-violence/articleshow/87675713.cms||Santosh Sonawane

They are too expensive, unaffordable and there’s uncertainty about the outcome. It is the civil society that can be subverted, divided and manipulated to hurt the interest of the nation. You are there to see that this land is fully protected,” Doval said. Doval, an alumni of the academy, was the chief guest at the ‘Dikshant Parade’ of the 2020 batch on Friday which saw 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees participating. “People are most important. The new frontier of war, which is called the fourth generation of warfare, is civil society,” he said. He also emphasised on the greater role of police in border management spanning over 15,000km covering Pakistan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. He said managing the 32 lakh square km of India was the responsibility of police forces. “But it will extend. You will be responsible for border management of this country. Most of the 15,000 km of border has got peculiar problems of its own,” he added. Doval said there were different types of security issues on each border. “There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations,” he added. Doval’s comments on greater policing comes a day after the Punjab assembly adopted a resolution against the Centre extending the jurisdiction of the BSF, which the Punjab assembly said was an insult.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/subverting-civil-society-is-new-frontier-of-war-nsa-ajit-doval/articleshow/87675717.cms||---

On Monday, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will meet state chief ministers and FMs to identify measures that may be required to get investment rolling. This will be followed by a meeting with bank chiefs on Tuesday to identify sector-wise problems. And, on Wednesday, the issues will be presented before Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he meets bank chiefs, in what is also seen as a signal to spur lending at a time when credit flow remains muted. “There is capital expenditure from the government side, and there is a positive sentiment from the private sector side, though perhaps not fully translated into actual investment on a big scale. Capital market activity indicates that a lot of investment is probably on the cards,” finance secretary TV Somanathan said. The top civil servant added that the government believed that it should capitalise on the positive sentiment to take the economy and investment to a higher growth trajectory. “It’s an opportunity, an opportunity that we should not let go,” he said. With demand, including in the services sector showing signs of bouncing back strongly, the government believes that the private sector is now in a position to invest. At the meeting with bankers, sectoral issues will be discussed as the Centre, along with the states, seeks to remove the bottlenecks and spur investment, which it hopes will translate into jobs. Somanathan said that at least seven states — Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Punjab, Rajasthan and Telangana — have so far taken advantage of the incentives announced by the Centre for enhanced capex during the first half. As an incentive, these states have been allowed to borrow an additional amount of Rs 16,691 crore from the markets. Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth said the discussion with the states will revolve around issues such as land, water, electricity availability and how policies can be eased for attracting investments. “While the investor sentiment is good, there is a need to capitalise on the momentum already created. The first four months of FY 2021-22 have already witnessed inflows of $64 billion foreign direct investment,” a statement said. The interaction will attempt to create a policy discourse and a facilitative environment for inward investment-led growth||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-looks-to-boost-private-investment-ease-bottlenecks/articleshow/87675897.cms||---

E Muniraju, from Chokkanahalli village in Bagalur, north Bengaluru, makes a living by grazing cattle and selling milk. After a few visits to the offices of his bank branch and the state commercial taxes department that administers GST, he realized that there had, indeed, been a huge transaction in his account and it was a fraud perpetrated on him by a family friend. Muniraju has filed a complaint with Bagalur police against family friend Zansi, a resident of Lingarajapuram who had taken copies of his PAN card, Aadhaar and bank account details on the pretext of getting him a ‘cow loan' from the government. According to police, the notice to Muniraju was issued by the additional commissioner of commercial tax (enforcement), department of commercial taxes, government of Karnataka. The cowherd told TOI that he and his wife wanted to buy a cow so that he could start a business. In April, Zansi, a friend of Muniraju's mother, assured him of getting ‘cow loan' from the government. Zansi is a vegetable vendor and her husband a businessman. "Zansi and my mother know each other for years. My mother sells vegetables in Lingarajapuram. Zansi asked me to hand over photocopies of my PAN and Aadhaar cards. Also, she asked for photocopies of my wife's PAN and Aadhaar. My wife and I have a joint account in a bank with its branch in Bagalur and gave her a photocopy of the passbook," he said. Some months later, Zansi told Muniraju that the loan work "is going on" and he will receive a one-time password (OTP) on his mobile and he should share the same with her. "Accordingly, the OTP came on August 20, and I shared it with Zansi. However, I did not get any loan from the government. Later, I called Zansi. She said my loan application has been rejected. On October 12, an official from the commercial tax department called me on my mobile saying there was a transaction of Rs 2 crore in my bank account towards which I had not paid any GST. Therefore, I'm supposed to pay a tax of Rs 40 lakh. I was shocked. I explained to the officer over phone that I'm a cowherd and earn a few thousands of rupees monthly. Also, I told him I was not aware of GST or any other kind of tax and I had not paid any tax in my life," Muniraju, who has a below-poverty-line ration card, said. Bank officials summoned Muniraju and showed him the notice sent by the commercial tax department to him through the bank. The officials, aware of Muniraju's financial status, asked him whether he had shared his bank account details with anyone. That's when Muniraju revealed the cow-loan story. As directed by officials, Muniraju visited the commercial tax department's office in Koramangala in October last week. "They took my statement that I have not carried transaction of Rs 2 crore in my account," he said. Later, Muniraju filed a complaint with Bagalur police, accusing Zansi, her husband and others of cheating him. A police officer said they will visit the GST office to collect documents on Monday. Cops said Zansi's mobile number is switched off. Cops have registered a case against Zansi and others under IPC for breach of trust, cheating, personation and dishonesty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-cowherd-with-2k-income-gets-gst-notice-for-2-crore-transaction/articleshow/87675935.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||KSRTC bans playing music on mobile speaker in buses||BENGALURU: Close on the heels of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) also banned passengers from playing music or watching movies on speaker mode on mobile phones in its buses. The state-run corporation also said that violators will be deboarded. On Friday, KSRTC issued a circular that complaints against passengers playing songs and watching news and movies and causing inconvenience to fellow passengers has increased. It urged drivers and conductors to create awareness among passengers. However, KSRTC has no data on number of such complaints. The order will also be implemented in other two corporations, including Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) and North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC). The move came after a Tumakuru-based advocate filed a PIL in the Karnataka high court seeking restrictions on playing loud music or videos on electronic gadgets in buses and trains. Petitioner L Ramesh Naik, 37, pointed out that playing loud music in buses severely inconveniences co-passengers. The court ordered notices to the commissioner of road safety and railway board earlier this year. However, the PIL was dismissed on Nov 9 for want of prosecution as the petitioner was not present in court. "The question raised in the petition is left open to be considered in some other appropriate case," a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi held.In 2019, BMTC had taken action against passengers playing on their mobile phones or iPods during commutes. However, many regular passengers complain there is no enforcement and many continue to play music without earphones/headsets. According to section 94 (V) of Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, if a passenger using a stage carriage bus, sings or plays any musical instrument or operate a transistor radio, then "the driver or the conductor may require such person to alight from the vehicle and may stop the vehicle or keep it stationary until such person has alighted. Such person shall not be entitled to a refund of any fare which he may have paid and any person failing to comply may be removed by the conductor or the driver, or any police officer on being requested by the driver or conductor or any passenger."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-bans-playing-music-on-mobile-speaker-in-buses/articleshow/87675940.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||K’taka: Pvt unaided schools to charge 85% of tuition fees||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Friday capped fees to be charged by private unaided schools for academic year 2020-21 at 85% of their tuition fees for 2019-20.No other fees like development fees, donation or charity to trusts or other facilities can be collected. The order is applicable to all school boards. In case a school has already collected the full fees, it's bound to return the excess fees or adjust it with fees of academic year 2021-22. In case parents have grievances, they can approach grievance redressal committees that will be headed by directors of the department in Bengaluru and principals of DIETs and senior education department officials in districts. On January 29, 2021, Suresh Kumar, then minister for primary and secondary education, had announced that private schools can collect only 70% of tuition fees. Other fees under the banner of development fee, donation to trusts, or other facilities like transport and extra curricular activities could not be collected. Private schools challenged the order in the high court. On September 16, the court disposed of the petitions in terms of the Supreme Court's decision in Indian School Jodhpur vs State of Rajasthan case on May 3. As a one-time measure, the Supreme Court had directed for providing deduction of 15% on fee amount in lieu of unutilised facilities by students during 2020-21.As per the high court order, the school management can collect annual school fees fixed for academic year 2019-20 (schools were not allowed to hike fees in 2020-21) after deducting 15% in lieu of unutilised facilities by students during 2020-21. The order states that schools are free to provide further concession over and above this 15% in tuition fees. At the same time, schools cannot debar a student from attending online or offline classes on account of non-payment fees and cannot withhold their results. Schools cannot withhold the name of candidate appearing for board exams too. In case of a request by a parent finding it difficult to pay fees, schools have to consider them on a case-by-case basis. The order mentions this will not affect collection of fees for academic year 2021-22."If a school collects Rs 70 as tuition fees, Rs 15 as term fees and Rs 15 as development fee, it can only collect 85% of Rs 70 as per the order. The fees to be collected would come to Rs 59.50," explained a department official.Parents' associations which had been fighting for fee reduction, are happy the case has come to a conclusion. "Private schools had gone to the highest court of the state. Since the verdict has come and the order is here, at least now they should implement it," said Ganesh Poojary, executive member, Karnataka State Parents Coordination Committee. "The high court has specifically said schools can collect annual fees after deducting 15%. However, the department has divided it into tuition fees and other fees. This is unacceptable and a contempt of the court order. We'll be forced to challenge it again in the court," D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-pvt-unaided-schools-to-charge-85-of-tuition-fees/articleshow/87675993.cms||---

Sources said Shettar is lobbying for a ticket for his younger brother Pradeep Shettar, who is eyeing a second term in the legislative council. The junior Shettar, who was elected MLC in 2015, is hoping to contest from Dharwad again in the December 10 council polls despite strong opposition as it violates the party’s policy against dynasty politics. Sources said BJP is looking to rejig its organisational structure in the state ahead of the 2023 assembly polls and Shettar was summoned to seek his opinion. Shettar, however, said he is in Delhi for personal work. “I had booked air tickets three days ago; my visit has nothing to do with politics,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/buzz-over-shettars-delhi-visit/articleshow/87675999.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Congress claims cops gave hacker Sriki ‘mind-altering drugs’||BENGALURU: Congress on Friday demanded a probe into the alleged bitcoin scam by a sitting Supreme Court judge, claiming police administered ‘mind-altering drugs’ to kingpin Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki in custody and tampered with evidence. The party said it will move the SC if the state government fails to order a probe. Priyank Kharge, a former minister and Congress MLA, shared some legal documents with the media to press various charges, which, however, could not be independently verified by TOI. Kharge said that on January 11, 2021, accused Sriki’s father, in his application before the court, had stated that police officers administered ‘mind-altering drugs’ to his son in police custody. “Sriki himself has told the magistrate that he used to take Alprazolam when in custody. If so, how did he get the drugs? Who gave them to him and why?” Kharge asked. At the time of investigation, Kharge alleged, Sriki’s wallet had 186 bitcoins, the current market value of which is around Rs 100 crore, while the accused in his sworn statement before cyber cell police had confessed that he had hacked around 5,000 bitcoins worth more than Rs 2,500 crore. “Where are these bitcoins now? How much of it has been recovered by police? The government must answer,” he said. Kharge also accused the state government of trying to hush up the case. “Police arrested Sriki in November 2020 and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) comes to know about it only on February 15. Why didn’t state police alert ED when they knew that Sriki hacked several websites and bitcoin exchanges and swindled crores of rupees,” he asked. Siddaramaiah questions PMOpposition leader in the legislative assembly Siddaramaiah questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for advising CM Bommai against worrying about the bitcoin allegations. Taking objections to Bommai’s statement made after his meeting with Modi on Thursday that he was asked to ignore the bitcoin charges and focus on development, Siddaramaiah said: “Instead of asking the CM to get the matter investigated, how could the PM ask him to ignore charges against him? Why is there so much hesitation towards a probe,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congress-claims-cops-gave-hacker-mind-altering-drugs/articleshow/87676001.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru saw most accidents caused by overspeeding last year: NCRB||BENGALURU: Bengaluru reported most overspeeding-related accidents among 89 major cities across the country last year, according to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2020 report released last week. While 2,993 accidents were caused by overspeeding in Bengaluru last year, the number was the lowest in recent years, mainly due to the pandemic, lockdown, travel restrictions and work-from-home arrangement. Such accidents have been decreasing over the past few years: 4,143 in 2019 and 4,289 in 2018. The 2,993 accidents resulted in 596 deaths and left 2,650 people injured. The Karnataka capital led the 89 cities on both counts: deaths and injuries. Ironically, Bengaluru is one of the most congested cities where the average vehicle speed is less than 10kmph during peak hours. Experts say most of these accidents are reported on major arterial roads during late night and early- morning hours when traffic movement and police presence on roads are less. Bengaluru was followed by Hyderabad, which saw 1,785 accidents due to overspeeding, Delhi (1,493), Thrissur (1,448), Ahmedabad (1,181), Chennai (1,126), Kollam (1,124) and Jabalpur (1,072). Thrissur and Kollam in Kerala and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh are tier-two cities. Across Karnataka, 27,059 accidents were reported due to overspeeding, which led to 7,809 fatalities and 31,190 injuries last year. “More than 60% of road accidents in the country can be attributed to overspeeding. In Bengaluru, most accidents are reported at traffic police limits in Yelahanka, KR Puram, Chikkajala and Electronics City. Airport road, Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Mysuru Road and NICE Road witness most accidents due to overspeeding,” said a senior traffic police official. However, the number of overspeeding cases booked by Bengaluru police came down from 61,531 in 2019 to 59,071 in 2020. Between January and September 2021, only 45,883 cases were booked. MN Srihari, traffic expert and former adviser to the government, said: “Most victims of these accidents are youngsters, especially two-wheeler riders. Most of them don’t wear quality and full-face helmets. There are several reasons, including negligence and driving under the influence of alcohol, for road accidents. In urban areas, the safe speed is 40kmph and most of these accidents happen when motorists tend to go above 80kmph.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-saw-most-accidents-caused-by-overspeeding-last-year-ncrb/articleshow/87676008.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

He was 75.Shyam West Wind for his friends and fans, the singer became an idol for music lovers in Bengaluru in the 1970s and 1980s when live bands ruled the music scene. His performance at Mandarin Room restaurant at Ashoka Hotel is nostalgic for many Bengalureans who spent their young days attending the band’s shows.“Shyam and his band held a superstar status in the city, especially in the late 1970s and 1980s. Those were the days of beautiful live music, much before DJs. West Wind was the best of the lot here. As a school kid, Shyam was my inspiration. Apart from being a talented musician, he was a wonderful human being as he always helped fellow musicians, especially budding talents, with their gigs,” reminisced Dominice D’Cruz, a guitarist who played with Shyam on many occasions.A sales executive with a fertiliser company in Kochi, Shyam relocated to Bengaluru in 1983 and began playing at East West Hotel (later Gateway and now Vivanta) on Residency Road before moving to Ashoka Hotel. “Shyam sang popular numbers of Elton John, Elvis Presley and other stars of the times. He was not only a talented singer but a versatile one too. He and his band performed when I was in Mount Carmel College in the early 1980s to a rousing reception from students. They were quite a sensation those days and indeed a household name,” said Bengalurean Shubha Chacko, executive director of Solidarity Foundation.Stanley Carvalho, author and Richards Town resident, said Shyam was the most popular western music vocalist of the 1980s and his band drew crowds with their performances in hotels and at other private events. “The band toured other parts of the country as well, including Jammu and Kashmir,” he added.Shyam remained active in the music scene in Bengaluru with his solo gigs till the pandemic struck.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: TikTok friend, nephew held for helping homemaker kill spouse||BENGALURU: Continuing investigation into the murder of real estate businessman Palar Swamy aka Swamy Raj in which his wife had surrendered, police on Thursday arrested two more persons, including the woman’s TikTok friend. According to Madanayakanahalli police, Raj’s wife Nethra, 37, surrendered before police past Saturday midnight, minutes after bludgeoning her husband to death at their house in Harokyatanahalli village, off Tumakuru Road. Nethra claimed Raj was harassing her sexually and hence she killed him. But investigation by police inspector BS Manjunath and his team revealed that Nethra took help from her TikTok friend Bharath, 32, of Bidarahalli, near KR Puram, and her nephew Vijay Kumar, 25, of Sunkadakatte, to eliminate Raj. Probe revealed Nethra came in contact with Bharath, who was in the business of pet animals, on TikTok. The duo became friends and later developed a relationship. Raj came to know about their affair and warned her several times; he also asked her not to meet him. But the two allegedly continued to meet. Nethra planned to kill Raj late Saturday night and summoned Bharath and Kumar to her home. She asked them to wait outside and alert her if anyone came. She took an iron object and bludgeoned Raj to death. Nethra reportedly gave Bharath and Kumar some money before rushing to the police station to surrender. Police came to know about the two other suspects while checking Nethra’s call details. “We have produced all three before the court, which remanded them in judicial custody,” a police officer said. Raj’s father Basavaraju M lodged a complaint with police, alleging that Nethra wanted to grab all the property earned by him and his son. According to him, Raj married TR Satyakumari 25 years ago and they had two children, including a daughter. Later he got acquainted with Nethra, a beautician, and married her six years ago. The incident came to light around 11.30pm, when Basavaraj came to Raj’s house after the latter did not respond to calls. “I rushed to his home and found him lying in a pool of blood. He had severe head injuries. Nethra was holding an iron rod and fled as soon as I entered the house,” Basavaraju stated in his complaint. Satyakumari too alleged Nethra murdered Raj to take possession of his property. Raj had developed a layout on two acres of land belonging to Nagesh in Harokyatanahalli. Later, he returned the property to Nagesh, keeping six sites with him. Three years ago, Raj built a posh house on these sites and lived there with Nethra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tiktok-friend-nephew-held-forhelping-homemaker-kill-spouse/articleshow/87676010.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The exam was to commence on November 15.Justice Ashok S Kinagi passed the order after hearing a batch of petitions filed by Rishab Trakraroo and others.The judge noted that the government had issued a circular on July 23 clearly dispensing with the exam for second and fourth semesters in three-year degree courses.“The directions issued by the state government are binding on KSLU, as per sections 9 and 10 of Karnataka State Law University Act, 2009. They clearly mandate government control over the university and confer power on the government to annul KSLU orders. The university circular is contrary to sections 9 and 10,” the judge noted. He added that during the pendency of litigation, KSLU had issued a timetable for the exams of three-year and five-year law degree courses. The students claimed when the UGC directive issued in the wake of the pandemic was clear that students of intermediary semesters should be promoted on betterment and exams have to be held only for final-year candidates, KSLU had issued a circular on September 17 mandating exams. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/intermediate-sem-llb-exam-stayed/articleshow/87676011.cms||---

The wily pacer made his ODI debut against England in which he picked up four wickets in India’s 66-run victory. The 25-year-old took a giant step on Friday towards earning a Test cap when he was named in the India’s squad for the home series against New Zealand later this month.Prasidh has been on the Indian Test squad radar since being added to the team ahead of the fourth Test against England at The Oval in London in September after being a standby. He had travelled and was training with the team during the tour of England. Also, he has been a standby player since the World Test Championship final. Prasidh, who made his first-class debut for Karnataka in 2015 is excited about being a part of the squad.Speaking to TOI on Friday before leaving the Karnataka team in New Delhi, Prasidh said, “I’m very grateful for the opportunity because it gives me another chance to rub shoulders with the greats, learn from them and add to my skillset.”Prasidh believes the time spent with the team in England has helped him evolve into a better player. “The tour helped me a lot because bowling in England required different work ethics and it was a good platform to learn. I believe that tour gave me a lot of confidence and also helped me evaluate at what level I was and set the vision for how I want my career to pan out in the future.”The time in England also helped Prasidh work on his shortcomings. “It helped me polish my skills and work on my consistency. To play at that level, we require an X factor and I worked on it. It also taught me how to handle pressure," he added. With Indian batting stalwart Rahul Dravid taking over the coaching reins from Ravi Shastri, Prasidh believes he is in for another learning experience. “I’ve interacted extensively with Rahul sir during my time with the India ‘A’ squad and at the National Cricket academy. He is somebody who is always calm and pressure never shows on him. These are among the many aspects of the game we get to learn from him. So, I’m looking forward to this crucial learning curve in my career,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/england-tour-helped-me-evolve-as-a-player-prasidh/articleshow/87676014.cms||Manuja Veerappa
---||India||Boost for small investors: PM Modi unveils scheme on government bonds||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday underlined the need for ease of investment, trust in the system and convenience for the common man along with financial inclusion and ease of access as he unveiled a scheme that allows retail investors to buy government bonds from a dedicated RBI platform. PM Modi, who also launched an integrated ombudsman scheme, underlined the need for a strong banking system, while listing out several initiatives by the government and Reserve Bank of India, including a clean-up of the books of banks. “With the RBI Retail Direct Scheme, small investors now have a medium through which they can safely invest in government securities. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme has led to the ‘One Nation, One Ombudsman’ system taking shape in the country,” he said, adding that the investment will also help the government undertake development work. The PM complimented RBI and the finance ministry for steps taken and said reforms initiated in recent years have resulted in greater inclusion. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a coordinated effort by the finance ministry and RBI has led to a recovery post Covid-19. She said the Retail Direct Scheme will facilitate retail participation, deepen the bond market and allow for a fair market determined rates for all the across the yield curve. “The retail participation has been hesitant all these years, because of the cost involved and because of the traditional intermediary system which has prevailed. Now this will probably bring in a direct cost free, convenience driven, and also build confidence in the retail participation in the government securities,” she said. Modi said that financial services – from banking to pension and insurance -- used to be like an exclusive club in India till six-seven years ago, but are now accessible to common citizens, poor families, farmers, small traders-businessmen, women, Dalits, deprived and backward. “Those who had the responsibility of taking these facilities to the poor never paid any attention to it. Rather, various excuses were made for not changing. It was said that there is no bank branch, no staff, no internet, no awareness, no idea what the arguments were,” he said while criticising the earlier government. Soon after taking charge, the Modi government had launched the Jan Dhan scheme which was followed by group health and life insurance schemes. Besides, he said, last mile financial inclusion was possible due to digital empowerment. While pointing to the spread of UPI, the PM said digital transactions have shot up 19 times in seven years. “Today, 24 hours, seven days and 12 months, our banking system is operational in the country. We have seen its benefits during Covid times.” He called upon policymakers to strengthen trust and confidence of investors in the financial market. “We have to keep the needs of the citizens of the country at the centre and keep on strengthening the trust of the investors. I am confident that RBI will continue to strengthen India's new identity as a sensitive and investor-friendly destination,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boost-for-small-investors-pm-modi-unveils-scheme-on-government-bonds/articleshow/87675997.cms||---

According to the police, the incident took place when 45-year-old Mukesh Dhodi’s tempo was being pushed to the side of the road by other passengers when it developed some mechanical snag. Dhodi, a resident of Kandadu village operates DJ music system business and was also elected as a first time member of Umargam taluka panchayat. Along with his wife Kalpana (42), son Kapil and four other employees, Dhodi was returning in their mini truck at night from Vapi after a performance there. When the vehicle reached near Bhilad railway crossing, it broke down and then, Kapil and three other employees got down to push the vehicle on the road side. While Dhodi was steering the vehicle, his wife was seating beside him. Suddenly a container truck hit the tempo from behind. The tempo lost control and got pushed to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a private passenger bus coming from the opposite direction and going to Ahmedabad from Mumbai. In the collision, both Dodhi and his wife died on the spot along with an employee, Hiten Halpati.

Launched in 2019, Tata Q, with a manufacturing facility in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, is the number 2 player in India’s ready-to-eat market. On October 21, TOI had reported about the impending transaction. Previously, Tata Consumer had bought the packaged foods portfolio from another sister company Tata Chemicals, consolidating its play in the broader sector. The Tata Q deal marks Tata Consumer’s entry into the ready-to-eat segment, which is growing at a significant pace benefitting from demographic tailwinds such as urbanization, and high disposable income nuclear families looking for convenience food on the go. Last month, the Rs 11,600-crore Tata Consumer transferred the management rights of Tata Cha—a tea parlour chain—to a third sister company Indian Hotels. Indian Hotels, which runs Taj, has rebranded Tata Cha as Qmin as part of its larger play in food and beverages. It now plans to take over the entire operations of the tea café outlets on its books from Tata Consumer, said people in the know.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-consumer-to-buy-tata-q-from-group-co/articleshow/87674900.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Goa||Goa expert panel gives nod for offline classes for I-VIII||PANAJI: The committee on Covid has decided to recommend to the state government to reopen schools for classes I to VIII. The final call will now be taken by the state task force. Dr Shekhar Salkar, of the expert panel, said that paediatricians in the committee were overwhelmingly of the view that the situation is safe for younger children to return to school. He said that hybrid mode — with a combination of online and offline sessions — may be adopted and it may be left to the education department and the school managements to work out the modalities based on the ground situation. Salkar said that since physical classes have begun for Class IX to XII, no increase in positivity rate in children has been seen. “Today’s agenda was only one, on whether schools should start from Class I onwards. And the paediatricians, who were there, strongly felt that we should start. After discussing this, we have decided that we should recommend to the government that they should start classes from Class I onwards up to Class VIII. They should start by following proper Covid appropriate behaviour and the SOPs given by the education department,” Salkar told reporters. He said the overall positivity rate for the state is presently below 1%. “We have said hybrid mode. It is very important that it is left to the education department and the managements, how they can manage it. But from our side it is quite safe now considering this week the positivity rate is below 1%. So I think it is the right time to start,” Salkar said. State epidemiologist Utkarsh Betodkar has told the committee the average rate of Covid-19 infection for children at 10% has remained constant even after Classes IX-XII started, he said. Schools can open from Classes I to VIII even immediately, if the government so wishes, the expert committee member said. “Once central government gives clearance, we can go all out and give vaccination first to children who have co-morbid conditions like cancer, diabetes, obesity in the 12 to 18 age group. Our health director said we have got enough vaccine stock,” Salkar said. He said that children as well as parents are seen to be suffering ‘psychologically’ due to schools remaining shut for such a long period. “Psychologically children are suffering because they have not seen their friends. Parents are also suffering because they have to be at home to look after their children and with both the parents working it is difficult. In Bicholim, we had almost 40 primary school children whose parents were sending them to school saying that ‘you play with them or do whatever but take them in the school’,” Salkar said. He said that it will be a challenge for schools to work out the modalities to make all classes from I to XII operational. “The number of students will increase, but the number of classrooms will be the same. At present, only Class IX and X students were coming to school and the rest of the classes were empty. But now that Classes I to VIII will also start, how to do it will be a problem that will have to be solved by the education department and the managements,” Salkar said. Since physical sessions for Class IX to XII resumed, the admission of children in hospitals primarily for Covid has been nil, he said. “In fact cases are down since the time Classes IX to XII started. Most of the children who tested positive were those who had been brought for treatment for some other ailment. The admission for Covid itself is nil. Once classes resume for younger children and if there is some Covid infection in some school or cluster, we can advise the government based on the situation, maybe by shutting only that school. If the overall positivity in schools goes up then too we can guide the government in that regard,” Salkar said. The fact that nearly all sectors have opened up in the state and the positivity rate is still low means that Covid situation is under control in Goa, the doctor said. “Practically everything is open and with that also if the rate of positivity has come down that means Covid is under control. Not that we should be relaxed, we should follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour. We saw last year that despite the heavy rush in December-January, Covid cases did not increase, they increased in April, which means there was a mutation. So, we should wait, and if there are no mutations, we may escape a third wave. As of today, at least we feel there are no more mutations,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-expert-panel-gives-nod-for-offline-classes-for-i-viii/articleshow/87674922.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Mineral corporation report on leases likely by November-end||PANAJI: The Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) is likely to submit the mining leases inspection report by the end of the month, based on which the state government will take a decision on the number of leases to be put up for auction. MECL representatives have commenced site inspections of 77 leases to quantify the ore lying in these leases. Once this quantity is determined, the leases will be auctioned. The MECL will also determine if there is vegetation or habitation on the land. “We are likely to get the MECL report on mining leases by end-November,” a senior officer said. The state government has provided documents pertaining to these leases to MECL. Earlier, the government had signed a MoU with MECL to identify new iron ore mines in the state. Keeping in mind the delay in the resumption of mining, the state government recently formed a mining corporation to identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. The officer said that once MECL finalises the blocks to be auctioned, the leases will be transferred to the mining corporation, and thereafter, auctioned. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 leaseholders had applied for first renewal. Subsequently, 413 leaseholders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987 and 2007. In October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 in November 2013. Goa has large deposits of iron ore (1,456 million tonne) as well as significant occurrences of other major minerals like bauxite (55 million tonne) and manganese ore (34 million tonne).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mineral-corp-report-on-leases-likely-by-nov-end/articleshow/87675031.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Business||Rural markets growing faster than urban: Mondelez India||MUMBAI: Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez India has witnessed a double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2021, with urban markets rebounding and rural growing faster than urban for the company. Consumption trends driving growth for Mondelez in India include more people consuming premium chocolates, even in rural India. Mondelez International president (India) Deepak Iyer told TOI, the company has seen a double-digit CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in the last two years. During the third quarter, over 80,000 stores were added in India. Among categories, biscuits witnessed a mid-single-digit growth, while chocolates grew in double-digits. Given that rural India has witnessed huge tailwinds, Mondelez India has expanded its reach to almost 1 lakh villages, said Iyer. “This year, urban has rebounded very strongly for us, while rural is growing at 1.5 times urban because we believe there’s a lot of headroom for growth given the difference in per capita consumption between urban and rural markets. We have noticed rural consumers are happy consuming chocolates at Rs 5 and Rs 10 price points but they are also asking for ‘Silk’ (Cadbury Dairy Milk (CDM) Silk). In a digitally connected world with smartphones, rural consumers are aware of premium products.” CDM at price points of Rs 20 and Rs 40 are also very salient now, said Iyer, while adding that Silk is now a fast-moving SKU (stock keeping unit) for the company. “A small village store would have 50-75% of the SKUs that one finds in an urban store,” said Iyer. As to how the company is managing inflationary pressures along with maintaining price points, Iyer said, the company tries to maintain a balance between the three portfolios of affordable, mainstream and premium. The affordable portfolio is used to recruit new consumers and thus no pricing action is taken here. On the other hand, the premium portfolio is where pricing actions are taken. “The affordable portfolio will get us volume and new consumers. The premium portfolio will get us profit, while the mainstream portfolio will be somewhere in between,” said Iyer. On the kind of mega trends he sees for 2022 — whether they’ll peak or taper — Iyer said: “We may have to learn to coexist with Covid in 2022. It’s not going to be the old normal. It is going to be somewhere in between.“ On what kept the company going since the pandemic broke, Iyer credits it to the company’s employees and the workplace culture. “Even though the external situation in the country posed a lot of uncertainties for the industry, there’s one thing that kept our business chugging along in these testing times, and that’s our people. Our purpose of empowering people to snack right, our mission of leading the future of snacking is something which really energises our teams very well. Over the years, we have curated and nurtured a very enabling culture around mindsets and behaviours, which have really helped us come out stronger from every disruption that has come our way,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rural-mkts-growing-faster-than-urban-mondelez-india/articleshow/87674876.cms||Namrata Singh

Almost 60% of the patients visiting different hospitals are suffering from diseases caused by fluctuations in temperature, say doctors. According to health experts, change in weather brings out a spell of sickness. The weather itself does not make one sick, but the viruses do. Rhinovirus and coronavirus are the two main viruses that cause common cold, cough, and fever. They multiply rapidly during seasonal shifts, resulting in an increase in the number of people getting sick, they say. Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital claims that 50-60% of the OPD patients visiting the hospital are victims of seasonal change. Most of them complain of sore throat, stuffy nose, respiratory problems, and fever. He adds, “A human body performs its functions at a certain temperature. However, during a change in season, it is forced to readapt itself, making it highly susceptible to viruses and infections. People with lower immunity and prone to allergies are highly susceptible to these changes.” Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, the former president of Indian Medical Association (Bihar branch), says during the current seasonal change in the state, pulmonary diseases and dengue are on the rise. TB is also showing a rising trend this year and the number of Covid-19 cases has also shown a slightly upward trend during the last three to four days. He advises the people to protect themselves from cold and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour in order to stay medically fit and healthy. “Eating a well-balanced diet, getting plenty of sleep, and keeping stress under control can help one deal with seasonal sickness better.” Paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, points out that children are most vulnerable to seasonal changes. They must be protected from cold and kept away from others affected by viral diseases. He adds, “Hospitals and nursing homes of almost all the cities in the state have reported maximum number of children suffering from seasonal diseases this year. Only a month back, the situation had come to such a pass that sick children were lying on floors and two to three kids were occupying one bed in different hospitals. Most of them suffered from viral fever and diarrhoea.” Dr Shah further says children above six months must be administered a dose of influenza vaccine every year so that they stay protected against this virus during the change of season. Moreover, children also need to be protected against Covid-19 as they are yet to be vaccinated for the same. Dr Prabhakar Devaj, former chief medical officer of Patna University Central Dispensary, says, “Every time we observe a change in season, the count of allergens in the environment also goes up to nearly 200 viruses in the air. The shift in temperatures provides an apt condition for different groups of viruses to flourish, which then spread contagious diseases.” He suggests that with some minor precautions and lifestyle changes, it is possible to dodge seasonal sickness. “Practise good hygiene, exercise regularly, eat well, and take proper rest to avoid viral infection,” he urges people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/exercise-regularly-and-eat-well-suggest-doctors/articleshow/87673311.cms||B K Mishra

IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said respiratory exercise is the best way to strengthen lungs. “It may be done by yoga or even inculcating the fun of blowing balloons,” he said and added that pneumonia may be allergic, infective or atypical and affects lungs leading to problems in breathing and other symptoms in people of any age, though children are more susceptible to catch this disease. “About 400 of the 1800 Covid patients who died at the IGIMS had severe pneumonia,” Dr Mandal said. He, however, said yoga or breathing exercises can minimise its chances among the people. Dr Lokesh Tiwari, head of paediatrics department at the AIIMS-Patna, termed pneumonia as an ongoing health concern. Malnutrition, unhealthy lifestyle and weak immunity are the main factors leading to bacterial or viral pneumonia. “About 40% of the children admitted to paediatric ICU at the AIIMS-P suffer from pneumonia of varying severity,” he said. Though anti-pneumonia vaccines are available free of cost at government hospitals, many people fail to get their children vaccinated just because of lack of awareness. The best way to protect children from this disease is to encourage them for outdoor games or inculcate the practice of breathing exercise like 'pranayam' at home or schools, added Dr Tiwari. A child specialist of Mahavir Vatsalya hospital, Dr Vivek Kumar Pandey termed unsafe delivery and malnourishment as the main causes of pneumonia in the newborn and children. “It may prove fatal in case of children within one year of age if proper medication is not followed at the earliest,” he said. Unhealthy way of living and exposure to dirt and dust may trigger the disease. However, regular exercise can strengthen lungs, he added. Senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah from of Muzaffarpur said, “Pneumonia in India accounts for 20% of the deaths in children worldwide. It causes difficulty in breathing and limits oxygen intake. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses and is a contagious disease.” He said pneumonia symptoms include a cough, difficulty in breathing, fast breathing or wheezing. Infants may experience inability to feed or drink, unconsciousness or convulsions, or worse. Pneumonia is the largest infectious cause of death among children in the world. Shah said exclusive breastfeeding for six months, vitamin A and zinc supplementation and adequate nutrition are the best ways of prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/perform-breathing-exercise-yoga-to-keep-pneumonia-at-bay-doctors/articleshow/87673266.cms||VK Tripathi

And to address this issue, the state health department will hold a special counselling and vaccination drive on Saturday to club it with the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan (PMSMA). Gynaecologist at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Mukta Agarwal, said many of the pregnant women are not even aware that they can take the vaccine. “Nearly eight out of ten women visiting the OPD have not taken the vaccines and majority of them do not know that they can get themselves vaccinated. We then counsel such women at our hospital. All the vaccines given against Covid-19 are safe for pregnant women,” she said, adding that more awareness is needed in this regard. Dr Neelam, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said she had somewhat the same experience as at least 70% of the pregnant women who came for routine check-ups had not been vaccinated. “We counsel them to take the shot,” she said. As per the data available with the health department, there are 30 lakh pregnant women in the state. Though the exact figure of those who have not been vaccinated is not available, officials said the number was huge. State health society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parashar said to address this issue in particular, the department has planned to use nearly 600 session sites of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan (PMSMA) for counselling pregnant women, followed by their vaccination. One day of each month has been fixed for providing health facilities to pregnant women under PMSMA. They are given free antenatal check-up four times during their pregnancy along with counselling on nutrition. This has to be held on 9th of every month, but in case of festival or Sunday, it can be shifted to another day. This month, it is being held on Saturday. “When these women come for availing the health benefits under the PMSMA, they are also counselled regarding Covid-19 vaccine. People have to understand that two lives can be protected with this vaccination,” said Parashar while asking doctors, especially obstetricians and gynaecologist to counsel those who come for treatment. 1 from Vaishali tests Covid +ve: One new Covid-19 case was registered in the state on Friday against 11,43,87 samples tested.

Pahalwan has been nominated as the state president and Kameshwar Singh its general secretary. The former legislator, who was himself a wrestler before stepping into politics, said the sangh office-bearers would identify the old ‘akharas’ across the state and inspire youths to join the organisation, which will hold wrestling practice on a regular basis. The sangh has decided to organise a state-level wrestling championship at Motihari in East Champaran district and later a national event in Madhepura to be attended by some noted wrestlers of the country, he said. “Wrestling is not only good for health, but it also provides an opportunity to show one’s talent at the national level. We will urge the state government to provide jobs to young wrestlers on sports quota to promote the traditional sports,” he told this reporter over phone. He cited a few names like Yogeshwar Dutt, Sushil Kumar, Narsingh Pancham Yadav, Geeta Phogat and Sakshi Malik, who were offered jobs either by the state government or the central government, depending on their choice. “Our idea is to create at least one ‘akhara’ in every village so that youths who waste their time in gossips and other non-productive exercises, practice wrestling on a regular basis. It will be of great help in nation building,” the former minister said. He expressed concern over the sorry state of wrestling, which has been in practice since the Ramayana and the Mahabharata era. The Pahalwan said he would do whatever required to revive wrestling in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-dumraon-mla-to-promote-wrestling-in-bihar/articleshow/87673382.cms||Ramashankar

The video is believed to be a week old, but went viral on social media on Friday. Harij police have arrested at least 17 persons in connection with the incident including a few of the young woman’s family members and neighbours. In the video, the girl is seen sitting on the ground with her hands tied. A man brandishing a pair of scissors is seen chopping off her hair even as she pleads for mercy. Those tormenting the victim are members of her family and also neighbours. In another video of the same incident, some people are seen smearing her face with black ash before being paraded thus in the locality where she lives with her hands still tied. According to Patan district collector, Supreet Singh Gulati, the woman belongs to Vadi community. “The woman was tonsured, her face blackened and she was paraded in the locality where she lived. According to what I could gather, the woman who is engaged to be married to some other person from the community had eloped with her lover. The tonsuring, and blackening of her face was some sort of a purification ritual of the community,” Gulati told TOI. “This is against the law,” Gulati said, adding that a case is being filed and 17 persons have been arrested in connection with the incident. Patan superintendent of police Akshayraj Makwana said that age of the young woman could not be ascertained immediately. “We are trying to get documents with regard to ascertain her age. Based on her age accused will be booked accordingly,” he added. Sources said that the woman had eloped with the man last month and when she returned about a week ago, she was subjected by the community to the “purification ritual”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patan-girl-tonsured-shamed-for-eloping/articleshow/87674178.cms||---

Taking cognizance of the incident, the district education office issued a notice to the school. The stickers were shared in the WhatsApp group of Class I of the Hasteshwar School in the Limkheda taluka of Dahod district. They were allegedly forwarded from a parent’s phone. The act drew a lot of flak in the group and parents informed the school principal as well. The school principal, who was also a member of the group, deleted the stickers. Principal Suresh Jadav said that the stickers were such that anyone who opened them automatically shared them. He added that the parent from whose phone the stickers were being shared was contacted and summoned to the school. Jadav said that the parent claimed that he was out of station. “He said that he had left his phone at a shop to charge it when the stickers were shared,” said Jadav. He pointed out that the parent had claimed that the shopkeeper told him that the phone was used by some youths who had come to the shop. The school has been issued a notice by the district education office. It has been asked to reply to the notice within two days. Jadav said that the WhatsApp group was formed to facilitate online learning for students. “We will now register a complaint so that the truth comes out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/obscenities-shared-on-school-group/articleshow/87674606.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Amid row, fresh order on aided institutions||VIJAYAWADA: Amid protests and controversy over the proposal to withdraw aid to and take over posts in aided educational institutions, the state government on Friday issued fresh orders giving clarity on the issue. The government has proposed another two options for existing aided educational institutions and left the decision to them. The government said the first option is to surrender the aided institution along with its assets and the existing staff to the government, which in turn would make the institution a government one. The second is to surrender the aided posts and the staff to the government while retaining the institution and its assets. This would make the institution a private unaided institution, the government said. The third option is to continue as an aided private institution “as per the existing rules, regulations, grant-in-aid code and other issues. The fourth and the last option is to withdraw the decision that an institution has already given to the government and continue as a private aided institution as per the existing rules and regulations. These two options were given through the GO issued on Friday, following widespread protests across the state from students and the institutions. These two options will give a chance to the institutions to withdraw the consent given earlier and remain as government aided private institutions or private unaided institutions. The state government said that 68.78 per cent of the 2,249 private aided educational institutions, which includes schools, junior and degree colleges and polytechnic colleges, have given their willingness to surrender their staff and the institutions along with assets or just surrender the aided posts and remain private unaided institutions. More than 6,600 aided staff, both teaching and non-teaching, have already reported to the government for absorption, the government said. The government further said that 702 aided institutions have preferred to be government aided private institutions. It asserted that this makes it “evident that there is no coercion on the institutions in any manner” and further added that “the entire process is voluntary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amid-row-fresh-order-on-aided-institutions/articleshow/87673581.cms||Gopi Dara

While more than 1,500 workers resumed services, 826 passengers travelled by ST buses on Friday, officials said. The MSRTC has suspended 2,053 workers so far and this figure could go up if there are more agitations near the depots, sources said. MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said that the corporation had accumulated losses mounting to Rs 12,000 crore, and during the total strike, it lost Rs 15 crore to Rs 20 crore daily. He appealed to workers to resume duties and not put lakhs of commuters to inconvenience. After the second wave of Covid 19, the MSRTC operates 12,500 buses and ferried 25 lakh-plus commuters daily, but due to the strike, bus services had come to a standstill. While talks with government failed, the impasse continued and strike is likely to continue during the weekend, sources said. Officials said they, however, expect more workers to resume duties by Monday morning, helping more buses to operate across Maharashtra. In Mumbai, four buses were operated till Pune and 78 passengers ferried while a bus was operated till Satara. A day earlier, transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab had assured police protection for all workers returning to work and stringent action against those who instruct them while performing their duties. On Friday, Parab said : “I have been meeting workers for the last many days. We have been asking the workers from the beginning to withdraw the strike.” He said, “BJP leaders like Gopichand Padalkar are provoking the workers. They can make whatever allegations they like against me but they should not cause harm to the workers. Ultimately, it is the workers who will suffer.” MNS chief Raj Thackeray met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to press for the demands of the striking workers. MNS leaders said they were hopeful of a resolution. From Friday, BEST also began bus services to cater to the MSRTC passengers. A BEST bus attached to Worli depot is being operated from Dadar and Panvel, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-some-of-msrtc-staff-back-to-work-36-buses-operate/articleshow/87674902.cms||Somit Sen

The deceased — Puja Chanda — had scribbled a suicide note on her left palm, alleging that her mother-in-law Sheela was responsible for her death. Police said Puja was married to Sanjoy Chandra, who owns a mobile shop in the Tollygunge area, barely a year ago. On Thursday around 7.50pm, Puja was found hanging in her bedroom. “Suicide notes are usually written by the deceased on a paper or readily accessible things such as notebooks, walls or mirrors. Though writing may be found on the body of the deceased, suicide notes in a structured manner written on the palm have not been reported in forensic literature,” said a forensic expert.  Sanjoy and Sheela were arrested. Cops reportedly have evidence the duo used to put pressure on Puja for more dowry. “A case has been registered under IPC section 304B against Sanjoy and Sheela,” said DC (south) Akash Magharia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-writes-suicide-note-on-palm-hangs-self/articleshow/87674449.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||To avoid contempt, government, Army say will give permanent commission to 11 women||NEW DELHI: The Centre and the Army on Friday agreed to grant permanent commission to 11 more female officers and also to consider such pleas of other officers with "an open heart and an open mind" after the Supreme Court started dictating an order for holding the Army guilty of contempt of court. At the outset of hearing, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the Centre and the defence ministry, told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna that an order has been passed to grant permanent commission to 39 out of 71 officers who were earlier denied but it cannot be granted to 11 officers who, along with others, filed a contempt petition in the SC against the Army chief. They submitted that there were adverse findings against them during the relevant period and if they were granted PC then it would lead to a flood of litigation as other officers, including their male counterparts, would seek the same relief. The bench, which is hearing the third round of litigation on PC for female officers, made it clear that it will go by its previous judgments where it had fixed criteria for granting PC. Referring to past adverse remarks against those officers, the bench raised questions on why they were denied permanent commission when they continue to serve the Army. "We are finding that the Army is guilty of contempt and we are going to pass the order. The Army may be supreme in its own authority but the constitutional court is supreme in its jurisdiction. We have given a long rope to you. But you are now in trouble," the bench said and started dictating the order. Sensing the mood of the bench, government lawyers immediately got in touch with the authority concerned, who sprang into action to ward off embarrassment of being held guilty for contempt and immediately communicated instructions to the lawyers. Jain then told the bench, which had by then dictated a couple of paragraphs of the order, that he had got instructions to tell the court that the remaining 11 officers would be granted PC within a week and the pleas of other similarly placed officers would also be considered and an order passed in three weeks. He said that the government has taken a decision by considering the "flow of hearing" in the case. The court then recorded Jain's statement that plea for permanent commission for all female officers will be decided as per the criteria enumerated by the SC in its judgment in March. The court had said that all female officers who have fulfilled the cutoff grade of 60% in the selection board held in September 2020 shall be entitled to PC, subject to their meeting the medical criteria and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The court then appreciated the efforts made by Sanjay Jain and R Balasubramanian in resolving the issue. There were 72 officers who were denied PC. One officer subsequently sought premature release from service. Thirty five officers moved a contempt petition in the SC against the Army chief; 21 of them were also granted PC and three were found to be medically unfit and the pleas of 11 petitioners were rejected. The bench also made it clear that PC will also be granted to those female officers who did not approach the court but are eligible as per its March judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-avoid-contempt-government-army-say-will-give-permanent-commission-to-11-women/articleshow/87676039.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Interestingly, those who were handed out IIT admit cards in 2020 will go past its gates for the first time not as freshmen, but now as sophomores after losing a year of campus life purely through force of circumstance. The Powai campus closed after the March 2020 lockdown announcement and will begin in the ensuing semester beginning January 2022 for second- and third-year undergraduate students. Students have to reach the campus in December. All full-time post-graduate students and PhD candidates beyond the first year have already come back to campus. The decision to fully open up was taken at a recent senate meeting where it was felt that damage expected from Covid-19 had certainly waned. First-year undergraduates, almost 1,300 of them, though, will not be called just yet till more hostel rooms are ready to house them to avoid overcrowding. Their campus journey will begin only when student housing pressure eases and an under-construction hostel will be up and available. Officials are hopeful the hostel would open by February which would allow freshmen to join the campus by March. “We have written to all second- and third-year students that we are happy to have them back in December. On their part, they have been eager to come back and we have received emails from many of them who are keen to know the exact return date,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, IIT-B. The electric campus life provides a rich backdrop to the overall IIT engineering path; students consider the memories they make at these residential tech colleges the biggest souvenir they take with them when they graduate. Final-year students were permitted to return to campus two months ago; many are back and others will return by December, well in time for lasses from January 3, 2021. They will follow soft quarantine rules of not going to the mess for meals nor the laboratories for the first week. The unvaccinated few will be quarantined before they can dissolve into campus life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-to-reopen-campus-to-2nd-3rd-year-undergrads-next-month/articleshow/87674145.cms||---

The education office in Pune had issued an order to adjust the remaining vacations in December as students had to report for the NAS survey on November 11 and 12. However, the headmasters’ association in the district and parents had demanded that the vacations be continued after the NAS survey. The education officer issued an order late on Thursday evening about the resumption of vacations from November 13 orders bowing down to the association demands. Secondary education officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, Sunanda Wakhare, issued a notification on Thursday that stated, “The decision to resume the vacations after the NAS survey was taken on Thursday. The five days of the remaining vacation will start from November 13 to 18, while on November 19 there is a public holiday on account of Gurunanak Jayanti whereas November 20 and 21 are the weekend so the schools would reopen directly on November 22.” The headmasters’ association in the district had strongly opposed the notification of cutting down the Diwali vacations and had conveyed to the education office that the schools would continue to follow the state government notifications and reopen schools only after November 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diwali-vacation-resumes-from-today-till-nov-22-in-pune-district/articleshow/87674098.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Varanasi||City to use municipal waste to produce electricity||Times News Network Varanasi: The holy city of Varanasi is all set to go for the green energy with NTPC support by installing a ‘Waste to Energy’ (WTE) plant to produce electricity by using municipal waste. Varanasi Nagar Nigam has allocated about 20 acres of land at Ramana for setting up the WTE plant. In an endeavour towards sustainable development, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC Ltd, has signed an agreement with Varanasi Nagar Nigam for setting up the WTE plant worth Rs 180 crore. The agreement was signed between NVVN authority and additional municipal commissioner of Varanasi Dushyant Kumar Maurya on Friday. The NTPC spokesperson said that the NVVN has placed the order for engineering procurement construction (EPC) contract work of the plant for a fast execution of the project. The plant will help in mitigating environmental hazards caused by solid waste and bring clean surroundings contributing towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Swachh Bharat. The plant will be a milestone for Varanasi towards Atmanirbhar Bharat using the latest indigenous Make in India technology for solid waste management in the country. The plant with a waste segregation capacity of 600- 800 ton per day will be installed under the project. Further, this waste will be processed and fed into the reactor to produce torrefied charcoal. The torrefied charcoal which is similar to natural coal can be successfully blended with fuel in thermal power plants to produce electricity. The process is environment friendly as the temperature is lower than other technologies, due to which there are no toxic emissions. Recently, NVVN signed a similar agreement with Bhopal Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/city-to-use-municipal-waste-to-produce-electricity/articleshow/87674927.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: IPL matches can’t result in denial of I-T registration to BCCI, holds tax tribunal||MUMBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has scored a sixer in the field of income-tax litigation as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, has held that its registration under section 12A/12AA of the I-T Act cannot be denied. An entity can claim tax exemption in a particular year (if eligible for claim) only if it has a valid registration. Based on recommendations of the Justice R M Lodha Committee, BCCI had amended its memorandum of association, rules and regulations. Thus, while it had an existing registration that was granted in 1996, post-modification of its objectives on August 21, 2018, it sought a fresh registration. The principal commissioner of I-T held that BCCI’s activities as per the amended MOA, read with its rules and regulations, facilitated conducting business for profit by commercial exploitation of cricket through franchisee ownership under the 20-20 IPL format. Keeping in view the surplus generated from IPL matches, she held that BCCI’s activities could not be held as ‘charitable’ and denied the registration. In its appeal before the ITAT, BCCI submitted that the principal commissioner had placed an undue reliance on the surplus generated from conducting IPL matches, without considering its overall activities in a holistic manner. While the denial of the registration was held as legally vitiated based on the technical analysis of the I-T provisions and past judicial precedent, the ancillary observations made by the ITAT bench composed of Pramod Kumar, vice president; and Ravish Sood, judicial member, would gladden the heart of any cricket-lover. The bench viewed that the basic character of the activity of popularising cricket is not lost merely because the operational model of a cricket tournament, whether IPL or any other tournament, is more entertaining or more economically viable. They also noted that the additional funds generated by holding the IPL tournaments are employed for promoting cricket. “Improvising the rules of the game, adding entertainment value to it and making it economically attractive may be a purist’s nightmare, but the same factors can also be viewed as radical and innovative ideas to popularise a game – the very raison détre of an institution like BCCI and this is how we view it.” The ITAT bench finely analysed the various provisions of the I-T Act. They pointed out that by itself, the registration does not grant any tax exemption. The eligibility is determined on a year-to-year basis based on the actual activities of the taxpayer-entity and the exception limits for income from commercial activities that have been carved out. It is not denial of registration, but denial of I-T benefits if income from commercial activities exceed the specific amount, which is the crux of the issue. On this ground, the bench held the denial of registration to BCCI as legally vitiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ipl-matches-cant-result-in-denial-of-i-t-registration-to-bcci-holds-tax-tribunal/articleshow/87674926.cms||Lubna Kably

---||Jaipur||Rise in cotton yarn prices impacts apparel industry||Jaipur: The steep rise in cotton yarn and fabric prices has started impacting the apparel industry. Apparel Exports Promotion Council chairman A Sakthivel, who was in Jaipur, said that the recent growth in apparel exports would be impaired if the runaway rise in yarn and cotton prices are not curbed. Early this month, he has written a letter to textiles minister Piyush Goyal to intervene and take measures to rein in the rise in raw material prices without which there could be shortages as early as February and March next year.“Apparel exports during the April-October have grown by 44% to $8.6 billion. In fact, the shipments have grown by double digit in the past two months. With the peak season approaching, India has the opportunity to leverage good global demand and order position and meet the $20.03 billion export target for 2021-22,” said Sakthivel. However, the uncertainties in the cotton yarn price has created hurdles. The industry is also facing increasing input cost pressure on other fronts. In the letter to the textiles minister, Sakthivel said, “The rise in cotton yarn and fabrics prices have started impacting the entire value chain. Adding to this is the volatile crude oil price, logistics cost, coal addition to the yarn prices, the rising crude oil prices, logistics cost, coal prices, prices of dyeing and chemicals etc which has impacted costing of apparels considerably. Because of this, exporters are not being able to service existing orders and finding it difficult to take new orders.” He urged the minister to consider quantitative restrictions on export of cotton and cotton yarn to bring down galloping prices. “Cotton Corporation of India should be actively involved in managing cotton prices. CCI should also be advised not to increase prices at present as it will impact yarn prices and have a cascading effect across value chain. As a long-term measure, cotton price stabilization fund scheme should be announced,” he said .Sakthivel, which is also the chairman of Apparel Training and Design Centre, said they are in the throes of upgrading the training centers. “Jaipur is one of the main hubs for garment exports. Accordingly, we have started the process of upgrading the centres here,” he said. ATDC is also focusing on upskilling existing employees for enhancing their productivity. Sakthivel said, “The new working committees are putting their best efforts to improve drastically the quality and productivity of the training centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rise-in-cotton-yarn-prices-impacts-apparel-industry/articleshow/87675491.cms||---

---||Goa||En route to Somalia, Amur falcon makes pit stop at Socorro plateau||PANAJI: A dreamy-looking Amur falcon — admired globally for its daring transcontinental migration — perched on a 33KV power line created a flutter at Socorro plateau on Friday, as its arrival is an eagerly-awaited event on Goan birders’ calendar. The small raptor from the falcon family spends just about ten days on some of Goa’s plateaus, but the birders’ happiness quotient soars after they spot the bird on its pit stop. “This individual made a grand entry, inaugurating the newly-replaced 33KV line, and it is a good omen,” said Kunal, secretary for power and environment, in a lighter vein. Savio Fonseca, chief naturalist of a travel company, said that “At Socorro, (the falcon) does a pit stop, gorging on the proteins provided by caterpillars on the grasses there before making an incredible non-stop flight of eight days over the ocean to Somalia”. The individual sighted at Socorro — the slight delay may be due to the extended rainy season — is one of the first to arrive in the state. Kunal, who is also state election commissioner, had gone bird watching with some birders on Friday morning. “Our power lines are favoured perching spots for the avian population, where they can rest or bask in the sun for birders to click excellent photos,” he said. This raptor breeds in parts of Siberia and China, as also near the sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. Its migration is stuff of legend, as it flies to India and over the Arabian Sea to spend the winter in south and east Africa. Unlike many other birds that fly long-distance for migration, Amur falcons traverse diagonally across the globe, instead of the usual north-south direction. This indicates that it apparently relies on wind direction and magnetic field for navigation. In India, they hop down on plateau areas, and in 2014, the massacre of 14,000 of these beautiful birds in Nagaland sparked outrage across the world. Now, certain areas have been turned into safe breeding grounds for these falcons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/en-route-to-somalia-amur-falcon-makes-pit-stop-at-socorro-plateau/articleshow/87674880.cms||Paul Fernandes

He said such a decision was taken as students have been asked to get the vaccine as well. When asked whether the salaries too would be affected, Samant said that the vice-chancellors have been asked to take a call about which benefits should be withheld. The VCs have been asked to serve notice and give the staff 15 days to respond. “If they do not respond, the VC will take a call. We may have to take that decision too. It is not that I have a personal benefit in the teachers getting vaccinated,” he said. Samant made the statement on Friday during his visit of Aurangabad. Speaking to the media, he said, “Vaccination has been made mandatory for all the teachers, professors, principals, or else all of their benefits will be stopped.” He added that while they were “asking all the students to get vaccinated and if the students question about the teachers not being vaccinated, we will not have any answer.” He even warned the teachers’ associations unwilling to get vaccinated. Samant said, “Certain teacher associations citing that they are imparting online education, are unwilling to get vaccinated. No one will be allowed to do it. All the professors, academic staff, non-teaching staff, principals will have to take both the doses.” 8,000 vacancies to be filledMinister for higher and technical education Uday Samant said they would be filling vacancies of 8,000 professors in another seven months. “The state has approved recruitment of professors and principals. In the first phase, 2,088 posts will be filled. Old pension scheme will be implemented for 5,000 professors,” said Samant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-vax-no-salary-for-varsity-staff-minister/articleshow/87672531.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Speaking at Aurangabad, Samant said: “Vaccination has been made mandatory for all teachers, professors, principals or else all of their benefits will be stopped.” He reasoned that after “asking all the students to get vaccinated, if they question about the teachers not being vaccinated, we will not have any answer”. Asked if salaries too would be affected, Samant said vice-chancellors have been asked to take a call. The VCs have been asked to serve notice and give the staff 15 days to respond. “If they do not, the VC will take a call. We may have to take that decision too,” he said. “Citing that they are imparting online education, some teacher associations are unwilling to get vaccinated. All professors, academic staff, non-teaching staff, principals have to take both the doses,” said Samant. After a Covid reviewing meeting in Nashik on Friday, Bhujbal said the district administration would monitor the pace of vaccination for the next 8-10 days. If it remains sluggish, those who have not taken even one shot would be denied food grains distributed through public distribution system (PDS) shops and LPG cylinders. Bhujbal’s instructions are similar to the one recently adopted by the Aurangabad collector. There are 51 lakh eligible residents in Nashik. “Around 16 lakh beneficiaries have not even taken the first dose. There is a need to improve the coverage,” he said, expressing concern over the low coverage in Malegaon. The attitude is spreading. The Kolhapur zilla parishad has asked all gram panchayats to read out the names of all unvaccinated villagers during the gram sabha scheduled for Tuesday. Several panchayats have decided to put names of such villagers on walls to name and shame them. “We have set a deadline of November 20 to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries,” said Sanjaysinha Chavan, the Kolhapur ZP CEO. So far, 85% of those eligible have got the first dose and 42% are fully vaccinated in the district. The gram panchayat of Pathurdi, a village of around 1,200 people in Solapur district, has decided not to supply ration to the families that have unvaccinated members. “Instead of forcing people, the authorities should try mass counselling by conducting workshops to do away with the fear about vaccination,” said Sanjay Ghatage, a vaccination activist.

---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: BJP sharpens attack on Congress, SP on Hindutva & Jinnah||VARANASI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday sharpened attack on the Congress on the issue of its senior leaders Salman Khurshid and Rashid Alvi allegedly deriding Hindutva and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and his alliance partner Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar for praising Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The BJP attack was launched by deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, who were in the city on Friday to take part in the BJP poll managers meeting for the 2022 UP election. “This is the real face of those who turn ‘bhakts’ (devout) and start visiting temples during elections.. they have now been exposed,” they said while talking to reporters. Maurya targetted Congress leader Salman Khurshid for reportedly comparing Hindutva with jihadist Islam and terror groups like Islamic State and Boko Haram in his recently released book. “The quotes in his (Khurshid’s) book have insulted the national Hindu organisations, hence they should be removed from his book. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, ‘janeu’ wearing Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who presents herself as a priest, have not uttered even a single word in this episode in the past three days. Their silence is not correct.” Reacting to Khurshid’s book and Alvi’s remarks, Sharma said, “Some seasonal ‘Rambhakts’ have emerged recently. One of them chanted ‘Ram naam’ after wearing a ‘Ramnaami’ (stole). But, now they have returned to their old tricks. Those who termed Ramsetu as imaginary, could never be the Rambhakts. By their statements, they have made it clear to whom they are loyal." Senior Congress leader Alvi had recently said that all those raising the slogan of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ are not saints, citing a demon from the Ramayana and urging people to stay alert. Maurya also took up the issue of Akhilesh bracketing Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel and Rajbhar claiming that the partition of India could have been avoided had Jinnah been made the first PM. “It is too late. Jinnah is buried and now he will not come to help them,” he said. Sharma said, “Their Jinnahism and Talibani approach is not going to work in state politics as days of appeasement with the help of this ideology are over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjp-sharpens-attack-on-cong-sp-on-hindutva-jinnah/articleshow/87674935.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Varanasi||Objective of rath yatra is to bring change in the UP govt: Shivpal Yadav||Gorakhpur: People are very upset in the Bharatiya Janata Party government as they are facing many problems, said the president of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohiya) Shivpal Yadav while addressing a press conference in Gorakhpur on Friday. Shivapla Yadav is carrying out a Samajik Parivartan Rath Yatra in Uttar Pradesh. He said that the objective of this ‘Rath Yatra’ is to bring change in the government in Uttar Pradesh as it has become necessary. “People are facing challenges of inflation and unemployment. All the sectors of society are upset with the present government including farmers and people in power are not listening to the voice of people. Farmers are being harassed and they will become labourers instead of masters and the BJP is continuously telling lies. The party and the government are losing people’s faith and they are not fulfilling the promises,” he said. On law and order situation in the state, Shivpal said that crime is at prime and cases of murders, loot and corruption have become common. “ BJP promised that it will end corruption in 100 days while the corruption has increased in the state,” he said. On inflation and power supply, he said, “Prices of petrol, diesel and basic amenities have increased and people are not able to manage their household budget. Gorakhpur gets 24-hour power supply as it is Yogi Adityanath’s district but other districts are not getting regular power supply.” He repeated that his party will have alliance with the Samajwadi Party with conditions and in case the alliance does not materialises, they will join hands with small parties and also a big national party but not with the BJP. “I told Akhilesh that my party wants alliance with the SP but we want tickets. I have worked with Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav for 40-45 years and my share in the SP can’t be denied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/objective-of-rath-yatra-is-to-bring-change-in-the-up-govt-shivpal-yadav/articleshow/87674944.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Inclusive Hinduism does not need divisive Hindutva: Rahul Gandhi||Nagpur/Wardha: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said Hinduism as Hindu religion was different from the Hindutva ideology practiced by the RSS, as he added that the latter was about killing innocent minorities. He urged the party workers to discuss and learn about these issues, which will help eclipse the hate that appears dominant in present times. The divisive policy of RSS and BJP has overshadowed that of the Congress, but has not finished it off, said Gandhi at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) orientation camp at Sewagram, which he addressed via video conference. Gandhi said through training every Congress worker must be empowered to propagate the all inclusive ideology of the grand old party. “They are able to overshadow us because of two things. One is our own failure to propagate the party’s ideology, and second is the complete control of BJP over media and the nation,” said Gandhi. He explained the Congress followed India’s cultural values of thousands of years, and Hinduism and Hindutva were very different, “Why do Hindus need Hindutva when they follow Hinduism ….Is Hinduism about beating a Sikh or a Muslim person? No. But Hindutva is. Is Hinduism about killing Akhlaq? I have read the Upanishads and nowhere is it written to kill an innocent man. But I can see it in Hindutva. Our orientation comes from Lord Shiva, Kabir, Guru Nanak to Mahatma Gandhi. We stand for what they stood for in their times,” he said. “It is a simple logic - if you are a Hindu, then why do you need Hindutva? Why do you need this new name?” he asked. Rahul said the RSS ideology has spread hate in the country and overshadowed the loving and nationalistic ideology of Congress. “The moment we crystallise our ideology, we will envelope the RSS. Just like Lord Shiva used to swallow the world, the Congress ideology will make the BJP’s ideology of hate disappear,” he said. He added that through training, every Congress worker can be made aware of the long history of Congress’ ideology, which has it roots in India’s origin. “Actually, we have started calling it Congress ideology, but it has been part of our culture for thousands of years. We do not differentiate between people based on their caste, religion etc. And it’s this ideology which became that of the Congress too,” said Gandhi. He said every Congress worker, senior leaders and ordinary workers alike, must undergo training to be empowered with information. “Congress workers should be completely aware of issues of national interest, safety and security like terrorism, Article 370, nationality. Only when they are aware, will they reach out to the people and explain the party’s stand on the issue to them. Training had become optional in the Congress, but I think that has to change,” said Gandhi. AICC’s training in-charge Sachin Rao said, “In our over 100 year history, Congress has shown the path of Swaraj and Sarvodaya. But today these two and the Constitution are under attack from forces of fascism that believe in the rise of only a few people. It’s also under attack from some narrow minded regional forces, which are trying to divide the politics of the country.” Sunil Kedar, guardian minister of Wardha, where the camp for some 140 participants is being organized, said, “We want an India where everyone must feel secure and safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/inclusive-hinduism-does-not-need-divisive-hindutva-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/87675505.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Another case of cheating lodged against Kiran Gosavi||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Thursday registered a case against Kiran Gosavi, the NCB witness in the cruise drug bust case involving Aryan Khan, after a 33-year-old Bhosari resident lodged a complaint accusing Gosavi of cheating him of Rs 2.25 lakh in 2015 over a promise to give him a job in Brunei. Assistant inspector Gokul Mahajan of the Bhosari police told TOI, “In 2015, the complainant had given a part of the total money to Gosavi at his office in Thane, some amount in Bhosari and the rest through online transfers. When he did not get the job, the complainant asked Gosavi to refund his money, which he never did. Recently, the complainant came across the news of Gosavi’s arrest for carrying out similar crimes. He then came to us on Thursday.” The Pune police have registered three cases against Gosavi with the Faraskhana, Cantonment and Wanowrie police stations. The first case of cheating was registered against him in Faraskhana in 2018. He was evading arrest since then. The police swung into action after a selfie of Gosavi with actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan during the cruise drug bust went viral on social media. He was arrested on October 29 and is still in judicial custody. Mahajan said that in 2015, the complainant had received an email from Gosavi’s office seeking his resume. “After the complainant sent across his resume, Gosavi promised him a job in Brunei. He took Rs 2.25 lakh from the complainant in cash and also through online modes and then duped him,” Mahajan said. “We will seek Gosavi’s custody from the court to probe into whether or not he has duped others too using the same modus,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/another-cheating-case-against-gosavi/articleshow/87674121.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In Mumbai, Delta & derivatives dominate, vaccination cuts hospitalisation need||MUMBAI: Delta and its descendants continued to be the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulating in Mumbai, according to the fourth gene sequencing exercise conducted since August. The results, announced by BMC on Friday, showed 75% of the tested samples contained the Delta variant and the remaining were Delta derivatives. Correlating the genomic results with clinical symptoms, BMC doctors said both Delta and its derivatives seemed only “mildly invasive”. “As compared to Delta, the derivative infection and transmissions seem milder,” said a doctor. Vaccination made a difference, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Of the 281 samples, only eight who took the first dose and 21 fully vaccinated people needed hospitalisation as against 69 unvaccinated. There were no deaths in the vaccinated group, and the unvaccinated had four deaths. “There are no new variants of concern in Mumbai or any Indian states. We now have to concentrate on achieving zero Covid deaths,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state Covid task force. The possibility of a third wave in the absence of a new variant of concern appears distant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-mumbai-city-delta-derivatives-dominate-vax-cuts-hosp-need/articleshow/87674968.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sikar girl drugs parents, runs away with Rs 70,000||JAIPUR: A 19-year-old girl decamped with Rs 70,000 from her Piproli Road-situated house under Udyog Nagar police station area of Sikar. Before leaving the house, the girl served sleeping pills-laced dinner to her parents who fell unconscious and were stunned to know about the incident later. According to police, the incident took place late on Wednesday, when the girl, identified as Anita Kumawat, served food to her parents. “It appears that the girl had planned to run away from the house as her parents fell unconscious after having dinner. Thereafter, the girl must have checked the safes in the house and took the money out. The incident came to light when the girl’s father woke up the next day and found various safes in the house open,” said a senior officer of Udyog Nagar police station on Friday. Heera Lal Kumawat, the father of the girl, initially attempted to find his missing daughter. “Initially, they had no idea about the missing money from their house as they kept enquiring about their missing daughter from their relatives. Finally, when they realised that the girl went missing along with the money, they lodged a case,” said the officer. Police said that the mobile phone of the girl is also switched off after the incident. “Prima facie, it appears that she single-handedly carried out the act. Still, we are probing other angles to find out if anybody else also helped the girl in the crime,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sikar-girl-drugs-parents-runs-away-with-rs-70k/articleshow/87675501.cms||---

---||India||Space diplomacy: Isro preparing to launch nano satellite for Bhutan||Bengaluru: As part of New Delhi’s space diplomacy, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is preparing to launch a nano satellite built by engineers from the neighbouring country with the help of Indian scientists in the second PSLV mission that’s in the pipeline. As reported by TOI earlier, Isro has in its pipeline three Earth Observations Satellites (EOSs): Two of them — EOS-4 (Risat-1A) and EOS-6 (Oceansat-3) — will be launched using Isro’s workhorse PSLV and the third one, EOS-2 (Microsat), will be launched in the first developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV). Confirmations are now available that the space agency is preparing to launch the satellite for Bhutan — BhutanSat — in the second PSLV mission that will have Oceansat-3 as the main payload. Other than these two satellites, the mission will also put into orbit India’s first private Earth Imaging satellite developed by Bengaluru-based Pixxel. Isro chairman K Sivan said: “This is India’s gift to Bhutan as part of the space diplomacy initiatives put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We’re helping their personnel to build the nano satellite which will be used for imaging purposes. It will be launched on the PSLV carrying EOS-6. The mission will also launch the Pixxel satellite.” Launch progressWhile Isro hopes to achieve the launch of all three EOS missions in the last quarter of 2021, multiple issues, including disruptions caused by weather, may impact the internal deadlines set by the agency. “The integration of the PSLV had begun at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC-SHAR) in Sriharikota but had to be suspended as some glitches were found with the satellite (Risat-1A). It will resume soon as the problem with the satellite will be resolved,” a senior scientist from Isro headquarters told TOI. Therefore, another scientist said, the launch of BhutanSat may stretch to early next year. However, as per internal deadlines, Isro is looking to launch it by December. Further, the launch of Risat-1A would also mark the beginning of a new model for Isro as intended by the space reforms initiated by the Centre. Earlier, Isro had a supply-driven model. That is, after Isro made a satellite, it offered it to ministries and government agencies. The three satellites that the space agency is planning to launch are meant for ministries like agriculture, home affairs, earth sciences and environment and forests. Unlike communication satellites where the entire capacity could be demanded by one customer, a single Earth observation satellite can simultaneously cater to multiple customers as the data generated by these satellites can be analysed for different uses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/space-diplomacy-isro-preparing-to-launch-nano-sat-for-bhutan/articleshow/87676061.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Bhambri targets Australian Open qualies||Bengaluru: The 2019 and 2020 tennis seasons swept past Yuki Bhambri, who was laid low by tendonitis, both knees.Bhambri returned to competition in late February, playing two ATP Tour events, where he did well for one who had spent the previous 28 months weighing medical options. Just when he appeared to be logging a run of tournaments, he tested positive for Covid-19 in Orlando, Florida, where he was to play a Challenger. That was in April.Bhambri may have beaten the virus with a negative test, but his right knee hurt again. It was the same ache that had forced him to pack away his Babolat Pure Drive sticks for two years. The 29-year-old’s career, which had once promised much, appeared to be taking a shine for the vanishing act. Bhambri, a former world No. 1 junior and silver medallist at the Youth Olympic Games, wasn’t sure what exactly the pain in his right knee was. Was it the virus talking a foreign language or was it the tendonitis acting up again? “I went back the same route (as in 2019 and 20) to find a solution, I consulted with a number of doctors in the US,” said Bhambri, who also sought out fellow players, including South African Kevin Anderson, whose right knee went under the knife twice in the last two years. “I had a surgery finally, a mini intervention,” Bhambri said of his 2021 summer. “That was in North Carolina. I feel better from it. At first, the recovery from Covid was hard, you lose endurance. I was dropping to the floor out-of-breath after an eight-minute jog. Slowly I worked my way back from there.” Bhambri, whose singles ranking, not surprisingly, has dropped to 1035, returned with his injury protected ranking of No. 100 in February, which was where he was when he had to cut his 2018 season short. A player is eligible to keep the injury protected ranking for 12 tournaments, and the Indian played two events in February and March at No. 100, before requesting for another ‘freeze’. Bhambri, who won the junior Australian Open crown 13 years ago, returns to competition at the Australian Open (qualifying) in Melbourne in January.For two years -- 2019 and Covid ravaged 2020 – Bhambri waited his turn, patiently working his way through 20 doctors, in different continents. He then settled on injections (platelet-rich plasma and stem cell), eight in all, swinging between rest and rehab. Every few weeks he came up against the wall of doubt, wondering if he was doing the right thing. “I would ask myself, is it going to work, is it ever going to work? You don’t see improvements on a daily basis, so naturally you find yourself confronted by doubts,” he said, adding that chats with fellow pros like Serb Janko Tipsarevic, ranked in the top-10 ten years ago, and who between 2014 and 2017 underwent seven surgeries, twice on his right knee, helped him focus on recovery.In his time away, Bhambri learnt that it was actually only his right knee that was the problem, the left was hurting only because he was overcompensating by literally playing on one leg.“Because of Covid restrictions, I didn’t have to rush back, I had a lot of time to practice because of which I was able to do well in my first two Tour events,” Bhambri said of coming through the qualifiers in the Dubai Duty Free where he beat Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Ramkumar Ramanathan in back-to-back matches. “The risky decision to play big tournaments paid off, these results showed me where my game was, you know you have a certain level. I know my game is not lacking. Which will help at the Australian Open qualies.”Bhambri, who has until August 2022 to complete his quota of 10 more tournaments with the protected ranking, is looking to playing more on the Tour next year. “Australia will be a good test, the two-three months after will be a good test. If I can get through it without issues, I would consider myself back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bhambri-targets-australian-open-qualies/articleshow/87676063.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Reid looks to instil team-first attitude||Bengaluru: The past few months have been a roller-coaster ride for Indian hockey. The men’s team’s bronze medal-winning feat coupled with the women’s fourth-place finish has pushed the sport into the limelight. While the dust settles on their achievements, the Vivek Sagar Prasad-led junior men’s team will look to ride on the crest of the seniors’ success and defend the junior world Cup title won in 2016.But in these uncertain times, the road to success has many challenges and the Indian team is gearing up to overcome them as the junior hockey extravaganza gets under way in Bhubaneswar on November 24.With an eye on regaining the trophy, senior men’s team chief coach Graham Reid has been roped in to put the finishing touches to the team’s groundwork. Reid has been working with the junior squad for the past month and moved to Bhubaneswar — where the team has gathered for acclimatisation — last week.While the team has been a work in progress over the past two years with BJ Kariappa at the helm, the lack of international match exposure due to the pandemic has been a dampener. But Reid believes that in the given circumstances, the team is well prepared, especially with match practice having been against their senior counterparts.“They had practice games against senior boys before the team left for Tokyo which was valuable for both the teams. In the camp in Bengaluru recently, they played against each other again and the junior boys have been performing well. Also, the senior camp will move here next week. We will be able to play more practice matches against them.” explained the Australian during a virtual press conference on Friday.In the short span that he has been with the team, Reid admitted that he can’t change much in terms of their game, but is working more as a relationship coach.“It’s more icing on the cake rather than having to rebuild anything. Togetherness and team first are very important. Those are things which can be added. In the last month I have been (more like) a relationship coach as relationships with the players are important especially when the chips are down, those things can come to the fore,” he said.Reid also pointed out that since Kariappa spent time assisting him in the senior camp during the pandemic, the juniors have imbibed the work ethics well. “Kariappa spent a lot of time with the senior group during the Covid situation. A lot of the exercise, drills and terminology we use has already trickled down to the junior group in the past year.”Given the team has been training in isolation for a long time, the players have made good use of the span to brush up their English, through classes held at the SAI, Bengaluru premises. Also, a psychologist has been working with the unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/reid-looks-to-instil-team-first-attitude/articleshow/87676066.cms||Manuja Veerappa

He had set a target of winning over 300 seats again in the 2022 UP assembly elections at a recent meet with BJP leaders in Lucknow. Earlier, Shah reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi on a two-day visit to a warm welcome with thousands of hoardings greeting him. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union education minister and in-charge for UP election Dharmendra Pradhan, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh and other leaders welcomed Shah at LBSI Airport. From the airport, Shah reached BHU helipad by chopper and garlanded the statue of varsity founder Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya at the university’s main gate in Lanka area. He then reached the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre to participate in the meeting. The party functionaries who attended the crucial meet included in-charges of all 403 assembly constituencies of the states besides the district and regional level leaders. The BJP has roped in over 50 lakh party workers from booth level upto the state unit for making preparations for the 1.63 lakh polling booths in the state. Not only this, the party will also complete all the preparatory work at the organisational level, including meetings upto the level of ‘panna pramukh’ (voter list page in-charges) by November-end. Party national chief JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh will address the booth committees presidents on November 22 and 25. These details were tabled by the Party’s state organising secretary Sunil Bansal before Shah and in-charge for UP and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and many other leaders at the meeting of party’s poll managers. Bansal also collected details of the poll preparation related exercises from the party presidents of Kashi, Gorakhpur, Awadh, Kanpur, West and Braj region units in the initial session of the meeting, in which in-charges of 403 assembly areas were present. He said, “Currently, over 50 lakh workers are busy in poll preparations of BJP in UP. The data of 49 lakh workers has also been compiled at the state office. The work of formation of committees for each of the 1,63,000 booths and 27,800 Shakti Kendras, which look after multiple booth committees, have also been completed.” “The party will hold the convention of booth committee presidents of Gorakhpur and Kanpur region units on November 22. It will be addressed by the national president. The defence minister will address similar conventions for Awadh and Kashi regional units at Sitapur and Jaunpur on November 25. On the same day, Shah will be addressing the convention of such committees of West and Braj regional units. The conventions of booth level committees and in-charges, divisional units, in-charges of ‘shakti kendras’ and ‘panna pramukh’ will also be conducted by November-end,” Bansal said. Bansal called upon the party cadres to take part in voter list revision process at each booth on November 21 and 27 and also in the on-going membership drive launched by Shah on October 29. The regional units were also assigned the task of holding conventions of teachers, ex-servicemen, lawyers, chaupals of women and labourers. Earlier, mobilising the assembly area in-charges and office-bearers from 98 district units, the party’s in-charge for UP Radhe Mohan Singh said that the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi government for the poor, needy, deprived, Dalits and backwards apart from common man is being positively debated everywhere. The same work done for social welfare should be utilised to woo the voters. He appealed to the partymen to change their daily routine as per the need of the party during election time to dedicate them for executing the programmes prepared by the organisation. Apart from Shah, Pradhan and Yogi, Union minister Anurag Thakur, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present on the dais. Many other Union and UP ministers and leaders, including Annapurna Devi, Shoba Karandalaje, Saroj Pandey, Arjunram Meghwal, Capt Abhimanyu Singh, Vivek Thakur, Sunil Oza, Sudhir Gupta, Pankaj Singh, Subrat Pathak and Mahesh Chand Srivastava were also present.

While addressing a meeting with in-charges of 403 assembly segments and office-bearers of 98 district and six regional units of party at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre’s auditorium here on Friday, Shah made the cadres aware about the depth of their responsibilities, asking them to “go in field with the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who gave fearless and corruption free governance to the country and state”. Giving this information, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh briefed the media about the proceedings of the closed-door meeting which was out of bounds for the reporters. Shah, who ensured landmark victories for the party in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 UP elections, made the cadres aware about the depth of their responsibilities. He asked them to go in the field with the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who gave fearless and corruption free governance to the country and state, Singh added. There are over 100 schemes and programmes, which the Modi and Yogi governments introduced for the welfare of the poor, Singh said adding, crores of people had been benefited with housing, clean toilets, tap water, LPG, power connections, medical, ration, bank account and others. Those who taunted that date of Ram temple in Ayodhya would not be told, had witnessed its foundation laying by PM while a grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) is about to be completed, Singh told the reporters adding that due to the clear vision and intention, the country and state are on the path of development. On the basis of achievements and strength of party workers, the BJP will go among people to seek their blessing and win again in 2022, Singh further said. He said that a decision on the proposals given by people at state level to join BJP was also taken during the meet. Partymen were also asked to focus on the on-going membership campaign and contacting maximum people to increase the member base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/shahs-mantra-for-party-cadre-win-booths-to-win-up/articleshow/87674964.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Goa forest department has received approval from the national Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to establish automated weather monitoring systems in the state’s wildlife sanctuaries. These are expected to help assess the short-term and long-term impact of climate change in the state’s protected areas. “The automatic weather stations will be set up in each of Goa’s wildlife sanctuaries to study the short-term and long-term impact of climate change on biodiversity of the state’s protected areas. The stations will be established in association with India meteorology department (IMD),” additional principal chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar told TOI. The weather stations being set up in each wildlife sanctuary will cost approximately Rs 20 to 25 lakh. “IMD at present only has weather stations in urban areas and not in remote areas or forests. These stations will help us record the weather in forests, sanctuary areas and study the impact of climate change there,” Kumar said. The executive council of CAMPA, under the Union environment ministry, has decided to recommend the proposal for approval of the governing body, with the condition that the central climate change division will vet the proposal ‘to ensure synergy’. Funds set aside for Goa under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016, will be utilised for the project. Recently, Goa prepared its state action plan for climate change (SAPCC), where the report warns of possible adverse impact on the state’s forests if mitigation measures are not put in place to combat climate change. The report has already rung the alarm bell that the state’s temperatures will rise by over 2 degrees Celsius in less than 15 years. As a result, the SAPCC warned of an increase in forest fires in Goa in the coming years. “Forest fire is a phenomenon that can intensify due to climate change,” the SAPCC said. “Although enough documented proof is not available on whether forest fire incidents have increased in Goa due to climate change or human activities, the trend depicts the vulnerability of Goa’s forests to fires, and this can get exasperated due to climate change by 2040.” When the SAPCC was being prepared, 92 forest fires were reported in 2016-17, notes the report, as compared to only two or four fires during the previous years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weather-monitoring-stations-in-goas-sanctuaries-soon-to-combat-climate-change/articleshow/87675007.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Telangana high court to university||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday sought to know from Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) whether it was willing to conduct a second supplementary exam for MBBS first year students who failed their annual and instant examinations. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing petitions filed by aggrieved MBBS students and parents who were contending university did not adhere to pattern of exam as was mandated by new regulations of National Medical Commission (NMC) from 2019. Students’ counsel Unnam Muralidhar Rao urged court to direct varsity to conduct special supplementary exams. “They have already lost one year due to pandemic. Though NMC guidelines prescribe multiple choice questions, the university eliminated this section and gave only descriptive ones,” he said. The counsel said students know they were studying a serious subject like medicine and hence were not seeking grace marks. “We are asking for a special supplementary exam,” he said. Appearing for the varsity, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the NMC allowed universities some autonomy in fixing exam patterns. The judge asked him to verify if the varisty could accommodate students because when the entire world was crippled by the pandemic and was granting exemptions, there was no point why students should be left out, particularly when they were seeking only an exam. “We know of instances where medical colleges gave up even practical exams for PG medicine students during the peak of Covid-19,” Justice Vijaysen said. The judge gave KNRUHS till November 15 to convey its stand and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cant-you-hold-2nd-exam-hc-to-univ/articleshow/87674167.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Kanpur||IIT-K develops robust, self-sustained mechanism to check health of river Ganga||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: To study the impact of environmental changes on the riverine ecosystem, IIT-Kanpur has developed an aquatic autonomous observatory named ‘Niracara Svayamsasita Vedh Shala (NSVS) for monitoring real time data transmission and web-based visualization of river Ganga. The NSVS system was inaugurated by Prof. A R. Harish, dean, Research and Development, IIT-Kanpur at the Laxman ghat of Bithoor on October 31. The project is being implemented by a team of earth scientists, mechanical, electrical, and aerospace engineers from IIT-Kanpur, led by Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya as the principal investigator. IIT-Kanpur’s NSVS system is developed as a low-cost, multi-parameter, water quality monitoring platform that would consist of an array of sensors and auto sampler placed on a stationary platform which is semi-submersible, all-weather, robust, and perfectly stable. Prof. Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-Kanpur said, “Ganga is not just a river but a cultural heritage for us, and, therefore, it is our responsibility to save it from all harms. IIT-Kanpur has been doing rigorous research and developing various mechanisms to study the ecosystem of Ganga and the impact of climate change on it. I congratulate the team led by Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya on the inauguration of the NSVS system, which will ensure real-time, in-situ monitoring of Ganga to ensure its good health.” In its current capacity, the NSVS system can sense three important parameters, namely, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen capacity of water. This can be further utilized to estimate Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), specific gravity and presence of metallic ions in water. The system autonomously collects the data every fifteen minutes and reports it through a wireless network to the institute. For self-sustenance, the platform is equipped with energy harvesting systems consisting of solar cells and a unique Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) system which can extract energy from the flow of river. The system has an open platform architecture such that other institutes developing sensors may integrate it with the IITK system in a collaborative mode. This development is in line with the belief that in the Indian Subcontinent, cleaning and rejuvenating the health of Ganga ecosystem is the focal point, which is often marred by some major challenges including inadequate skilled manpower, poor time-series resolution, integrated data fusion and on-demand water sampling capacity. The project has been jointly sponsored by the department of science and technology, Government of India and IUSSTF- Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum. The IIT-Kanpur has also recently launched a ‘Ganga Atlas’ and a workflow that allows users to process and analyse declassified imagery of riverine environments at minimal cost, using open-source software. Earlier, IIT-Kanpur did research on the high resilience of dissolved heavy metals in Ganga, impact of immersion of dead bodies in the river and held a roundtable discussion on the rejuvenation of rivulets in the Ganga basin; among other initiatives. In its continuous effort to tackle climate change in India, IIT-Kanpur has also signed an MoU with the Delhi government to check Delhi’s air pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-develops-robust-self-sustained-mechanism-to-check-health-of-river-ganga/articleshow/87675004.cms||---

The signing took place in Glasgow at United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26). The state EV policy, approved in July, aims to have a 10% share of electric vehicles in registrations by 2025. It targets conversion of 15% of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fleet into electric by 2025. The policy provides fiscal incentives for EV buyers and for manufacturers along with subsidies for creation of charging infrastructure. The state government said RMI is a 40-year-old non-profit working on clean energy transitions globally. “In Maharashtra, RMI has been engaging with Pune through its City EV Accelerator platform to make Pune EV-ready. We look forward to further our partnership on electric mobility, ZEV, hydrogen fuel and decarbonisation our transport sector and urban renewal sector,” said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray at the signing of the MoU. Highlighting the need to mobilize climate finance, CEO of RMI Jule Kortenhorst said, “Maharashtra is showing leadership for climate action by sub-national governments. The size and scale of economic growth in the state provides it the unique opportunity to leapfrog to clean and modern energy systems and be the role model for sub-national governments, not only in India, but globally.” Thackeray was invited by UNFCCC high-level champions for a one-on-one chat with First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, who “commended the sheer scale at which Maharashtra government is working to decarbonise the state”. The minister emphasized that it will be up to administrative officers and elected representatives to lead and inspire sustainable development for Maharashtra. He said Maharashtra Council for Climate Change will convene to chart out a decarbonisation pathway for the state, under the chairmanship of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Climate is karma, it will do to you what you do to the planet. It will not discriminate between developing and developed. It will hit us all regardless of who or where we are,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-signs-mou-with-us-org-for-ev-policy-tech-support/articleshow/87674206.cms||Manka Behl

Reacting to Rahul seeking to draw a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva in the context of the controversy over his colleague Salman Khurshid’s book, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Rahul’s remarks were part of a pattern where his senior colleagues Digvijaya Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer have been using terms like “Hindu Taliban” , “Hindu Pakistan” and “Hindu terror” to denigrate the faith and culture of the majority community. “It is not coincidence, but part of a project,” Patra said. “While clarifying about Salman Khurshid’s book, Rahul Gandhi attacked Hinduism and Hindutva. Rahul has a history of making critical comments about Hinduism and its culture. It is in the character of Congress and the Gandhi family to attack Hinduism at every opportunity,” Patra said. Khurshid has in his book likened Hindutva to dreaded jehadi outfits like Islamic State and Boko Haram. “What Congress leaders say is not a coincidence but an experiment. And the headmaster of this experimental lab is Rahul Gandhi,” Patra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-has-a-pathological-hatred-for-hindus-bjp/articleshow/87676094.cms||---

After checking on the ground, the team found that out of total 50 sensor based AQI machines, only 33 machines are functional. The ICCC set-up has installed 50 high quality sensor-based air quality monitoring machines and equipment at various locations of the city. Divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar, heading the team, reviewed all the air quality monitoring systems of ICCC in detail and held a meeting in this regard. The meeting was attended by CEO of the Smart City Shiv Sharanappa, additional CEO PK Tripathi, nodal officer of the Smart City and the pollution control board officer. After the review meeting, the commissioner made a random visit to the two sites—Jareeb Chowki and Coca Cola crossing--check the ground situation, and found that only 33 out of total 50 sensor-based AQI machines were functional. The authorities informed him that the rest of the machines are under repair because of Metro and other road construction works. Later, he directed the CEO to get repaired and replaced 17 sensors in 15 days in coordination with Kanpur Metro and the PWD. Taking serious note that regular reports have not been sent for the last several months to the officials of the Smart City by the ICCC Tech Mahindra team, the commissioner asked the CEO to issue a show cause notice to ICCC Tech Mahindra manager for the negligence. It was found in the review meeting that the “Real time reporting of AQI '' reports are being generated and sent to the pollution control office through email, but when asked about the action taken on the daily reports, the pollution control officer said that no action has been taken against them so far. Taking it seriously, the commissioner issued a show cause notice to the regional pollution control officer for not taking necessary steps and corrective measures as required. The regional pollution control officer told the commissioner that the sensor-based systems are to be approved for reporting by the central pollution control board, Delhi. The commissioner directed the CEO and the regional pollution control officer to coordinate and get it validated in the next 15 days, and ensure that daily action and corrective measures are taken. To ensure that real time data of air quality in Kanpur reaches all the people of the city, the commissioner directed the CEO to see that Kanpur Smart City mobile app picks up the data in real times and is updated on regular basis so that people of the city can view all air quality related data (of all 50 sensor-based monitoring systems across the city) on their mobile phones. He also asked the CEO to review it on a daily basis for the next 15 days, and has fixed the next review meeting after 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/district-administration-team-visits-iccc-at-kanpur-smart-city-office/articleshow/87675005.cms||---

The beds will be lowered in each of the teaching hospitals to 200, with routine treatment services getting priority. There are 55,442 beds available in the state, including in government and private hospitals. But just 1,424 beds remain occupied (including general, oxygen, and ICU beds) and 54,018 beds are unoccupied and unused. Most patients (594) are being treated on oxygen beds. Now, Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad has the most Covid-19 patients (55) while Mahbubnagar government hospitals have around 40 patients. Around 35 people are also being treated at the Mahatma Gandhi hospital in Warangal urban district. Only King Koti and TIMS hospitals have more than 10 patients and the administration has already decided to restore regular treatment services and reduce the Covid- 19 beds in two hospitals. The health department has agreed to increase routine services at district and mandal level hospitals while gradually reducing the number of Covid- 19 nodal centres and special beds at each institution. The decision was made after it was discovered that an average of 40,000 Covid-19 tests are being conducted daily, yet no more than 200 tests are positive. “The employees and facilities will be diverted more towards routine services, as we do not expect a large surge. But if one occurs, we will promptly boost the bed capacity,” an official said. The current emphasis is on Covid- 19 immunization and officials have been ordered to pick up the pace in order to meet the targets by the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-positivity-rate-dips-t-to-lower-covid-19-bed-strength/articleshow/87674199.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In a step in this direction, they are creating enabling policies as well as sensitising the workforce about the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning) community. “Few MNCs and global consulting firms in Hyderabad are driving this as part of their hiring process that provides equal opportunity for candidates to not only foster innovation but attract the best and brightest talent,” Gautam Vohra, vice-president and business head, telecom & engineering staffing, TeamLease Digital. Currently, LGBTQ hiring has been predominantly in support functions and back-end roles, he added. Vohra said that the levels of exposure and awareness on LGBTQ issues is a notch higher in MNCs as IT companies host awareness programmes to foster inclusion by updating their policies and by being equal opportunity employers. Many of them have developed a resume application system to include gender neutral language and at offices, they have been launching ‘Pride groups’ for LGBTQ employees. Some have created gender neutral restrooms and enabling employees to self-identify as LGBTQ in internal HR systems, he added. Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani K Aroll too pointed out that some tech companies, especially MNCs, are taking up very specific programmes for including transgenders into their overall employee base and are conducting sensitisation initiatives for all employees. A spokesperson from Deloitte, that is one of the largest employers in the city, said: “Our workplace culture supports LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual). ) professionals to show up authentically and to thrive at work and beyond without fear of discrimination or prejudice.” In 2018, Deloitte Global endorsed the UN Standards of Conduct for Business in Tackling Discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people and has aligned its actions accordingly. Among other things, this UN document said that companies should ensure that gender affirming surgery, treatment and support are covered by company health insurance policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tech-cos-strive-to-create-conducive-lgbtq-spaces/articleshow/87674202.cms||Swati Rathor

She deserves to be punished, so I have filed a complaint with the Ludhiana commissioner of police to book her under sedition and arrest her immediately. We also urge the President to take away her Padma Shri as she does not deserve the honour.”The Ludhiana unit of Communist Party of India (CPI) too has lashed out against Kangana and the BJP. In a statement issued here on Friday, leaders of CPI DP Maur, Dr Arun Mitra, Chamkaru Singh, MS Bhatia and Ramesh Rattan said, “The BJP should clarify its stand on Kangana Ranaut’s statement. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has not uttered a single word on this till now. His silence smacks of his agreement with her statement. The issue is important because Kangana has been awarded Padma Shri. It is a well-known fact that the RSS/ Jan Sangh connived with the British during the freedom movement. Her statement is a cruel joke on the sacrifices of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and thousands of others who fought for our freedom. Our party demands immediate withdrawal of her Padma Shri and other awards, and her arrest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chorus-against-kangana-for-remarks-on-independence/articleshow/87673405.cms||---

Quality LED bulbs and decorative lights made by these women are available in the markets and are selling well too. This was the first time in any Eastern UP district when over a dozen women associated with two self-help groups under the UP State Rural Livelihood Mission have taken initiatives to assemble\ manufacture LED bulbs at their respective homes or in groups. Not only in Baribojh village under the Lalganj block, but women in Newadi village under the Mandhata blocks have also come forward to assemble LED bulbs and decorative night lamps. After receiving week-long training from National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) officials, they started assembling LED bulbs and are now receiving orders from different parts of the state. Nafees Ahmad, Block Mission Manager (Pratapgarh) told TOI that more than a dozen women associated with self-help groups in Lalganj and Mandhata blocks of the district are assembling good quality LED blubs after bringing required materials from Delhi and other parts of the country. These LED bulbs are on par with the branded ones available in the market. Competitively priced, these LED lights saw good demand and this was aptly proved during the recent festive season. He added that this was the first time when women had taken initiatives to manufacture LED bulbs in their respective homes. He further added that orders for LED bulbs have been pouring in from many districts including Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Amethi, and Sultanpur. He, however, said that there are plans to impart training to more women in other blocks for the manufacturing of LED bulbs. Meanwhile, women associated with assembling LED bulbs claimed they usually spend between Rs 40-45 to assemble a LED bulb and it was sold out for Rs 70-80. They have has also been receiving bulk orders where each piece of an LED bulb is being sold for Rs 65-70.

The court said the conspiracy was writ large by the calculated attack on the victim by the unlawful assembly. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges of rioting, murder, unlawful assembly and criminal conspiracy against Anwar Hussain, Kasim, Khalid Ansari and Shahrukh in the case related to the death of Deepak during the riots in Gokalpuri. “It has come on record that the deceased Deepak was murdered by an armed unlawful assembly on February 25, 2020 around 1.30pm. By the manner of their mobilisation and intent as construed from their conduct, the said unlawful assembly can be said to have conducted itself for riots and other offences like murder of deceased Deepak, in prosecution of their common object. The conspiracy is also writ large by the calculated attack on the victim by the unlawful assembly,” the court said in its order on November 9. It further said that there were other public witnesses who have given similar statements implicating accused persons in the offence of riots and murder of Deepak. It added that police witnesses have also identified the accused persons as allegedly a part of the armed riotous mob. “The most important witness in the present case would be Sunil Kumar, who is an eyewitness to the entire incident and has given the complete picture as to how the deceased Deepak was killed by the armed mob consisting of the accused people,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conspiracy-writ-large-murder-rioting-charges-framed-against-4/articleshow/87675530.cms||Usha Das
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Class XII girl ends life due to sexual harassment by teacher||COIMBATORE: A day after a Class XII girl committed suicide, the RS Puram all-woman police in Coimbatore arrested a former teacher of a private school on Friday under Pocso Act and other sections for sexual harassment of the girl and abetment of suicide. According to police, the accused, 31-year-old K Mithun Chakravarthy, was teaching physics and mathematics at a private matriculation school in the city. He had resigned from the school in September this year. According to police, last March, the teacher called the girl to school under the pretext of holding special classes since lessons were taught online during the pandemic. The girl complained to the school principal about the harassment but no action was taken. The girl committed suicide on Thursday evening after her mother and sister had left for Madurai for a family function, police said. Her father was away at work. “When her father returned from work, he found the door bolted from inside. As there was no response, he, along with the help of some of his friends, broke open the door and found the girl hanging from the ceiling. They took her to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital where doctors declared her brought dead,” police said. The girl’s father said, “Mithun used to take online classes during the pandemic and talk to my daughter over WhatsApp video call and chat. My daughter had in March sought permission to go to school, stating she was among the students who were selected for a science competition and Mithun would take classes for them. While I used to pick and drop her, on more than three occasions she was late, and it was the teacher who dropped her back home. She told me that the teacher had taken her to various places alone and requested me to move her to another school.” When the girl’s father informed the incident to his wife, she told him about how their daughter was sexually harassed by her teacher Mithun Chakkaravarthi. He later lodged a complaint with the RS Puram all-woman police seeking action against the teacher. The man said his daugther had also told her mother that the teacher’s behaviour towards her was not good. “She had informed the same to the school principal and the Mithun’s wife who is also a teacher at the same school. We subsequently admitted her to the corporation school at RS Puram. However, she did not mingle with anyone and seemed very dull.” Based on the complaint of the victim’s father, police registered a case against Mithun under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 9(l) (whoever commits sexual assault on the child more than once or repeatedly) read with 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, and nabbed him. Earlier in the day, members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, Students’ Federation of India, All India Democratic Women’s Association and DYFI had staged demonstrations outside the private school and the district collectorate, demanding police to arrest the teacher. They also petitioned collector G S Sameeran, seeking action against the schoolteacher and the school management. Chief educational officer N Geetha said the school education department would conduct an inquiry into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/class-xii-girl-ends-life-due-to-sexual-harassment-by-teacher/articleshow/87675019.cms||---

---||Allahabad||City to host Indira Marathon this year||Prayagraj: After remaining off the track in 2020 owning to the pandemic, ace runners of the country would once again compete at the popular 36th edition of the All India Prize Money Indira Marathon to be held in the Sangam city on November 19. Held annually, this 42.195km (for both men and women) marathon marks the birth anniversary of late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which falls on November 19. The run would begin from Anand Bhawan and end at Madan Mohan Malaviya Stadium of the city. However, this year there has been a small change in the route of the marathon as the runners would have to go towards Rewa Road after crossing the new Yamuna bridge, and then would have to return on the same route by taking a U-turn from the Reliance Petrol Pump (located just before the flyover at Ghoorpur). Earlier, the run used to pass through the old bridge of Naini due to ongoing sewer work on the traditional route, via Mahewa. District magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri approved the new route of the Indira Marathon in a meeting and also instructed officials to undertake necessary repairs of the road, keeping the route of the marathon in mind for the benefit of the athletes. The marathon’s maiden edition was held on November 19, 1985, after being flagged off by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. “With the route finalised, instructions have now been given to officials of all departments concerned to prepare for the event. The roads will be repaired and the traffic management plan for the route will also be prepared accordingly. The ARTO has also been instructed in this regard,” said Khatri. The DM has directed the municipal corporation, health, traffic and education department to prepare for the marathon. SDM (Sadar) has been made the nodal officer of the marathon. The DM has also instructed the district inspector of schools to ensure participation of schoolchildren, including in the closing ceremony. He has also asked the ADM (city) to depute sector magistrates along with the marathon route for smooth conduct of the event. The sports department marked the ‘kilometer marks’ on the new route of the marathon on Thursday. “The runners will run with a computer chip attached to their shoes or clothes. As per the rule of Athletics Federation of India (AFI), the chip has been made mandatory in marathon. These chips will record the timing of the runners. Besides, the entire route and the run would be monitored through the network of CCTV, including the installed on major crossings of the city,” said regional sports officer Anil Tiwari. The official also said that after being flagged off from the historical Anand Bhawan gate, the participants would run on the route past Teliarganj, Mayo Hall crossing, High Court, CMP College, New Yamuna bridge, Rewa road and back to the end point at Madan Mohan Malviya stadium via Hanuman Mandir. In the last edition of this famous marathon (35th in 2019), Rahul Kumar Pal of Amethi had won by clocking a timing of 2:28:35 seconds. Harendra Kumar of Gazipur had bagged the second position, while Hetram of the services came third. In the women category, Shyamili Singh of West Bengal made history by winning for the first time. She was followed by Neeta Patel of Allahabad and the third place was won by Anita Rani of Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-to-host-indira-marathon-this-year/articleshow/87673411.cms||---
---||Allahabad||City resident provides free goat milk to help dengue patients, doc says no scientific proof||Prayagraj: With the city witnessing increasing numbers of Dengue cases and as per common man’s belief that goat’s milk is supposedly effective in bringing up the blood platelet count, the owners of these animals have started to hike prices of goat milk upto Rs 500 per litre. However, the city also has some good samaritans like Sanjay Saran alias Guddu Bhai, a resident of Chatham Lines of Prayagraj, who is providing free goat milk to around 50 persons every morning. The district has recorded 891 dengue cases so far out of which, 643 were reported in urban pockets, while the rest 248 in rural areas. Earlier, the businessman used to run a tea-shop on the road leading to Iswar Saran Degree College (ISDC), but the pandemic forced him to close the shop and he is barely able to meet ends meet. However, despite facing the challenge, he refrains from charging any money for the milk of his goats which is given to a number of denizens of the Sangam city who visit his house every morning to collect around 100 millilitres (ml) of goat milk, believing that consuming the same would improve the patient’s blood platelet count. “Although, earlier I used to have around 100 goats, but now the numbers have come down to just seven. But since all of them are yielding milk and people believe that goat milk helps fight dengue and the falling platelet count, I thought of donating the same to those who need it. Although, I don’t ask for money but there are few, among the large number of people who come daily to get the milk, who do give some money which I keep it for the fodder of my goats,” said Guddu. It’s been over two months that Guddu has been providing around 100-150ml of milk to 50-60 people every day. But as the outbreak of the disease is getting worse in the city, more and more people come to his house. However, the medico of the city has a different perceptive in terms of consuming goat milk in respect to its benefits for dengue patients. “As far as the standard protocol or the practice goes, in terms of treating dengue patients, there is no proof that goat’s milk has any benefits in increasing the platelet count. Moreover, we never recommend consuming milk without boiling it and people should refrain from the same,” said associate professor at MLN Medical College and eminent physician of the city, Dr Manoj Mathur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-resident-provides-free-goat-milk-to-help-dengue-patients-doc-says-no-scientific-proof/articleshow/87673424.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Demoiselle cranes died of avian flu: Lab report||Jodhpur: Deaths of over a hundred demoiselle cranes, popularly known as ‘Kurjan’ in desert region has been attributed to the avian influenza. A report of the viscera of the dead birds sent to the laboratory has confirmed it. It may be noted that the dead Kurjan had been spotted near a water point in village Kaparda first on November 8 by a local wildlife activist. Many of them were found to sick and were not able to fly. Since then, the toll has reached close to the mark of 150 and has also been reported to other settlements of the birds in the villages in the vicinity of Kaparda. Keeping this in view, a meeting was also held by the district magistrate on Friday in the aftermath of the report from the National institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal stating that the birds were infected with deadly H5N1 Avian Influenza. Directions have been issued to the common persons that any spotting of dead or sick Kurjan should immediately been reported to the officials of the Medical & Health, Forest or Animal Husbandry department, so that the necessary action could be taken. Directions were also issued about the proper disposal of the carcasses of the birds in adherence to the protocol so that the infection did not spread to other birds or animals, who could dig out the carcasses from the pits. Meanwhile, taking a serious note of this unabated mortality of these migratory birds in Kaparda, Ramasani and Olvi villages, a team of medical experts from an NGO also reached here to set up a temporary rescue center in the village. “Sick birds are being administered IV fluids, multi vitamins, liver tonics and antibiotic by our team, so that they could be revived and saved. The sickness among them have caused weakness in them crippling them from walking let alone flying”, said one of the team members Rohit Gangwal. On the other hand, the count of bird mortality has been growing steadily with reports of some more birds death pouring in from other areas besides Kaparda. According to the sources, some birds were also found to be dead in Pali on Friday. However, these birds were not Kurjan but some small birds. Senior veterinarian Shrawan Singh said that the disease had also spread in many small birds last year adding that the concern should be a this stage to stop the infection from spreading to healthier birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/demoiselle-cranes-died-of-avian-flu-lab-report/articleshow/87674211.cms||---

Conducted ahead of Children’s Day to gauge the emotional and nutritional impact of the pandemic on children, doctors from the three Fortis Hospitals at Mahim, Mulund and Vashi interviewed 7,670 parents.  They found half the parents were worried about their children's reduced attention span, and over a third about their child’s weight gain and unhealthy snacking habits. Only parents of children aged five to 18 were interviewed. Overall, 95% of the parents interviewed said the pandemic has impacted their child’s “physical, emotional and social growth”. A research paper in medical journal JAMA Network, on October 1, underlined a correlation between children’s mental health and their physical activity and screen time. The study surveyed 1,000 school-aged children in the US and found children engaged in more physical activity and less screen time had better mental health outcomes. The Fortis Hospital survey found the balance between screen time, physical activity and mental health couldn’t be maintained by many. For instance, the ‘work from home’ culture during the pandemic resulted in parents being in close contact with children, but unable to pay attention to them. “Parents worked from home, but they were not accessible to their children. We came across cases where the children were locked away in a different room so parents could work. This must have impacted young children's emotional makeup,” said Dr Sameer Sadawarte. Six out of 10 children had become agitated and irritated during the lockdown periods. Over 60% of the parents felt their children had become “clingly” and demanded that parents spend time with them. During the first wave in 2020, the lockdown was so stringent that children were not allowed to go to the playground or even the housing society's garden. Not surprisingly then, 62% of the parents said their children spent four to six hours every day in front of a gadget. The survey found 57% of the parents said their children watched TV or played video games in their free time. Over one-third of the parents (39%) said their children had gained weight during the pandemic as they frequently snacked. Pediatrician Jesal Sheth said, “As life limps back to normalcy, we must try to involve our children in physical activities, sports and help them socialize with their friends, but in a safe manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-snacking-screen-time-irritability-up-in-pandemic/articleshow/87675027.cms||---

Addressing reporters after a Covid reviewing meeting, Bhujbal said the Nashik administration would monitor the pace of vaccination in the district for the next 8-10 days and if it remains sluggish, the beneficiaries who are not taking the jabs would be denied food grains distributed through public distribution system (PDS) shops and LPG cylinders. Sharing the vaccination data of Nashik, Bhujbal said a total 1.02 crore doses are to be administered to the 51 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 18. “But so far, only 49 lakh doses have been administered. Around 16 lakh beneficiaries have not even taken the first dose. The pace of vaccination in Nashik is still sluggish and there is a need to improve the coverage,” he said. According to the Bhujbal, low vaccination coverage in Malegaon is concerning. “I will look into the reasons for the poor response to vaccination in Malegaon city and steps would be taken to improve the coverage in the textile town,” he said. “The district has less than 500 active Covid patients and the positivity rate has reduced to 1.4%. But we are prepared for any outbreak and have made arrangements for adequate supply of medical oxygen,” he added. Bhujbal also appealed to the people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent spread of the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-says-partial-vax-may-be-a-norm-for-foodgrain-lpg/articleshow/87672639.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Noting that nobody was present on behalf of the petitioner when the matter was called, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh observed that the petitioner remained unrepresented on the last few occasions as well. “The petition is, therefore, dismissed for default,” the bench said. Filed in January, the petition by Dhananjai Jain, a Delhi resident, also sought to remove people squatting under the garb of farmers’ agitation and to clear off all the roads and public places. The plea further demanded the removal of the then Delhi Police Commissioner from his position with immediate effect following the violence on Republic Day and prayed for a direction to the Centre to put adequate paramilitary forces to protect important monuments and to ensure the safety of life and property of citizens of Delhi and restore the feeling of confidence and security amongst them. “Grave and emergent situation arose in Delhi, when on the Republic Day, the celebrations were underway. The farmer agitation, which was going on for last so many days, took a very aggravated and violent turn and the farmers reached the interiors of Delhi armed with weapons, hockey sticks, swords and other assault weapons disturbing the peace and law and order and tranquillity in the capital apart from demeaning the Republic Day festivity,” the petition had claimed. It alleged that Delhi Police did not take timely decisions to allow officials to wield appropriate force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-petition-seeking-action-against-police-for-failing-to-discharge-duty-during-red-fort-violence/articleshow/87674251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier, Shah reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi on a two-day visit to a warm welcome with thousands of hoardings greeting him. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union education minister and in-charge for UP election Dharmendra Pradhan, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh and other leaders welcomed Shah at LBSI Airport. From the airport, Shah reached BHU helipad by chopper and garlanded the statue of varsity founder Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya at the university’s main gate in Lanka area. He then reached the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre to participate in the meeting. The party functionaries who attended the crucial meet included in-charges of all 403 assembly constituencies of the states besides the district and regional level leaders. The BJP has roped in over 50 lakh party workers from booth level upto the state unit for making preparations for the 1.63 lakh polling booths in the state. Not only this, the party will also complete all the preparatory work at the organisational level, including meetings upto the level of ‘panna pramukh’ (voter list page in-charges) by November-end. Party national chief JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh will address the booth committees presidents on November 22 and 25. These details were tabled by the Party’s state organising secretary Sunil Bansal before Shah and in-charge for UP and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and many other leaders at the meeting of party’s poll managers. Bansal also collected details of the poll preparation related exercises from the party presidents of Kashi, Gorakhpur, Awadh, Kanpur, West and Braj region units in the initial session of the meeting, in which in-charges of 403 assembly areas were present. He said, “Currently, over 50 lakh workers are busy in poll preparations of BJP in UP. The data of 49 lakh workers has also been compiled at the state office. The work of formation of committees for each of the 1,63,000 booths and 27,800 Shakti Kendras, which look after multiple booth committees, have also been completed.” “The party will hold the convention of booth committee presidents of Gorakhpur and Kanpur region units on November 22. It will be addressed by the national president. The defence minister will address similar conventions for Awadh and Kashi regional units at Sitapur and Jaunpur on November 25. On the same day, Shah will be addressing the convention of such committees of West and Braj regional units. The conventions of booth level committees and in-charges, divisional units, in-charges of ‘shakti kendras’ and ‘panna pramukh’ will also be conducted by November-end,” Bansal said. Bansal called upon the party cadres to take part in voter list revision process at each booth on November 21 and 27 and also in the on-going membership drive launched by Shah on October 29. The regional units were also assigned the task of holding conventions of teachers, ex-servicemen, lawyers, chaupals of women and labourers. Earlier, mobilising the assembly area in-charges and office-bearers from 98 district units, the party’s in-charge for UP Radhe Mohan Singh said that the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi government for the poor, needy, deprived, Dalits and backwards apart from common man is being positively debated everywhere. The same work done for social welfare should be utilised to woo the voters. He appealed to the partymen to change their daily routine as per the need of the party during election time to dedicate them for executing the programmes prepared by the organisation. Apart from Shah, Pradhan and Yogi, Union minister Anurag Thakur, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present on the dais. Many other Union and UP ministers and leaders, including Annapurna Devi, Shoba Karandalaje, Saroj Pandey, Arjunram Meghwal, Capt Abhimanyu Singh, Vivek Thakur, Sunil Oza, Sudhir Gupta, Pankaj Singh, Subrat Pathak and Mahesh Chand Srivastava were also present. It is Shah’s second visit to the state within a fortnight. Earlier on October 29, he had launched a BJP membership drive in the state capital and made it clear that Adityanath would be the party's chief ministerial face in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/shah-exhorts-party-cadres-to-improve-bjp-tally-in-2022-up-assembly-polls/articleshow/87673468.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Hyderabad||Third Covid dose is the real booster, the magic bullet: Dr Krishna M Ella||HYDERABAD: In a candid conversation, Dr Krishna M Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, tells Swati Bharadwaj and Swati Rathor about vaccines, his passion for science and innovation and how he is betting big on youth and startups Do you think it is time for a booster third shot?The third dose is the real booster dose, it’s the magic bullet. When we look at child immunity, for instance, in inactivated polio vaccines or pentavalent or DPT, two doses will give you enough immunity but not enough for a lifetime. The third one gives the best immunity to the body. With Covaxin, I don’t know how the variants are going to pan out and how long this immunity will last as it’s a new virus. What is the status of the intranasal vaccine?We have just completed the heterologous phase II trials. We have also figured out some new immunology. Why nasal vaccine did not work for lot of people, we have figured out. Something that even the Americans could not figure out. The nasal vaccine is ideal for Covid-19 because from nostril onwards to the throat, intestine, guts, everything is mucosal which is the place where the body’s defence mechanism is located. Nasal has the IgA, mucosal immunity, IgG and T-cell response. But nasal doesn’t really develop the immune response to all the viruses properly for various reasons and we have figured out that science. It is working extremely well with Covaxin. By end of the month we will be submitting phase II data to the regulator. It will be the next big thing because it will stop transmission. WHO claims that Covaxin’s approvals were not delayed and there were other vaccines that also took time. Comments?I don’t think it was delayed per se because we started the process in April. Usually the regulatory process for licence is to complete one year of safety profile after phase III has started. That’s why it’s called Emergency Use Listing (EUL). So, I don’t think it was delayed but what I can certainly say is there was a lot of negative publicity in international media. Regulators work differently, they have their own mind. Even WHO had a lot of questions. They looked at us with much more scrutiny as an Indian company. With WHO approval in place, how do you see the global play for Covaxin, especially gaining access to the US market?With the US market, whether we get approved or not, it’s an exercise for us to understand (the approval process). Nobody looks at that angle in this country. (By approaching the US regulator) I put pressure on the US government. I let them know that they need an alternative technology. Currently the Covaxin we are getting is based on the Wuhan strain. Have you started tweaking it with the Delta variant?We are starting work on the Delta variant now with a test licence. What were the reasons for a shortfall in supply of Covaxin as per government’s expectations and are things back on track now?Manufacturing scale-up has been carried out in a stepwise manner across our own multiple facilities in Hyderabad, Malur in Karnataka and Ankleshwar in Gujarat. For Pune, we have got a test licence. The company was able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacity in a short timeline, mainly due to the availability of its specially designed BSL-3 production campuses to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines. We have manufactured and supplied over 150 million doses with an excellent safety and efficacy profile. We are producing 50-55 million doses of Covaxin per month and we are on target to reach our goal of 1 billion doses annualised capacity by 2021 end. Do you think the timeframe to develop vaccines for Covid-19 is the new benchmark for all vaccines now? Will future vaccines be developed faster?I am totally against this sort of regulatory process. You are going to develop vaccines for children so you can’t take shortcuts. In a pandemic, the orphan status of drugs is okay. Like Merck developed the Ebola vaccine where, without an animal or human clinical trial, it was given to humans directly. This has been done in other vaccines during emergency times, for instance the mRNA vaccine never underwent animal trials. When can we expect Covaxin for kids?We have completed our trials and the data is with the government. A lot of people have been questioning whether there is a need for a children’s vaccine, but Covid-19 affects the lungs and it’s a lifetime problem. I am 66 and if I die there is no problem but if a child gets infected, it affects the quality of life of the younger generation for the next 70 years and that’s more dangerous for me. Are you a scientist first and then a businessman or the other way around?Honestly, I spend very little time as a businessman. I am a scientist and until I die I am going to be a scientist. I breathe science. That’s my passion. There is one good thing about US education – it makes you imbibe science. It’s not my grades or marks or degree. Teachers create an interest in science. I majored in virology at one of the best labs in the US at the University Wisconsin Madison. We used to have Nobel Laureates right there. Har Gobind Khorana was there when I had joined as a student. What is the next area of R&D you are excited about?I really want to get into gene therapy. Gene therapy is still controversial and sketchy, but if we can save some people who are going to die, that will be significant. And I think in gene therapy, whether it’s the CRISPR technology or vector-based, we need to get into the game. After Covid-19 where do you think the next threat to the world will come from?I fear that the next threat may come on the animal side. In India at least, we don’t eat beef. But the whole of Europe and the US depends on beef and if cattle get affected, then food shortage is going to be massive and inflation will be very high. Would you consider taking Bharat Biotech public at this point of time?You tell me, what will I do with so much money? I need to spend it also, no? Somebody else’s money is a liability. We are a cashrich company. I do not have a single loan and my salary is also very low. We have no intention to go public right now. Would you look at acquisitions or would be keen on working with startups?I am very keen on startups but not for making money. Every entrepreneur who has succeeded can help another five entrepreneurs succeed. That is my CSR (corporate social responsibility). I go by what type of promoter he or she is, is he or she good, ethical and passionate about what they are doing? It can be any field. We are not looking at startups as acquisitions. I want to help others succeed. I always tell pharma companies in Hyderabad, they have so much cash, but they only invest in real estate. Instead, if they would have funded 20 entrepreneurs and even if five had succeeded, they would have created more wealth. What’s your prescription for young scientists?Do not do anything just for the sake of the job or your boss. Your boss will not be there with you if you don’t succeed. Do what excites you. Whatever you do, be passionate. In our company we nurture a lot of young scientists and our attrition rate is less than 1%. The average age is about 26-27 years. I believe in the younger generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/third-dose-is-the-real-booster-its-the-magic-bullet-ella/articleshow/87674235.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat denied the relief to Jalaluddin, saying the accused was allegedly seen actively pursuing the object of the unlawful assembly by pelting stones upon police officials. The court said that the accused was seen in one of the videos allegedly exhorting the shopkeepers to pull down the shutter of their shops. It further said that in another video, he was seen allegedly pelting stones towards the directions where the police party had been apprehended by the violent mob and were being beaten. “The manner in which he (Jalaluddin) was pelting stones towards the police personnel who other members of unlawful assembly were beating, clearly indicates that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly i.e. to cause injuries by the police personnel and to kill them,” it added in its order. The court said that the accused had neither made any attempt to stop the other members of the assembly from beating the police personnel nor did he try to disassociate from the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-accused-in-case-related-to-cop-murder-during-riots/articleshow/87675550.cms||Usha Das

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two of the police personnel have been admitted at the hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, said the local police. The police have detained four persons in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen, including an additional superintendent of police, an inspector and six constables were injured. In addition to this, at least three vehicles were damaged in the stone pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG of Nashik Range, BG Shekhar Patil, told TOI that the police had a tough time in bringing the situation under control as the group members had become violent and kept on throwing stones at the policemen. “The police had to resort to mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” added Patil. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters pelted stones at a building with shops at the basement and a hospital on the first and second floor. The stone pelting left some of the window panes of the hospital shattered. The DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to tehsildar around 3pm, the gathering was dispersing, when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, leaving policemen injured. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on the charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, unlawful assembly. In addition, the suspects have also been charged with sections under the Criminal Amendment Act and Damage to Public Property Act. The injured officers include additional superintendent of police Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fracture in his leg. Additional superintendent of police Vijay Kabade said though none of the policemen suffered any serious injuries, one constable has a fracture in the leg. He said, “The incident occurred when the gathering was returning home. The sudden stone pelting left the policemen injured and three police vehicles have been damanged. Based on the CCTV footage, an offence is being registered against some identified and about 100 unidentified suspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/protest-turns-violent-in-nanded-and-malegaon/articleshow/87677610.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Hubballi||MLC elections: Outsiders aspiring for Congress ticket earn North Karnataka leaders’ wrath||Dharwad: Congress workers in north Karnataka, particularly from the once undivided Dharwad district, are upset with the party high command as they feel leaders have been imposing outsiders on them. The southern part of the earlier undivided Dharwad district, which was earlier the Dharwad South Lok Sabha constituency (now called the Haveri Lok Sabha constituency), has been a favourite for the Congress as several leaders from outside, particularly from the Old Mysore region, who have lost elections in their areas were fielded in a bid to rehabilitate them. The rehabilitation tale has a long history. It started with the fielding of former chief minister S Nijalingappa, who was elected unopposed from the Shiggaon assembly constituency in 1967. Nijalingappa, who hailed from Chitradurga district, had lost the 1962 assembly election to GT Rangappa of the Praja Socialist Party by a margin of 5,709 votes. In the same election, Fakkirappa Taware of the Congress had won from Shiggaon against FT Patil of the PSP by a margin of 14,232 votes. So, Shiggaon was now considered a safe seat for the Congress. In 1967, the party decided to field Nijalingappa from there and as the opposition parties did not field a candidate, Nijalingappa entered the assembly uncontested. In the 1984 national general elections, the Congress fielded Azeez Sait of Mysuru from the Dharwad South constituency. The Janata Party’s candidate was Abdul Nazeer Sab. Sait won by a margin of 57,607 votes. This seat had been deemed safe for the Congress as FH Mohsin, BM Mujahid and IG Sanadi had won there earlier. But in recent times, the Congress has seen upsets in Dharwad South. Saleem Ahmed from Bengaluru who was the MLC from 1996-2002 and 2002-2008 was fielded by the Congress in Dharwad South (now Haveri) parliamentary constituency in the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Saleem lost both the elections to the BJP’s Shivakumar Udasi. Santosh Lad, who hails from Sandur, was another outsider to be accommodated by the Congress in the Dharwad district as he was given a ticket to contest from the Kalghatagi assembly constituency in 2008. His earlier constituency Sandur had become reserved for STs. After winning in 2008 and 2013, he lost in 2018. In the 2018 assembly polls, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, fearing defeat in Chamundeshwari, also contested from Badami in Bagalkot district. While he lost Chamundeshwari by 36,000 votes, he scraped through in Badami by a slender 1,696-vote margin against B Sriramulu of the BJP. Now that Saleem Ahmed is lobbying for a Congress ticket to contest elections to Legislative Council from the Local Authorities’ Constituency in undivided Dharwad district (comprising Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag districts), there is palpable resentment among local leaders. Sources said the party was inclined to field a Muslim candidate and there were several aspirants from the community. “Saleem has lost twice in the Lok Sabha election and considering him again for a ticket at the cost of several loyal party workers is not acceptable. The Upper House should have senior leaders who are experts in different fields and are capable of reviewing the decisions taken by the Lower House. It should not become a rehabilitation centre for those who cannot win assembly elections. Have you ever heard of a party a leader from north Karnataka who has lost an election being fielded in a safe constituency in South Karnataka? Why should we always sacrifice?” asked an aspirant. He said that the high command should respect the sentiments of the local loyal party workers and field a senior person for the elections from the Local Authorities’ Constituency to the Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/mlc-elections-outsiders-aspiring-for-congress-ticket-earn-north-karnataka-leaders-wrath/articleshow/87673264.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The city has also been chosen among the top cities in the category of ‘Garbage Free’ under the Swachh Survekshan 2021. Confirming the development, Suresh Ola, district collector, Dungarpur says, “We are delighted to share that city has been adjudged for two awards in national level competition. The credit goes to the local body and the people of the city for showcasing exemplary civic behaviour.” The road to success was not easy for the tribal-dominated city with expanding at a very fast pace. The main trick which worked in the city has been cleaning drive in the night. The city is among the very few in the state where the cleaning took place in the evening and continues late in the night. Explaining the logic behind the trick, Ola, said, “The city is not fully urban in its character and people after the sunset doesn’t prefer to stay out. They give an opportunity for the local body to carry out the drive in the evening and by late-night, they are done with everything. The biggest advantage of the drive is that the cleaning process doesn’t affect the traffic and residents finds streets and lanes clean when they wake up,” said Ola. The trick would not have been successful until it is met by the civic behaviour of the residents. “It will be surprising for any outsider to take a stroll in the evening around the lake which is done by thousands but not yet find litter on the path. Also, the hawkers in the city carries dustbins to ensure that wastage from the product doesn’t travel on the road,” said Ola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dungarpur-to-get-cleanliness-awards-by-prez/articleshow/87674248.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahead of VGGS, Gujarat to launch new policies||GANDHINAGAR: To attract investors and boost positive sentiments ahead of the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat global summit scheduled in January 2022, the Gujarat government is set to announce around half a dozen new policies in key sectors like energy, IT/ITeS, electronics, and agri-business. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel is likely to announce these policies soon. The government is also expected to approve important long-pending demands made by industries. The state’s Information Technology & IT-enabled Services Policy 2016 will lapse shortly. So, the government is working on a new policy that will have a larger ambit. It is likely to cover emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence and robotics. Compared to the 2016 policy where incentives were given to create IT & ITeS accommodating properties, the new policy will focus on providing easy entry-and-exit plug-and-play infrastructure on lease. The policy is also expected to offer manpower-related incentives to attract talent and boost the sector’s growth. Similarly, the current policy for the electronic industry is also coming to an end this month. To draft the new policy, the state government is consulting large, medium, and small electronic companies to understand their needs and is also studying policies of other states. Like the IT/ITeS policy, the government intends to provide incentives to nurture manpower required for the industry. Meanwhile, the state agriculture department has prepared a draft for the new agri-business policy which has proposed to reduce investment criteria from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 35 lakh. It has also proposed reduction of interest subsidy from 7.5% to 7%. This decision has been taken to match the state’s industrial policy which offers cost benefits only up to Rs 35 lakh and 7% interest subsidy. “Although financial benefits have been reduced in the proposed policy, it is expected that considering higher demand, more applications will be admitted and more industries will be given benefits,” said sources. The energy & petrochemicals department is also working on three key policies namely wind power generation, waste to energy, and small hydel power generation to double power generation from these three sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vibrant-step-for-industry-demands/articleshow/87674253.cms||Kapil Dave

In addition to this, several gram panchayats have decided to display the names of all non-vaccinated villagers on walls to name and shame them. Currently, around 145 villages from Kolhapur district have completed 100% vaccination of the residents. Sanjaysinha Chavan, Kolhapur ZP CEO, said, “We have set a deadline of November 20 to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries. To ensure the target is achieved we have asked gram panchayats to read out names of non-vaccinated villagers so that others know who all are yet to get vaccinated and can encourage them to take the jab.” He added, “Some gram panchayats have also decided to display the names of non-vaccinated people on walls so that people would want to get jabbed and get their names removed .” So far, 85% of the eligible beneficiaries have received first dose and only 42% are fully vaccinated in Kolhapur district. Over 2 lakh beneficiaries have their second dose due. Meanwhile, activists, who are working for increasing vaccination figures, said fear of naming and shaming or incentives of any sort have limited outcome. Sanjay Ghatage, a vaccination activist, said, “Instead of forcing people, the authorities should adopt the route of mass counselling by conducting workshops to do away with the fear about vaccination. The counselling will help achieve significant turnout of beneficiaries. However, to ensure many come forward for getting jabbed, the vaccination process should be made more convenient and accessible.” No vaccination, no ration The gram panchayat of Pathurdi, a village of around 1,200 people in Karmala tehsil of Solapur district, has decided not to supply ration to the families that have non-vaccinated members. Shitalkumar Mote, head of Tanta Mukta Gaav forum, said, “In the last wave 15 people from our village succumbed to the infection. Currently, around 250 villagers have not taken a single jab yet. The families of these people will not be given monthly ration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-zp-adopts-name-shame-plan-to-boost-vaccination/articleshow/87672682.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi court dismisses bail plea of woman who opened medical clinic without degree||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court dismissed the bail plea of a woman who had opened a medical clinic though she allegedly had no medical degree for her profession as a midwife or nurse, in a case related to the death of a pregnant woman. Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi said undisputedly, the accused had no medical degree or certificate as midwife or nurse and as such she was not a qualified medical person. The court noted in its order on November 11 that earlier the accused was working as a midwife/assistant (auxiliary staff) with a maternity centre, which is also not registered with Medical Council India or any government agency. It added that the accused left the same in the year 2002 and since then was running her own clinic. “The material on record would indicate that the deceased, who was five months pregnant, was taken to the clinic of the accused on 22.05.2021. The woman also deposited an amount of Rs 16,000 for her treatment. However within 30 minutes of treatment, the deceased died with her foetus aborted. Cause of death in postmortem report is awaited, after ascertaining chemical analysis report of viscera,” it observed. The court noted that discrepancies pointed out by the accused’s counsel in the prosecution case during investigation, including the points of critical condition of deceased, cannot be gone into at the stage of consideration of bail as it cannot go into deep analysis of evidence appreciation or the reasons touching the merits of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-woman-who-opened-a-medical-clinic-without-degree/articleshow/87674286.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: Niti Aayog hails health scheme for APL leg-up||AMARAVATI: In a major achievement, Niti Aayog has lauded the state government’s Aarogyasri scheme for covering people from Above the Poverty Line (APL) families with health insurance scheme. Niti Ayog has observed that majority of the families from APL bracket have been provided health coverage under Aarogyasri scheme. Interestingly, no other state government scheme has found place in the Niti Aayog’s noteworthy health insurance schemes’ list.  In fact, Niti Aayog strongly recommended the Centre to consider bringing middle class into the universal health insurance scheme ambit in order to achieve better economic results. Niti Aayog recently carried out a comprehensive study on the implementation of the health insurance schemes being implemented by the Centre as well as different states. The study found that about 30 per cent of the total population of the country particularly from the middle class were missing from health coverage. Niti Aayog also expressed serious anguish about the ‘Missing Middle Class’ in the health insurance bracket. “Expansion of health insurance / assurance coverage is a necessary step, and a pathway in India’s effort to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Low government expenditure on health has constrained the capacity and quality of healthcare services in the public sector. It diverts majority of individuals – about two thirds – to seek treatment in the costlier private sector. However, low financial protection leads to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE),” the report said. It further remarked that India’s population is vulnerable to catastrophic spending, and impoverishment from expensive trips to hospitals and other health facilities. The catastrophic effect of healthcare spending is not limited to the poor – but it impacts all segments of the population. “At least 30% of the population, or 40 crore individuals – called the missing middle– are devoid of any financial protection for health,” said Niti Aayog. It said that the Ayushman Bharat–Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) launched in September 2018, and expansion of state government extension schemes, provide comprehensive hospitalisation cover to the bottom 50% of the population, which is around 70 crore people. Around 20% of the population–25 crore people– are covered through social health insurance, and private voluntary health insurance.  “The remaining 30% of the population is devoid of health insurance. The actual uncovered population is higher due to existing coverage gaps in PMJAY and overlap between schemes. This uncovered population is termed as the missing middle,” said Niti Aayog. Interestingly, Niti Aayog noted that the revised and upgraded YSR Arogyasri scheme has taken care of the health needs of many of the middle class as it is providing healthcare to about 95 per cent of the state’s population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/niti-aayog-hails-health-scheme-for-apl-leg-up/articleshow/87673485.cms||Samdani MN
---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur: Case against Kangana for India’s independence comment||JODHPUR: Jodhpur Mahila Congress committee on Friday filed a police complaint against actor and Padma Shri recipient Kangana Ranaut for her comment that India got ‘real’ freedom in 2014 and not in 1947 when it got a bheek (alms). President of the committee and MLA Manisha Panwar reached the Shastri Nagar police station to file a complaint, in which she termed the statement of Ranaut about the country's Independence an insult to those thousands, who fought for the Independence and the people of India. “Entire World looks up to India’s freedom struggle and its fighters for this freedom in high esteem. It is also a fact that thousands laid their life for this freedom and by terming their sacrifice as ‘beekh’, she has committed an insult to both the martyrs and their descendants as well as each Indian citizen,” Panwar stated in the complaint. Demanding action against both the actress and the channel (owner and host), Panwar said that this statement shows that she has no respect at all for the constitution and historic and authentic evidence of the Independence of India. “Her statement was a deliberate move from a public platform, which has not only hurt the sentiments of Indians and also the glorious history of the country. Hence her statement came under the category of sedition”, she said. SHO (Shasri Nagar) Pankaj Raj Mathur said that the complaint has been taken for inquiry and further action would be taken after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/case-against-kangana-for-indias-independence-comment/articleshow/87674265.cms||---

All the seats for BEd courses got filled last year amid Covid-19 pandemic. This time, there seems to be a lack of interest among candidates to pursue BEd courses,” said sources in GU. In all, there are about 3,250 seats for BEd courses in colleges affiliated to GU. The admission process is presently underway and is scheduled to end on November 13. As per estimates, at least 5% of the seats will go empty this year, sources added. “The admission committee has already completed two rounds and the third is underway. Compared to other universities, GU began admission process quite late. At a time, when there is a rush of candidates for BEd courses at other universities in the state, it’s quite surprising to see that GU is having a tough time filling these seats,” said an education expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gu-bed-seats-vacant-for-first-time-in-4-years/articleshow/87674249.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Indian flag to unfurl for shipping sector at GIFT City||AHMEDABAD: After aircraft leasing and financing, Gujarat International Finance Tec-City is now exploring ways to make India, which has a huge export-import trade, a country of shipowners rather than only charterers. The authority at the country’s first and only International Finance Service Centre (IFSC) is aiming to turn the country into an international hub for ship acquisition, financing and leasing activities. The country spends about $75 billion annually chartering foreign flag vessels for India’s international trade. “It is heart-wrenching to find that on registering of ships, the industry finds it easier and more expedient to resort to Flags of Convenience (Panama, Marshall Islands, Liberia etc.) rather than flagging in India. Through the avenues of development of leasing which is suggested here, it is proposed to impart brand value to India flagged vessels,” according to a latest report of the committee on development of avenues for Ship Acquisition, Financing And Leasing (SAFAL) from IFSC in India.  The committee was constituted by IFSCA on June 24 to examine global best practices in financing and leasing of ships, identify opportunities and devise a roadmap to enable such activities from GIFT IFSC. Under the chairpersonship of Vandana Aggarwal, a former senior economic advisor of the government of India, along with representatives from the Centre, Gujarat Maritime Board, industry and finance experts, and academicians, the panel submitted its 208-page report to IFSCA on October 28. One of the key recommendations proposed in the report to D G Shipping is about ‘flagging’ where it has proposed to introduce a new category titled ‘Indian IFSC controlled tonnage’, offering certain relaxations. The report also suggests global benchmarking of regulations, tonnage tax and other tax and seafarer regimes, besides overcoming pricing and other limitations of the existing right of first refusal (ROFR) regime for import of bulk cargoes. Direct and indirect tax changes have been proposed based on the competitive gaps identified through the financial models developed for GIFT City. “After carefully examining the recommendations, the Centre is likely to announce some relaxations in the union budget in February. Once this is done, companies will start setting up their operations at GIFT City IFSC,” said a government official close to the development. In February this year, the IFSC Authority came out with a special framework for enabling aircraft leasing and ancillary services. As a result, several entities in this area who were earlier forced to search for options at overseas IFSCs, have now set up their operations at the Indian IFSC centre in GIFT City. “As IFSC authority, we are developing new avenues to bring international financial services to the country. Ship leasing and financing will play an important role in developing new business through IFSC in India,” said Dipesh Shah, Executive Director, IFSC Authority. Based on the current global order book of scheduled commercial vessels, over 3,000 vessels are on order at a value of about $200 billion (fair market value). Yet, there is serious room for growth, China has 340 million Dead Weight Tonnage (DWT) or 16% global market share while India has 25 million DWT tonnage or 1% global market share, according to the report. Among India’s strengths are its established common law system, world-class ports, proximity to major sources of and markets for goods, and a young, well-educated, creative and motivated workforce. India has the potential to build a base for commercial principals. “Many providers around the world continue to search for an Asian base of operations. At the same time, many Chinese vessel leasing companies, with all or part of their fleet based or registered outside China in low tax jurisdictions, are looking to house their offshore ownership operations in respectable jurisdictions with a stable tax and legal environment. All these activities present a real opportunity for India,” as per the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/indian-flag-to-unfurl-for-shipping-sector-at-gift-city/articleshow/87674276.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Pune||Pune: Shivneri & Shivshahi buses run by private players on roads||PUNE: In relief to commuters, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has started operations of Shivneri and Shivshahi buses in Pune. With the employees’ strike — resulting in the suspension of over 148 till now in Pune division alone — entering its fifth day, senior state transport officials said more than 10 Shivneri and Shivshahi buses were now running, with more to follow soon. “A part of the fleet of Shivneri and Shivshahi buses is owned by the MSRTC, while some are run by private operators. A few of the latter have started plying these buses from Pune to places like Mumbai, Nashik, Dhule, Satara and more,” Dyaneshwar Ranavare, the traffic manager of Pune MSRTC, said. While Shivneri buses mainly ply on Mumbai and Aurangabad routes, Shivshahi buses travel across districts. However, the higher fares remained a concern for many commuters. “The fares are at least two to three times higher than Lal Pari buses. Paying Rs450-500 for Kolhapur is too high for a lower middle-class traveller with a family, like me. To opt for trains instead, one needs a reservation. The state government should end this strike soon,” said Milind Sable, who was looking for options with his family of four at the Swargate depot on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shivneri-shivshahi-buses-run-by-pvt-players-on-roads/articleshow/87674289.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation may restart amnesty scheme for property tax||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is contemplating reintroducing an amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters. It introduced the scheme last year too and recovered around Rs500 crore from defaulters. “The previous scheme received a good response and high revenue was generated. The civic body hopes to replicate last year’s success by coming up with a similar scheme,” Hemant Rasane chairman of the standing committee, told TOI. He said while the terms and conditions of the amnesty scheme are likely to repeated, a final call on the exact discount has to be taken. A 75% discount on the penalty may be offered. According to Rasane, the civic body has around 4.5 lakh property tax defaulters, of which around 1.5 lakh have cleared their dues. Nearly 3 lakh defaulters can expect to avail the benefits of the scheme, if reintroduced. Dues amounting to Rs2,500 crore are pending. The civic areas have 11.26 lakh properties, which are liable to pay the tax. The number has gone from around 9.26 lakh to 11.26 lakh after the merger of 23 villages. Opposition parties had objected to a blanket waiver in the previous scheme. They had demanded a cap of Rs50 lakh so that habitual offenders don’t get undue benefit of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-may-restart-amnesty-scheme-for-property-tax/articleshow/87674261.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

As per an order issued by superintendent of police Nimit Goyal, Jadhav was attached to the police control room pending a departmental inquiry after a special squad busted an illegal biodiesel dispensing point at Jhalta phata in the Chikalthana police station limits in the early hours of Friday. Further, Goyal’s order also cited discrepancies found at the police station during a recent inspection. In the early hours of Friday, a team led by traffic police inspector Machindra Survase raided an open space and seized a tanker through which biodiesel was being dispensed to other heavy vehicles at the spot. The police arrested two men — Salim Shaikh (37) of Baijipura and Syed Yaser (45) of Qaisar colony — while a third suspect fled from the spot. “The raid was carried out between 12.30am and 1am. The suspects and the seized tanker have been handed over to the police station concerned for further action,” said Survase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/biodiesel-racket-police-stn-incharge-faces-action/articleshow/87675091.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: YSRC names candidates for MLC polls||AMARAVATI: The ruling YSRC on Friday declared its candidates for the upcoming MLC elections from local body constituencies. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, while sticking to the party’s social justice principle, has picked his long-time loyalists as candidates. YSRC general secretary and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy released the list of candidates at the party office. While the chief minister’s advisor (tour programme) Talasila Raghuram from Krishna has been named from the district, the party’s affairs in-charge in Kuppam KRJ Bharath has been named from Chittoor district. Kuppam constituency is represented by TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu. Former APCO (Andhra Pradesh handloom weavers cooperative society) chairman Murugudu Hanumantha Rao, who quit the TDP recently but is yet to join YSRC formally, has been gifted with the MLC ticket from Guntur district. Party sources said Jagan was keen to bring a weaver’s leader from Mangalagiri to the upper House. Mangalagiri constituency has a sizeable population of weavers, and was won by Alla Ramakrishna Reddy who defeated Naidu’s son and TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh in the 2019 assembly elections. The surprise selection of Rao has come as a shock to followers of former Chilakaluripet MLA Marri Rajasekhar, who was hoping to get the ticket. BC leaders Vamsi Krishna Yadav and V Kalyani have got tickets from Visakhapatnam. While V Kalyani could not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections due to the last-minute entry of Dr BV Satyavathi, Vamsi Krishna is the party’s Vizag city unit president, and missed the chance to become the GVMC mayor when the party picked a woman to head the civic body. Kshatriya leader Indukuri Raghuraju has been named from Vizianagaram district, while Kapu leaders Anantha Udaya Bhaskar and Ummareddi Venkateswarlu have been named from East Godavari and Guntur districts, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-names-candidates-for-mlc-polls/articleshow/87673523.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice over plea to transfer probe||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to the state government and the Banaskantha district SP in response to a petition filed by the de facto trustee of Lilavati Hospital demanding transfer of probe from Banaskantha police to a central agency in the alleged Rs 45 crore theft from a safe at the hospital building in Palanpur. In his petition, Prashant Mehta, the de facto trustee of Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust, has accused the SP and two inspectors for being hand-in-glove with other trustees, against whom Mehta has levelled allegations. On Thursday, Justice Hemant Prachchhak admitted his petition and sought response from the concerned respondents by November 25. Mehta moved the HC after the police filed a report saying that the loot of diamonds, jewellery, silverware and fancy diamonds from the collection of Maharaja of Baroda from a safe vault in the basement of Lilavati Hospital in Palanpur in 2019 was a dispute between family members regarding properties. The police also noted that no case for filing an FIR was made out. This report was filed after a court in Palanpur had directed the police to investigate Mehta’s complaint. Another court in Palanpur ordered the Palanpur City East Police Station to register an FIR. For seeking transfer of investigation, Mehta submitted before the HC that he had no faith in Banaskantha police, who are either not interested in investigating the case or they are hand-in-glove with the accused persons. The Banaskantha police have reluctantly filed the FIR under compulsion from court order. The police had earlier given save passage to the accused and many of them have fled India, he claimed. This is Mehta’s second petition in the high court. Earlier, he approached the court seeking registration of FIR on his complaint. But the high court had asked him to approach concerned magisterial court for the relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-plea-to-transfer-probe/articleshow/87674291.cms||---
---||Delhi||UP cops take action against officers after Delhi HC rap||Meerut: Days after the Delhi high court pulled up UP police for “illegally arresting” a Delhi-based man and his son without following protocol and for showing laxity during the probe of an elopement case, the station house officer (SHO) of Shamli, Pankaj Tyagi, and investigating officer (IO) Narendra Verma were suspended on Friday on the orders of SP (Shamli) Sukrit Madhav. On October 28, Justice Mukta Gupta had said: “Yeh UP mein chalta hoga, yahan nahi (This may work in UP, but not here)”. Uttar Pradesh Police had picked up two men from their Delhi residence – the father and brother of a man who, according to a complaint filed by his in-laws, had “kidnapped” their daughter from Shamli. The high courthad pointed out that according to the FIR, the woman was 21 years old and not a minor and yet her husband’s father and brother were arrested without informing her. The Shamli police, however, claimed that they were not aware of the woman's exact age. At the hearing, the young couple, who belong to the same caste, had said that they married with their "own free will" on July 1 this year. The man, works for an e-commerce platform in Delhi, and the woman is a final year nursing student. The woman's family owns farms in Shamli and are associated with ‘khaps’. According to police sources, the couple had eloped and the woman's brother and father approached police and filed a case of "kidnapping". A police team from Shamli then went to the man's house and arrested his father and brother whose whereabouts were not shared with the family for over a month. “The couple had approached the Delhi HC seeking protection and requested the man's father and brother be released. The HC came down heavily on the cops, saying that they had violated the law at every step and made the arrests without even informing local police,” said Avdhesh Kumar, the couple's lawyer. SP (Shamli) said, “An IPS officer is now investigating the case and the role of Shamli police. Prima facie, we found that there was laxity in the conduct of these cops which is why they were suspended. A report will be submitted soon.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-cops-take-action-against-officers-after-delhi-hc-rap/articleshow/87675559.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Woman attacked by stalker loses vision in both her eyes||NEW DELHI: The 26-year-old acid attack survivor undergoing treatment at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital has lost her vision in both the eyes. Doctors treating her said the next 5-6 days were crucial because she had suffered internal organ damage too. The survivor has 45% burns on her face and upper torso. Police have arrested the person who had provided the acid to her attacker, who is currently in jail. The woman’s husband, who has been in the hospital ever since the incident on November 3, said he was losing hope by the day. “She has neither eaten nor spoken in two days. Doctors are wondering if dialysis will be required. She will never be able to see her children now,” he told TOI over phone. Dr Manoj Jha, head, burns department, RML Hospital, said on Friday, “Her condition is extremely critical and she had lost vision in both her eyes. We have sought a nephrologist’s opinion on whether she needs dialysis. She suffered damage to her face, excretory organs and the upper torso plus blood loss.” The woman’s assailant, Montu, had been infuriated by the already-married woman turning down his marriage proposal and threw acid on her on November 3 in Bawana. He was arrested from Bihar on November 8. Police took him to outer north Delhi to recover a weapon he had fired at his police pursuers. He and his victim were both from Bihar and lived in the same neighbourhood in Samaypur Badli. The devastated husband told TOI, “My children are at my brother’s house but I need to work to earn money and feed them. My wife’s condition has deteriorated and I haven’t been able to leave the hospital. She cannot see any longer.” In related news, police arrested Shahjahpur native Ram Sewak, who had sold the acid to Montu and booked him under Section 285 of the IPC for endangering a human life with combustible material. Sewak claimed to have procured the acid from Nangloi and the cops are trying to trace the original source of the acid used in the ghastly incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-attacked-by-stalker-loses-vision-in-both-her-eyes/articleshow/87674344.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Ahmedabad||Fuel price rise: September VAT collection up 55% from last year||AHMEDABAD: Wondering why your monthly budgets have toppled over a year? You could attribute a significant chunk of this surge to the rise in fuel prices. In a year, as petrol became costlier by 26% and diesel by 28%, Gujarat’s mop-up through VAT on fuel went up by a whopping 55% in September this year, against last year. In October 2021, Gujarat government recorded revenues worth Rs 1,423 crore from VAT on petrol and diesel against Rs 915 crore in October last year, according to data compiled by state commercial tax department. Explaining this, Milind Torwane, state commercial tax commissioner, said, “VAT payments for a given month are paid by the 20th of the subsequent month. Therefore, the VAT collection figures of October reflect the consumption of fuel in September.  Against the previous month, the consumption has marginally gone down due to which the tax collection is less.” Noteworthily, the consumption of petrol and diesel has not undergone a significant change during the same period. While petrol consumption increased 1.6% during this time, diesel consumption went up only by 0.4%. Yet, tax collection was high as a clear function of increase in fuel prices. In September 2021, 45.1 crore litre diesel was sold against 44.9 litre in September 2020. Similarly, 24 crore litre petrol was sold against 23.6 crore litre. Industry sources said that due to flooding triggered by extended monsoon, the transport activity was marginally impacted in September. “During the monsoon season, the use of diesel in the agriculture segment usually drops as they do not need to use diesel to power pumps to draw irrigation water. That apart, even transport movement was hampered with flooding in certain parts of Saurashtra due to which the diesel consumption could have been impacted,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-price-rise-september-vat-collection-up-55-from-last-year/articleshow/87674332.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Vijayawada||AP, Telangana ministers spar over ‘financial crisis’ in states||HYDERABAD: After the fight over Krishna river water, two ministers from AP and Telangana engaged in unsavoury remarks over the ‘financial crisis’ in Telugu states, and accused each other’s government of being “bankrupt” and “begging for funds”. The ministers, Vemula Prashanth Reddy of Telangana and Perni Nani of AP, unwittingly entered into a war of words, each extolling his own government and criticising the other over alleged financial bankruptcy. It all began with Telengana roads and buildings minister Prashanth Reddy, during a dharna on paddy purchase issue in Nizamabad on Friday, alleging that Andhra people are now seeking alms. “AP had said if Telangana were to become a reality, then Telangana people would have to seek alms. But thanks to the efforts of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we (Telangana people) have utilised our revenue for our region and the revenue is not going to Andhra,” he said, while adding that “Andhra people are now seeking alms.” He further said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is also “seeking alms from the Centre”. “AP government cannot run without borrowings. Even for daily and routine expenditure, they are seeking help from the Centre. The government is fixing meters to agriculture borewells due to pressure from the Centre,” Prashant Reddy alleged. Strongly condemning the remarks, transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) wondered how Telangana government had made such huge debts since its formation if it was so rich. “TRS leaders are roaming in New Delhi seeking loans and grants with an assurance to join the NDA government at the Centre. Our chief minister (Jagan) would never speak with a double-tongue unlike TRS leaders,” Nani said. He further alleged that TRS leadership is trying for an alliance with the BJP at the Centre but posing as fighters for the cause of the poor back home. “Our party supremo’s stand is always clear and straight. AP has been making debts chiefly due to losing the ‘Kamadhenu-like’ Hyderabad and the blunders of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu,” Nani said.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Schools yet to face action for harassing parents over fees||JAIPUR: District education officer of Jaipur had sent seven letters to two private schools of the city for allegedly harassing parents over school fees. However, no action has been taken so far. According to parents, the officer didn’t inquire or any further step wasn’t taken against the schools for not following rules laid down by the government amid pandemic for fee collection. Parents association has met the officer to inquire about the follow up and were given assurance for the same. Manish Vijayvargiya, conveyor of Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh, said, “Parents had given written complaint to the top officers of the education department, orders for investigation on these complaints were also issued by the officials, but even after months passed, no action was taken against the schools. We have met the DEO Ravindra Kumar, seeking action against our complaints or there is no point of complaining to the officials.” Complaints were filed by parents’ alleging that one private school had refused to give transfer certificate to a student because he was not able to pay fees. The parent of the child had written that due to pandemic, he was not able to pay full fees but the school did not consider it and refused to give TC. Another parent alleged that a fee committee was formed without consulting parents in any of the matter and without following the guidelines of Rajasthan School Fees Act. Replying to the parents’ allegations, Kumar said, “Around seven private schools were given notices. We are waiting for the report to arrive then we will send the complied report to Directorate of Education, Bikaner.” As government has allowed 100% capacity schools reopening, many private schools have shut down physical classes as well. This is against the norms of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-action-yet-against-schools-for-harassing-parents-over-school-fees/articleshow/87674342.cms||---

Not depending on any outsider, the authorities have roped in two teachers, who are currently lodged in the prison — one for a cheating case and another in a murder case — to educate about 90 inmates, who are unable to read or write any of language. As per the idea floated by SS Kosamkar, Latur’s principal district judge and chairman of DLSA, the educated and literate inmates should be tasked with educating their fellow illiterate inmates, so that there is an apt utilization of the skills of educated inmates. DLSA member secretary and civil judge senior division Swati Awasekar, who is spearheading the initiative, told TOI, “Our criminal justice system aims at reforming the inmates and our initiative is on the same lines. Teaching them to read, write and communicate in the languages of their choice, we thought it would be a great social contribution if we can make all these illiterate inmates literate.” The unique aspect of this program is that it encourages educated inmates to teach their fellow illiterate inmates, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/laturs-dlsa-starts-imparting-education-to-illiterate-inmates/articleshow/87675097.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in ED custody till November 15 as 'new facts emerge'||MUMBAI: A special court on Friday extended till November 15 the ED custody of state's former home minister Anil Deshmukh, who was arrested on November 2 in an alleged money laundering case. Seeking his custody for three days, the ED said "certain facts have emerged" regarding Deshmukh's role in transfer and postings of police officials in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, adding they emerged while the agency was recording his statement and his continued custody and interrogation is "essential to unearth the truth". Need to confront Deshmukh with pvt individual who handled projects: EDThe ED, through its counsel Shreeram Shirsat, submitted before a special court on Friday that it needs to confront Deshmukh with a private individual who resides in Navi Mumbai and had “handled certain prestigious projects” in the NCP leader’s constituency and had been regularly visiting Deshmukh’s official residence. Deshmukh is a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Nagpur. Shirsat said during the course of recording Deshmukh’s statement, certain new facts emerged, and hence ED has issued summons to the private person for his appearance on November 13. Shirsat said the person has received the summons. The ED also said “another accused Sachin Waze (dismissed assistant police inspector) has played a key role in collecting illegal gratification from the bar owners of Mumbai” on Deshmukh’s “direction”. On November 5, ED’s request to record Waze’s statement was denied by a local court, and now ED plans to file a fresh plea before the designated National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to record Waze’s statement, and based on what emerges, it wants to confront Deshmukh with facts that may arise. Deshmukh’s senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri, with advocate Aniket Nikam, said ED appears to be displaying “double standards.” Chaudhri asked, “Why is Sachin Waze being treated differently? Why has it not arrested Waze yet? Has ED issued summons to Param Bir Singh? He has three non-bailable warrants against him and is close to being declared an absconder.” He spoke of the “unfair” actions of the ED. Chaudhri said, “My client has always been in public space his entire adult life. He wanted to dispel any belief of his non-cooperation and has cooperated with the ED.” Chaudhri said Deshmukh used his legal remedy to file a quashing petition, which the Bombay high court dismissed. The HC had given him liberty to seek pre-arrest bail, and the additional solicitor general for ED had said Deshmukh was still a “suspect”, but when Deshmukh responded to the summons, on November 1, the agency took him in custody. Chaudhri said, “This is a ridiculous proceeding. The department thinks they are privileged and can do what they want. We have given more than fair cooperation. This (ED’s remand plea) amounts to over-reaching…today on what grounds can they take him in custody? Out of 14 accused, only two others have been arrested.” Chaudhri said, “The ends cannot justify the means,” adding, “All is not fair here.” Now saying that a private person is being summoned and Waze’s statement is being sought “is just a ruse to keep me (Deshmukh) in custody,” argued Chaudhri, seeking his judicial custody instead. In a rebuttal, Shirsat said, “Should the department turn a blind eye if new facts emerge?” and asked the court to “please see the statement of Waze dated November 10.” The special judge dictating his order then said ED’s effort shows its sincere attempt to investigate the offence and based on ED submissions, extended Deshmukh’s remand. By November 15, the entire legally permissible 14-day police custody would be over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-need-to-confront-deshmukh-with-pvt-individual-who-handled-projects-in-mumbai/articleshow/87674349.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Centre has already proposed seven major textile parks to be set up across the country this year. The state had placed a request for one park and had promised its support to establish it. Minister for industries, Mekapati Gautham Reddy, who concluded his two-day visit to the national capital on Friday, met several Union ministers during his visit and placed requests on behalf of the state government. The minister also made a strong request to the Centre for establishing solar power plants in the state. He told the Centre that Coal India Limited (CIL) had come forward to establish a solar wafer cell PV modular manufacturing unit at Kopparthy. This would come up at an investment of Rs 7,200 crore, for which CIL has already established a special purpose vehicle (SPV), he told the Union minister of power. Gautham Reddy also requested the Centre to allot a power equipment manufacturing zone to Andhra Pradesh. As the Centre had proposed establishing three power equipment manufacturing zones in the country, the minister wanted that one of these be set up in the state. He also offered land and other facilities at Mannavaram in Chittoor. He said Mannavaram is strategically located near the electronics and manufacturing cluster (EMC) in Satyavedu, and also close to Krishnapatnam Port. The two clusters would add value to planned heavy power equipment manufacturing operations, as resource mobilisation and logistics would be easier, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-lobbies-for-textile-park-in-kopparthy/articleshow/87673556.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Hubballi||Congress, BJP yet to finalise candidates for council polls||Hubballi: Both the national parties – the Congress and the BJP – appear to be dithering over announcing the names of their respective candidates for the forthcoming polls to the state’s legislative council. Uncertainty appears to have gripped both the parties, which appear to be confused as to best determine the credentials of a potential winner. The Congress is reportedly considering fielding a Muslim candidate in the wake of several functionaries, including senior leaders, having made a formal request to this effect. With aspirants from other communities also throwing their hat in the ring, the Congress appears to be facing a troublesome problem of plenty. Among those from the Muslim community vying for the ticket include Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president Saleem Ahmed, former minister AM Hindasgeri and Shakir Sanadi, the son of former MP IG Sanadi. However, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, along with former ministers Zameer Ahmed and Santosh Lad, is reportedly lobbying for Ismail Tamatgar. On the other hand, senior Congress leader and All India Congress Committee general secretary HK Patil is pitching hard to get the ticket for former minister Hindasgeri, who has twice represented the local bodies’ constituency in the legislative council. Anand Gaddadevarmath, yet another aspirant for the Congress ticket, may get the nod should the party decide against a Muslim face in the polls. There is no shortage of contestants for the BJP ticket either, with as many as 17 having thrown up their hand. Among the contenders is Pradeep Shettar, brother of former CM Jagadish Shettar. Karnataka BJP general secretary Mahesh Tenginkai said that the party would finalise the name of the candidate in a few days. The Karnataka unit of the party has reportedly submitted a shortlist of three names to the BJP central leadership. However, Tenginkai refused to disclose the names of the three aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/congress-bjp-yet-to-finalise-candidates-for-council-polls/articleshow/87673318.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Agra||Bailable warrant issued against ex-min, aide in kidnapping case||Agra: A special MP/MLA court in Hathras issued warrants against former energy minister Ramveer Upadhyay and his personal assistant in a case filed by a former block development council (BDC) member accusing them of attempting to kidnap him in September of 2019. The victim, Virendra Kumar, had filed an application before the court of additional district and sessions Judge (IV) Parul Verma, after he had approached the Apex court against him in 2017, who issued the bailable warrants against the duo and directed them to appear in the court on November 15. According to an order copy, Kumar, a scheduled caste, was elected at BDC in 2017. He had accused Upadhyay and his associates for allegedly kidnapping him to get his vote in 2017 MLC (member of Legislative Council) elections. He claimed that he had lodged a police complaint against the minister at Chandpa police station then but due to his influence, police closed the file after a biased probe. He had then approached the Apex court and the court directed CB-CID to investigate the matter in July 2017. Two years later, Upadhyay visited Bisana village with his convoy. After seeing the complainant, the former minister allegedly started passing casteist remarks and threatened him with dire consequences for approaching the court against him. When Kumar confronted him saying that he was doing his work, Upadhyay had asked his associates to put him in a vehicle. However, he failed to "kidnap" him as local people were present there. Kumar had tried to lodge a police complaint against him, but no FIR was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bailable-warrant-issued-against-ex-min-aide-in-kidnapping-case/articleshow/87673570.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Vadodara||Minister supports Rajkot, Vadodara municipal bodies||Vadodara: Action taken against street vendors selling non-vegetarian food in Rajkot and the directives to ensure that they cover their food in Vadodara, seem to have found support from state revenue minister Rajendra Trivedi. When asked about the developments, Trivedi said that footpaths were meant for pedestrians and nobody should do business there. Trivedi told media persons that the footpaths should not be encroached and using them for business was a type of land grabbing. “Any ‘laari’ — veg or non-veg cannot stand there,” he said in Vadodara. Trivedi said that the smoke from non-vegetarian and even vegetarian food troubled people and went in their eyes. He congratulated the mayors of Vadodara and Rajkot for taking action. In another media interaction, Trivedi said it was widely reported that omelette and non-vegetarian ‘laaris’ used to occupy footpaths and operate at timings when commuters faced problems. He added that the display of these food items in public was also not proper and could also lead to diseases. Trivedi said that he would urge the police commissioners that such ‘laaris’ and other things obstructing footpaths be removed. The Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have issued oral directives, especially, ensuring that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ in the public eye. The ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) acted first with oral order to its officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. He held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/minister-supports-rajkot-vadodara-municipal-bodies/articleshow/87674616.cms||---

The CID had registered a case based on a complaint given by Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy under the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, AP Assigned Lands (prohibition of transfer) Act, and various sections of IPC. Reddy alleged that Naidu and Narayana along with others conspired to extend undue favours to their henchmen by changing the rules of Assigned Lands Act. He further claimed that they cheated poor Dalit farmers in the capital region and illegally purchased lands through their benamis from farmers at throwaway prices and later changed the rules in the Act. Naidu and Narayana moved the HC seeking to quash the case. After hearing the petitions, the court on March 19 stayed all further proceedings in the case through an interim direction. As the interim relief is about to expire, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas, on behalf of Naidu, sought relief from the court. Considering his request, the court extended the interim stay on further proceedings of the case by eight weeks and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.

According to officials, the budget this year is likely to be presented around 10 days earlier. The south corporation is likely to present its budget on November 23, while the north and east civic bodies will present their respective budgets two days later. The entire budget-making process is expected to be over by December, which earlier used to be February. This will be the last budget before the civic body polls slated to be held next year. In view of the polls, the budget is likely to cover people-friendly schemes and policies. According to an official, every year, the process starts around the third week of December when all the departments are asked to send in their proposals on new schemes and their achievements. The information and publicity department of all the three corporations are already working on compiling all the data. South Delhi Municipal Corporation will hold a special standing committee meeting where the commissioner of the corporation will present the budget. According to the rules, the budget has to be presented in the standing committees by December third week. After this, discussions take place among ward committees and standing committees on the proposals before the budget is finally approved by February. North and east corporations are likely to present their budget proposals by November 25 and 26, respectively. The civic elections, as per Municipal Act, have to be completed by the month of April as it is in the first week of April that the nomination of mayor and deputy mayor has to be completed. All the three corporations are facing a financial crunch. North and east corporations are even facing problems in giving salaries to their employees. In such a scenario, there could be proposals to increase the revenue of the civic bodies.

---||Kolkata||Cop lens on bus drivers for traffic rule violations||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police launched a drive against errant bus drivers on Friday and started prosecuting them for breaking several traffic and permit norms. The drive spearheaded by the Tiljala traffic Guard had kicked off initially with surprise raids on Monday and Tuesday on the EM Bypass. “We are keeping tabs on frequent overtaking of buses, rash driving, route permits and picking up passengers from the road other than designated stops,” said an officer. At least 45 to 60 bus drivers are being prosecuted for violations each day. “Cops have warned the owners and drivers that they will be slapped with Motor Vehicles Act 207 to get their buses seized if they flout the rules,” the officer added. Cops have also warned the bus owners against pending challans. “All the owners of the buses with a high number of pending cases and those, who have not renewed permits in the past two years, have been asked to pay up and renew the permits at the earliest. During raids, cops found that the buses are involved in two forms of traffic violations frequently — picking and dropping passengers on the road other than bus stops and overtaking. The raids started following the Highland park accident on the EM Bypass when a bus — that had 500 pending cases and plied on the route, for which it did not have a permit — mowed down a biker on the day of Bhai Phonta. However, cops said they have not yet come across any such bus that plies without a permit. “Almost all the buses have a permits. The problem lies in that the permits have not been renewed during the pandemic as RTO remained shut for a long time and the buses stayed off the road,” said an officer, adding that cops are ready to carry out joint raids with the transport department officials to find the buses plying with permits for different routes. Cops at the Beliaghata traffic guard said that they are fining the bus drivers for overtaking and rash driving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-lens-on-bus-drivers-for-traffic-rule-violations/articleshow/87674368.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The court wondered as to how 10 cases, including those of grave offences, could be withdrawn with just one stroke of pen. Ch Krishnanjaneyulu, president of AP journalist forum (APJF), moved the PIL challenging GO 502 issued on May 28, directing the public prosecutor concerned to take steps to withdraw 10 cases against Udayabhanu. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, Jada Sravan Kumar told the high court that the GO is illegal and in violation of Supreme Court guidelines. Arguing on behalf of the state government, GP Maheswar Reddy said the petition is not maintainable. He said the government only informed the public prosecutor about the decision and it is up to the public prosecutor to decide whether to file an application before the magistrate concerned or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/go-on-withdrawal-of-cases-irks-court/articleshow/87673578.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Agra||Kasganj lock-up death: Cops filed FIR after man died in custody||AGRA: The FIR against 22-year-old Mohammad Altaf -- who, police claimed, had "hanged himself" from a 3ft-high water tap in the washroom of the Kasganj lock-up around 2.30 pm on Tuesday -- was registered at 4 pm that day, one-and-a -half hours after his death. According to police, Altaf, accused of kidnapping a 16-year-old Hindu girl, was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead after 10-15 minutes. Health department sources told TOI that Altaf was brought to the Ashok Nagar community health centre at around 4.10 PM. Told about it, additional director general of police (ADGP) Rajeev Krishna said these were "grave findings". He said, “The sequence of events of the entire matter and the role of policemen on duty will be investigated. Aligarh range DIG will be tasked to conduct a departmental probe. As per the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) guidelines, a magisterial probe is being conducted. If family members of the deceased file a complaint, an FIR will be registered.” Altaf's Father Caahat Miyan being consoled by visitorsOn Friday, TOI accessed a video (recorded at 6:06 pm on Tuesday) which shows police taking out the body of Altaf from the hospital to transfer it to the postmortem house at the district hospital. The postmortem was started at about 11 pm that night. According to Altaf's family members, they got information regarding his death from local reporters at around 6 pm. But when they reached the hospital 30 minutes later, police did not allow them to see the body. "We have been saying that our son was murdered in police custody. Now we are being told that the FIR was filed after he had already died. This should be probed by the top police officers and court," an uncle of Altaf said. Family members of Altaf said police had picked him up from his house on Monday around 8 pm after he returned from work, saying he had kidnapped a girl. However, Kasganj superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod had claimed that Altaf was brought for questioning on Tuesday morning. The SP added that Altaf was "suffering from depression and attempted suicide in the washroom of the lock-up". Police had earlier said that Altaf “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket from a tap in the washroom." Later it was revealed that Altaf was about 5.6 ft tall and the tap barely 3 ft in height. According to the FIR filed by the girl’s father against Altaf and an anonymous “friend”, the girl ran away with the latter and headed for Delhi taking along her clothes and academic certificates. The FIR was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station under sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the IPC. This comes even as the girl hasn't been traced by police 72 hours after Altaf’s death. A special team has been formed to look for her. Her family, meanwhile, has locked their house in Kasganj and are at an undisclosed location. The dead boy's family asked, "Which girl during her abduction would remember to take her clothes and school certificates along, and which kidnapper would allow that?" Altaf's father Caahat Miyan said, Why would Altaf go to work and stay at home if he had indeed kidnapped someone?" Altaf’s mother said, “I have no trust in the local authorities. I want the death of my child to be investigated by the CBI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-lock-up-death-police-filed-fir-after-man-had-died-in-custody/articleshow/87673585.cms||Deepak Lavania

The state government employees’ Joint Action Committee comprising AP NGOs Association and Amaravati JAC alleged that the government is resorting to delaying tactics without releasing the pay revision commission’s (PRC) report. The JAC also questioned the absence of the chief secretary at the meeting. Speaking to the media, AP NGOs Association president Bandi Srinivasa Rao said the government is testing the patience of its employees. He said there would be no discussions with the government till it released the report. “We are unable to understand what the government intends. We are surprised at the deliberate delay in release of the report,” said Srinivasa Rao. He also questioned what senior officials could discuss with the associations without providing the details of the recommendations of the PRC. Stating that the government is committed to addressing the grievances of employees, principal finance secretary Shamsher Singh Rawat assured that everything would be streamlined by March 2022. Addressing the meeting, Rawat said the government had granted 27% interim relief soon after Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. He added the government could not deliberate on issues related to the PRC due to financial troubles imposed by Covid-19. “Since revenues are slowly limping back, the government is hopeful of setting all issues on track by March 2022,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/employee-unions-stage-walkout-over-delay-in-prc-report-release/articleshow/87673599.cms||Samdani MN

The BMC board of administrators member, Pranay Roy, who is heading the teams, held a meeting with the health workers to discuss how they will work and coordinate with each other. “Each of the six quick action teams comprises health and conservancy workers along with the respective ward coordinators and supervisors. One assistant engineer will supervise the work of each team. All the 41 wards will be inspected by these quick action teams regularly to check if there is any accumulation of water, where mosquitoes can breed. If found, immediate action will be taken to clean up the places along with spraying larvicides and fogging,” said Roy. The teams will work till the end of December. There has been a spike in dengue cases across BMC and the adjacent areas under South Dum Dum Municipality. Since October 1, over 150 dengue cases have been reported. Satabdi Saha (33), a resident of Baguiati’s Ashwininagar, died of dengue shock syndrome last Monday and this first dengue death in a BMC area this season brought back the memories of three years ago, when several people succumbed to the disease in Baguiati, Kestopur and Salt Lake. BMC officials said that heavy rain, which continued till September, triggered waterlogging in many places and this resulted in the spike in dengue cases. “We close our windows after lunch. We have been doing this for the last 30 years,” said Dipannita Bakshy, a resident of BL block close to the Eastern Drainage canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anti-dengue-drive-starts-in-bidhannagar/articleshow/87674374.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The authorities blocked traffic movement on a 200-metre stretch of the road between Baguiati Joramandir and Big Bazaar crossing on the Kolkata-bound flank as the PWD workers scraped the the top layer while preparing the road for a relaying. The officials said the work on the entire 8km road between Ultadanga and Jessore Road will be completed till early next year. “In the first phase we have started re-sectioning the most affected stretches of VIP Road that have completely lost elasticity and are prone to developing large craters and potholes after rain. We are removing the top layer as well as the inner portions of the road and then we will refill it with a bituminous layer. Once the inner layer is strengthened, we will apply the final coat of mechanised mastic asphalt that will prevent water seepage and make the road long lasting,” said a PWD executive engineer, who is in charge of the maintenance of the road. TOI had written on October 28 on how four major city roads were set to be repaired, using a technology that promised to make the process “pollution-free”. While the authorities began the work with VIP Road, they will take up the repairs of Red Road, Mayo Road and Hospital Road in the future. According to PWD engineers, the new technology is set to be a “game-changer” in road engineering. The “Gussasphalt machine” that is imported from Germany will also make the work five times faster than the existing methods, said an engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-tech-to-repave-battered-vip-road/articleshow/87674383.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||City remembers Dostoevsky in author’s bicentenary year||Kolkata: Even two centuries after his birth, Fyodor Dostoevsky remains relevant to the modern society and its complexities, said scholars at a seminar on Friday. The event was organised at Gorky Sadan to celebrate the bicentenary of the novelist. Apart from literary discussions, an exhibition of books and photographs by the Dostoevsky Museum of St Petersburg was inaugurated as part of a series of events. Dostoevsky’s writings offer a glimpse of the society in 19th century Russia. Though his writings were considered to be dark and sombre, but juxtaposition of that greyish-brown tone in writing with splashes of colour was a style that was uniquely his, said scholars at the seminar. The exhibition of paintings gave visitors a glimpse of the fashion of the times. Interestingly, Dostoevsky himself was a very fashionable man and this seeped into his characters, and the exhibition of pictures made that evident. “He reminded people that no one was born a criminal and there were several reasons why a person converts into one. We must not forget that he was one of the principal figures who brought about prison reforms in Russia,” said Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das. Alexey Idamkin, consul general of Russia, described Dostoevsky as one of the greatest novelists that Russia ever produced. “His writings were a combination of existentialism, theology and psychology,” Idamkin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-remembers-dostoevsky-in-authors-bicentenary-year/articleshow/87674403.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He held several state-level posts and was instrumental in attracting scores of students and youths to Congress. Terming his demise as a huge loss to the party, TNCC president K S Alagiri said he had launched National Students Tamil Development Committee to cultivate Tamil affinity among the student community. Thanjavur DCC treasurer Vayalur S Ramanathan said Ramamoorthy launched Tamil development committee after the Congress lost in the 1967 assembly election over anti-Hindi protests. “Instead of calling it Hindi opposition, he preferred to call it Tamil development as an optimistic approach. His efforts to rope in students to Congress paid off with chairmen in 154 of 168 colleges in the state hailing from the Congress party then,” he said. Ramamoorthy who pursued his law degree at government law college in Chennai developed close connections with former chief minister K Kamaraj and others. He also worked as a teacher in Karandhai Tamil Sangam in Thanjavur before his political entry. Ramamoothy quit Congress after the demise of Kamaraj and launched Kamaraj Congress. He was with Janata Dal for some time before returning to Congress. As a reputed lawyer, he was known for his powerful speeches and argumentative skill. Ramanathan said ‘Thanjaiyar’ kept the audience spellbound for a record 3.5 hours at a public meeting at Thilagar Thidal several years ago. As a writer, Ramamoorthy had authored books on Vallalar and Vivekanandar and one titled ‘Buddhan Enum Maanudan’ was released a month ago. He is survived by his wife Saraswathi, daughter Ammu and son Appu. AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran was among those who condoled the death. Ramamoorthy’s last rites will be held in Thanjavur on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veteran-congress-leader-thanjaiyar-passes-away/articleshow/87674399.cms||---

On his return from Delhi after receiving the recognition from President Ram Nath Kovind, the social worker said he would continue working for his cause and is open to sharing his expertise with the urban local body to improve the city’s hygiene and sanitation. A resident of Ramalinga Nagar, Subburaman constructed over 1.20 lakh toilets in various parts of the country. Environment-friendly and requiring less water, toilet models such as EcoSan were established in rural Trichy. He was also instrumental in establishing a sanitation park in the city where dozens of toilet models were displayed to promote awareness among children. Empanelled in the smart city advisory forum last year, Subburaman said basic amenities and sanitation needs must be addressed first before going for beautification. “We still need a lot of urinals in the city to overcome open urination threats. Covid-19 has implied the need for handwash centres and improved urban sanitation,” Subburaman said. Stating that he is willing to offer his expertise in rainwater harvesting, the social worker said that the ongoing monsoon can be utilised by the civic body to identify inundation-prone areas to establish roadside RWHs. Subburaman has a zero waste sustainable house that uses rainwater for domestic needs. He said authorities must hold discussions with experts to make a project successful, pointing to the Trichy corporation’s poor choice of locations for installing over 10 RWH pits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/padma-shri-awardee-build-more-toilets-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87674408.cms||---

---||Goa||Biofloc fish farming gains traction, training sessions begin||Panaji: Biofloc fish farming, which has set trends in the pisciculture industry, has started gaining popularity among fish farmers in Goa. The farming system, which facilitates recycling and reusing of nutrients in the culture medium, is benefited by the limited or zero water exchange. Most importantly, the system reduces the utilisation of protein-rich feed and the cost of standard feed. It is a technology adopted by aquaculture wherein turbid water in fish ponds is reused by filtering unwanted substances and metabolites and converting them into nutrients. “We have installed a unit of biofloc fish farming at Ela, Old Goa and have trained fish farmers in converting toxic materials such as fish excreta in the water into a single cell protein. This eliminates the need to give pelleted feed to the fish, thus saving cost on feed cost worth lakhs of rupees,” a fisheries officer told TOI. Preparing the floc in the fish farm requires a 20:1 ratio of carbon and nitrogen. Probiotics such as molasses, jaggery, sugar and wheat flour can be used as a carbon source. Good soil, urea or yeast can be used as a source of nitrogen. After 24 hours of good aeration, the floc is ready. To test it, the residue of 15-20 ml and precipitate is required to be checked. “The process only requires a tank of water, prawns that require to be fed till there is excreta in the tank, followed by floc which will convert the excreta into feed. Anyone who has space behind their house to carry out this procedure can do so,” the officer said. The system can be used for the culture of fish as well, besides shrimp. While shrimp can be harvested in 90 days, the harvest of fish will take five to six months. Besides converting the waste into nutrients, there is less water exchange in this system. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) scheme of the Central government, a subsidy of 40% has been announced for biofloc fish farming for large, medium and small categories. All the expenses from setting up tanks and other requirements for doing the biofloc fish farming, depositing the fish seeds, expenses of feeding them to until the time of harvesting of the fishes, are covered under the scheme. The directorate of fisheries in Goa has therefore started training fish farmers in this technology. A total of 40 candidates are currently being trained for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biofloc-fish-farming-gains-traction-training-sessions-begin/articleshow/87674426.cms||Nida Sayed

Anurag Kundu, chairperson, DCPCR, said, “I have written to the commissioners of all three municipal corporations flagging non-issuance of birth certificates to juveniles out of ignorance of municipal officers. These children are victims of sexual violence, child labour, trafficking, in conflict with law, etc.”He added it is a serious matter of concern and is violative of the statutory rights of the children in difficult situations. A North Corporation official in the birth and death registration department said, “If We will look into this matter immediately. The DCPCR can send us information of such cases, then it would be helpful. As the system of collecting birth certificates is online, the software will also be updated.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rights-body-writes-to-corpns-over-non-issuance-of-papers-to-minors/articleshow/87675596.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They stated that most of the villagers are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. The Pudhukanmoi, an irrigation tank that extends to 40 acres which is situated in the village, acts as a major water source for agricultural activities.The petitioners stated that the Centre in 2018 had issued a notification for laying Melur-Karaikudi national highway project which crosses through the centre of the Pudhukanmoi. This project would ruin the waterbody and would also affect agricultural activities.That apart, it would also affect 50 houses in the colony where people belonging to the scheduled caste community are residing. Hence, the petitioners moved the HC Madurai bench seeking not to lay the highways across the waterbody and sought to lay the highways in an alternative route. However, the NHAI in its counter submitted that the proposed alignment does not bisect the Pudhukanmoi. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan gave the direction to the Sivaganga collector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-against-laying-road-over-sivaganga-waterbody/articleshow/87675144.cms||---

As on Friday, Mumbai had administered 92,35,708 first jabs, just 838 shy of the estimated adult population of 92,36,546. Statistically, a 100% single dose coverage, however, shouldn't make Mumbai complacent as there are still unvaccinated areas. An internal assessment by BMC has found that several wards may be far below the required coverage. Mumbai has administered a total 1,51,97,031 doses, fully immunising nearly 60 lakh people. However, a chunk of beneficiaries were residents of adjoining townships in MMR. Within the state, Pune and Sindhudurg are next in line to reach 100% first dose coverage. Mumbai has capacity to vaccinate 2 lakh daily, 2nd doses now main priorityAgainst Mumbai’s 100%, Delhi has administered first doses equal to 88.5% of its population, Bengaluru 88% and Chennai 82% respectively.On January 16, the vaccination drive started with merely 10 centres. On Day 1, 1,926 healthcare workers showed up to get vaccinated against the planned target of 4,000. Eleven months later, the city now has 462 vaccination centres, including 146 private centres. The city now has a capacity to vaccinate nearly 2lakh people in a day. In the age categories, 106% senior citizens have been covered with a single shot. In the 45-59 years too, 106% have been given a single dose, while more than 88% have got one dose in 18-44 category. “Mumbai’s well-organised vaccination centres were a big draw for people who flocked from the MMR and other districts,” said an official from the immunisation department. The civic officials believe that at least 20% of vaccinations done in the city could be for MMR citizens. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said Mumbai reaching the milestone before other cities was a testimony to the efforts that the health workers had put in. He said vaccination wouldn’t slow down, neither would immunisation centres be reduced drastically as more than 35lakh people are yet to take their second doses. Besides, at least 11 wards have immunisation coverage much lower than the city average as per a evaluation done on the basis of population estimates in wards. “We plan to cover whoever is left in the door-to-door vaccination that is being carried out,” the official said. “There could be hesitancy in 5-10% population,” said the official. Recalling the initial days of vaccination, Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC jumbo hospital said that the initial two months saw a lull before the scramble for vaccines began. “Over the months, the faith was built. Even healthcare and frontline workers who stayed away, wanted to get vaccinated,” he said. On its busiest days, BKC vaccinated more than 7,000 people in a single day. “It’s great news to have achieved 100% single dose coverage but the real milestone would be reached when we cover 100% people with both doses,” Dere said. Many centres have vaccinated more than 3-3.5lakh people. Dr Sachin Desai, Maharashtra’s immunisation in-charge, said every district should follow Mumbai’s example. “It’s the most populated district in the state, yet they managed to achieve the milestone before others,” he said. The civic official said that the private sector should be credited for the milestone as they have administered nearly 58 lakh doses in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-has-capacity-to-vaccinate-2-lakh-daily-2nd-doses-now-main-priority/articleshow/87674429.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||Now, you can adopt a Kolkata zoo animal for a month||KOLKATA: A recent tweak in the ‘adopt-an-animal’ policy by the Alipore zoo has led to a renewed interest by ‘foster parents’ in the scheme. The scheme, launched in August 2013, was available only in annual adoption fee format till a few months ago. But in September, the zoo officials decided to introduce a monthly scheme for adoption after queries from interested persons. “For instance, the annual adoption fee for a tiger is Rs 2,00,000. But recently, we introduced a monthly fee option of Rs 20,000. This way, anyone interested can adopt the animal even for a month,” said zoo director Asish Kumar Samanta. The recent adoptions happened through the monthly scheme include that of a zebra (September 6 to October 5 for Rs 3,000), a kangaroo (September 6 to October 5 for Rs 2,500), a cockatiel (September 12 to October 11 for Rs 200) and an iguana (October 25 to November 24 for Rs 500). And, the new scheme seems to be yielding results. Compared to 2020-21 and 2019-20, when only four and five adoptions, respectively, had taken place — as per data on zoo website — 19 animals have already been adopted this year, including four through monthly scheme. Eleven adoptions happened after the introduction of new scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-you-can-adopt-a-kol-zoo-animal-for-a-month/articleshow/87674427.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
---||Madurai||Prevent production of ganja to stop smuggling: Madras high court||MADURAI: The volume of ganja which is in circulation in a few districts is shocking and warrants serious consideration, the Madras high court has said and added that the main thing which could be done is that it should be nipped in the bud by preventing its production. Justice B Pugalendhi observed that narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances have several medical and scientific uses, however, the use of such substances are also being abused. In order to get a clear picture of the ground reality, this court clubbed the matters seeking bail and anticipatory bail in relation to offences under the NDPS Act, for the past two months. The judge observed that it appears that approximately 4,000kg of ganja was involved in these cases. This whopping quantity of ganja involved in the petitions filed in a couple of months exposes the volume of ganja that is in circulation within a few districts. The judge observed that there exists a perception that using drugs and alcohol can feel like the perfect way to escape life stressors and other difficult issues. When a person is drunk or high, he may experience positive and euphoric feelings and may feel ecstasy. At the same time, such substances can dull emotions and make painful feelings disappear temporarily. For this reason, many people end up using such substances to cope with emotional pain, bad memories, poor sleep, guilt, shame, anxiety, or terror. “Finances, relationships, and personal wellbeing all get sacrificed, while the underlying issues with which the person was struggling would only tend to worsen. The escape that the substances provide are temporary, but the costs are permanent. The ‘cure’ for the internal pain, actually creates a much worse problem. In other words, what seemed euphoric and like heaven, can quickly become a personal hell,” observed the judge. The judge observed that use of such substances result in a rise in crimes. “The drug-crime relationship is of three types - violation of drug laws, crimes motivated under the influence of drugs and crimes to rely on the drugs. We are also witnessing the emergence of juvenile crimes, such as chain snatching, sexual abuse and other offences, under the influence of such substances,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ganja-circulation-huge-nip-its-production-in-bud-hc/articleshow/87675143.cms||Kaushik Kannan

His speech was also about how the people in the delta region became landless. He stated that his intention was not to affect the sentiments of any particular community or religious group of people but was only to voice in favour of aggrieved persons. He stated his intention was to bring awareness among the people. Hence, he sought to quash the FIR against him. It maybe recalled that during the course of the earlier hearing, the court had stayed the filing of the chargesheet in this case.

The team led by cooperative minister I Periasamy on Friday said about 9,250 acres in Thanjavur and 42,500 acres in Tiruvarur have been affected. Periasamy told reporters after visiting Madhukur block in Thanjavur that about 9,250 acres of samba crop in 42 villages in the block has been submerged by rainwater. In the afternoon, the team visited Tiruvarur. After completing the assessment there, Periasamy said about 42,500 acres of paddy crop has been damaged in the district. Collector P Gayathri Krishnan and officials were present. “All the samba crop in Madukkur area is submerged and the roots have begun to rot. If the water recedes, the government will take steps to revive the crops. After completing our visit to the affected areas throughout the delta, we will submit a report to the chief minister. The government will take steps to sanction required compensation,” he said. The team also comprised ministers Thangam Thennarasu, S Regupathy, K R Periyakaruppan, R Sakkarapani, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, and CV Meyyanathan. Asked as to what steps that the government was taking to avert such damage, Periasamy said the CM had sanctioned crores of rupees to desilt important canals immediately after the government took charge. Necessary action would be taken to prevent rainwater from entering the fields, he assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/51000-acres-of-paddy-damaged-in-delta-dists-ministers-team/articleshow/87674423.cms||---

Workers under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) filled over 50 potholes on the highway that links central and western districts in the past two days. The highway which passes through Kambarasampettai, Jeeyapuram and Thirupparaithurai hamlets on the city’s suburbs had been in bad shape for months now. One portion of it is maintained by state highways and its widening is nearing completion while another is maintained by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). As the road abuts Cauvery river, the narrow stretch is prone to fatal accidents. In the recent rains, numerous potholes have surfaced near Jeeyapuram . A jurisdictional confusion between state and national highways departments over the road meant that requests for maintenance of the damaged road have fallen on deaf ears. With villagers using the road meeting with accidents, locals of Andhanallur involving MGNREGA workers filled the potholes without waiting for the officials. Soil excavated from other work sites were used for filling the potholes. “Around 80 workers filled and levelled the 50 plus potholes on the 2 km between Jeeyapuram and Thindukkarai. Even before the monsoon, the road was not motorable,” Andhanallur panchayat president Priyanka Anandhan told TOI. Highway patrol police also pitched in by streamlining vehicles passing through the stretch. Although a toll plaza is situated about 3 km away, the villagers said that no support had come from the toll collected for accessing the highway. Sources in Thirupparaithurai toll plaza said the road must be maintained by state highways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/villagers-fill-potholes-on-natl-highway-using-mgnrega-workers/articleshow/87674420.cms||Deepak Karthik

The government has instructed all e-Seva centres to be open on Saturday and Sunday to enable farmers to enrol their names. Officials of concerned departments have also been asked to extend all help to farmers to remit insurance premiums before the last date. Farmers have been expressing their inability to remit the premium as the revenue and agriculture departments are busy with rain-related relief works. In a statement, the agriculture production commissioner said the concerned officials have been constantly involved in the process of getting an extension of the last date from the Union government. Besides all e-Seva centres, authorities of all primary agriculture credit cooperative societies (PACCS) have been asked to transact business for farmers who need crop loans for samba cultivation. Village administrative officers (VAOs) have been instructed to provide required certificates to farmers for both crop insurance and crop loans, the statement added. District-level teams headed by district collectors will monitor the entire process, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-releases-steps-to-help-farmers-insure-crop-under-pm-scheme/articleshow/87674434.cms||---

On October 28, Justice Mukta Gupta had said: “Yeh UP mein chalta hoga, yahan nahi (This may work in UP, but not here)”. UP Police had picked up two men from their Delhi residence – the father and brother of a man who, according to a complaint filed by his in-laws, had “kidnapped” their daughter from Shamli. The HC had pointed out that according to the FIR, the woman was 21 years old and not a minor and yet her husband’s father and brother were arrested without informing her. The Shamli police, however, claimed that they were not aware of the woman's exact age. At the hearing, the young couple, who belong to the same caste, had said that they married with their "own free will" on July 1 this year. The man, works for an e-commerce platform in Delhi, and the woman is a final year nursing student. The woman's family owns farms in Shamli and are associated with ‘khaps’. According to police sources, the couple had eloped and the woman's brother and father approached police and filed a case of "kidnapping". A police team from Shamli then went to the man's house and arrested his father and brother whose whereabouts were not shared with the family for over a month. “The couple had approached the Delhi HC seeking protection and requested the man's father and brother be released. The HC came down heavily on the cops, saying that they had violated the law at every step and made the arrests without even informing local police,” said Avdhesh Kumar, the couple's lawyer. Speaking to TOI, SP (Shamli) said, "An IPS officer is now investigating the case and the role of Shamli police. Prima facie, we found that there was laxity in the conduct of these cops which is why they were suspended. A report will be submitted to the court and the government soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/shamli-sho-io-removed-after-del-hc-says-yeh-up-mein-chalta-hai/articleshow/87673656.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Four Mumbai wards show 1st dose coverage of only 40-55%: BMC||MUMBAI: Four Mumbai civic wards have low first dose coverage of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to an assessment carried out by the BMC. Wards found lagging were L from the eastern suburbs, R Central from western suburbs, and G North and B from south Mumbai.L (Kurla-Chunabhatti) is at the bottom with 40% first dose coverage and 24% second dose coverage. R Central (Borivli, Gorai) which has given the first shot to 44% and second dose to 37% is the second lowest. The first dose coverage of G north (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim and Shivaji Park), was 52% and that for the second dose was 35%. For the thinly populated B ward (Dongri and Umarkhadi), the first dose coverage was 55% and second dose 39%. To micro-analyse the actual coverage across 24 wards, BMC collated doses administered at vaccination centres in each ward and compared it with the ward’s estimated population. Findings are not fool-proof as CoWin doesn’t recognise geographical limits, said a civic official. But the exercise was carried out to get a rough idea about pockets where coverage is less. Mumbai has statistically achieved 100% first dose coverage on Friday. But there are wide variations. Several wards show 40-85% coverage while certain others have vaccinated more than 300% of their population, the data showed. D (Malabar Hill-Warden Road), for instance, has posted first dose coverage of 350%. Against an eligible population of 2.53lakh, 8.89lakh doses have been given. Similarly, A ward (Fort-Colaba-Churchgate) has registered single dose coverage of 192% and second dose coverage of 151%. At least 10 wards have more than 100% single dose coverage. An official said wards with more vaccination centres, or those that started early in the drive, have administered more doses. “It is, therefore, difficult to say, which ward has reached how much coverage accurately. People in Kurla, for instance, could have got vaccinated elsewhere,” the official said. Officials of L ward said their first dose coverage (74%) and second dose (42%) was higher than what was deduced from the assessment. “More than 75% of the population lives in slums. They cannot afford any mode of transport other than trains, and hence people have got vaccinated. They may have taken the shots in other wards and hence may not be reflecting in L ward figures,” said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical officer of L ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-city-wards-show-1st-dose-coverage-of-only-40-55-in-mumbai-bmc/articleshow/87674446.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The court also slapped a fine of Rs 1.6 lakh on the convict. The convict is a native of Vengamedu in Karur district. The victims aged 10, 12 and 13 were residing in the same locality. As they lost their father, their mother has been taking care of them. The convict used to perform puja in his house and often invited the girls to provide ‘Pongal’ as prasadam. On one instance, he asked the girls to come one by one to get Pongal. During that time, he sexually harassed the three girls separately. When the mother came to know about this, she lodged a complaint with the Vengamedu police in 2019. Based on the compliant, police registered a case under various IPC section including Pocso Act and arrested him. As the hearing concluded, the mahila court judge pronounced the judgments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-gets-25-years-jail-for-sexually-harassing-3-minors/articleshow/87674435.cms||---

The observations came when the director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) said the forensic report in a bribery case was delayed due to shortage of staff. The court had sought an explanation for the delay. The court noted that the director had gone into the details about the workload on an officer of the level of SSOII (physics) and his involvement in many high-profile cases across India. The director also mentioned 302 cases had been pending with CFSL, some since 2015. “Shortage of staff is no justification for delay in giving the expert opinion reports, which has a direct bearing on the trial of serious and heinous offences. The agency is expected to take up the matter of shortage of staff with the authorities concerned and this cannot be taken as a ready-made excuse or justification..., whenever called upon by the courts to showcause for enormous delay on its part,” special judge Santosh Snehi Mann said on Monday. The judge further said the chargesheet was filed without the expert opinion and, hence, a lot of judicial time was wasted as cognisance could not be taken. The court allowed a week’s time to the investigating officer after being informed that CBI had received the report, but it had been pending administrative approval for filing before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/courts-concern-over-300-cases-pending-at-cfsl/articleshow/87674437.cms||Usha Das

The high turnout for National Achievement Survey (NAS), despite the apprehensions and misgivings of parents, was encouraging for schools, which are set to reopen their campuses in phases from Tuesday. Educationists viewed the exercise as a confidence-booster for resumption of physical classes. The students were the most delighted to be back to school. The masks did hide the smiles but could hardly veil the excitement and glee apparent on the children’s faces. Though initially unsure about sending their wards to school amid the pandemic, parents, too, seemed glad to allow their children to appear for the in-person NAS test. Nine out of 10 parents gave their consent, leading to an attendance of over 90% at most schools. Maximum 30 students were allocated to a class on an average. The CBSE conducted the exams nationwide, on instructions from the education ministry, to check how teaching-learning had progressed during the Covid pandemic, during which campuses were shut and studies shifted online. In Bengal, 3,165 schools affiliated to various boards were selected for the exercise. Children of classes III, V, VIII and X were tested for language, maths, social sciences and science, depending on the standards they are in. Classes III and V took their test from 10.30am to noon, while the exams for the higher classes ended at 12.30pm. All the children of chosen classes reached their schools between 8am and 8.30am for attendance, which was taken by CBSE-appointed observers. After this, a draw of lots selected 30 children from each class for the test. “I loved it. There was no syllabus and we just randomly prepared for the test. We didn’t even know whether we would get a chance to write the test or not because only a small number was to get selected by lottery, but we were happy preparing. The best bit was that we could once again sit in our classrooms and write a pen-and-paper test. It was a relief,” said Aratrika Das, a Class-X student at South Point School. “Before the survey, I was both nervous and excited. But the questions put me at ease as I knew the answers to most. It felt so unreal to be back in school with my friends after 20 months of staying away. We feel said that we won’t be coming to school from Tuesday as we are from junior classes,” said Ojaswee Thaldi, a student of Class V at Sushila Birla Girls’ School. Of the 119 students of Class V at this school, 108 entered the school before 8am. Teachers of host schools did not enter the survey rooms that were designated for the test since the entire affair was managed by teachers of other schools, appointed as observers. Field investigators were appointed by the state education department to ensure the test went off smoothly. In some schools, like St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, where children of Class III took part in the survey, special precautions were taken so that there was no crowding anywhere as masked kids walked in, sanitised their hands and went straight to the survey rooms for their attendance and training on how to use the OMR sheets. “We were taught in school on how to use the OMR sheet. I could write the test so well,” said little Sounavo Ghoshal. Parents wearing masks and maintaining social distancing waited patiently outside, after dropping their kids off at the school gates. Many had taken the day off to accompany their children to exam centres. They admitted they were initially apprehensive about sending their children to school before the formal reopening but later, they were glad that the gave the consent. “We debated a lot in the parents’ social media groups. Many said they would not send their kids even after physical reopening and so, there was no question of sending the children now. But later, many saw reason in the whole arrangement, especially after the school assured us of taking all safety measures. But now I am happy and relieved that we took the plunge,” said advocate Praloy Chowdhury, who spent the day outside South Point, as his child wrote the exam inside .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/90-students-take-nas-happy-to-be-back-in-school-after-20-months/articleshow/87674444.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

On Friday, Naik also filed a complaint with the state's vigilance department over the issue. In a press note, AAP pointed out that the CEO of ESG, Tariq Thomas wrote to PWD based on AAP’s complaint “to examine the issue urgently and take necessary action” while also calling for the original report from PWD. Naik has alleged that the exterior painting work that is being carried out in the ESG premises is being done by PWD without issuing a work order. “PWD had put a work order of exterior painting worth 70 lakh. The tenders should have been submitted by 3pm on November 9, and they were supposed to be opened on November 10. The tender was supposed to be awarded to the lowest bidder. But the work of exterior painting has been completed before the bid and that too without a work order,” Naik had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-esg-has-written-to-pwd-after-our-plaint/articleshow/87674436.cms||---

One block of a residential society located in Motera in Chandkheda area was declared a micro-containment zone on Friday, a day after Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) resumed containment of buildings. In case of the Motera housing society, 20 houses with 76 residents were under quarantine. On Thursday, the civic body had micro-contained one block of a society in Isanpur — the first after a gap of six months. AMC had discontinued the practice of putting buildings in micro-containment in the last week of May. Elsewhere, in the state, daily Covid cases halved in the last 24 hours. The five Gujarat cities account for 71% cases. After the spike in daily cases to 42 and 40 in the past two days, the Covid-19 positive cases again dipped on Friday with the state recording 21 cases. Of these, 15 or 71% of the cases were from the five cities. The new Covid positive cases include 6 from Vadodara city, 3 each from Surat city and Valsad, 2 each from Ahmedabad, Jamnagar and Rajkot cities, and 1 each from Junagadh, Kutch and Surendranagar districts. Friday recorded cases from 5 cities and 4 districts. “We may need a few more days to ascertain whether the spike was a warning bell, or was due to the Diwali festivities and an one-off anomaly. But as we had experienced the first wave after Diwali last year, it’s always better to keep guards on,” said a city-based critical care specialist. With discharge of 35 patients, the active cases dropped by 14 to 220. Ahmedabad and Vadodara have the highest active cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/motera-society-put-in-containment-second-in-city-in-2-days/articleshow/87673669.cms||---
---||Pune||Two weeks on, PMC repairs pipeline & restores supply||PUNE: Two weeks after the raw water pipeline that supplies water to the Cantonment works burst, the Pune Municipal Corporation completed repair and restored supply at full capacity. The pipeline had burst in Sinhagad Road area before Diwali. Officials from the PMC’s water supply department said the repairs were completed at the beginning of the week after which the pipeline was inspected for the last few days. “No leakage was found during the inspection,” said an official. The civic administration is usually able to complete restoration work in two to three days after incidents of burst or leakages. Civic sources said it took more time to complete the repairs because some parts and material were not readily available. “The pipeline was laid 20 years ago and parts are not available in the market. We placed an order and procured the material which lead to some delay,” said an official. Administration sources said replacing the entire pipeline is under consideration. “Replacing the existing pipeline will be a major task as it is a big pipeline that covers a long distance up to the Cantonment water works. We will first check its status and based on that, a further call on replacing it can be taken,” said a source. The civic administration had been lifting about 50MLD water from the irrigation canal since the last two weeks due to the pipeline burst. With repairs complete, the optimum flow of water from the pipeline will ensure adequate supply to areas like Hadapsar, Kondhwa, Mundhwa, Kharadi. The damaged stretch of the road is yet to be restored completely. The pipeline burst caused major damage to a 50-metre stretch with two lanes being closed for traffic. The administration will open lanes for traffic after completion of resurfacing work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-weeks-on-pmc-repairs-pipeline-restores-supply/articleshow/87674438.cms||---

The deceased, Subhash Singh (62), had supported one Ramashankar Singh Chauhan in the panchayat election. Chauhan was elected as the mukhiya of Kharatia panchayat on October 27 after defeating Saheb Hussain, who had pressurised the trader on many occasions to campaign for him. Mirganj police station SHO Chhotan Kumar said Hussain was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. “He is the prime suspect in the murder case,” he said. Kumar said Hussain wanted Singh to campaign in his support due to his influence in the village. “They developed enmity over the issue and it escalated after Hussain lost the election,” the SHO said. “Singh was shot multiple times while he was asleep in front of his house. He died on the spot. His family members came out after hearing the gunshots,” the SHO said.

---||Madurai||As cases drop, Covid-19 block to be shifted to old GRH building||MADURAI: More than 19 months after the newly-built super speciality block (SSB) of the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was dedicated for Covid patients, the hospital on Friday announced that the Covid block will be shifted to the Old Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) block of the main GRH building from this weekend. The decision to shift the block to a relatively smaller facility has been taken as there is a drastic drop in the number of patients getting treated for Covid-19. Also, there is an increase in the number of cases requiring super speciality care in the urology, nephrology, medical gastroenterology, surgical gastroenterology, neurology and neuro surgery departments that functioned in the SSB. Resident Medical Officer (RMO) A Srilatha said that the 450 to 500 bed SSB was dedicated as a Covid block in April, 2020. “The number of beds was increased to 900 during the peak of the second wave earlier this year,” she said. The block was the key tertiary care facility for most southern districts.But the number of patients who were admitted came down below 100 by the end of June. “Since the beginning of July it has been below 80 patients and between 50 and 60 in August. It peaked to 70 in September when there were rumours of a third wave. It came below 50 in the next few days and has been well within that range. It even went down to 25 last week,” the RMO said. On Thursday, the block had only 39 patients. Under these circumstances the heads of the six super speciality departments made a representation to the dean to shift their facilities back to the SSB. Hospital dean A Rathinavel said that the shifting will be carried out in a phase manned on Saturday and Sunday. The Covid-19 testing facility, outpatient and inpatient wards will be shifted to the first and second floors of the old O&G block, starting with the shifting of stable patients on Saturday. The entire facility including sample collection for RT-PCR test will be done there from Sunday. The Covid block in the Old O&G building will have 150 beds including ICU and will be more than enough to cater to the requirements in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-cases-drop-covid-block-to-be-shifted-to-old-grh-building/articleshow/87675149.cms||---

Sardesai said that the construction of the Western Bypass by filling low-lying paddy fields would cause massive flooding in Mungul and Maddel. Stating that he has been fighting for the construction of the bypass on stilts in these flood-prone areas, Sardesai said his suggestion was upheld by the 10-member committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to study objections raised with regard to construction of the bypass in this area. Former Benaulim sarpanch Royla Fernandes had moved the NGT pointing out that the construction of the Western Bypass on earthen embankments through the villages Seraulim to Benaulim would lead to water stagnation resulting in flooding and inundation of houses located in the vicinity. The residents have been demanding that the road be constructed on stilts. Sardesai, on Friday, telephonically discussed the issue with PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar, who is learnt to have promised to commence the work only after Sardesai is convinced that the present road work was just to create an access to facilitate the construction of the bypass on stilts. Sardesai, however, expressed doubts on the government’s intentions as a 15m road was not necessary as “access” and that “there existed past instances of the government going back on its word, including in an assurance given by the chief minister on the floor of the Goa Legislative Assembly” to him on this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-halts-western-bypass-work-at-fatorda-says-build-it-on-stilts/articleshow/87674450.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Survey a dress rehearsal for Tuesday reopening’||Kolkata: Friday’s on-campus exams for the National Achievement Survey (NAS) was like a dress rehearsal for school re-opening, felt authorities. Schools in the state are scheduled to reopen their campuses from Tuesday after remaining closed since March 2020, though some did open for a brief period in February before they were again forced to shut down as Covid cases started rising. School heads said that as children as young as those in classes III and V walked in for the NAS test, it helped build confidence and paved the way for a surer re-opening on Tuesday. Sanitization of classrooms where the exams took place, placing hand-sanitizers at vantage points, thermal checking, distanced seating and ensuring that each child kept the mask on for the entire duration of the test gave school authorities the much-needed practice to once again bring children to school for physical classes. “It feels unreal after such a long time. But seeing children in uniform around me, happily making their way to the exam room, following every Covid-safety norm encouraged me,” said Meena Kak, director at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Echoing her, Sushila Birla Girls’ School principal Koeli Dey said, “Class V in our school participated in NAS. Those children are much younger than those who will come in from Tuesday. Since we could handle the younger ones successfully, we are sure about the older ones. Tuesday will be a big day for every school,” she said. NAS gave schools an added opportunity to connect with parents, who were initially apprehensive about sending their children to school. But now that the day has gone off so well, it will send a positive message to the parents, who are yet to give their consent for their wards to go to school on Tuesday, school heads felt. “The entire atmosphere of the school changed as the Class-III students entered. The ice seemed to have automatically melted and we will now follow the same regimen for our senior students who are coming back on Tuesday. Life will come back to school, God willing,” said Father Rodney Borneo, principal at St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar. At South Point School, 340 students of classes VIII and X came for the test. “We are happy Class X got a feel of the real exam hall before they come in for the offline board exams,” said Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharya, principal of the school. Most schools arranged for an isolation-cum-sick room with a doctor and a nurse ready during the exam hours. School heads said this would become a permanent feature now so that any child feeling unwell or even uncomfortable can be taken there for a check-up. After the NAS ended, children were given a questionnaire on how they were taught in online classes and how willing the teachers were to help them out. As the students spent additional time at school filling the form, some institutes arranged for dry food for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/survey-a-dress-rehearsal-for-tuesday-reopening/articleshow/87674451.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Nagpur||Ngp ‘vulnerable’ to drugs misuse by kids, FDA to alert pharmacies||Nagpur: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Nagpur division, plans to alert pharmacists to practice caution, especially with minors, while selling scheduled drugs (X, H and H1). The move is as part of Central government-driven joint action plan for ‘Prevention of drug and substance abuse among the children and illicit trafficking’. The agency would also appeal to the chemist shops to install CCTV cameras, especially at those located near schools and colleges.In Maharashtra, the special drive would be concentrated in Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune and Nashik, cities the central government has labelled as ‘highly vulnerable’ as far as drug abuse and illicit trafficking is concerned.The action aims at curtailing drug sale and consumption in the vicinity of schools and child care institutions to prevent misuse of drugs and substance abuse by children, It has been planned and formulated with a time-bound goal by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights in collaboration with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Following directions from its state head office, FDA, Nagpur, would soon address the chemists and pharmacy owners to create awareness regarding the sale of the scheduled drugs like Alprazolam. They would be directed to maintain proper records of sales of special drugs as per the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940, following the protocols of the ‘Management information system on record keeping of schedule drugs’.Asst commissioner of FDA PM Ballal, who would soon take up the programme under supervision of joint commissioner Viraj Paunikar, said there are instances of misuse of drugs like Alprazolam by youngsters for intoxication. “Chemists having shops near schools and colleges would be asked to practice caution and appeal them to install CCTV cameras to keep a watch on youngsters visiting their pharmacies,” he said.Meanwhile, city police had registered an unprecedented 216 cases related to narcotics till October this year and arrested 286 persons. Narcotics worth Rs2.50 crore were seized this year so far. “In a joint meeting attended by FDA officials, police asked pharmacies that any scheduled drug being sold without prescriptions and labels would draw legal action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngp-vulnerable-to-drugs-misuse-by-kids-fda-to-alert-pharmacies/articleshow/87673671.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||NAS test held smoothly in dist, say officials||Nagpur: The National Achievement Survey (NAS), wherein students are tested on their comprehension of core subjects, was held across the country on Friday. In Nagpur district, the exam was held in randomly chosen 232 schools for almost 7,000 students. The test, which was held all over the country, will help authorities get a better picture of learning gaps that lockdown may have resulted in, apart from the regular purpose of formulating academic policies. Milind Wankhede, chief of Vidarbha Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, had opposed holding the exam for at least the younger kids. “We had demanded that the date should have been pushed forward. There are two reasons for it, first is the safety point and second is academic. Due to the lockdown there has been a learning gap which we can cover once physical classes start. So, holding NAS now will show poor results which won’t be accurate due to the prevailing situation,” said Wankhede. According to education officials, the test went off smoothly. CBSE, which is administering the test, will also be deploying its special software to track either individuals or exam centres that indulge in unfair practices. NAS being a non-core exam has sometimes been susceptible to allegations that teachers prompt answers to students, just to boost the marks. While authorities don’t accept that such a thing may have happened, they are moving ahead with mechanisms which may ultimately negate any chance of such things happening. CBSE says its special software that will identify cheaters will help to strengthen the reliability of NAS. While CBSE is using technology to increase fairness in NAS, the Maharashtra government has formed an Education Technology Forum. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The forum will serve as an open platform for free exchange of ideas on the use of technology to enhance learning, assessment, planning and administration of schools.” She said that senior representatives from Google, Microsoft, Cognizant, Persistent, Dell, Amazon, C-DAC among others will be part of this forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nas-test-held-smoothly-in-dist-say-officials/articleshow/87674478.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

They would ask us what if they died immediately after the shot. We allayed those fears, saying we have taken the vaccine too and we were alive and working,” she says. In the 10 months after vaccinating thousands safely, even the tiniest of apprehension has disappeared, she says.

Two of his friends have been arrested for murder while a hunt is on for the third one, police said. The killing was the result of a petty dispute over distribution of liquor among them, police said. A daily wager who made plaster of paris ceilings, Ravindra had been out with his friends -- Akash Singh, Manoj Chaudhary and Kala -- but never returned home. His friends, all in their early 20s, claimed that he had left them in the middle of the road and gone off on his own. Unable to locate him, Ravindra’s family filed a missing complaint with police. While interrogating the three friends, one of them admitted to killing Ravindra and burying his body in the sugarcane field. A fight had broken out over liquor distribution and Ravindra allegedly had abused two of his friends. “Angry, his friends killed him,” Ajay Kumar, SHO, Baghpat Kotwali. “Akash accepted that he had killed Ravindra with the help of Manoj and Kala.

Pouch is part of the evidence in the alleged encounter case investigated by additional DCP J Surender Reddy. The constable’s denial came following commission’s advocate showing him medical records submitted by Care Hospital superintendent Dr Charles which indicated that he had collected the belongings of constable Aravindh Goud and SI Venkateshwarulu from the hospital. While Srikanth admitted he did take Goud’s gold chain, ring and belt at the emergency room of the hospital, he claimed he did not remember receiving the SI’s shoes, watch, yellow colour ring, belt, purse and pistol pouch as mentioned in the hospital records. When commission’s advocate asked why he had signed if he had not taken the articles, Srikanth said, “They had told me to sign as I had brought them to the hospital. I was in tension. I did not take the articles of SI.” Srikanth also stated the SI’s articles were not removed at the Shadnagar community health centre where he was taken soon after the alleged encounter On whether the SI was conscious while being taken from Shadnagar to Care Hospital, the head constable initially said that he heard the former say ‘amma’ while being put in the ambulance. Probed further, the head constable, however, claimed that he was not sure if the SI was conscious because during the journey he was sitting with the driver and didn’t notice the SI after reaching Care hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cop-denies-he-received-injured-sis-pistol-pouch/articleshow/87674453.cms||Mahesh Buddi

He said Annamalai has only been a police officer and should remain calm on this issue as he does not know anything about Tamil Nadu. Vaiko said Kerala has been making false claims that the strong Periyar dam is weak so that it could get adequate water for Idukki dam. He said Periyar dam is strong enough to hold water till 152 feet but the Apex Court has given its verdict that water can be stored only till 142 feet. This being the case, Kerala government should put an end to its efforts to demolish Periyar dam. He said the neighbouring state could build 48 check dams from Periyar dam to Idukki dam at Pulmedu, Vallakadavu, Vandiperiyar, Maanjamalai, Pasumalai, Thenga Kal, Chengarai, Upputhurai, Sappari, Aaladi and Mariakulam to improve water storage. He added that water level in Idukki dam should be reduced and maintained at 444 feet – that is 111 feet from its full reservoir capacity – as monsoon preparedness. Efforts should be taken to strengthen baby dam and to mend the damaged Vallakadau - Mullaperiyar dam road. Reiterating that the Mullaiperiyar dam issue has already been resolved, he said the people of Tamil Nadu will not be mute spectators to any effort to demolish the dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/focus-on-idukki-dam-inflow-vaiko-to-kerala/articleshow/87675152.cms||---

The long-pending demand of city residents to have a statue of the saint will be fulfilled soon. The Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple committee took the initiative and completed the task of making a 12-ft tall statue at a cost of Rs 9 lakh. Now, committee members are waiting for the CM to unveil the statue. Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple is one of the oldest temples in the city. Saint Channabasaveshwar had arrived in Dharwad in the 12th century while on his way to Ulavi from Kalyana to create awareness about vachana literature. He stayed here for some time at UB hills, Dharwad. In his memory, Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple was built at UB hills. Sources said the temple committee is building a pedestal at the junction on the way to the Dharwad railway station and head post office. The committee had requested HDMC to provide space for the statue and it was approved in 2004. Temple governing body chairman SR Ramanagoudar told TOI, “The installation of the statue of Channabasaveshwar is our long pending demand since 2004. Now the demand has been fulfilled. Work has been completed and the statue is ready to be unveiled. We are waiting for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to inaugurate it officially.” Temple trustee TS Patil said the 12-ft tall bronze statue was designed and made by an artist from Kolhapur at a cost of Rs 9 lakh. The entire circle has been decorated with plants and the statue will be unveiled soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ulavi-channabasaveshwar-statue-in-dharwad-waiting-to-be-unveiled-by-cm-bommai/articleshow/87673390.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Khurshid’s remark not appropriate: Former MP||Hyderabad: After Ghulam Nabi Azad termed Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s comparison of Hindutva with ISIS and Boko Haram an exaggeration, another former MP of the Congress, MA Khan, has found fault with Khurshid’s remark. Khan, who hails from Telangana, and has served as Rajya Sabha member for two terms, on Friday extended support to Ghulam Nabi’s comment that the comparison is an exaggeration. “I personally do not support the kind of Hindutva the BJP has been promoting. But the Congress is a secular party and a majority of Hindus are secular. It is not appropriate to make such a comparison. I condemn it,” he told TOI over phone from New Delhi. Former Union minister Salman Khurshid in his book ‘Sunrise over Ayodhya’ which was released recently, compared Hindutva to ISIS and Boko Haram, triggering a controversy with BJP leaders burning his effigies at various places in the country.  Azad had criticised his party colleague Khurshid for his remarks. “In Mr. Salman Khurshid’s new book, we may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from the composite culture of Hinduism, but comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Jihadist Islam is factually wrong and an exaggeration,” Azad had tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/khurshids-remark-not-appropriate-former-mp/articleshow/87674471.cms||Roushan Ali

The month-long period for filing objections and suggestions ends on November 30. The BLAs are tasked with assisting election officials in the revision of the electoral rolls by giving information about voters who have shifted or passed away during the pandemic.

---||Hyderabad||Protect India from subversive forces, says NSA Ajit Doval to IPS officers||HYDERABAD: The new frontier of warfare was about dividing civil society and IPS officers must be at the forefront of this battle to keep the nation intact, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval said in his address to the IPS trainees at the SVP National Police Academy (SVPNPA) in the city on Friday. “Wars ceased to become effective instrument to achieve political and military objectives. They are too expensive, unaffordable and there’s uncertainty about its outcome. It is the civil society that can be subverted, divided and manipulated to hurt the interest of the nation. You are there to see that this land is fully protected,” Doval said. Doval, a former Alumni of the Academy, was the chief guest at the ‘Dikshant Parade’ of 2020 batch on Friday which saw 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees participating. NSA Ajit Doval pays tribute to martyred cops at the police academy“People are most important. The new frontier of war, which is called the fourth generation of warfare, is civil society,” he said. He also emphasised the greater role of police in border management spanning over 15,000 km covering Pakistan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. He said managing the 32-lakh square km of India was the responsibility of police forces. “But it will extend. You will be responsible for border management of this country. 15,000 km of the border, most of it has got peculiar problems of its own,” he added. Doval said there were different types of security issues in each border. “There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organizations,” he added. Doval’s comments on greater policing comes a day after the Punjab assembly adopted a resolution against the Centre' for extending the jurisdiction of the BSF, which the Punjab assembly said was an insult. Emphasising on the individual ability of officers, Doval said: “Enforcement of law will depend on your efficiency, your commitment, your values, your attitude and your performance. There implementation becomes more important that legislation. No nation can be built where rule of law has failed. People cannot feel safe where law enforcers are weak, corrupt and partitioned. I found many of these values were enshrined in the oath which you have taken. Enforce the law in that spirit.” Turning the clock back 52 years when he had passed out, Doval stressed that the tag ‘IPS’ was their common identity which should bind them in gratitude for the training at the Academy as they march forward in their careers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsa-to-ips-officers-protect-country-from-subversive-forces/articleshow/87674496.cms||---

Thousands of villagers from various cities, including Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Amroha, reached the pilgrimage centre on tractors, trollies and other vehicles. Leaving no stone unturned to woo the pilgrims, political parties put up large hoardings all across the ghats. Three prominent fairs of Ganga Snan take place in West UP, including Amroha's Tigri, Hapur's Garhmukteshwar and Bijnor's Vidurkuti, where lakhs of devotees congregate every year. The snan is followed by fairs lasting up to six days. At Vidur Kuti too, devotees have started gathering to celebrate the festival, with a large number of them setting up camps there. Making most of the occasion, political parties, too, have started camping at the fair venues. BJP's Bijnor district president, Subhash Valmiki, said, "Our party is putting up hoardings to apprise people of the welfare schemes sponsored by state and Union governments. Religious fairs are a way to reach out to masses.” BSP district president, Jitendra Sagar, too jumped in, saying, "People know everything. They know such fairs are informative.” While other parties talked about the fairs and their significance, RLD senior leader, Praveen Deshwal, took a swipe at his opponents, saying hoardings only scarred the ghats. "This time, when there are no rallies, hoardings are being put up to scar the venues,” he said. Speaking to TOI, SB Sharma, AMA, district panchayat, said, “The fair will be inaugurated next week. All preparations are in place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-lakh-devotees-expected-for-ganga-snan/articleshow/87673705.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot meets Sonia Gandhi, says decision on Rajasthan cabinet reshuffle ‘very soon’||JAIPUR: Amid speculation over cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in Rajasthan, former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Friday and expressed confidence that a decision on the expected rejig will be taken "very soon" keeping in mind factors such as credibility, performance, regional and caste balance. His near hour-long meeting came a day after Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met Gandhi. The two leaders are learnt to have discussed the political situation as well as the impending cabinet reshuffle in the state. Speaking to reporters after meeting Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence, Pilot said, “Whatever the Congress party wants me to do, I am more than happy to do. In the last 20 years, whatever job has been assigned, I have done it diligently and now also whatever the party decides, what role I should have... I am happy to do it.” “Extensive discussions took place about Rajasthan, the government, party organisation, and I put forward my points about the political situation in the state. I am happy that the Congress president is constantly taking interest in Rajasthan and is taking feedback about the work of the government and organisation,” Pilot said. He said the committee that Gandhi had formed to look into the issues raised by him about a year ago has also completed its work, and general secretary organisation KC Venugopal along with AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken have been submitting reports from time to time. “The party high command is also talking about taking action on the points we had put forward last year, and I think very soon decisions will be taken on it,” he said. Pilot has been demanding cabinet expansion and appointments to boards and corporations in the state for long. He has been insisting that Congress workers and leaders working closely with him for the party should be given their due.“I think whatever changes that need to be made in the government and organisation, the AICC and the chief minister will decide at an appropriate time. But now less than two years time is left for the next election and we want to fight the next election with full strength as the tradition of alternating Congress and BJP governments has to be broken,” he said. “This time we want to make the organisation very strong. The workers should get respect, everyone's participation is important, there should be balance in power, and we should move forward taking all sections of the society along,” he said. “The Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2024, so it is necessary to repeat the government in Rajasthan. I think that if the government and the organisation work strongly, then surely we will be able to do it,” he said. A major reshuffle is on cards in the state in the next few days and various modalities are being worked out, according to sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-meets-sonia-says-decision-on-cabinet-reshuffle-very-soon/articleshow/87675186.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Phase-II of dust drive begins, NBCC site fined Rs 5 lakh, says environment minister Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai said a fine of Rs 5 lakh had been imposed on NBCC for flouting anti-dust norms at its construction site in Karkardooma. Rai, who inspected the site to mark the beginning of the second phase of the anti-dust campaign on Friday, said, “To mark the commencement of the Kejriwal government’s Anti-Dust Campaign 2.0, we conducted a surprise inspection of the NBCC construction site in Karkardooma. While the ongoing project checks most of the regulation boxes, a few violations have been found. We have imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on NBCC so that all rules and regulations are adhered to in future.” During phase 1, 2,500 construction sites were inspected by the teams of Delhi Pollution Control Committee and around 450 sites were found to be violating the rules and regulations. A total fine of Rs 1.3 crore was imposed on these sites for failing to prevent dust pollution. The Delhi government has issued a 14-point guideline for all construction and demolition sites. Rai said, “All our dedicated teams will work together to curb dust pollution, majorly coming from construction sites and increasing PM2.5 and PM10 levels. All agencies in Delhi consisting of 25 departments have been instructed to form their respective anti-dust cells. All construction sites in Delhi will be actively visited and inspected, and reported for violations.” Phase 1 of the campaign was run in October. On the sources of pollution in the city, Rai said, “The current levels of pollution are increasing due to the consistent increase in stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. A total of 45,000 such instances have been reported till now. The impact of this staggering number is being witnessed by the people of Delhi as the air is accumulating more impurities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/phase-ii-of-dust-drive-begins-nbcc-site-fined-rs-5-lakh-says-rai/articleshow/87674502.cms||---
---||Delhi||Unnerving Delhi: Bad air hits heart, lungs; hospitals report strike in admissions||NEW DELHI: Pollution has become a health emergency in Delhi-NCR. Hospitals reported patients rushing in with complaints of chest congestion, cough and difficulty in breathing — symptoms now synonymous with polluted winter days in Delhi. Many require admission, the hospitals claimed. “We are getting 12-14 patients daily in the emergency, mostly at night, when the symptoms cause disturbed sleep and panic,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals. According to Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Gurugram, nearly 70% of the ICU beds are occupied by people with respiratory problems. “A majority of them have pre-existing respiratory problems but pollution aggravates them,” he said. “We also have patients with no history of respiratory illness but suffering from acute bronchitis, breathlessness and other complications that necessitate hospitalisation.” Safdarjung, AIIMS, Sir Ganga Ram, Max, Akash Super-specialty and Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital, among others, also disclosed a rise in hospitalisations due to respiratory complications. “My father is a heart patient and my wife has asthma. None of us are stepping out for the fear of respiratory setbacks,” said Nikhil Sharma of Malviya Nagar. “Yet we constantly worry that someone will fall seriously sick.” The 39-year-old added that he bought two air purifiers for home use recently despite being aware of the limited evidence available about their efficacy in reducing the impact of pollution. “Something is better than nothing,” Sharma said. The bad air is also affecting heart patients and people with neurological disorders. High levels of pollutants in the atmosphere, studies show, can trigger stroke in people with neurological disorders. Patients suffering from heart failure and coronary artery disease can also have their conditions worsened by poor air quality, research shows. Doctors advise such people to remain indoors and avoid morning walks until the air quality improved. “Every day six-seven patients come to the OPD complaining of burning and watery eyes and breathing issues caused by pollution,” said Dr (Col) Vijay Dutta of the internal medicine & respiratory medicine department at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre. “The numbers were lower in mid-October, but began rising at the beginning of November. Around 10 patients are currently admitted with such conditions,” Dutta said, adding that asthmatic people should stay indoors and if they need to go out, to wear masks to minimise the inhalation of toxic air. Dr Sunil Nakra, director of paediatrics at Madhukar Rainbow Hospital, warned that small children were also at high risk of developing complications on prolonged exposure to high levels of pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unnerving-delhi-bad-air-hits-heart-lungs-hosps-report-spike-in-admissions/articleshow/87675617.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Two-year-old Nitya was bidding adieu to the place that was her home for the last six months. The officials and also her friends at the children’s home, who all would surely miss the bubbly girl, were feeling a bit low. But the overwhelming emotion was that of joy, for Nitya got a new family and a new life on Friday. The Nimkar couple from Vadodara, who always wanted a girl child, completed the formality of adopting Nitya on Friday. With it being the first adoption from the city in 2021, district collector Aayush Oak was present on the occasion and handed over the custody of the child to her new parents. The Nimkars fell in love with Nitya at first sight. “After we saw Nitya for the first time we immediately decided to adopt her. We are very blessed to have her in our life,” said Umang Nimkar, an employee of an insurance company. Umang’s wife, Sapna, is a school teacher. “We first applied to adopt a child in 2011. Later, in 2014 we applied through child adoption portal CARA. Ours is a close family and what we were missing was a girl child. We always wanted a girl child,” Umang added. Hemant Gamit, manager, specialized child adoption agency, told TOI that the VR Popawala Children Home currently houses 11 children — seven boys and four girls — between the age of one month to five years. “Due to Covid-19 the adoption process was discontinued for some time. This is the first adoption from Surat after the pandemic. Officials are very happy as the child has got a family and her future is secured. Nitya was a handed over child. Umang had applied via CARA and after finishing all legal formalities his application was approved,” said Gamit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/2-yr-old-surat-girl-steals-vadodara-couples-hearts/articleshow/87674538.cms||---

Goa Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has failed in his promise to regularise contractual teachers working under the Goa Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. Mardolkar said that the BJP government has pushed these teachers towards a “dark fate” during Diwali, and forced them to launch an agitation. “It may be recalled that these teachers had temporarily withdrawn their strike on the eve of Diwali, but have now resumed their strike after claiming they were unhappy with the chief minister’s offer,” said Mardolkar. “When these teachers are doing good work to mould our students, they should be respected and their contribution should be acknowledged by regularising them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-failed-to-regularise-teachers/articleshow/87674505.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||AIIMS Nagpur to start conducting post-mortems||Nagpur: The medico-legal sector in Vidarbha is set to get a boost as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, is soon going to start conducting post-mortems at it’s upcoming state-of-the-art forensic facility. Phase one of the project is nearing completion with the AIIMS authorities gearing up to hold a meeting with the city police top brass for future collaborations on medico-legal aspects. Sources from AIIMS said the first phase would have a mortuary, cold storage, doctor’s chamber, police panchnama room and mourners’ hall to begin with. With the civil construction work of phase one in the final leg, the fine-tuning of the department is being monitored and supervised by an expert team led by prof and head of the forensic department Dr Manish Shrigiriwar under the supervision of AIIMS’ director and CEO major general Dr Vibha Dutta, SM. In phase II, AIIMS Nagpur is likely to have ‘virtual autopsy’ for dignified management of bodies on the lines of its Delhi counterparts where the post-mortem process can be completed using a CT scan and MRI and without having to wholly dissect the body. An autopsy auditorium is also among the facilities planned for the next stage with a 50-seat capacity. Yet another significant inclusion of phase II of the project, which would have a ground floor and another storey, is the toxicology department where a round-the-clock ‘poison information centre’ would be functional. Experts manning the centre would help interpret the effect of the poison and its antidote even to a remote enquiry. DNA analysis is also set to be part of the second phase. TOI has already reported about the institution’s unique forensic museum adding weightage to the credibility of the medico-legal department. Though AIIMS would initially start with post-mortems of the few police stations in the vicinity like Sonegaon, it’s learnt the institution would gradually start handling more complicated and sensitive cases in the coming days. With AIIMS foraying into the medical-legal practices, the institution would expectedly take much load off the government medical college and hospital (GMCH) dealing with crucial cases in Vidarbha where deeper expertise is sought in sensitive crimes. “There is an elaborative plan in place to make the forensic department at AIIMS Nagpur one of the best in Central India where most of the important cases would be dealt with in the near future,” said Prof Dr Manish Shrigiriwar, adding several modern facilities would made available along with the experts to interpret the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aiims-nagpur-to-start-conducting-post-mortems/articleshow/87674510.cms||Soumitra Bose

He cited personal reasons for not being able to appear before the police. “I am unable to travel out of Jaipur for one week as my father is not well and I have been advised not to leave him,” he said. In the meanwhile, the OSD had moved a petition in the Delhi high court seeking an early hearing on his petition seeking to quash the FIR against him. The counsel for Delhi police opposed the OSD's plea seeking early hearing, contending that there was “no urgency” as a June 3 order passed by the high court had clearly granted him protection from arrest. However, he can't stall the investigation in the garb of the order, the counsel said. In his reply, Sharma said, “If there is any urgency, I am available via video-conferencing at a suitable time. If any information is needed from my end, you are requested to provide me with a questionnaire,” he told police. In view of the Delhi police clarification concerning protection from coercive action, the court said it would hear the case on January 13, as fixed earlier, and also issued notice on the Rajasthan government's plea to place on record certain documents in a sealed cover. Sharma had received the notice for questioning in the case for the third time. The fresh notice had stated that failure to attend or comply with the terms of the notice can render him liable for arrest under sections 41 A(3) and (4) of the CrPC. The investigating officer (IO) said in the notice that there exists reasonable suspicion that Sharma has committed a cognisable offence and directed him to appear before him on November 12. He had also laid down 10 conditions, including Sharma's assurance that he would not commit any offence in future, tamper with evidence or make any threats, sources said. The Delhi police had registered the FIR in March this year against Sharma on charges of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and unlawfully intercepting telegraphic signals (telephonic conversation) on a complaint by Shekhawat, who is also a BJP MP from Jodhpur. The phone-tapping controversy erupted in July last year in Rajasthan after audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Shekhawat and Congress leaders surfaced amid a rebellion against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot by his then deputy Sachin Pilot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phone-tapping-cms-osd-fails-toappear-before-delhi-police-again/articleshow/87675193.cms||---

On October 9, GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar had reviewed the progress of acquisition of properties with all its wings. “In view of the increased compensation value, the GHMC has initiated TDR Policy in acquiring the properties with minimum burden on the exchequer. Moreover, the property owners are also willing to part with their land while obtaining TDR certificates in lieu of cash compensation, since the demand for issue and utilisation of TDR has increased rapidly,” read an official release issued by the GHMC on Friday. Regarding land acquired in the last five years, the civic body officials said that a total of 89 roads have been taken up for road widening, out of which 55 roads have been constructed and 1,805 properties have been acquired. Under SRDP category, the GHMC acquired 1,100 properties and 192 properties under missing/slip roads category, and remaining 511 properties under general road widening category. A few major road widening/link roads, where acquisition of properties has been completed include Bio-Diversity Flyover, Shilparamam RUB, Rajiv Gandhi Flyover at JNTU, Road No.45, Stay Cable Bridge (Durgam Cheruvu), RUB at Hitech City, Underpass at Bairamalguda to Chintalkunta checkpost and flyovers in different areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-issues-864-tdrs-to-acquire-350-acres/articleshow/87674514.cms||---

The party went on to say that chief minister Pramod Sawant heads the “worst and most incompetent government” in Goa’s entire history. The party’s president, Swapnesh Sherlekar, said that PWD minister Deepak Pauskar’s acknowledgement, that Goa faces an acute water shortage, proves that the BJP government lied about water supply to every household. “Sawant is now brazenly promising 16,000 litres of free water to every household without even bothering to address the acute and chronic water shortage problems faced by Bardez, Pernem, Bicholim and a host of other villages,” said Sherlekar. Goencho Avaaz has demanded that the state government put together a plan to ensure adequate water supply, while also repairing the breach in the Tillari canal. “Never has any other government in Goa, apart from BJP, forced so many different groups of people to come out on the streets to protest for their basic rights. At the time of Manohar Parrikar’s tenure, it was announced in the assembly that the Assonora plant capacity would be increased. Five years later, there is barely any progress. The people of Goa have a right to know why the work order took so long to be issued and when their misery is going to end,” said the party’s convener Viriato Fernandes. Its vice-president, Roshan Mathias, said people must come together to vote out the BJP government. Meanwhile, Fernandes met former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, who has been appointed as Congress’ senior election observer and strategist for Goa's elections. “Our suggestion was that for the greater good of the state, for the time being, MGP and Congress must come together. We are willing to facilitate this. BJP is the primary destroyer of Goa.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Sub-inspector suspended after protest over Athmakur tribal’s ‘torture’||HYDERABAD: A day after villagers protested the alleged torture of a suspect in a theft case at Athmakur (S) police station in Suryapet, the sub-inspector (SI) has been suspended. Senior Suryapet district police officials said that SI M Lingaiah was suspended based on the report submitted by DSP (Suryapet division) to SP Rajendra Prasad. The probe against constable Mahesh for also allegedly beating the suspect, Dharawath Veerasekhar (25), was pending. “In preliminary oral enquiry, it was found that suspect Veerasekhar was beaten. But medical report to ascertain if he suffered any injuries is awaited,” the district police said. On Friday, DGP M Mahendar Reddy also took stock of the incident. Veerasekhar, a tribal, was called to the police station on Wednesday evening by Athmakur (S) police station as a suspect in its probe into theft of motor pumps from a farmer’s fields. Cops had earlier taken two others in custody and subsequently came to know that Veeraskehar was also with the duo. Veerasekhar was allowed to leave around 12 am on the condition that he would return on Thursday morning. He was handed over to his relatives who later found that he had become unconscious. Villagers alleged that he was tortured and held a protest on Thursday. “One constable took me away and I was beaten on my legs and hands with a belt. Three policemen are involved,” Veerasekhar had earlier told media. A few days ago, the Telangana High Court, while hearing a case of alleged police torture of a woman, Mariamma, who was found dead in Addaguduru police station a few months ago, had said that it was contemplating to order a CBI probe into it. SI has history of similar behaviour:The suspended sub-inspector of Athmakur (S) police station of Suryapet distirct, allegedly had a previous history of beating up a farmer. An year ago, while M Lingaiah was posted at Nagaram police station a farmer was called for investigation and he was beaten up. When the farmer approached district senior police officials, the subinspector was transferred and kept under Vaccany Reserve (VR). Few months later, he was posted at Athmakur (S), where is now facing the allegations of beating of a Veerasekhar after calling him for investigation as a suspect in a theft case. In the past too, similar incidents of police excesses were witnessed in Hyderabad and other parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/si-suspended-after-protest-over-athmakur-tribals-torture/articleshow/87674528.cms||---

A senior AMC official said the corporation is closely monitoring the situation and will further increase testing if the need arises. “We have already scaled up testing at entry points such as bus stands and railway stations. We are prepared to start setting up testing tents at various locations if the need arises.” He said the focus of the civic body is on fast coverage of second doses of vaccines. “In five days including today, we administered as many as 60,000 vaccine doses. We are concerned as 9.3 lakh eligible people have not yet taken their second dose and some of them are overdue by over six weeks,” he said. An official said that on Friday, the civic body administered a total of 21,787 vaccine doses of which 18,554 were second doses. He said that the civic body is taking all possible measures to avert a third wave of cases. “AMC has made its ‘no vaccine-no entry’ rule stricter on Friday. We have also started calling people who are overdue on their second dose. We are also tracing contacts of people who test positive. If despite all this we have to deal with another surge in the positivity rate, our hospitals are now better equipped to deal with such a situation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-ramps-up-testing-to-4500-a-day/articleshow/87673740.cms||---

---||Kochi||KIIDC invites tender for renovation of broken seawall||KOCHI: Amid protests by residents and allegations of delay in implementing a comprehensive solution to the sea erosion issues in Chellanam coastal village, the tender for the renovation of the broken seawall has been invited. Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) has floated the tenders for the reformation of the damaged sunken seawall using tetrapods. The plan is to restore the broken seawall using tetrapods and rubble for 10km along the coast in between CP stone 976 and 1,052 in Chellanam under the Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) project. In the first phase, the construction of seawall will be held at a length of around7km in between CP stones 986 and CP 1,026 at a cost of Rs 252 crore. The stipulated period of completion of the works is 16 months . According to the tender, the contractor must construct the seawall using granite stones, weighing 10kg to 700kg, and tetrapods weighing 2 tonne to 3 tonne, as per approved design on top of non-woven geo-textile mat as specified. Also, the contractor should have their own casting and stacking yard for stones and tetrapods and must establish weigh bridges. They also have to ensure necessary software and internet connection for the weigh bridge and the yard. The tender also states that the cement used should be suitable for marine environment and stipulates the minimum grade of concrete to make the tetrapods. All details regarding the experience of the contractor, rules, conditions and work nature have been published in the tender document. “The technical committee for the project was constituted last week. We hope to get some good bidders before the deadline so that the work could be started at the earliest. The plan is to complete at least a major portion of the work before the monsoons in next year as the coast is likely to see huge sea erosion at that time. But everything depends on several reasons, including the availability of rock,” said a KIIDC source. According to residents, processes including tendering are lagging behind the schedule promised by the government and the works should be started at the earliest. “Several projects were announced by the government and the tendering and inaugurations too have happened in the past but most of them are still incomplete. The seawall project is the last hope for residents and it must be completed as per the schedule,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, a resident and coordinator of Care Chellanam, a people’s collective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kiidc-invites-tender-for-renovation-of-broken-seawall/articleshow/87673733.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Goa||Goa: Local bodies, PWD, waste corporation can grant nod for government projects||PANAJI: Simplifying the process for construction of solid waste management facilities and government projects, the town and country planning department has brought in amendments that empower panchayats, municipal corporations, PWD and the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC). The amended Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations permitted PWD to issue development permissions as well as completion orders for government projects, while GWMC, panchayat department and municipal bodies can grant similar permissions for material recovery facilities and solid waste management structures that are coming up in their jurisdiction. This, TCP officials said, will enable faster clearances for time-bound public projects. “In case of government buildings designed by the office of chief architect - PWD, the chief architect shall grant the technical clearance, development permission as the case may be and the completion order,” chief town planner James Mathew said. He said that in the case of material recovery facilities and solid waste management structures, an engineer from the municipal council or engineer of the directorate of panchayats or an assistant manager of the Goa Waste Management Corporation can grant the technical clearance, development permissions and completion order. “These officers are qualified to certify the plans. Right now they send the files to us, we have to inspect and clear them and all this takes time. The government may notify any other officer to grant the permissions for public projects too,” Mathew said. The government has also relaxed the conditions for subdivision of large farm plots by introducing various slabs. The TCP department had noticed that farm land was being rapidly sub-divided into small plots for creation of farmhouses, which were subsequently being sold to non-Goans. Subdivision of farm plots was halted till 2018, but was resumed with certain conditions that the plot size cannot be smaller than 20,000 sqm. “Over the last three years, the government realised that if an owner had a 10,000 sqm plot, he cannot subdivide it for his heirs. So the government has introduced various slabs based on the land holding size. The TCP department had notified the draft Goa Land Development and Building Construction (Amendment) Regulations and had also appointed a steering committee to consider the objections and make its own recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/local-bodies-pwd-waste-corp-can-grant-nod-for-govt-projects/articleshow/87674530.cms||---

Soon after the fight, Jayanti Devi, 35, locked herself and her kids -- 2-year-old son and a 5-month-old daughter – inside a room since her husband, Bantu, was asking her to leave the house. Upset over being nagged to leave, the woman, in a fit of rage, strangled her children to death. The incident came to light on Friday when Bantu, a labourer, went to police and got his wife arrested. Speaking to TOI, ASP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “At first, the man didn’t tell us that his wife had killed his children, Balkrishna and Komal. It was only after our forensic team collected evidence and was informed by locals about the quarrel between the couple that Bantu revealed the truth. We have charged Jayanti under section 302 (murder) and sent her to jail. The bodies were handed over to the father after an autopsy.” During questioning, she confessed to killing her kids, saying she regretted her act. Officials are now considering giving her counselling. Jayanti Devi married Bantu, who uses his first name only, nearly 12 years ago and gave birth to their first child, a son, nine years after the wedlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-kills-two-kids-after-tiff-with-husband/articleshow/87673752.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab government trying to implicate Sukhbir Singh Badal in false case, claims Akali Dal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday alleged that the Congress government in Punjab, in a criminal conspiracy, is trying to implicate SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal in a false case related to the sacrilege issue by holding a meeting on October 22 in the annexe of Punjab Raj Bhawan. The SAD leaders demanded that the entire investigation be monitored by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. Addressing a press conference, SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Daljit Singh Cheema and Maheshinder Singh Grewal said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa were responsible for hatching this conspiracy by holding a secret meeting in the Raj Bhawan annexe between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on October 22. They claimed that the meeting was attended by officiating DGP I P S Sahota, home secretary Anurag Verma, advocate general A P S Deol, SIT chairman S P S Parmar, AIG R S Sohal, SSP Mukhwinder Bhullar, DSP Lakhbir Singh, and inspector Dalbir Singh, retired police officers R S Khattra and Sulakhan Singh and Congress MLAs Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon and Kulbir Singh Zira. Grewal claimed that the purpose of the meeting was to neutralize the anti-incumbency being faced by the Congress government by diverting the attention of people by fixing the political opposition, especially the Badal family. by implicating it in false cases. He said former DIG R S Khattra had been entrusted with the responsibility of creating deposition through false witnesses against the Badal family. Grewal claimed that Khattra had agreed to do this after home minister Randhawa brokered the deal between Khattra, who was very close to Randhawa, and the chief minister. “Khattra has been promised a constitutional post and his son has been promised a Congress ticket from Patiala or Malwa region,” claimed Grewal. Grewal alleged as part of this deal, Khatra has prepared a Congress worker, Rajinder Kaur Meemsa, to get a false case filed against the SAD president. “The conspiracy is that Rajinder will hold a press conference and ring up the DGP to ask why her complaint is not being registered. The cooked up complaint is that the Congress worker, who had temporarily even joined the SAD, had visited Sukhbir’s residence in Badal village before the 2017 elections where she had witnessed the SAD president in the company of three dera (Sirsa) workers (now absconding),” claimed Grewal. The SAD leader claimed, “Subsequently, Rajinder would claim she had seen the same leaders in Sukhbir’s residence after the 2017 elections and had heard Sukhbir telling that the new government is ours and I will not let anything wrong happen to you.” The SAD leaders also asked retired DIG R S Khattra to explain his conduct as he had earlier headed the SIT during the course of which he had claimed that the previous SADBJP government did not interfere in the functioning of the probe. ‘PHONES OF PARTY CHIEF TAPPED’The SAD leaders said Channi government had gone to the extent of tapping the phones of the SAD president and that they would also move a privilege motion in this regard in the forthcoming parliamentary session. They also requested the Punjab governor, whom they will meet shortly, to take appropriate action in the matter and also provide the CCTV footage of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-trying-to-implicate-sukhbir-in-false-case-claims-akali-dal/articleshow/87674544.cms||---

After two narrow losses against Amman Club (1-2) and Shahrdari Sirjan (0-1), Gokulam Kerala were determined to grab full points in the concluding clash and they did just that with a convincing win against the Uzbekistan side. Elshaddai Acheampong opened the scoring for Gokulam Kerala, while goals from Manisha and Karen Zea ensured a smooth ride for the winning side. Umida Zoirova scored the only goal for Bunyodkor. The Indian champions finished with three points, the same as Bunyodkor, but occupied the third spot due to their better head-to-head record. Amman Club defeated Shahrdari Sirjan 2-1 later on Saturday night to emerge champions on a better head-to-head result. Both teams were out of title contention, but Bunyodkor came into this game on the back of a last-minute win against Amman Club. Gokulam Kerala had nothing to show for their previous efforts and had a point to prove. They were under pressure at the start with goalkeeper Shreya forced into action twice. The misses proved costly for Bunyodkor as Gokulam Kerala opened their account just after the half an hour mark. It was Manisha – wonderful all through the tournament – who made it happen from the left. Her cross to Soumya Guguloth was headed towards goal and Elshaddai did the rest from close range. In the second half, Gokulam Kerala continued to press for the insurance goal and won a penalty in the 55th minute when Bunyodkor captain Luiza Sadirova received a red card for pushing Elshaddai inside the danger zone. The referee took almost six minutes to confirm the penalty, and Manisha kept her cool to make it 2-0. Bunyodkor responded immediately after the restart when Dildora Nozimova played a nice one-two with Zoirova, who beat the rival defence before slotting home to reduce the deficit. Substitute Karen should have scored with her first touch, but the goalkeeper made a save from a one-on-one situation. The Colombian, however, made amends in the 68th minute when she scored from handshaking distance after Elshaddai’s shot rebounded off the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-womens-club-championship-gokulam-kerala-edge-out-fc-bunyodkor-to-finish-third/articleshow/87690919.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sikh groups to CM: Reopen 2007 case against sect head||Jalandhar: Sikh groups have urged Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to reopen the 2007 blasphemy case against Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and also order a time bound inquiry to ascertain how the sect head was allowed to go scot free as police did not even file a chargesheet against him in the court and the latter discharged him in 2014. They have also asked the CM to issue a white paper on the case. In a joint letter to the CM, prominent Sikh preacher Harjinder Singh Majhi, who heads Darbar e Khalsa and Alliance of Sikh Organisations (a conglomerate of around 35 Sikh groups) spokesperson Sukhdev Singh have mentioned that they had earlier written to then CM Amarinder Singh on January 29, 2019, and July 16, 2020, but he did not take any interest in the case. They have also mentioned that on December 22, 2019, they had staged a dharna outside his (Channi’s) house but he did not come before the sangat to give his reply. “Now, when you mentioned in Punjab assembly yesterday that you were very much worried as justice was not being delivered in the sacrilege cases and while visiting Darbar Sahib Amritsar you reiterated your commitment to deliver justice, now by delivering justice in this case you can deliver your promise at Darbar Sahib and in the assembly,” they wrote in the letter which was mailed to the CM on Friday. They have requested Channi that a high level probe be completed in 15 days and to issue a white paper on who blocked the dera chief’s prosecution in a highly sensitive case even when he was already facing rape and murder cases. They mentioned that in place of filing chargesheet in the case registered under sections 295 A and 153 A of the IPC, Bathinda police had filed cancellation report just five days before the 2012 assembly polls. The Sikh activists have also argued that the dera chief and his followers dared to execute the sacrileges in 2015 only because they were emboldened after the then Badal government had brazenly helped him (Gurmeet) get off the hook in blasphemy case, which was registered in May 2007 after he imitated Guru Gobind Singh. “The probe should bring out the directions given by the political bosses, especially the then CM and home minister. The police officers who worked against the law and helped an accused so brazenly should be identified and action be taken against them,” the letter states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikh-groups-to-cm-reopen-2007-case-against-sect-head/articleshow/87675115.cms||---

The Goa Vision Document 2035 prepared by a committee headed by top scientist Raghunath Mashelkar remains unimplemented since 2012. In February 2020, Sawant had even met with Mashelkar and the Vibrant Goa Foundation to discuss the implementation of the report’s recommendations. Sawant had said that a task force will be constituted to review the vision document and provide inputs for a phase-wise implementation of the report in the state. The report, prepared by the Goa Golden Jubilee Development Council constituted on July 26, 2010, and submitted to then chief minister Manohar Parrikar in July 2012, was never implemented. Sawant said that the state government has prepared a vision document for panchayats through the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development and directorate of higher education. Speaking at the inaugural function of the National Panchayat Parliament, the chief minister asked zilla panchayat and panchayat members to contest the next assembly elections which are scheduled early next year. He said that once zilla panchayat members and panchayat members get elected, action plans and vision documents should be prepared for implementation in their respective jurisdictions. “Politicians should dream and if we don’t dream, then it cannot turn into reality. In February 2022, aspiring candidates should contest assembly elections. Many parties have come to Goa and there are opportunities to contest upcoming assembly elections, but only 40 will get elected as MLAs,” he said. Sawant said that most of the time panchayat members don’t know what development they should take up in their respective wards and they should reach out to the people with various government schemes. He said that this government is committed to developing human resources in the state. Sawant said that this government is a “double engine” administration and that is the reason Goa has witnessed development across the state. He asked the panchayat and zilla panchayat members to support the state government in achieving a “new India”, and fulfil the dream of Parrikar and vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-preparing-vision-document-for-state-cm/articleshow/87674546.cms||---

He said he would soon preside over a review meeting with all the collectors to understand the plans they had prepared to ensure every beneficiary was administered at least one dose by November 30. “We want community participation to speed up the drive,” said Tope. The statement assumes significance considering that some, including the Aurangabad collector, have made at least one vaccine jab mandatory for residents to purchase fuel and ration. Tope told TOI that weekly review meetings would be held with the collectors and they would be directed to include NGOs, housing society federations and local leaders to get their help in reaching out to the beneficiaries. The state is working towards giving at least one dose to the 9.1 crore eligible population by November 30. Of them, around 2 crore have not received a single dose. Nearly 5.9 crore beneficiaries are yet to get their second dose. During an interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, Tope again demanded that the 84-day gap between administering the two Covishield doses be reduced to speed up the vaccination drive. “We have again demanded that the Centre reduce the gap between the Covishield doses, to which they have only replied ‘Noted’,” said Tope. The minister also apprised the Centre about the ongoing programmes in the state like Mission Kavach Kundal and Mission Yuva Swastha to boost the inoculation drive. “We have assured the Centre that the state’s vaccination programmes will be further scaled up,” he told the TOI. “The Mission Yuva Swastha has received a good response,” the minister said, adding that the state would strive to ensure that all the eligible beneficiaries receive at least one dose by November-end. He said public awareness was being created through several communication models to allay the citizens’ doubts on vaccination. The state is also making efforts to seek the help of religious leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/use-persuasion-not-coercion-to-boost-vaccination-in-mumbai-tope/articleshow/87674554.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Civic chief Kailas Jadhav took this decision after the Rajasthan-based firm that was roped in by the civic body for the project was no longer interested in doing so. Jadhav has directed the officials concerned to prepare a report about the project, including cost per station along with all other details, and locations where the stations would be set up. A civic official said although a final decision is yet to be taken there would be at least 20 EV charging stations in the city and they can be further increased depending on the response from the citizens. The charging stations are to be set up for the both two and four-wheelers. The official said they are already in the process to get more details about charging stations. A project report will be prepared shortly and submitted to the municipal commissioner. The civic body has received a total of Rs 41 crore from the Centre to deal with the air pollution. The funds have been received in two instalments under the National Clean Air programme. The NMC is already in the process of utilising Rs 20.5 crore received in the first phase for various projects like electric crematorium, purchase of mechanical sweeping machines, recycling and management for construction waste in the city. The second instalment of Rs 20.5 crore was received by the civic body last month. The NMC is already in the process of preparing plans to spend the funds for various projects to reduce air pollution and improve city’s air quality. “Parts of funds will be used for setting up the charging stations for EVs,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-set-up-ev-charging-points/articleshow/87672913.cms||Tushar Pawar

What is happening? Why two, three, four and five constituencies?” Reacting to Lobo’s statement that he hasn’t done anything in Mapusa, D’Souza said, “A lot of people talk like that, but we and the people of Mapusa know what work has been done and completed. The people of Mapusa are smart”. He added that “outside people” can’t tell the people of Mapusa what they have to do. “The people of Mapusa will decide who to vote for and whom to elect,” he said. Asked if Lobo would support him, D’Souza said that even the last time (for the byelection), “Lobo had interfered”, and Congress candidate Sudhir Kandolkar had said that Lobo had helped him. “This time, based on our work, the people will be with us,” D’Souza said. “My father worked for the last 20 years for the people of Mapusa.” The Mapusa constituency has been represented by BJP for over two decades now. Former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had joined BJP in 2000, and after his death in 2019, Joshua was elected as the party’s MLA there. “We have started work from the Mapusa boundary,” Lobo had said. “We have inaugurated projects in Verla-Canca and we have come to Parra. People of the three constituencies (Calangute, Siolim and Mapusa) and our well-wishers will elect our MLAs. All the three candidates vying to contest are sitting here itself. Kandolkar is from Mapusa, and I think the people of Mapusa will 100% get him elected. Delilah (Lobo’s wife) will contest from Siolim constituency with the blessings of the people.” Kandolkar, a one-time close aide of Francis D’Souza, was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket in the 2019 by-election, after the death of D’Souza. After Kandolkar was denied the BJP ticket, he switched over to Congress and was defeated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/joshua-slams-michael-for-vested-interest-in-mapusa/articleshow/87674557.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Home delivery: Preliminary inquiry report absolves GMSH-16||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The preliminary inquiry report submitted on Friday after an incident of home delivery due to alleged refusal of doctors at GMSH-16 to provide care absolved the hospital. UT health secretary Yashpal Garg has asked the medical superintendent, GMSH-16 to inquire and clarify certain aspects for further action. After examining the report, the health secretary said, “Both the lives of mother and child were exposed to serious risk with or without fault of the health department. Hence there is a need to go deeper into details of the issue to bring out the truth. If it is established that the pregnant lady was not properly attended to by the staff on duty during a visit to GMSH-16 on 31st October, then strict action will be taken against the concerned staff,” he said. He added, “There seems to be something more than what meets the eye here and the possibility of some foul play due to vested interest with ulterior motives to defame the health department cannot be ruled out.” A video clip of the couple alleging that they were denied treatment at GMSH-16 due to which the woman had to deliver the baby at home was circulated. An inquiry was marked to the director, health services by the UT health secretary and it was conducted by the GMSH medical superintendent. The report said, “neither of the staff on duty during the night of 30- 31st October was aware about the visit of the pregnant lady at the hospital.” The inquiry could not find out who provided the unsigned prescription on the woman’s OPD card. It was also found that the baby was delivered at home on October 31 at 10:50am with the assistance of neighbours and a ‘dai’. A health department team was sent to the residence of the couple to check for the immunisation of the new-born and the mother. “On November 6, a health worker and a middle aged person visited the house of the lady and recorded a video clip about the issue. The said health worker tried to instigate the patient against the health authorities for reasons not known and requested not to disclose about their visits to anyone,” mentioned the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/home-delivery-preliminary-inquiry-report-absolves-gmsh-16/articleshow/87673775.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Officials from both hospitals confirmed that they were low on blood stocks. Both facilities witness heavy patient rush as they are the biggest government-run tertiary care medical facilities in the district. According to Somnath Khedkar, blood bank in-charge at Sassoon hospital, they have around 150 units of blood that could last for the next three days. Shankar Mosalgi, blood bank in-charge at YCMH, said they had only 120 units of blood available with them. Both said increasing the number of blood donation camps immediately was the only solution to avert any blood-related crisis. Khedkar told TOI, “The Diwali holidays have resulted in low response to blood donation drives. Every day, we get a few donors who come voluntarily to the hospital for donation, but it needs to be increased. The holidays also resulted in a drop in the number of camps that we conduct in the colleges and in the IT companies. Earlier this week, we conducted a camp with an NGO which resulted in the additional bloodstock of at least 150 units. We have a daily demand of at least 60 units.” He added that only individuals having an infection or uncontrolled sugar are discouraged from blood donation. Citizens who have yet to complete at least two weeks after the first or second dose of their Covid vaccination too are told to let the waiting period of two weeks pass. Mosalgi said that the 120 units are quite low and they need to be restock at the earliest. Both the officials appealed to citizens to contact their respective blood banks for the donation from 9am to 9pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sos-for-blood-from-sassoon-ycm-hospitals-left-with-three-days-stock/articleshow/87674558.cms||Piyush Bhusari

I have directed the officials to figure out a plan to start issuing licenses after following due paperwork. This should be done at the earliest,” said SDMC’s standing committee chairman BK Oberoi. SDMC recently sealed a restaurant, which was running without proper license. The eatery had allegedly denied entrance to a woman earlier, objecting to her traditional Indian attire of a saree. After that, many other restaurants were sealed by the corporation that were running with licence. A discussion in the standing committee was held where BJP councilors raised the matter. According to Oberoi, these guesthouse owners will submit a demand draft and an affidavit to the corporation, after which the officials should start the process of de-sealing. As per an SDMC official, these guesthouses were operating in ‘non-conforming’ or residential areas, said the official; hence, they were sealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/guesthouses-sealed-by-sdmc-may-get-relief-soon/articleshow/87675618.cms||---

The observation was made by a division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice C Jayachandran in the judgment overturning the conviction of a father accused of molesting his seven-year-old daughter when his second wife was in the kitchen attached to his home. His first wife had died earlier and the complaint alleging penetrative assault was lodged at the instigation of the second wife, the accused had contended. In the judgment delivered on Wednesday, the court said, “Forensic and semantics apart, child molestation is a shame on society; but if the allegations are false, it is lethal to the life of the accused, more so if the accused is a parent; even if he is eventually acquitted. Here we have the case of a child raising such accusation against her father with the active support of the stepmother; sheer instigation by the latter, pleads the accused.” After noting the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the accusation and the testimonies, the court observed that the evidence from medical examination also showed no proof of any penetrative assault. The court ordered for setting the father at liberty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-will-destroy-dads-life-even-if-acquitted/articleshow/87654150.cms||---

Schools across the country will be ranked on the basis of the examination. The test was conducted for students of classes III, V, VIII and X. Earlier, the CBSE had stated that students would be prepared for board classes on the basis of this examination. Class X board examination term-1 is to be held by the end of November.

---||Delhi||No second draw of lots under EWS category for school entry||New Delhi: There will be no second draw of lot for the Economically Weaker Section/Disadvantaged (EWS/DG) category for admissions in schools, as per a senior Directorate of Education official. This year, the draw of lots was not held for all the seats in the entry-level classes of private schools. Out of the total 50,000 seats in the entry-level classes (nursery/KG/I), the draw of lots was held for 33,000 seats. As per the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 25% of the seats are reserved for the EWS/DG category in private schools. “Private school association and a few other NGOs have moved Delhi High Court and the matter is now sub judice. So there will be no draw of lots this year. In some time, the admission process for the EWS/DG category for the 2022-23 academic session will start,” said the official on condition of anonymity. Of the 33,000, too, not all seats have been filled. On questioning if the empty seats will be carried over next year, the official added that it would not happen. The matter is sub judice as private schools challenged the education department’s order, asking them to admit EWS students irrespective of the general admissions in the school. According to the private schools, due to Covid, they have not had enough general category admissions this academic year. “As per a high Court order in 2013, for every three general category admission, one EWS student is admitted. But as the department issued an order against it, it was challenged in the court,” said an official of the action committee. Earlier, when a member of the budget private school association had placed a grievance on the matter, the department had said the matter on the second draw of lots was under consideration and would be notified. Chandrakant Singh, general secretary of Private Land Public School Trust, said, “In August, I had raised the matter, as it is unfair for the students who have been waiting to get admission. Most budget private schools have admitted the allotted students. But this practice of not drawing all the seats is not right.” Earlier, a senior official had explained that draw of lots was only held for these many seats based on last year’s reference on how many could be admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-second-draw-of-lots-under-ews-category-for-school-entry/articleshow/87674580.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Slow response to stricter ‘no vaccine, no entry’ rule on Day 1||AHMEDABAD: Implementation of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) stricter ‘No vaccine, No entry’ rule was slack. While at many places such as Flower Garden at Sabarmati Riverfront and at Law Garden people were asked to show certificates which led to confrontation between officials and citizens, there was hardly any checking done at other AMC-run public facilities like BRTS and AMTS buses. Starting from Friday, the civic body started restricting access to those who have not taken both the doses of Covid vaccine to public facilities, like civic transport service and from entering public spaces. Earlier in September, AMC had announced that only those with at least one dose of vaccine will be able to avail relevant municipal services. “Our teams carried out random checking in gardens this morning. We asked the people for certificates and allowed entry to those who could produce certificates of the second dose of vaccine. However, we had to face arguments from many citizens who could not furbish certificates. People were asked to leave the park but they argued that they were not aware of the rule,” an official of AMC’s parks and garden department said. However, at many BRTS and AMTS stands people were seen getting tickets without being asked for the vaccine certificates. At AMC headquarters at Danilimda all visitors were asked for a certificate ofsecond dose before letting them in. A civic body official said that the move of restricting people from entering public places is to give impetus to the ongoing drive to fully vaccinate the city's population. “Not only do they pose a danger to themselves but they also can be harmful to others,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/slow-response-to-stricter-no-vaccine-no-entry-rule-on-day-1/articleshow/87673810.cms||---

After purchasing explosives and precursor chemicals in bomb-making from various licensed companies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the accused, under the guise of forest department vehicles, transported the explosives to Hidma and other Maoists on Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, the NIA alleged.

The PLGA is the armed wing of the outlawed outfit.Hidma and his cadres were providing huge amounts of money to overground workers to procure the explosives, the NIA alleged. “Investigation has revealed that these workers procured explosive materials, including 500 kg of boosters, 400 gelatine sticks, 400 electric detonators, 5,500 non-electric detonators and 5,490 metres of safety fuse in February this year fraudulently from licensed firms in AP and Telangana,” the NIA said.

Addressing Congress workers at a meeting of the Calangute Congress block committee at Candolim, he said, “Let me apologise for what happened in 2017. You and the people of Goa voted to form the Congress government. Unfortunately, our MLAs betrayed the party.” “Workers were loyal, MLAs were disloyal. Workers were honest, MLAs were dishonest. Workers stood for the party, MLAs went in search of greener pastures. That the Congress leadership could not avert the situation in 2017, is a matter of deep regret. I assure you that such a situation will not occur in 2022,” Chidambaram said. With workers at the meeting raising queries about the selection of the Congress candidate for Calangute, Chidambaram said, “the candidate will only be decided in consultation with the block committee”. “The selection will be based on loyalty, integrity, acceptability to workers and winnability among the larger electorate,” he said. Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar, general secretary and former Calangute MLA Agnelo Fernandes, opposition leader Digambar Kamat, working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and other Congress functionaries were also present at the largely attended meeting.

---||Mumbai||Make physical class a must after Diwali, say schools||MUMBAI: With the nationwide survey of students’ learning outcome in the online mode getting a good response by way of students attendance on Friday, schools want the state to make physical presence in classrooms mandatory when educational institutes reopen after Diwali. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) to assess competencies of students of class 3,5,8 and 10 saw students flocking to their respective schools in large numbers. The ministry of education had given the mandate to schools to ensure 100% attendance depending on class selected for the survey. Of total students, a random chit was drawn to get a strength of 30. These children then the survey in the form of a 90 to 120 minutes test. “As attendance was mandatory, all class 3 and 10 students, barring those outside the city, attended school,” said the principal of a private school in Mahim. When schools reopened for classes 8-10 last month, the response was poor as parental consent was mandatory. “The state should make attendance in physical schools compulsory. The hybrid mode ---online and offline—is not working and children are losing out on learning,” said the principal. Five sets of question-answer booklets were provided to schools. Each student had to answer questions from two subjects (Maths, Science, Social Science, Language). Students moved around in masks. Principals said that class 3 and 5 students were the happiest to be back to school. “Those who were not selected for the test and had to return were sad-faced. They kept asking when physical school will reopen,” said the principal of a school in Bandra. Over 38 lakh students in 733 districts in the country took the survey. In Maharashtra, 7,330 schools and 2.35 lakh students participated in the survey. Across MMR, over 30,000 students of 950 schools were part of the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-make-physical-class-a-must-after-diwali-say-schools/articleshow/87674588.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||2 sr officials of SECR booked for sexual harassment of dalit woman||Nagpur: Two senior officials of South East Central Railway (SECR) have been booked for alleged sexual harassment on a complaint by 57-year-old dalit woman employee at Sadar police station on Friday. The cops have also invoked sections of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocity) Act against the two officials after she alleged mental torture by the officials as she was from backward class. Senior divisional commercial manager (Sr DCM) Vikas Kumar Kashyap and assistant divisional commercial manager (Asst DCM) Avinash Kumar Anand were charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 354A for sexual harassment and section 294 for using abusive language, among other charges. The dalit woman had first lodged a complaint against the officials in September after meeting CP Amitesh Kumar. In September, TOI had published the dalit woman’s complaint to the police. The dalit woman has claimed in her complaint that she was repeatedly summoned to the chamber by Kashyap and Anand. She claimed Kashyap misbehaved with her on June 15 while Anand had called up on her cellphone in August, and used derogatory words for being admitted at the hospital. As per the FIR, officials would try to summon her close to them on the pretext of work, and sneakily attempt to establish bodily contact. She mentioned that the officials would fling papers on the ground and ask her to pick them up. Senior inspector of Sadar police station Vinod Choudhury said the offence was registered after the railways inconclusively ended the Vishakha committee inquiry, without informing the cops of any decision reached by the probe. Initially, Zonal DCP Vinita S had also summoned the concerned railway officials to record a statement after the complaint by the dalit woman, who was also admitted at a hospital due to mental trauma. She had also released a video clip stating senior officials would be responsible if she takes any drastic steps due to overwhelming mental agony. In her FIR too she had mentioned about her intention to end life due to incessant torture. In September, TOI had approached Kashyap for his version, and he had refuted all the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-sr-officials-of-secr-booked-for-sexual-harassment-of-dalit-woman/articleshow/87674604.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s national body consolidated its stand on the booster dose soon after top Union government officials made it clear that a policy document on booster dose was being worked out. Senior surgeon and IMA national president J A Jayalal said, “Now, that the production has been augmented and availability of vaccine has increased, IMA demands the Union government to prioritise vulnerable population, including healthcare workers and immunocompromised citizens, and permit them to take the third dose. The booster dose for healthcare workers was initially desirable but we were not demanding it. Now, we demand that healthcare workers should be given a booster dose as ample vaccine stock is available.” Jayalal said, “On one hand, many people across the world do not have access to single dose, while on the other, a large population is demanding the third dose. Now that the production has been augmented, vulnerable population and healthcare workers should be given a booster dose on priority.” In September, doctors attached with the IMA’s Pune branch had unanimously upheld the need for a booster dose for healthcare workers. It was the first unit of the medical body in India to officially make such a recommendation. The members had also expressed readiness to undergo the trial to assess the need for a booster dose among the healthcare workers in India if there were trial plans. Senior paediatrician Dilip Sarda, the chairman of the Pune IMA’s core committee on Covid vaccination, said, “Various studies have proven that vaccine-mediated protective antibodies wane considerably after six to eight months. Healthcare workers are the most exposed and high-risk segment. Hence, they should get the third booster dose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-booster-dose-to-healthcare-workers-high-risk-individuals-grows/articleshow/87674599.cms||Umesh Isalkar

People have been advised to limit outdoor activities. States have been asked to remain ready for implementation of “emergency” measures as per GRAP. The sub-committee, during a meeting, observed that in view of unfavourable meteorology, stubble burning and poor dispersion resulting in accumulation of pollutants, the coming week is critical with regard to air quality in Delhi-NCR. Poor air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, especially when the AQI is in ‘Severe’ category, officials said. “Government and private offices and other establishments are advised to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent by working from home, car-pooling and optimising their field activities, etc. People are advised to limit outdoor activities and minimise their exposure. Implementing agencies, at appropriate level, must closely monitor actions taken and submit daily report,” said minutes of the meeting. The sub-committee said all actions under ‘Severe’ category, including intensifying public transport and introducing differential rate to encourage off-peak travel and closing brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers, would be continued stringently with more rigour.

---||Ahmedabad||Court orders payment of Covid patient’s rejected claim||Ahmedabad: During this pandemic it has been common for Covid-19 patients to see their medical insurance claims either rejected or get heavy deductions from insurers on various pretexts. Ashish Dave, a resident of Nadiad, saw his insurance claim rejected even after he got himself medical insurance specially meant for Covid-19. It was only after Dave knocked at the doors of a consumer court that he received the money spent on his Covid treatment. After the onset of the pandemic, Dave (37) opted for insurance coverage of Rs 2.5 lakh for Covid-19 and bought a policy named Corona Rakshak from Future Generali India Insurance Co Ltd. When his policy was in force, between July 23, 2020 and May 3, 2021, he got infected by the virus and was taken to the Nadiad Civil Hospital on December 1, 2020. Since Covid cases were surging after last Diwali’s festivities, many hospitals were overcrowded. The Nadiad Civil Hospital also did not have a vacant bed and Dave was refused admission. He was transferred to another Covid facility, Mahagujarat Hospital, where he was treated till December 5. On being discharged, Dave claimed his insurance payout, but to his utter shock, the company rejected his claim. The ground for the rejection was Clause 3.7 of the policy, which defined hospitalization for a Covid patient, “Hospitalization means admission to a hospital designated for Covid-19 treatment by the government for a minimum period of 72 consecutive in-patient care hours”. Dave sued the insurer at the Kheda District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, before which the insurer justified its rejection by submitting that Dave needed to be hospitalized for at least three days at a government-designated Covid facility and he had not got treatment at the government facility. The company also cited another policy clause and stressed that three-day hospitalisation was required after testing positive for Covid for payout of 100% of the sum insured. After hearing the case, the commission came to the conclusion that Dave had supplied all proof of his disease and since there was no space at the government hospital, he was transferred to another facility. He was hospitalised for five days and was therefore entitled to his full claim. It ordered the payment of Rs 2.5 lakh with 7% interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-orders-payment-of-covid-patients-rejected-claim/articleshow/87673847.cms||---

With the flattening of the Covid-19 curve, the two municipal corporations have started transferring life-saving medical equipment to the Kamla Nehru hospital, Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital and Jijamata hospital, officials said. Both the jumbo centres, closed since the past few weeks, had treated over 10,000 patients in the two Covid-19 waves in Pune district. Both the facilities have around 1,600 beds, of which over 1,000 are oxygen-supported and around 300 are ventilator-supported. There are a few dialysis-supported beds as well. Ravindra Binwade, additional commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We are monitoring the post-Diwali Covid situation but so far there is nothing of concern. The decision to transfer the equipment was to ensure better infrastructure availability at other civic hospitals in the periphery.” According to Binwade, the CoEP jumbo unit has been given green signal till January 2022 after its structural audit. “We will decide how to proceed with the infrastructure depending on the Covid situation in the coming days,” he said. Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “Shifting of equipment is already underway. We are replacing the old beds at the YCM hospital with the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit’s beds. Other life-saving equipment are being moved to other civic hospitals.” The decision on retention of jumbo unit infrastructure is likely to be taken at the state level meeting in the coming days, said the additional commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/equipment-from-jumbo-units-shifted-to-civic-hosps/articleshow/87674614.cms||Piyush Bhusari

It is Kochi circle which witnessed a major jump in registrations (1,496) this year. There were 1,155 active registrations, including those who renewed the registration and who entered the food industry for the first time in 2019 in Ernakulam constituency. It went up to 1,488 in 2020 and jumped again to 1,717 in 2021 so far in Ernakulam. Other constituencies are also making huge jumps in registration of small-scale food industrial units comprising . Food safety department officials say most of the home bakers are women who got time to experiment with their cuisine or baking skills during the lockdown . The registration with the food safety department is done for the food units with turnover less than Rs 12 lakh. If the turnover is above Rs 12 lakh, they should take licence. But the number of those taking licences is very less, said officials adding most of the units are now renewing the licence to start business after remaining closed for more than one-and-a-half years. “We had conducted a door-to-door survey in Kochi corporation limits after the first lockdown restrictions were lifted and found that many are engaged in food unit business by running it in houses. They were given strict warning to register with us, otherwise action would be initiated. This resulted in a rise in registrations,” said a senior food safety official in the district. A senior official said they conduct regular checking in units and take action if any violation of rules is noticed. “Most of the food items prepared in houses are related to cake making and their sales are mostly among relatives, friends and neighbours. But they have not entered into the sweet making sector which needs more involvement and need to prepare the products in bulk to ensure profit,” said Johnson Mathew, office manager of Bakers’ Association. “With Christmas and New year around the corner, the food industry will pick up again. Many customers purchase raw materials for making cakes,” says Kunjachan who runs ‘Bakers Traders’, which sells raw materials of bakery items. “Many returned to the industry after rechristening their hotels and re- registration. The problem we currently face is rising LPG price and shortage in the availability of skilled hotel workers,” says Jayapal of Kerala hotel and restaurant association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-seen-in-registration-of-small-scale-food-units/articleshow/87673837.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly directed for issuing notices to Wayfarer Films and M Star Entertainments, which are the producers of the movie based on the life of fugitive Sukumara Kurup. The court’s directive came after considering a public interest litigation filed by Sebin Thomas during admission hearing on Wednesday. Besides the producers, the court has also sought the views of the central and state governments on the matter. Initially scheduled to be released in May this year, the movie came out on Friday and is being screened in over 1,500 screens in multiple languages, including Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi. Through the petition, it is contended that Kurup, who was proclaimed as an offender and who was not convicted by a court, has the rights of an accused person until he is convicted. The movie is an exploitation of Kurup’s right to privacy as he has not consented to the publication of details of his life through a movie and he is not able to approach the court to safeguard his right, the petition said. Further, the petitioner claims that proclaimed offenders could be considered an underprivileged section of the society and that the government has the duty to protect their life and liberty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-notice-to-makers-of-dulquer-starrer-kurup/articleshow/87673858.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Para-athlete in need of professional and financial aid||Hubballi: A talented para-athlete in the district, having proven herself among her peers in the country, is hoping for support from the government that will enable her to participate in global events, and hopefully make the country proud by earning a medal. Nilofar Dharwad, the daughter of a porter, bagged the third place in the ‘Javelin Throw’ event at the National Para Athletics Championship 2021 event that was recently organised by the National Paralympic Committee (NPC). She hurled the javelin 19.82m far, an accomplishment that has earned her praise from feted para-athlete Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda, who believes that Nilofar may achieve much if her talents were honed and encouraged. Nilofar is, with assistance from the government, hoping to enlist the assistance of a professional coach. The recent demise of her loss of her father to cancer, who toiled and trudged to pour the much-needed financial fuel to drive his daughter’s dreams, has left her devastated in more ways than one. Nilofar lost her left hand in 2008, besides sustaining severe injuries on her stomach, and right leg when she was electrocuted. A natural southpaw, the loss of her left hand translated also into the loss of her natural athletic talent. Refusing to accept her fate, Nilofar battled on, continuing her education, and obtaining a degree from Nehru College. It was the feats of her sisters in the arena of sports – Nilofar’s siblings have achieved much in school- and college-level tournaments – that spurred her to take the plunge into athletics. Last year, she participated in the 30th edition of Karnataka State Para Games in the F-46 category, securing the gold in the shot put event, and silver in javelin throw. Her achievements at the state-level event earned her a shot at national fame, and participating in the 19th National Para Athletic Championship 2021, she brought home the bronze medal in the javelin throw event. Nilofar is one of her parents’ six children. Her brother decided to shoulder the family’s burden by turning a porter, like his father, in the wake of the latter’s death. “It’s very difficult for my brother to make ends meet, leave alone provide funds for me to train for javelin throw,” lamented Nilofar. Notwithstanding the seemingly insurmountable problems, Nilofar refuses to accept defeat. She said that she was eager to supplement the family’s income, to which end, she was ready to join any government organisation or a private company. “While I want to take care of my siblings and my mother, I am also determined to make India proud by winning a gold medal at an international event,” she added. ‘She can achieve more with right guidance’ There is much scope for women athletes, but they need professional assistance. If Nilofar can throw the javelin nearly 20m far, I am certain she can achieve a lot more, if provided the necessary guidance. Her talents need to be acknowledged, and local authorities, sports enthusiasts and even the private sector must lend her financial assistance. I will take up her cause with the Karnataka Sports Association for The Physically Handicapped, and do what I can to encourage her. - Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda | Silver Medallist at the 2012 London Paralympics||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/para-athlete-in-need-of-professional-and-financial-aid/articleshow/87673428.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Nagpur||Submit draft of ward delimitation by Nov 30: SEC tells NMC||Nagpur: The State Election Commission (SEC) has reportedly directed Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to prepare and submit draft of delimitation of wards on or before November 30. The civic body has finalized 52 wards in new three-member ward system. An official from NMC told TOI the SEC letter setting the deadline arrived a couple of days ago. “This is the first time since announcement of delimitation of wards that the SEC gave a deadline,” he said. As per latest decision, NMC has finalized increase in number of elected corporators to 156. Currently, the number of elected corporators is 151. The NMC house also comprises of five co-opt corporators. Notification regarding number of co-opted corporators is likely to be issued in coming days. NMC has finalized number of corporators as per 2011 population census. The 2021 census has been delayed due to Covid-19, therefore, number of corporators will not be as per existing population of the city. Also, NMC is preparing fresh boundaries of all wards as per 2011 population census. Due to this, some wards are likely to have more voters compared to others. On August 25, the SEC had directed starting the process of ward delimitation. At that time, one-member ward system was in existence. NMC started the process but stopped after government revised it to three-member ward system on September 22. The process again got a jolt with the decision of the government to increase number of corporators on October 27. For 2017 municipal elections, the process was started in August and completed by November 25. Delimitation of wards followed by reservations etc had been finalized by November 25. Senior corporator Sunil Agrawal said municipal elections can be conducted by the SEC on time if it wishes to do so. “Earlier, SEC used to give 45 days for MLC elections. Now, SEC has reduced time period to 24 days. SEC can conduct elections on time if it reduce days for suggestions and objections, and expedites the process,” he said. As per normal schedule, code of conduct should come into effect in first week of January followed by polls in second or third week of February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/submit-draft-of-ward-delimitation-by-nov-30-sec-tells-nmc/articleshow/87674637.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Teachers, students and educationists gathered in large numbers at the 'National Education Day' programme organised by the Association of Minority Educational Institutions, an umbrella body of different organizations working for the cause of education. A discussion on re-enrolment of school dropouts and out of school children and role of budget schools was held to examine the post pandemic situation. Mohd Abdul Azeem, Secretary to Government, referred to the educational emergency being talked about these days. “It requires SOPs to ensure a safe and secure environment for reopening of schools. According to the UN report 2020, nearly 1.7 lakh learners across 190 countries were affected by the pandemic. What it meant was 94% of the world student population was impacted by Covid,” he said. He called for front line educational catalysts on the lines of Covid front line warriors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/focus-on-dropouts-better-schools/articleshow/87674641.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Pune||Office vacancies dip, flexi spaces take up market||PUNE: Kolkata and Pune were the only major markets in India reporting a decrease, though slight, in office space vacancies in the first half of the 2021-22 fiscal as against the same period in the last two financial years, with co-working spaces increasing their market share across top seven cities, data from real estate consultants Anarock showed. Of the seven markets observed by Anarock — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad — Pune was also the only city to record a vacancy rate in single-digit percentage in H1 of the current financial year. It was also accompanied by a push in average rents for office spaces. An average rate of Rs 70/sqft prevailed in the first half of the ongoing fiscal as against Rs 68/sqft in the same period of the last fiscal. “The cost advantage of co-working spaces clearly outstrip the possible risk factors. Data indicates that of the net office absorption of 10.76 million sqft in H1 FY22 across top seven cities, the share of co-working has risen to 8%. In H1 FY21, of net office absorption of 8.31 million sqft, the share of co-working stood at 3%,” the Anarock report said. Pune has also been a beneficiary of the flexible space churn. Real estate consultants Knight Frank said ticket sizes and spaces were varying across requirements and firms, with most deals in the 200-500 seat range. “This helps large companies with smaller strengths to be present in Grade-A properties, while having the flexibility to scale up in the future. The advent of these workspaces is definitely keeping vacancies in check, but the vacancy levels in Pune are fairly comfortable by industry standards,” said P Vilas, Pune director of office transactions and capital markets for Knight Frank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/office-vacancies-dip-flexi-spaces-take-up-market/articleshow/87674661.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||Dusty roads spike pollution in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Continuous drives by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to sprinkle water on broken roads to control dust and check air pollution is not providing desired results. A reality check by the TOI in nearly two dozen localities found that the number of damaged and dusty roads is far more than what the civic body covers daily. As a result, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city continues to be in poor category. According to a survey conducted by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), broken and dust-laden roads contribute around 87.1% of total air pollution in the city. TimesViewAll civic and development agencies must cooperate with the district administration in checking air pollution caused by dust laden roads. However, a permanent solution of the problem would be to repair pothole ridden roads because they are the ones which cause most air pollution. Besides, there should be more greenery on footpaths/roadside as grass also prevents air pollution caused by dust.The dust raised by moving vehicles remains suspended in the air for long and combines with mist/fog during winter to create smog, comprising aerosols which are responsible for the continued haze being witnessed these days. LMC has eight trucks for sprinkling of water on roads and five for anti-smog spray. These vehicles cover around 80-85km of road networks daily. However, LMC has 236km of road network in the city, of which many stretches are in a bad shape. Though repair work is underway, the pace is slow. Some roads under LDA, PWD, State and National Highways Authorities are also damaged. TOI reality check found dust-laden and damaged roads in Mahanagar, Jankipuram, Jankipuram Extension, Aliganj, Gomtinagar, Alambagh, Aashiana, Hazratganj, Nishatganj, Lajpatnagar, SGPGI road, LDA Colony and Kanpur Road, among others. Residents complain that bad roads not only lead to accidents but the air pollution caused by it leads to itching and redness in eyes and shortness of breath. Residents of Alambagh said dust was causing respiratory problems for adults as well as their kids. “My child is allergic to dust. I also suffer from silicosis and our doctor has strongly advised us to wear mask even inside the house,” said a resident, Kartar Singh. “I feel irritation and itching in my eyes and can’t even sleep properly because of the dust entering our house. Repeated requests to our corporator for repairing of the stretch have gone unheard,” said Abhijeet Singh of Nishatganj. Shalini Tripathi of Telibagh colony said, “Almost all the roads in our locality are broken and riddled with potholes. A thin layer of haze envelops the area during the day. As a precaution, we have to keep windows closed all the time. We have bought an air purifier because air pollution aggravates the condition of my asthamatic mother-in-law.” In an official statement, municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said LMC had deputed five anti-smog trucks and several water sprinkling trucks in all eight zones of the city to settle the dust. Patch work on damaged roads is also being conducted, it said.

---||Rajkot||Record 112 Bhavai artists play bhungal||PALANPUR: Globally renowned Tana-Riri Music Festival of Vadnagar coincided with the 75th year of Independence this year. It was organized recently where a world record was set with 112 artists played the bhungal — a trumpet-like musical instrument made of copper or brass — non-stop for five minutes. Bharat Joshi an organizer stated that Bhavai performers belonging to the Turi-Barot and Nayak community, achieved this melodious feat. To facilitate ease of transportation, the six-feet-long Bhungal is made up of three parts and is later assembled. One of the key musical instruments, besides the tabla for Bhavai performances, the Bhungal gives performers the pitch and dance rhythm. This annual music festival started by then chief minister Narendra Modi is in honour of two sisters Tana and Riri, of Vadnagar, who were Nagar sisters and is celebrated on the 9th day of Kartik (the first month after Diwali). Famous classical singers from India along with accomplished Gujarati classical singers are invited to give a treat for music lovers. Legend has it that Tansen, the famous court musician of Emperor Akbar, sang Raag Deepak so fervently that even lamps lit up magically and the singer too suffered from high fever. To get relief, Tansen knew he had to hear the soothing rendition of of Raag Megh Malhar – an antidote to the heat — and thus, headed for Vadnagar where Tana and Riri sang for him and nursed him back to health. Akbar then summoned the two sisters to his court, but owing to the conservative societal norms of the community, Tana and Riri preferred to immolate themselves in Vadnagar than refuse or disobey the emperor’s summons. A samadhi was created in Vadnagar called the Tana Riri Samadhi and the annual classical music festival is held near this Samadhi. Those present at the function this year were Sangeet Natak Academy’s Pankaj Bhatt, chief of Genius Foundation, Pawan Solanki among many others. The organiser of the festival was Bharat Vyas of Himmatnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/record-112-bhavai-artists-play-bhungal/articleshow/87674419.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covid vax: NMC reaches out to beggars, destitute, transgenders||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which is planning to push Covid vaccination through door-to-door drive, has reached out to over 1,500 underprivileged persons who don’t have any identification proof. “These were beggars, destitute, transgenders and religious monks who do not have any identification papers but needed to be vaccinated,” said officials. Deputy NMC commissioner Ram Joshi said it can happen through special camps — a facility available in the Co-Win app itself. Dr Gowardhan Nawghare, immunization officer of the NMC, said, “Inmates in jails and mental hospitals have been covered under such drives apart from those living in destitute like the missionaries of charity’s shelter at Katol Road.” Vaccination of transgenders was done through NGO Sarthi trust. Another NGO Beti Bachao also took part in the drive. The homeless found near Cotton Market have also been vaccinated in a similar manner. “If a person does not have any document as ID proof, there is a special provision in the Co-Win app. Such persons’ names can be registered against the credentials of any other person who refers them. Even a single ID proof is enough with which an entire group can be vaccinated on the basis of a single ID document,” said Nawghare. Even the NMC officials are providing their ID documents for the purpose, added an official. “The NMC has taken up the cases through NGOs. However, such persons would also be covered the door-to-door campaign planned by the civic body,” said Nawghare. Elderly who do not have any papers or even the underprivileged can be covered under the door-to-door drive. Such persons are expected to be working in shops or taking up similar callings in the unorganized sector. TOI went around the city looking for such persons. A few also inquired about the procedure of getting jabbed if they did not have Aadhaar or any other paper. A group of homeless persons living near Kasturchand Park said they had already got themselves vaccinated back in their home state of Rajashtan. However, they did not show their Aadhaar card or the certificate when requested. A group of workers at Metro rail site on the Central Avenue quipped their vaccination cards. “I got both the doses back in Bihar,” said Sujit Kumar, a worker at the site. Mahadev Marandi, another worker, said he had his first dose at his home state in Jharkhand and the second is yet to be due. A little ahead, transgender Durga found seeking alms said she got the first dose in Odisha where she come from, and was waiting for the next. Mallaram Parmar, a nomadic shepherd now camping near Paratwada, was worried about his second dose. “I have got the first dose in Rajasthan but have left my papers back there. I am not sure if I will be able to get the second dose here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-vax-nmc-reaches-out-to-beggars-destitute-transgenders/articleshow/87673876.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Political party workers should follow restraint: Gadkari||Nagpur: Union transportation minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday called on party activists to follow restraint and do “smart work” while working for any organisation. He was speaking during a book launch function of MLC Girish Vyas. The book depicts various works done by him in six years of his tenure. A Diwali get together was also arranged on the occasion by BJP workers at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh. Former MPs — Datta Meghe and Ajay Sancheti, former minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, city president Praveen Datke and former MLC Anil Sole shared the stage. Bawankule and other leaders also addressed the gathering while leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis interacted in a virtual manner. Vyas’ term would end on January 1 next year and the book launch was his effort to stake his claim to retain the seat, as per BJP activists. Earlier, the city MP rekindled old memories while working with Vyas for the party. He recollected that at one time, BJP did not have strength in the city. “There was not even a single MLA that time. But all party workers worked hard to achieve the success and bring good days for the party. Rambhau Mhalgi started the tradition of reporting on development works. Vyas’ book is a medium to convey the work done as a representative of the people. He and I are old activists. It is said that when one gets old, the friendship breaks down. However, this is not the case in BJP,” he said. He added that Vyas and he also worked during the days of emergency and then both started working for Yuva Morcha. Speaking on the worker’s role, the senior BJP minister said the party was expanded due to their hard work and efforts. “A person who works with restraint is a true worker and he is a real strength of the party. The party often gets to top due to them and even gets down, if they don’t work. It is necessary that the workers should be smart, they may not be very wise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/political-party-workers-should-follow-restraint-gadkari/articleshow/87674651.cms||---

The weather change is following a depression near Tamil Nadu coast which is weakened into a low-pressure area. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over the south Andaman Sea and the neighbourhood by Saturday. “The weather was dry over the state on Thursday and Friday but there is a significant change in the sky conditions going from clear skies to cloudy. There are easterly winds over Goa causing the clouding and there is a possibility of light to moderate rain in the coming days,” the IMD forecast states. The IMD said the weather condition will continue for five to six days over Goa. Along with which, there is a likelihood of some increase in rainfall activity from November 14 or 15 onwards. There are chances of lightning and thundershowers over one or two places in the state as well. The IMD has also warned against working in open areas or even taking shelter under tall trees during the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rainfall-activity-over-state-may-increase-from-tomorrow/articleshow/87674672.cms||---

The six—Mahesh Visani alias Varchand who married the woman forcibly and sexually assaulted her, his brother Visan, the woman’s father Tejabhai Ahir and brother Rajesh, village sarpanch Veljibhai Jaga Patel alias Dilla and Pachabhai Patel alias Dilla—are in the custody of the Powai police. The woman had filed a first information report (FIR) against them on Thursday. The six have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections, including wrongful confinement, kidnapping a woman with the intent to get her married, criminal intimidation and conspiracy, and under the Information Technology Act for transmitting sexually explicit material in an electronic form. On Thursday, the Bombay high court had summoned Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale in the case, who appeared through videoconferencing and assured of an inquiry into lapses by the Powai police. On November 6, Powai police had provided security to the woman and her husband’s family on an HC order, fearing a threat from the man with whom she was forcibly married by her parents and the sarpanch. The couple’s advocate Pranav Badheka said the accused had thought they were above law and could subvert the system. “They were emboldened when every illegal and unlawful action of theirs was taken lightly by police,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-lodged-in-inter-caste-marriage-case-6-held/articleshow/87674659.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court unhappy with tardy pace of investigation against MLAs, MPs||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has expressed “dissatisfaction” over the speed of investigation in cases against sitting or former MPs and MLAs. The HC made these observations after the IGP (Administration, Law and Order), Haryana, submitted an affidavit informing that out of 44 cases under investigation, final reports have been submitted in 30 after completion of investigation, challan has been submitted before the trial court in seven cases, cancellation reports submitted in seven cases and in 16 cases, untraced reports have been written and the final report will be submitted to the competent court of law. It has further been pointed out that there are 17 more cases of sitting or former MPs/ MLAs, in which investigation is still in progress. Hearing this, a division bench headed by Justice A G Masih observed, “A perusal of the said affidavit would indicate that the speed, at which the progress of investigation is going on, is not satisfactory.” The Haryana government counsel informed that the IGP is personally monitoring these investigations and sincere endeavour would be made to conclude the investigations within six weeks and submit the report in this regard. In case of Punjab, an affidavit of the IGP, Crime-3, Bureau of Investigation, was filed, informing the HC that 42 cases are under investigation, 32 cases are under trial and that out of 10 cases, cancellation/untraced reports have also been presented in eight. It was further pointed out that fresh reports received indicate that 53 cases are pending at various stages before the trial court, out of which, in 14 cases cancellation/untraced reports have been submitted. The IGP’s affidavit suggested that in most of the cases, either cancellation/untraced reports have been prepared but not submitted to the courts and in some cases, the said reports have been presented to the courts. On this, the HC observed that the impression gathered is that effort is being made to push through things without really looking into the true aspect of investigation and conclusions thereof. “To dispel this opinion of the court, we direct the IGP (crime) to personally look into the reports and, if satisfied, proceed to submit the same in courts,” the HC has ordered. CBI counsel Sumeet Goel said that in some of the matters pending against the MPs/MLAs (former or sitting), stay has been granted by courts, wherein appropriate applications have been moved for vacation of the stay. Efforts are being made to expedite the trial. It was pointed out that the further investigations in cases where challans had already been presented are in progress and efforts are being made to expedite the same. The UT Chandigarh administration informed that only one case against a public representative in which the investigation was going on earlier, stands concluded and challan has been presented in the court on October 13 and no further case is pending for investigation as of now. The matter has now been adjourned for January 10 for submissions of further reports indicating the progress in various cases. THE ISSUE:The matter is pending before the HC in a suo motu petition where the court had sought details from Punjab, Haryana and the UT Chandigarh about the pendency of cases against the leaders in their respective states. The HC had taken cognisance of the matter in following the directions of the SC and appointed senior advocate Rupinder Khosla as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-unhappy-with-pace-of-probe-against-mlas-mps/articleshow/87674664.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Women are victims in overhalf of blazes in the Maharashtra state||Mumbai: More than half of all fire-related casualties in Maharashtra last year were women. Data with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) also shows that 60% of the 762 fires in the state, that resulted either in fatalities or injuries, were reported in residential buildings. Maharashtra ranked fourth in the country in terms of maximum major blazes, after Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Of the 767 fire related casualties in Maharashtra, 442 were women. “Women are typically the first to enter the kitchen and the last to leave, making them more vulnerable where it comes to domestic fires," says forensic fire investigator Nilesh Ukunde. About 28% of all fires in the state were caused from stove burst or cooking gas cylinder explosions last year. "During festivals, women tend to sit on the floor in close proximity to the stove and the LPG cylinder for making snacks. As cylinder pressure increases, gas could leak from the joint where the rubber tube is attached to the stove. Being heavier, LPG stays back in the room and mere friction could cause it to ignite," said Ukunde, adding that people rarely bother to change the rubber tube. One of the reasons why fires in residential premises are higher than those in commercial establishments is that compliance is taken very seriously in the latter. "In several residential premises, firefighting equipment may be installed but does not function when required. Also commercial establishments are not occupied round the clock like most residential structures," said Prakash Devdas, president, Mumbai Fire Brigade Officers Association. He said the fire department does not have adequate staff to inspect multiple fully-occupied premises in the city. Recently the Mumbai Fire Brigade was unable to start a mini fire station at Santacruz owing to a lack of staff. The fire brigade currently has 750 vacant posts and hasn't been able to recruit more personnel due to the pandemic. Typically, in prominent commercial spaces, there is a housekeeping agency which monitors encroachments in common areas or refuge floors. "But in residential areas, there have been several instances of refuge areas and common spaces being encroached, sometimes to the extent of househelps using it for staying or cooking. Buildings should be designed very carefully with toilets not located above meter boxes as in case of a leakages from the toilet, sparks erupt from the meter box and no one may realize till things get serious," said Shirish Sukhatme, former president of Practicing Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association. But awareness about fire safety is low. Building managements often skip maintenance of fire equipment and mock drills are almost never carried out. "A life-saving apparatus like a fire extinguisher could turn into a ‘life-taking apparatus’ if not maintained properly," said Ukunde, adding that when a fire breaks out, the first few seconds are crucial. Whether it was the Ahmednagar blaze involving children or the one in Pune where victims were so badly charred that DNA tests were required for identification, those who escaped or were pulled out soon were the ones that survived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/women-are-victims-in-overhalf-of-blazes-in-the-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87674692.cms||---

Yet, Vidarbha has not reported any fresh surge in Covid-19 cases. According to experts, little or no surge in new cases despite the festive rush is a good indicator that the virus is currently not multiplying. At the same time, they said it would be too early to say that the pandemic is turning endemic. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said it’s a good sign that cases are still at the baseline. “But, we need to see whether new cases increase in the next two weeks. If they remain low like they are now, it’s a big good news,” he said. According to Dr Shinde, February 2022 would be the deadline to decisively announce whether it’s an endemic. “The second wave had started in February 2021. If the same trend of low cases continues till February, we can conclude that the pandemic has turned into endemic,” he said. Member of Covid task force Dr Prashant Joshi cautioned that Covid is not going away in a hurry. “Why is Europe now epicentre despite high vaccination coverage? Look at the history of Covid in countries like China and Russia,” he said. Stressing that it is not the time to let our guard down, Dr Joshi said the current trend gives us hope that it would become endemic one day, “but not so early”. As far as Vidarbha is concerned, the number of daily new cases which was in single digit pre-Diwali has reached double digits from November 10. There have been four deaths in the last six days. “However, this small surge cannot be linked only to festivity,” said a senior official from health department. The number of tests had reduced during pre-Diwali time due to back-to-back holidays. “But, we have resumed the tests post-Diwali. With more tests, many asymptomatic patients are getting detected randomly,” said the official. General physician Dr Vinit Patil said that there is massive surge in cases of viral infections, cough, cold, and fever in the last 10 days. “But this is not Covid-19. Most of the patients to whom I referred Covid-19 tests returned negative. These are general infections due to weather change. With confusion still high, it’s always better to get tested,” he said. # Figures can be illusionary - Pre-Diwali downfall in new cases was due to less testing during holidays- Post-Diwali, as average number of tests has increased, new cases are up - So, pre-festivity or post-festivity connection cannot be established so early- At least next two weeks are crucial, but we must be careful even after that- New cases, smaller surges are expected now; vaccination only protection||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-caution-against-laxity-as-cases-low-even-after-festive-rush/articleshow/87673903.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Haryana OPD services hit as govt docs protest direct recruitment of medical officers||Chandigarh: Routine OPD services and clinical diagnostics were hit and patients harried in Haryana on Friday, as doctors across the state observed a two-hour strike in the government hospitals. The strike was held on a call by the Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA), to protest against the state government’s move to directly recruit senior medical officers (SMOs), delay in the creation of a sub-cadre of specialists and to press their demand for a quota of HCMS doctors for master degrees. Biochemistry, pathology and radio diagnostic services came to a complete stop for OPD patients. In some hospitals, even urgent ultrasound and X-rays were not held during the two-hour strike. Medicos in all district hospitals raised slogans against state authorities and demanded the immediate withdrawal of recruitment process of SMOs. They said the recruitments will jeopardise the growth of existing HCMS doctors. HCMSA office-bearers denied that emergency services were hit. They insisted that even patients cooperated with them. “First, we cannot affort to disturb emergency services. We are doctors first; hence, this is not possible at all. Only routine OPDs were not held for two hours. Else, emergency OPDs, emergency surgical procedures and diagnoses were held as routine, without any problem to patients,’’ said Dr Jasbir Singh Panwar, the president of HCMSA. Panwar said the agitation will continue till the government doesn’t withdraw the move of SMO recruitment as well as resume the quota system of HCMS doctors for master’s degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-opd-services-hit-as-govt-docs-protest-direct-recruitment-of-medical-officers/articleshow/87674679.cms||---

The sighting has been reported by citizens near gate number 3, and the animal was seen going in the direction of the post office. Honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate said camera traps were being set up and officials will keep a watch there, but it’s a “known fact” that the leopard is present in the Ordnance Factory and Ambazari belt. Ordnance Factory has told residents and workers in the area to be vigilant and not confront the animal if it is sighted. In the city, officials are being kept busy with the elusive crocodile in Nag River. Hate said, “On Friday we put up signages there, informing people to be careful and not enter in the embankment. We had set up a camera trap but there is no sighting of the crocodile yet.” The officials will continue to monitor the area at least for a few days because if the crocodile is sighted again, they will need to move ahead with the plan of capturing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-sighting-reported-in-ordance-factory/articleshow/87673890.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Glossopteris leaf to adorn BSIP new building architecture||LUCKNOW: A new building at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) will have a blend of Indo-Saracenic styled architecture representing ‘Lakhnavi tehzeeb’ and design inspired from the Glossopteris leaf—the subject of the famed palaeobotanist’s research. The leaf, which looks like a tongue fern, will symbolise the contribution of renowned palaeobotanist Prof Birbal Sahni to the field of Palaeosciences. The foundation stone of the building will be laid shortly to mark the platinum jubilee anniversary of the scientific institute. The building will come up on the premises at a cost of around Rs 90 crore. One of the two old buildings which are not in a very good shape will be demolished. Former secretary of the department of science and technology Ashutosh Sharma said, “The institute is old and required a new building that will do justice to modern science with hi-tech and modern laboratories. The importance of palaeosciences is increasing day by day.” BSIP director Vandana Prasad said, “After going through designs of around 20 architects from across the country, the scientific institute has selected a design which is a tribute to our founding father Birbal Sahni and the architectural beauty of our city.” She said the government had already sanctioned funds and the foundation stone of the building will be laid shortly. The new building, to come up on a sprawling area of 14,000 square feet, is expected to be completed in two years. “Due to space constraints, we couldn’t set up our astrobiology and molecular biology laboratories. This new seven-storey building will make it all possible,” she said. What is the Glossopteris leaf?The leaf is easy to recognize because of its distinctive design. Glossopteris means ‘tongue fern’ in Greek, because of its shape. Fossil evidence suggests that the plant probably grew in diverse habitats and came in different forms. Prof Sahni had described Glossopteris in detail and identified differences between the flora of India and Australia with that of China and Sumatra. BSIP film to showcase 75 year journey on founder’s day:The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences will celebrate its founder’s day on Sunday. The scientific institute will release a documentary featuring the 75 year-journey of BSIP to celebrate its platinum jubilee. Secretary, ministry of earth sciences and department of science and technology (additional charge), M Ravichandran will be the chief guest, while secretary, science and engineering research board, DST, Prof Sandeep Verma will deliver the 51st Birbal Sahni memorial lecture titled ‘STIP 2020: Policy and processes’ on the occasion. “We feel privileged to have two great scientists joining us on our founders’ day celebration. It would be a learning experience for everyone to hear M Ravichandran, who is a legendary scientist and has served as director, National Centre for Ocean and Polar Research in Goa and is credited for leading the coordination of several scientific missions in India to Antarctica and the Arctic,” said BSIP director, Vandana Prasad. She said another giant from the field of bioorganic chemist, renowned chemical biologist and a professor in the department of chemistry at IIT Kanpur Sandeep Verma, who is also an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences will be joining the celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/glossopteris-leaf-to-adorn-bsip-new-bldg-architecture/articleshow/87675290.cms||Mohita Tewari

Chairperson of Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) Shantaram Kolvenkar said the system has been lying unused as it was not maintained by authorities. However, a source from the South Goa collectorate said that it was decided that the PMC would maintain the system. “The collectorate had even paid Rs 8.12 lakh from February 2017 to January 2019 for maintenance and upkeep of the system after the expiry of the one-year guarantee period,” the source added. The sophisticated surveillance system was procured in 2015 with an aim to prevent untoward incidents by monitoring real time activities, including traffic discipline and crimes. Altogether 22 CCTV cameras had been installed at 16 locations across the town. Nupur Electronics, a Panaji-based company, had provided the surveillance system at a cost of Rs 32.9 lakh in 2015. The surveillance system had a recording unit, video display units and CCTV cameras including night vision fixed cameras and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras. The cameras are connected to a DVR at the main monitoring unit installed at the National Informatics Center (NIC) control room at the South Goa Collectorate, Margao to record captured videos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/even-after-ponda-gets-maintenance-funds-cctv-system-lies-abandoned-for-4-years/articleshow/87674751.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Lucknow||UP ex-minister Gayatri Prajapati gets life imprisonment in gang-rape case||LUCKNOW: A special (MP/MLA) court awarded life imprisonment on Friday to former UP minister Gayatri Prajapati and two of his accomplices — Ashok Tiwari and Ashish Shukla — in a gang-rape case. It also fined them Rs 2 lakh each. Special judge PK Rai declined their plea to punish them with the minimum quantum of sentence. The three were present in court and were taken to jail to serve their life terms. They now have the option of moving the high court against the judgment and order passed by the special court, which had pronounced them guilty on Wednesday. The prosecution had opposed the convicts’ plea for leniency in sentencing. “If a man in such a responsible post commits this kind of offence, misusing his power and position, the court should deal with him sternly in order to give a message to society,” the prosecution argued. Prajapati, who was the mining department minister in the then Akhilesh Yadav government, was arrested and sent to jail on March 15, 2017 on charges of raping a woman and attempting to rape her minor daughter. He has been in prison since then. Prajapati also faces multiple probes in the alleged mining scam in the state during his tenure as minister. He was granted bail once but it was cancelled by the high court immediately, before he could walk out of jail. The HC had noted that there had been foul play in granting bail. Declaring Gayatri and the two others guilty two days ago, the special judge had said on Wednesday that the prosecution had succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court had found all three guilty under IPC Sections 376 (D) and 5 (g) read with Section 6 of the Pocso Act. The court, however, acquitted Vikas Verma, Roopeshwar, Amrendra Singh, alias Pintu, and Chandrapal for lack of evidence. The prosecution had produced 17 witnesses in the case. A senior police officer said that Ashish Shukla was the former minister’s aide, that he looked after his work in the state capital and was also an important link with his constituency in Amethi. On the other hand, Ashok Tiwari was a government officer posted as “lekhpal” in Amethi tehsil. He was suspended on March 5, 2017. The officer also said Tiwari kept all the mining records of the former minister. According to the police, the survivor was introduced to the minister in 2013 at his official residence by Ashok Tewari. Thereafter, during her meetings with the minister, Prajapati offered to allot her a license for sand mining. At one of the meetings, she was allegedly served tea laced with sedatives and raped while objectionable photographs were taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-ex-minister-gayatri-prajapati-gets-life-imprisonment-in-gang-rape-case/articleshow/87676152.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Now, they will have to collect at least Rs1.48 crore daily, confirmed deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram. The monthly target for November is Rs 53.49 crore.The standing committee headed by Prakash Bhoyar had set a target of Rs332.49 crore for the current financial year, but property tax recovery till October end was Rs96.46 crore.Though NMC is focusing on recovering current tax, it will simultaneously target defaulters. According to data compiled by the NMC’s tax department, there are over 3.86 lakh property owners who have defaulted on tax to the tune of Rs651.75 crore.The department has compiled data of defaulters classifying them into five categories — 643 who have dues of over Rs5 lakh and above each. Their cumulative outstanding dues stand at Rs269 crore. Similarly, property owners who have defaulted between Rs1 lakh and Rs4.99 lakh (2,326), their outstanding tax is Rs45.05 crore. Total 5,058 owners owe between Rs50,000 and Rs99,999 to NMC and the total dues are estimated at Rs33.86 crore. Over 20,713 property owners have defaulted on tax between Rs25,000 and Rs49,999 and the dues are Rs68.88 crore.Likewise, 1,72,285 property owners have dues between Rs5,000 and Rs24,999 and they owe Rs191.94 crore. Total 1,85,772 property owners owe between Re1 and Rs5,000 tax. Their total outstanding dues are over Rs42.91 crore.Independent corporator Abha Pande said the civic administration needs to strengthen property tax collection as it is the main source of revenue.With the deteriorating financial situation of NMC, Pande said the reason for such high outstanding revenue needs to be addressed urgently and stringent efforts should be made to reverse the trend.Though NMC had launched amnesty scheme in December last year, it evoked poor response.

According to them, this is affecting the realty business and also causing huge problems for the property owners. Deepak Badyal, general secretary of Punjab Property Dealers and Colonisers Association, said, “According to government norms, any person having plot in unapproved colony can get his property regularised by paying the required fee. But even after payment of fee and getting NOC from authorities like GLADA, power connections are being refused to them by PSPCL on the pretext that the colony in which their plot is located is not approved. This is clear violation of the rules and due to this the plot holders are facing huge trauma as how they will build their homes without power. Moreover, this is also having affect on the realty business as why would people buy the properties and pay regularisation fee when they are not going to get power connection” According to Ritin Dhir, a resident who is facing such problem, “It has been almost seven months since I got NOC from GLADA for my plot after which I applied for power connection with PSPCL. But after months of sitting on my application, it has been refused by the department on the protext that the colony in which my plot is located is unauthorised. Despite me pleading before the PSPCL officials that the refusal is against Punjab government rules, they did not pay any heed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/realtors-claim-pspcls-refusal-to-connect-unauthorised-colonies-affect-business/articleshow/87674716.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Two Zika positive patients were diagnosed on Thursday. All three patients are unrelated to one another and have no travel history prior to contracting the disease. The two patients diagnosed on Thursday include a 24-year-old woman from LDA colony Kanpur road and a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh in Hussainganj. The 48-year-old woman’s sample was also taken as part of the district health department’s random sampling drive for Zika virus after a surge in cases were reported from Kanpur. Complaining of mild fever, she had visited Dr SPM Civil hospital on November 10 after which she had become asymptomatic with medication. “The woman had no travel history, but she had put up a temporary stall outside her home during Diwali which could have exposed her to the infected mosquito. She is asymptomatic and at her home,” said district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. Meanwhile the health department collected samples of 106 people who lived near or worked with the first two Zika patients. These samples were sent for testing. While the female patient was said to be doing well, the male patient who had gone to Ambedkarnagar because he was asymptomatic and was not aware of his report status till about Thursday, returned to Lucknow on Friday. “The Ambedkarnagar chief medical officer’s (CMO) office had been informed about the patient’s presence and that he should be contained in the district itself. But he returned to Lucknow on Friday. It is important that a Zika patient’s movement is restricted,” said Dr Vardhan. Updates of all three patients are now being taken by the district health team both on ground and through telephonic communication. “The virus travels from one place to another. Since there are frequent visitors between Lucknow and Kanpur, the latter of which is currently most affected by Zika in the state, it is possible that the virus travelled from Kanpur itself through one or the other source. It is a human to human contagious virus caused by a vector which is the mosquito,” Dr Vardhan explained when asked if the virus is present in Lucknow’s atmosphere irrespective of contact with Kanpur.

---||Nashik||NMC takes up special drive to collect property tax||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is collecting property tax from properties, which have not taken building completion certificates from the civic authority. As per the norms, the properties should obtain the completion certificate after the construction is completed. The NMC then levies property tax on such properties. But in many cases, properties are utilised without getting the certificate. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Friday informed the general body that the civic administration has started the painstaking task of identifying such properties and levying provisional property tax. So far, the civic body has collected over Rs 25 crore from 21,000 such properties in the last three months. There are an estimated 60,000-70,000 such properties in the city. Jadhav said that the administration has set a target of collecting approximately Rs 100 crore from such properties by the end of this fiscal. “We are also conducting survey to know about how many properties were given commencement certificates and how many of them obtained the completion certificates. We will collect the data from 2001,” he said. During the general body meeting held on Friday, city mayor Satish Kulkarni for the second time turned down a proposal of the civic administration to levy a penalty on such properties. Kulkarni also said that a special meeting of the general body is to be called next week to recruit manpower on a temporary basis. Recruitment has not taken place in the last 15-20 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-takes-up-spl-drive-to-collect-property-tax/articleshow/87673032.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 3D turns surgeries 360°||AHMEDABAD: Recently, a 14-year-old boy came under the care of the onco-orthopaedic surgeons at Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI). His lower leg’s bone (tibia) needed to be operated on to remove a tumour. “In the conventional method, we study X-ray and MRI scans of the area, plan a surgery, and cut the infected bone to ensure that the tumour doesn’t spread further,” said Dr Abhijeet Salunke, an onco-orthopaedic surgeon at GCRI. “That would have made the boy live with a prosthetic limb all his life.” Dr Salunke added: “But the new techniques help us preserve the original bone. We cut the specific part of the bone, remove the tumour, disinfect the bone, and re-attach it with a customized 3D printed metal plate.” The conventional methods don’t give the precision that’s required for the process — a bone cut the wrong way by just a millimetre may not have helped save the boy’s leg. Moreover, such a cut might prevent the bone from adapting as he grows up. Thus, in this case, the doctors first created a 3D model of the boy’s knee joint and tibia. Based on the model, a cutting jig (an instrument that helps doctors cut the bone with precision) and a metal plate were made specifically for the case. “The surgery took half the time of the conventional procedure and was successful,” Dr Salunke said. “The boy will have to follow up with us for the next couple of years, but he will walk with his own leg.” 3D printing involves planning of a case with the help of CT and MRI scans and it has its learning curve. As the surgeon performs more cases with this method, the duration of the planning period reduces from a week to a day, said Dr Salunke. 3D printing usually evokes models of toys, renderings of architectural plans, or at best some practical applications such as resin jewellery. But the advancement in the technology is also helping medical science. At GCRI alone, about 25 surgeries are done with the help of 3D models, whereas in private settings, the number could be much higher, said experts. The 3D printing method has been a “medical boon” for complex bone tumour surgeries involving the knee joint and the pelvic area. This process is helping surgeons devise patient-specific surgical instruments and implants. “Cost is a determining factor along with the complexity of a case,” said Dr Suresh Ludhwani, a city-based radiologist who makes medical 3D models for surgeons. “In the past couple of years, I have made models for bones, soft tissues, and internal organs,” said Dr Ludhwani. “Earlier, the printing quality was not good, but now the models are life-like with colour differentiation.” Dr Ludhwani added: “The process not only helps in surgery but also makes it easy to explain the procedure to the patients and their relatives.” Dr Vikas Warikoo, a GI cancer surgeon, said that doctors have used a 3D printed model of tumour involving the liver and have performed a complex liver surgery. Dr Keval Patel, a uro-oncosurgeon, said that 3D printed model of kidney and blood vessels helped his team perform partial nephrectomy and save the remaining kidney. Post-mucormycosis regenerationA patient in the late sixties had come to the clinic of a maxillofacial surgeon. The patient had mucormycosis, resulting in severe facial deformation due to the removal of the upper jaw and parts of facial tissues. The person had difficulty in speaking and eating. In this case, the conventional mapping of the oral cavity was not possible to make the partial denture. The experts got an MRI scan of the intact jaws and created a mirror image to make the denture for the other side of the face. It worked well — the patient could eat and speak normally after two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3d-turns-surgeries-360/articleshow/87674156.cms||Parth Shastri

He also sent his memorandum to principal secretary complaining against the civic officials. He claimed that he had given ultimatum to civic authorities several times, but no action was taken in this regard. However, the MC officials claimed they were preparing the report and it would be put up shortly. Sabharwal, a few months ago, had taken information under RTI from MC about total expenses on construction and maintenance of city roads in the last few years. The officials under RTI revealed Rs 212 crore was spent in only five financial years on maintenance of existing roads and Rs 177 crore approximately was spent on construction of new roads, but could not provide the details on which road how much was spent. He complained with central vigilance officer about this issue and even after seven reminders, the officials are yet to file their reply. Recently, MC officials issued a press note in which they clarified that they paid only Rs 11.58 crore from 2015-16 to 2019-20 to the hot mix plant for repair work while rest amount was spent on the construction of central verges, recondition of roads and widening of old roads. Sabharwal alleged the officials are delaying information intentionally as it does not take nine months to provide the information if is available in records. However, when contacted, additional MC commissioner Aadityanath Dacchalwal said, “We are getting the detailed report ready as it will go to vigilance for their inquiry. Only Rs 12 crore is spent on patch work not Rs 212 crore, as more works are included in this total expenditure amount.” He said they will soon share the detail with everybody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-yet-to-give-breakup-of-rs-212cr-spent-on-maintenance-of-roads-rti-activist/articleshow/87674724.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nashik||Driver injured as protesters throw stone at Pune-bound Shivshahi bus||NASHIK: A stone was pelted on a Shivshahi bus headed towards Pune from Nashik on Friday afternoon, leaving its windshield shattered and the driver with injuries to his hand. Divisional transport officer K S Patil said the incident took place near Sinnar, about 30 km from Nashik city, around 2.30 pm on Friday. There were 47 passengers in the bus at the time of the incident, luckily none of them sustained any injuries. Patil said that soon after the incident, the bus was halted on the spot. An additional Shivshahi bus was sent to Sinnar to pick up the passengers and take them towards Pune. The bus completed the journey an hour late. The Sinnar police are in the process of registering an offence against the unidentified persons for the stone pelting. This is the second incident of stone pelting on Shivshahi bus. On Thursday, two buses stationed at Mumbai Naka bus stand were targeted and their glass panes were damaged. There were no passengers in the buses at the time. The buses are leaving the depots under a police escort vehicle, but the cover ends after the buses reach the highway, officials said. Patil said they had increased the number of buses plying towards Pune and Dhule. The buses are leaving from the Thakkar Bus Stand as soon as they are filled with passengers. From 10am to 7pm on Friday, four buses were sent to Pune and another four to Dhule. He added that the buses would continue to ply despite the Friday afternoon incident. The police are already escorting the buses till the outskirts of the city since Thursday, said Patil. MSRTC operates 36 buses as strike continues The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) managed to operate 36 buses in the state on Friday amid the ongoing strike by the employees. MSRTC officials had claimed earlier in the day that some employees resumed work at its workshops. The agitation, for demands including merger of the corporation with the Maharashtra government, began on October 28. Shekhar Channe, vice-chairman and managing director of the MSRTC, told PTI that 36 buses were operated from 17 locations during the day. —With inputs from PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/driver-injured-as-protesters-throw-stone-at-pune-bound-shivshahi-bus/articleshow/87673041.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolhapur||Approval for intake of 100 students at GMC in Satara||Kolhapur: National medical council, the apex body governing medical education in the country, has approved an intake of 100 students for the first year MBBS course at the proposed Government Medical College (GMC) in Satara. The state government has allocated 64 acres of land located on the outskirts of Satara for setting up the medical college and a 500-bed hospital. For the current year, the MBBS course will be conducted on the premises of Satara civil hospital. Balasaheb Patil, Satara guardian minister said, “With the approval of intake of 100 students for the first year, we will be able to start the classes from June after the admission process ends. The design of the medical college and hospital is ready and the work will start soon. Within a year, the MBBS course will be conducted at the new building.” The demand of the government medical college at Satara was pending for the past 18 years. Patil said that the finance minister Ajit Pawar approved the first GMC in Satara in his budget speech last year. The minister said, “The issue was pending due to lack of space. After an intervention by the finance minister, the 64-acre land owned by Krishna Valley Development Corporation has been handed over to the government for the college.” In the region, only Satara district lacked a government medical college. Now, every district- Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur will have its own government medical college. Patil further said, “With the college, comes the hospital, which will provide quality healthcare services to people from the district. The hospital will have the capacity to accommodate patients for the next 100 years.” The government has assured Rs 420 crore for the construction of the college and the hospital. Patil said more funds will be made available if required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/approval-for-intake-of-100-students-at-gmc-in-satara/articleshow/87673059.cms||---

---||Delhi||Ending rice-wheat monopoly can ease Delhi woes||LUDHIANA/PATIALA: Most of the fields along the road to Jalaldiwal village, 42km from Ludhiana, are ashen black, some still smoking. Amid such sombre scenes of farm fires, one runs into a hillock of sunny bales of straw. Tractors loaded with this paddy stubble line up before busy men who unload, pull, push and sort the bales. Dr Harminder Singh Sidhu, a 54-year-old farmer who also runs an agri help centre, inspects the quality of straw and shouts out instructions to his workers. “We are collecting hay bales from over a thousand acres in 33 villages. It will be processed into fodder,” smiles Sidhu. “We have been doing this for five years and encouraging farmers in Punjab not to burn the harvest remains. It has been slow, but there is progress.” Sidhu is among the few farmers who are trying to veer away from the annual practice of burning the remnants of the rice plants for the pollution this causes. Apart from processing it into fodder, he is also trying to get plywood factories to use stubble as raw material. However, eradicating a decades-old practice will take time and given that Punjab is one of the biggest rice producing states of India, merely managing the stubble will not be enough to address the issue of air pollution caused by farm fires. Alongside mechanical and chemical innovations, like the IARI decomposer, experts are also working on ways to reduce the creation of stubble. A solution earlier attempted now appears both promising and challenging: breaking the rice-wheat monopoly through crop diversification. Agriculture scientists in Punjab are trying to push maize as a substation for rice in the belief that lesser rice means lesser stubble. The package comes with major economic and climatic benefits, the prime reasons why the diversification is being talked about. International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), the state agriculture department and others are experimenting with this at 116 farms in Pathankot, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar and Rupnagar. “Diversification is one of the two futuristic ways to reduce the emissions, the other being carbon credits,” said Dr M L Jat, principal scientist, CIMMYT. “For this, the rice-to-wheat-to-rice cycle has to be broken.” Scientists have discovered that wheat yields an extra two quintals per acre if sown after maize. As a bonus, the farmers can grow moong bean in the interregnum of 60-65 days between wheat harvesting and maize sowing. The challenge however is to persuade and convince the sceptic farmers. “A major problem for the farmers is an assured market for maize like rice has,” revealed Jat. “Last year, the support price for maize was Rs 2,000 per quintal but what farmers actually got was around Rs 1,200. We need to guarantee a price for farmers to take to crop diversification.” Describing any further investment in Punjab’s rice sector as ‘digging your own grave’, Jat pointed out the twin disadvantages of rice cultivation. While stubble burning makes air unbreathable in the National Capital Region, the water table in Punjab is being fast depleted. Rice is so water intensive that producing a kilo of it consumes as much as 75 times the water that a kilo of maize requires. And yet, Punjab has around three million hectares under rice cultivation and just 109,000 hectares under maize. However, improving Delhi’s air quality is not the ultimate objective of crop diversification. Agri officials insist it is an economic need for the monetary burden it imposes on the state and central governments. B S Sidhu, Punjab’s director of agriculture, said, “For the cultivation of one hectare of paddy, the central government spends Rs 72,000 and the state government Rs 8,000 to maintain the power and irrigation infrastructure. An equivalent amount is invested by the farmers.” He said rice cultivation had to be trimmed to two million hectares for sustenance and 1.6 million hectares ideally. “This is doable, but it tough due to several policy issue. We need the Centre to do more at the policy level,” Sidhu told TOI. However, despite the desirability for crop diversification, capping rice production can be tricky. “Experimenting with paddy is risky because of periodical droughts and the central government has regularly advised us not to fiddle with rice,” said Sidhu. “We actually thought of diversification in 1987, a drought year. There were dry years also in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2014, and at such times, the country needs food grains like rice.” Carbon credit is the other possible solution to farm fires. In a first attempt of the type, Grown Indigo, a company based on sustainable agriculture, the state agriculture department and CIMMYT are engaged in giving around a thousand farmers in four Punjab district carbon credits, a market-linked unit with a value of Rs 700-1,200. Explaining the concept, Dr Usha Barwale, executive director and chairperson, Grow Indigo, said, “There are certain agriculture practices that a farmer must undertake, such as converting from planting seedlings to direct rice seed in the paddies or using machines like Happy Seeders or shifting from rice to maize. After an audit, the credit is calculated in terms of tapping of CO2 equivalent and the farmer will be incentivised.” While direct seed planting instead of seedlings reduce methane emissions, the Happy Seeder mixes carbon in the soil and the rice-to-maize shift opens up window for a third, nitrogen-fixing crops like legumes. Such quantifications are equated in carbon credits and charged in monetary terms from major carbon-producing industries like oil to be passed on to the farmers. Mechanical management of stubble has proved difficult to implement. “We have given cooperatives and farmers’ societies 15,000 Happy Seeders, 18,000 Super Seeders and 504 balers since 2018,” claimed M Kalia, joint director and nodal officer for stubble management, Punjab government. Yet, this is not enough for 12 lakh farmers and 4.2 million hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ending-rice-wheat-monopoly-can-ease-delhi-woes/articleshow/87674744.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Lucknow||UP now robust state under Yogi: Rajnath||Lucknow: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the Centre was working on a centrally sponsored scheme under which investments in the two defence corridors, one in Tamil Nadu and the other in UP, would be incentivised. Speaking after an interaction with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and representatives of the defence manufacturing industry in Lucknow, Singh said that while the government was mindful of the potential of the private sector, it also understood its requirements and was taking all steps to ensure that industries could be anchored in the country. “We are confident that we will be able to develop a strong defence manufacturing ecosystem in UP. For this, I have to credit CM Yogi Adityanath for the work he has done. If this was the UP of earlier years, I would not have seen this glow on your faces,” he told the industry representatives, adding that the CM had provided an environment conducive to investments and a robust law and order situation. “If you tell the CM something, then there is no delay in implementation. He will do whatever is possible. To promote investments, his government has issued various sectoral policies and has already signed 58 MoUs. The defence corridor will bring about an industrial revolution in the state,” Singh said. The Lucknow MP added that for the first time, the Centre had given private industry a share in domestic defence manufacturing. Since 2014, the Centre has issued 350 licences while the previous government had issued about 200 licenses between 2004 and 2014. To further strengthen the role of the private sector in the defence industry, the government was bringing in policy provisions in the design and development sector. Schemes were also being made to encourage industries to act as anchors. “Foreign direct investment through the direct route is 74% while if it is through the government, it is 100%. The Centre has also made a provision of Rs 1,000 crore to make purchases under the innovation for defence excellence scheme, floated to promote invention in the defence sector and in coming months, this provision will be increased. An additional Rs 500 crore has been allocated for promoting start-ups,” the minister said. Inviting investments in the UP defence corridor, Yogi spoke about the incentives being provided by his government, emphasising on the law and order situation in the state and Nivesh Mitra, the single window portal through which clearances are being provided. “UP promises the best security and if the private sector is interested in taking up this offer, UP can become an export hub in the defence sector and help in realising PM Narendra Modi’s dream of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. I will request the defence minister that if the Centre can implement the defence production policy, it will help boost investments in the corridor,” the CM said. Yogi said the Defence Expo organised by UP was hailed even by the experts. He said UP has become a sought-after investment destination under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi and the efforts of the state government are bringing dividends. The CM highlighted the robust infrastructure developed in the past 4 years such as expressways, international airports and connectivity corridors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-now-robust-state-under-yogi-rajnath/articleshow/87675327.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Pune||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope bats for persuasion, not coercion to boost vax rate||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has told collectors across the state to opt for measures aimed at persuasion and not coercion to boost vaccination. He said he would soon preside over a review meeting with all the collectors to understand the plans they had prepared to ensure every beneficiary was administered at least one dose by November 30. “We want community participation to speed up the drive,” Tope said. The statement assumes significance considering that some collectors, including the Aurangabad collector, have made at least one vaccine jab mandatory for residents to purchase fuel and ration. Tope told TOI that weekly review meetings would be held with the collectors, and they would be directed to include NGOs, housing society federations and local leaders to get their help in reaching out to the beneficiaries. The state is working towards administering at least one dose to the 9.14 crore eligible population by November 30. Of them, around 2 crore beneficiaries have not received a single dose. Nearly 5.93 crore beneficiaries are yet to receive their second dose. During his interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, Tope again put forth his demand to reduce the 84-day gap between administering the two Covishield doses to speed up the vaccination drive. “We have again demanded the Centre to reduce the gap between the Covishield doses to which they have only replied ‘Noted’,” Tope said. The minister also apprised the Centre about the programmes in the state to boost the inoculation drive. “We have assured the Centre that the state’s vaccination programmes will pick up and will be further scaled up,” he told the TOI. “The Mission Yuva Swastha has received a good response,” the minister said, adding that the state would strive to ensure that all the eligible beneficiaries receive at least one dose of the vaccine by November 30. He said public awareness was being created through various communication models to allay the citizens’ doubts on vaccination. A senior government official told TOI that they would have to review how the collectors would reach the target directing the machinery to take up special drives for the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-bats-for-persuasion-not-coercion-to-boost-vax-rate/articleshow/87674748.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Stubble burning: Why Delhi may have to wait for respite a little longer this November||NEW DELHI: An analysis of the past five years’ data from Nasa’s satellite imagery of stubble burning reveals that the daily farm fires come down drastically by mid-November. However, as farm fires have picked up late this year, experts said unlike past years, high incidents of stubble burning might continue for the next few days. The data shows 4,454 farm fires were recorded in Punjab on November 11 this year, but on the same day, it was only 2,434 in 2020, 672 in 2019, 1,365 in 2018 and 104 in 2017. It reveals that the paddy residue burning cases dropped further by mid-November as the fire counts on November 15 stood at just 69 in 2020, 77 in 2019, 1,482 in 2018, five in 2017 and 743 in 2016. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences at Universities Space Research Association in Nasa, said, “By November 15, most of the stubble was burnt in the previous years. However, as the stubble burning started late this year due to frequent rain in October, farm fires witnessed peak in the last one week. If the burning continues at the same rate for the next few days, the cumulative data of stubble burning can exceed last year’s.” L S Kurinji, programme associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “On Thursday alone, Punjab and Haryana witnessed over 4,662 farm fires. The daily counts have been in the range of 3,000-6,000 for the past eight days.” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “If high-intensity stubble burning continues for few more days and its contribution to Delhi’s air quality remains high, it can prolong the current smog episode.” Kurinji added, “Delhi has been experiencing severe air quality levels since 9pm, November 10. Additional emission load from stubble burning in the nearby states and unfavourable meteorologies — such as slow surface winds and northwest winds — are driving the pollution levels in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhi-may-have-to-wait-for-respite-a-little-longer-this-nov/articleshow/87674773.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh ministers spar over who’s bankrupt||HYDERABAD: After the fight over the Krishna river water, two ministers from AP and Telangana on Friday engaged in unsavoury remarks over the “financial crisis” in Telugu states, and accused each other’s state government of being “bankrupt” and “begging for funds”. The ministers, Vemula Prashanth Reddy of Telangana and Perni Nani of Andhra Pradesh, unwittingly entered into a war of words, each extolling his own government and criticising the other over financial bankruptcy. It all began with roads and buildings minister Prashanth Reddy during a dharna on the paddy purchase issue in Nizamabad alleging that Andhra people are now seeking alms. “AP people said if Telangana were to become a reality, then Telangana people would have to seek alms. But thanks to the efforts of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we (Telangana people) have utilized our revenue for our region and the revenue is not going to Andhra”. He then added that “Andhra people are now seeking alms.” Prashanth Reddy further said that AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is also “seeking alms from the Centre”. Now AP government cannot be run without borrowings. “Even for daily and routine expenditure, they are seeking help from the Centre. The AP government is fixing meters to agriculture borewells due to pressures from the BJP government at the Centre," Prashant Reddy alleged. Strongly condemning the remarks of Prashanth Reddy, AP transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) wondered how Telangana government had made such huge debts since its formation if it were so rich. “TRS leaders have been roaming around New Delhi seeking loans and grants with an assurance to join the NDA government at the Centre. Jagan Mohan Reddy would never speak with a double-tongue unlike TRS leaders,” Nani alleged. Nani further alleged that the TRS leadership is trying for an alliance with the BJP in New Delhi but posing as fighters for the cause of the poor back home in Hyderabad. “Our party supremo’s stand is always clear and straight,” said Nani, adding that AP has been making debts chiefly due to losing “Kamadhenu” like Hyderabad and the “blunders” of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. He said that bankers would tell Prashanth Reddy as to how Telangana’s debts grew in the past seven years after the TRS took over. On the other hand, Prashanth Reddy recalled that during the recent TRS plenary, KCR had said that there were thousands of requests from AP to launch the TRS in AP. “They even said they want schemes like Dalit Bandhu in AP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-ministers-sparover-whos-bankrupt/articleshow/87674780.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Graft of Rs 3 lakh crore in BMC in 25 years, says BJP||MUMBAI: The Mumbai BJP’s executive committee on Friday alleged that corruption in BMC was the biggest scam in independent India. The committee, in a resolution passed on Friday, said there was corruption of over Rs 3 lakh crore in BMC over the last 25 years. “There were scams like the 2G, 3G, coal scam, and CommonWealth Games (CWG) scam and many others in this country. But since Independence, the scam in BMC is the biggest in the country. It is to the tune of over Rs 3 lakh crore in the last 25 years,” the resolution moved by BJP MLA Ameet Satam read. Mumbai BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha, MLAs Mihir Kotecha, Atul Bhatkhalkar and MPs Manoj Kotak and Gopal Shetty were present among others including BMC corporators. The BJP also said that in the last two years of the MVA government, Mhada and SRA had become hubs of corruption. BJP alleged that MVA has become Maha Vasooli Aghadi. With this resolution, BJP leaders said that corruption in BMC would be the party’s main plank in the upcoming elections. “Before this, Maharashtra had not seen such an incompetent government. So the Mumbai BJP is resolving that in the upcoming BMC elections, it will not be a fight to come to power or to appoint the mayor from our party but it will be a struggle to fight for the rights and justice of the people of Mumbai and the city. BJP will stand with the people in the upcoming poll and fight for development and will ensure that Mumbai gets its glory and fame back. We resolve to fight and win this battle,” the resolution stated. BJP currently has 82 corporators in the 227-member BMC. In 2017, in a dramatic rise in its performance, BJP’s corporators grew from 32 to 82 and the party emerged as the second largest — just two corporators lesser than Sena. The Sena and BJP contested the polls alone. Before 2017, BJP was part of the ruling alliance in BMC with Shiv Sena for almost two decades. However, BJP had refused the opposition leader’s post in 2017 since it was in an alliance with Shiv Sena in the state then. Congress then laid claim to the opposition leader’s post in BMC. With the Sena-BJP alliance breaking in the state and Shiv Sena forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Congress and NCP in the state, BJP began playing opposition in the BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-graft-of-rs-3-lakh-crore-in-bmc-in-25-yrs-says-bjp/articleshow/87674758.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Delhi government submitted before a bench of chief justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that the Centre has already introduced a policy on door-to-door vaccination, and it has to be followed by all states. However, the counsel for the petitioner highlighted before the bench that the Centre and Delhi government have not filed their affidavits on the petition till date and no official statement has been made by the Delhi government on the issue, even while it is claiming that the Centre has granted it the mandate. "You file your affidavits. Keep in mind the argument of the counsel (for petitioner). You mention one paragraph about Delhi,” the bench told the counsel for the government, seeking a reply. In August, the court had issued notice on the petition by an 84-year-old senior citizen. She informed the court that she suffers from arthritis and cannot visit the vaccination centre on account of her health. The matter would be heard next on January 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-for-covid-vax-at-home-for-elderly-infirm/articleshow/87675715.cms||---

The district health officials claimed that the awareness about inoculation was growing among the unvaccinated people with the “Har Ghar Dastak” initiative. Rajesh Patil, commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), told TOI, “We have vaccinated a sizeable number of beneficiaries from the twin towns, but there could be still over a lakh of people who have not come forward for vaccination.” According to Patil, there are around 17 lakh eligible beneficiaries in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. Of them, around 15 lakh have received their first shot, while around eight lakh have received both the doses. An official from the public health services said they had two lakh vaccine doses comprising Covishield and Covaxin — good enough for conducting a smooth vaccination drive for the next few days. “We have clear instructions from the state government to exhaust the available vaccine stock and get the new one. The number of second dose beneficiaries will increase in the coming days. Naturally, the number of daily vaccination numbers will go up with each passing day,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/highest-nov-shots-in-district-on-friday/articleshow/87674772.cms||---

The woman, 30-year-old Neema Devi, was produced before the court later in the day and was sent to 14 days of judicial remand. On October 17, police had received information that Kundan Singh Dhami (35) had died after falling from his house roof at village Chhinpatta. However, a postmortem report raised suspicion over his death and pointed towards possible foul play. Soon after, the victim's brother, Dhan Singh Dhami, approached the police with a complaint against her sister-in-law. He alleged that the couple shared strained relations and would often engage in heated arguments. Based on the complaint, a case was lodged against Neema Devi under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Himanshu Pant, station house officer, Didihat, told TOI, “During interrogation, the woman confessed her crime. After an argument with her husband on October 17, the accused slit his throat.

Calling the Haat a platform where traditional arts and crafts were being given recognition, Mandaviya said: “It is necessary to promote, encourage and respect the art and crafts of indigenous artisans and craftsmen.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the slogan of ‘vocal for local’ to fulfill the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and that vision was being realised through the Hunar Haats being organised across the country. “To increase the income of artisans and craftsmen of the country, there is a need to provide national and international markets for their products. Hunar Haats have proved to be an important platform in this direction, ” he said. A government spokesperson said that more than 600 artisans from over 30 states and union territories are participating in the Hunar Haat, which will continue till November 21. Along with stalls selling handicraft and local products, cultural and musical performances of artists like Annu Kapoor, Pankaj Udhas, Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik will also be held. Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that more than 6.75 lakh artisans, craftsmen and people associated with them have been provided employment and employment opportunities through Hunar Haats in the past six years.

---||Nagpur||BJP to protest three-fold hike in Gunthewari charges||Nagpur: All BJP MLAs and corporators from the city will stage a protest against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for steeply hiking Gunthewari charges. The protests would commence with a big morcha at Yeshwant Stadium on November 15, which will be headed by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. On November 18, the BJP leaders would meet NIT chairman Manoj Suryawanshi and submit a representation to him requesting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government to provide some solace to about five lakh residents from the city. If the government fails to act, the saffron party will stage a big agitation in front of NIT office on November 22. “The Urban Development Department (UDD) had suddenly hiked Gunthewari charges from Rs56/sqft to Rs168, which is a three-fold jump. It floated a government resolution (GR) on October 18 without consulting with the public representatives or the department officials concerned. About five lakh residents would be adversely affected by this development, which is being implemented amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” MLA Krishna Khopde told the media. Flanked by other leaders, including MLA Vikas Kumbhare, ruling party leader in NMC Avinash Thakre, former MLA Milind Mane, BJP general secretary Sanjay Bangale, NMC legal committee chairman Dharampal Meshram, and BJP spokesperson Chandan Goswami, the MLA said the government’s decision shocked all these five lakh common households as many of them had either lost jobs due to the pandemic or suffered losses in their businesses. “When the Gunthewari Act was implemented in 2001, the then Congress-NCP government had fixed Rs48/sqft charges for the residents. However, the decision was strongly opposed by then senior corporator Prabhakar Datke, Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis, both outside and inside the assembly. Due to them, the then government was forced to reduce the charges to Rs16/ sq ft,” he said. Khopde said the Congress-NCP government again hiked the charges to Rs56/ sq ft over the years. “Under Fadnavis, the layouts coming under Gunthewari were developed by the government by providing basic facilities like cement roads, drainage, and water pipelines. Now for what reason have they hiked these charges? We will intensify the protest but in a democratic way and knock on the high court’s doors as a last resort,” he said. Expressing surprise over the silence of MVA ministers and leaders in the city, the MLA said “government’s parrots” like Congress state president Nana Patole and guardian minister (Nitin Raut) should have come forward to raise their voices against such big injustice to the common citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-to-protest-three-fold-hike-in-gunthewari-charges/articleshow/87674778.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Liquor to be cheaper by 20% from next week in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Come November 16 and the tipplers in the state may have something to cheer about. The prices of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) are likely to drop by 20% across the board while the prices of beer may change marginally. The excise department would announce a new duty structure for IMFL and beer on Tuesday, when top excise officials will meet liquor retailers to discuss a new distribution structure. However, some retailers said that it may take two more days to get stocks at new prices. The excise department had a series of meetings with leading liquor and beer companies over the last few months following representations from various bodies related to liquor trade. The consumption of IMFL in the state was in decline since the upward price revision in April 2020. The prices of IMFL have increased by almost 40%-50% in two phases since the pandemic set in. In the last quarter of 2020-21 and first two quarters of 2021-22, liquor consumption dipped by 30%-35% compared to the same period of 2019-20. The trend continued in the third quarter of this fiscal in October, when sale was down by 20%, despite it being a festive month. The excise department has verbally conveyed the information of change in duty structure on ex-distillery price for IMFL and ex-brewery price (EBP) for beer from next week. “A detailed circular may be issued on Monday night or on Tuesday,” an executive of an IMFL company said. While there has been a massive dip in IMFL demand, the demand for beer witnessed a jump. The prices of beer was slashed in October 2020 by 20%-30%. An executive of a top beer company pointed out that there had been a robust growth in demand since the fall in prices. “We are getting very encouraging response,” the executive added. West Bengal is a market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer annually. The total consumption of IMFL in 2020-21 was a little over 10 million cases. In the first four months of 2021, beer consumption has crossed 50 lakh cases, which is almost 60% of annual consumption of beer in the state. Beer consumption is expected to cross 1 crore cases mark in Bengal this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-to-be-cheaper-by-20-from-next-wk/articleshow/87673985.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar to invite open bid for sand ghats after district survey report||PATNA: Mining department minister Janak Ram on Friday said the state government would invite open tender for the authorised sand ghats after completion of the district survey report (DSR) in the wake of the Supreme Court’s directive recently. Talking to this newspaper, the minister said the DSR has to be prepared within six months. “Open tender will be invited after the process is complete. The companies at the national level may take part in the bidding process for legal sand mining in Bihar,” he said. He said the open bidding would generate more revenue to the state. “The department is going to hold a meeting soon to discuss the modalities for preparing the district survey report,” the minister said, adding that sand mining was stalled in October following the intervention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The mining department had started the process of auction of authorised sand ghats in eight districts from October 1, but it was stopped on the order of the NGT, causing huge loss to the state exchequer. The state government then moved the Supreme Court against the NGT’s order. The NGT had directed the state government to undertake further exercise for preparation of a fresh DSR for Banka. This led to stalling the process of auction of the sand ghats in other districts as well. The NGT, in its order issued on October 14, 2020, had said the DSR must be prepared through consultants accredited by the National Accreditation Board of Education and Training/Quality Control Council of India. The Supreme Court, however, observed that a total ban on legal mining, apart from giving rise to illegal mining activities, also caused huge losses to the public exchequer. Besides, illegal mining resulted in clashes between sand mafias, criminalisation and, at times, loss of human lives. A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao observed, “A balanced approach of sustainable development ensuring environmental safeguards needs to be resorted to while dealing with the issue of sand mining.” The court, in the meantime, allowed the state government to carry on mining activities through the Bihar State Mining Corporation (BSMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-to-invite-open-bid-for-sand-ghats-after-district-survey-report/articleshow/87673715.cms||Ramashankar

They also complained that the demand for the flight has gone up due after the easing of the Covid situation and the ongoing MSRTC strike. However, travelers also have to shell out more money for the one-stopover flights to Mumbai. TOI tried calling the assigned person from the flight operator but the call was not responded till the time of going to the press. Sanjay Shete, head of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce, said, “The count of passengers travelling to Mumbai is high from Kolhapur. People travel quiet frequently to Mumbai for work, business and industrial purposes. The frequent cancellation of the flight is inconvenient. The service should be resumed properly at the earliest.” Travelers said that the flight service remained shut in September and even now, the flight service is shut till next week. Sameer Sheth, who is a frequent flyer to Mumbai, said, “This has become a routine now. The flight to Mumbai gets cancelled at the last moment; creating much inconvenience and panic situation. The flight service should be implemented properly.” Recently, when the Pune airport was shut, the travellers from western Maharashta used Kolhapur airport for their travel. A meeting was also held recently with district guardian minister Satej Patil regarding the acquisition of 64-acre land for the Kolhapur airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/travellers-rue-irregular-schedule-of-kolhapur-mumbai-flights/articleshow/87673128.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: App cab driver molests woman after dangerous driving protest||KOLKATA: The Behala police have arrested an app cab driver for allegedly trying to assault and molesting a 23-year-old media professional and her male friend after they objected to the driver driving dangerously — with one hand on the steering wheel and another responding to a phone call — and blocking the right of passage. The cops said the incident took place around 8.15pm on Thursday in front of the Sree Sangha club on James Long Sarani in Behala. The accused — identified as Bubai Samanta — was arrested from his Behala residence on Friday morning and charged under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertaining to wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing hurt, molestation, criminal intimidation and insulting the modesty of a woman. “It started after an altercation between a woman scooterette rider — a reporter with a Bengali news channel — and the driver of an app cab (WB 04H 8378) after the cab driver tried to pass the two-wheeler coming from the opposite direction in a dangerous manner on James Long Sarani. The accused reportedly misbehaved with the victim and manhandled her friend who was riding pillion. We registered a case and nabbed the accused based on the complaint. We will get the woman to record her statement before a magistrate at the earliest,” said DC (Behala) Swati Bhangalia who has instructed the local police to ensure that the charge sheet is filed at the earliest. According to the woman, the app cab was coming from the opposite direction with the driver on the phone, and the car was blocking the narrow alley. “My friend stopped him and suggested he take the phone off his ear and drive. This infuriated the driver and he came out of the car and kicked the two-wheeler. He held my friend by his throat and kept punching him in the nose and face. When I protested, the driver pushed me away. He then threatened me, saying he will see me when my friend is not around,” the woman told cops. Fortunately for the police, the braveheart noted down the number of the cab before the driver fled. “We traced the cab through the app cab platform and the RTO details. The woman had also dialled 100 and our men attended to the initial call, picking up some clues,” said an officer. The misbehaviour by the app-cab driver is not the first in the city this festive season. Last month, a man lodged a complaint on Kolkata Police’s Bondhu app, alleging an app-cab driver had beaten him up and tried to molest his wife when they were getting out of the vehicle after reaching their destination in south Kolkata. A day earlier, a couple who work as software developers alleged an app-cab driver had beaten up the man and tried to snatch his wife’s phone. The man suffered injuries in his head. App cabs cancelling bookings at the drop of a hat has also spiralled during this festive season — the problem assumed alarming proportions after the massive hike in petrol and diesel prices. Last week, the Kolkata traffic police requested all such harassed passengers to take a screenshot of their booking and report the refusal to them along with the date, time, location and other basic details. The top brass have asked the public grievance cell of the traffic unit to look into each allegation and take “appropriate measures”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/app-cab-driver-molests-woman-after-dangerous-driving-protest/articleshow/87673982.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Is there a Bigg Boss show going on in the state? These doubts come to mind. The issue of development has been sidelined in the midst of allegations. On the other hand, Dawood, the underworld, the drug mafia are all being discussed. It is the misfortune of the state but the question to ask is who brings this to Maharashtra. It is up to the ruling party and administration to curb this,” she said. “The politics of the state has hit a new low. The ruling parties are accusing us. In all this chaos, the development of the state has lagged behind and unwanted issues are coming up. It would be better for rival parties to focus on development than to accuse us,” the BJP politician from Marathwada said. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane called minister Nawab Malik a traitor. “One who supports terrorists is a traitor.

As a key religious day, Kartiki Ekadashi, is nearing and the bus service remains affected; the Central railway authority has decided to send extra trains for Pandharpur. The reservation office at the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Terminus is witnessing heavy crowd. Shivnath Biyani, member of advisory committee with Pune Railway division, said, “On the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi, the Central Railway has decided to run special extra trains between Pandharpur - Miraj, Latur - Miraj and Latur- Pandharpur. The trains will have sleeper and second class compartments.” He added that the railway authorities were thinking about starting the passenger trains between Kolhapur and Pune again and a decision regarding the same is expected soon. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers’ association, said, “The state government cannot turn a blind eye to our demands. One lakh workers across the state are participating in the strike and if our demand to merge the MSRTC into the state government is not approved, then the intensity of the strike will further escalate.” He added that the MSRTC staff continued to work even during Covid lockdowns in the minimum salaries of around 8,000 to 10,000. “Now, our major demand of merger into state government should be fulfilled and only thereafter the strike will be called off,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/citizens-turn-to-railways-amid-stir-by-st-employees/articleshow/87673139.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||Pvt hosps expect rise in Covaxin demand||Kolkata: With the Centre set to announce a policy for third booster dose, city private hospitals — many of which are saddled with stocks of Covaxin that have had few takers so far — now plan to procure more Covaxin, expecting a rise in demand as the number of recipients swell. At least one hospital is set to place fresh orders this week after having run out of Covaxin more than a month ago. Another, which is now struggling to get rid of its existing stock, foresee a sharp rise in demand by January and believe it will soon need to order afresh. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), which exhausted its Covaxin stock more than a month ago, is set to procure a new consignment. “We will place orders for fresh stock very soon, may be by this week,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that a rise in Covaxin demand was now imminent. “We definitely foresee a rise in demand due to the expected third dose. Also, with vaccination for children likely to come up soon, there may be a further increase in demand,” added Venkatesh. Earlier this week, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) extended the shelf life of Covaxin from six months to a year, which came as a big relief for most private vaccination centres in Kolkata that were left with stocks set to expire soon. It didn’t, however, lead to spurt in demand. Nor did the WHO nod to the vaccine last week. AMRI Hospitals, which holds a stock of 4,500 Covaxin doses, sees a spurt immediately after the third dose is declared. “We are getting ready to deal with an overall increase in demand for vaccines since it will be a repeat of the first dose. Covaxin, too, will see a spurt and our existing stocks will be quickly used up. We are now assessing the situation and will place an order for Covaxin,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Woodlands Hospital administered 16,000 doses of Covaxin in May when the vaccine was introduced. “Depending on the government approval, this group would be eligible for their booster dose in December. Those who took Covishield could also go for cross-vaccination and take Covaxin as booster. So, demand is expected to rise in the next two months. We have sufficient stock of Covaxin and would be assessing the demand before placing orders for more stock,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. Peerless Hospital is following a wait-and-watch policy for Covaxin. “It is being given to those who are listing their names. We are getting very few takers yet but the third dose will scale up the demand. Hopefully, we will be able to use up our stock once the dose begins,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-expect-rise-in-covaxin-demand/articleshow/87673989.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Delhi||Delhi govt asks departments for plans to raise non-tax revenue||NEW DELHI: With the Covid pandemic stretching Delhi government’s finances, all departments have been asked to generate more non-tax revenue. Every department would have to submit an action plan within two weeks on the same. The pandemic has dealt a body blow to the state government’s financial health. The second wave of Covid this year and the lockdown to curb its exponential growth have resulted in Delhi government’s collection declining, while its expenditure has gone up massively due to the implementation of relief and other measures. In a circular issued on Thursday, the finance department has informed all departments that the “Covid crisis has stretched state finances by impacting both tax and non-tax collections. In this context, a need has arisen to augment non-tax revenue, which is currently at 2.7% and 2.9% of state’s total revenue collection in 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively”. The finance department has stated that the major components of non-tax revenue are interest charged on loans or advances, and dividends and profits from investment, apart from user charges or fees against services provided by the government. Keeping this in mind, it has said that non-tax revenue can be augmented by reviewing the outstanding loans that are recoverable from PSUs, local bodies and autonomous bodies under their administrative control and ensuring that interest on loan is received by the government. The department has said that Delhi government has circulated a dividend policy, which states that a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth, whichever is higher, is to be paid by a PSU. The finance department has directed the administrative department to take stock of the financial results of the PSUs and enforce the discipline laid down in the dividend policy. The department has also said that the user charges and fees for various services being provided shall be reviewed by examining the trend of non-tax collection and identifying the factors responsible for the lack of its growth. All the departments have been requested that an action plan for augmentation of non-tax revenue in respect to their department be sent to the finance department by November 25 as per a format provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-asks-depts-for-plans-to-raise-non-tax-revenue/articleshow/87675716.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The deceased identified as Abhijeet Hanumant Dhanawade, a resident of Kanheri, was travelling to Murgud to meet his sister. He owned a car with an LPG kit fitted in it. When the car reached the Waghjai ghat section, the kit exploded. The car immediately caught fire and Dhanawade jumped out of the car to save his life but he suffered severe burns and died on spot. In the meantime, the car fell into the valley and the dried grass along its way caught fire. Police inspector Sanjay Gorale of Kagal police station said, “Couple of travellers passing along the route saw the burning car. We immediately sent fire fighting vehicle to douse the fire. We found the body of the driver along the roadside. He might have tried to jump out of the car to save his life. Since the body was badly burnt, it was difficult to identify at first.” The tyres too caught fire and the car fell into the valley burning,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/man-dies-as-lpg-kit-in-car-explodes/articleshow/87673133.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Those who love Jinnah should go to Pakistan, says Naresh Agarwal||LUCKNOW: BJP leader Naresh Agarwal on Friday waded into the controversy over SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “Jinnah remark”, saying people who loved Jinnah should leave India and “go to Pakistan”. Speaking to reporters ahead of a BJP backed state level ‘Vaishya Sammelan’, scheduled to be organised in Lucknow on November 14, he said the country belonged to the followers of “Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi) and Patel (Vallabh Bhai Patel)”. He was reacting to Akhilesh’s recent remark comparing Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. Agarwal has been keeping a low profile since 2018 when he joined the BJP after being denied a ticket to Rajya Sabha by the SP. Cine star turned politician Jaya Bachchan was chosen over Agarwal by the SP leadership, a move that left the former RS MP and seven time MLA from Hardoi riled. Agarwal’s jibe at Akhilesh marked his aggressive emergence from a relatively dormant political stage to woo the ‘Vaishya’ (trader) community in favour of the BJP ahead of the UP assembly elections. His son, Nitin Agarwal, who represents Hardoi constituency, was recently propped by the BJP as a candidate for the post of deputy speaker in the UP assembly, a move which was seen as the saffron party’s attempt to bewilder the opposition ranks, mainly the SP, which had fielded its senior lawmaker Narendra Singh Verma, a Kurmi. The BJP has traditionally been banking on the upper caste votes, including Vaishya (trader community). Agarwal said that the BJP has been organising conventions for various communities. “The Vaishya sammelan is also part of the BJP campaign,” he said. He claimed no political party will be able to stand against the BJP which will have full support of the Vaishya community and win more than 300 seats. Earlier on November 7, Agarwal had made a scathing attack on the opposition parties in Hardoi, saying that those who did not believe in Lord Rama and considered Jinnah as their leader have been taught to go to temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-who-love-jinnah-should-go-to-pak-agarwal/articleshow/87675362.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rain-led damage affects functioning of e-court vans||By Sonali MishraNAINITAL: The acting chief justice of Uttarakhand high court (HC), Sanjay Mishra, on Friday said that the initiative of e-court vans, aimed at serving justice to the furthest corners of the hill state, has not yielded desired results due to the rain-triggered flash floods in October. The e-vans could not reach areas that became inaccessible due to rain-related incidents across Uttarakhand on October 18 and 19, he pointed out. In view of this, the acting chief justice said that HC will seek two more weeks from the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), a statutory body that provides free legal services to the weaker sections of the society, for the awareness campaign concerning e-court vans. The court will soon send out a letter to NALSA chairman in this regard. Justice Mishra added that the e-court van initiative is not a magic wand solution to provide legal aid to those in remote areas and the drive will become a success only with the cooperation of all stakeholders. On Independence Day this year, e-court vans — equipped with WiFi and computers for videoconferencing — were flagged off in Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Champawat, Tehri and Pithoragarh districts. Later, the facility was provided in other districts as well. The district judge and the court coordinator were tasked with maintaining and stationing these vans in their districts. Significantly, people could also seek deployment of the vans in their areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/e-court-vans-couldnt-yield-desired-results-due-to-recent-natural-disaster-awareness-campaign-to-be-extended-for-two-more-weeks-says-hc/articleshow/87673137.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Complaints of unmasked citizens, littering spike as clean-up marshals term out||MUMBAI: The BMC’s clean-up marshal scheme expired this year June, and with the BMC yet to appoint a full-time central agency, unmasked citizens and those spitting and littering in public are going unchecked. For the last four months, ad hoc monthly contracts have been issued at the ward level. As a result, several wards don’t have enough clean-up marshals and action against violators has slowed down. TimesViewThe BMC’s clean-up marshals scheme is very important to ensure citizens wear masks as lockdowns have been fully relaxed. The fact that the central clean-up marshals contract ended in June and now ad hoc extensions are being given at the ward level, shows that the BMC is not serious about this. The BMC should have awarded a new contract well before the old one expired. The BMC must appoint a new agency with a strong complaint redressal mechanism.The opposition has alleged that with no central contract, there is no accountability and the number of complaints against clean-up marshals for extorting money from citizens has gone up. Clean-up marshals are appointed across the city by the BMC’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) department. “The central agency SWM tender for clean-up marshals expired in June 2021. As a temporary measure, extension is being given at ward level right now. SWM has invited Expression of Interest and received responses from parties. A committee will meet for scrutiny and new agencies will be appointed thereafter,” said a senior civic official. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said the BMC had failed to get a new agency in place on time. “This shows that the scheme has failed and the BCM is not even serious about unmasked citizens. Having no central agency and only ward-level ad hoc contracts is the reason why there is no accountability. The ward doesn’t blacklist any clean-up marshals for extortion and there is no system of addressing complaints against them,” Shaikh said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a list of agencies has been sent to the wards and the ward officers were appointing clean up marshals as per their local requirement. “Marshals are being deployed across the city,” Kakani said. Around 720 marshals are deployed across the city as part of the SWM contract. After a video of clean-up marshals misbehaving with citizens not wearing masks had gone viral in February, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar had taken clean-up marshals to task and told them not to misbehave. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “The BMC has turned clean-up marshals into extortion agents. In the new contracts, there should be more stringent conditions and the BMC should make companies liable for their marshals’ actions. Penalty clauses should be introduced with a Rs 10,000 fine a day if there is any complaint against marshals. All companies flouting norms should be blacklisted,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plaints-of-unmasked-citizens-littering-spike-as-clean-up-marshals-term-out/articleshow/87673995.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The department had appointed officer-rank employees recently and many senior officials, it is alleged, were not kept in the loop. Pandey has ordered the education secretary to conduct an inquiry in this regard. Responding to the allegations, some education department officials, requesting anonymity, told TOI that the appointments were made to speed up the implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, in Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, it has also been alleged that some of the government school teachers were given transfers of their choice despite the current academic year being a 'zero transfer' year for all education department employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/edu-min-orders-probe-on-appointments-done-secretly-by-dept/articleshow/87673155.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Patna||Bizmen set to meet Union min at Hajipur tomorrow||PATNA: Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai and state industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain are slated to meet with industrialists and entrepreneurs at Hajipur on Sunday to find ways to put the industrial production there on the national map, sources said. While the initiative in this regard had been taken by Rai when he held detailed discussions on the related issues with Husain in Delhi in June this year, the Sunday meeting will also focus on the revival of industries in the Samastipur industrial area, they said. Besides the industrialists and prospective entrepreneurs, the officials of the industries department and Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) will also participate in the meeting. For the last several decades, the Hajipur industrial area has been home to several production units, but it has also remained plagued by various kinds of problems, including the lack of adequate land availability for new units, waterlogging, insecurity and lack of good quality roads. However, as a follow-up to the discussions between Rai and Hussain in June, a team of BIADA officials, along with representatives from the National Highways Authority of India, visited Hajipur in mid-June to identify the problems. During the legwork, the BIADA and other officials concerned zeroed in on the problems, which needed to be handled on priority basis to create improved working atmosphere, so that the existing production units deliver while the new units are also opened. The solutions found included construction of drainage system, fresh acquisition of land, construction of quality roads, provision of high-mast and street lights. During the first phase following the Sunday meeting, schemes would begin to be implemented from the end of the current fiscal. It is felt that Hussain will also announce the quantum of money to undertake the work to provide basic infrastructural facilities. By one estimate, it might require an investment worth around Rs100 crore. On Sunday, Hussain will also inaugurate a couple of new units which have come up for production in the Hajipur industrial area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bizmen-set-to-meet-union-min-at-hajipur-tomorrow/articleshow/87673905.cms||Abhay Singh

Prompt police action ensured the situation was restored to normalcy soon. A community had called a one-day bandh. They pulled down shutters of their business establishments on Friday. Some agitators also took out a morcha in the city. When it reached Shivaji Chowk, they saw a shopkeeper who had not closed his shop. The agitators asked him to close the shop, but he refused. The mob then took objection to his non-cooperation and pulled down the shutters and threw stones at it. Some people also looted the shop, which triggered a group clash, leaving some persons injured. The news spread like wild fire and a riot-like situation had developed. SP Dilip Patil Bhujbal rushed to the city and is camping there to supervise the law and order situation in the city. BJP MLC Nilay Naik and BJP district president Nitin Bhutada also visited the police station and requested police to arrest the miscreants immediately. “Now the situation is under control and city life is returning to normalcy,” said Bhujbal and added that close vigil is being maintained by the police so no untoward incident recurs in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/group-clash-at-pusad-during-one-day-bandh/articleshow/87674798.cms||---

---||Patna||One more ‘hooch’ death in Bihar's Samastipur||PATNA: In a fresh incident of suspected hooch death, spurious liquor allegedly claimed the life of a 19-year-old youth at Narghoghi Khairwan village under the Sarairanjan police station area of Samastipur district on Friday morning. Earlier, six persons had died after consuming poisonous liquor in different villages under the Patori police station area in the district this month. The deceased, Chandan Kumar, used to work in Mumbai and had reached home to celebrate Chhath with his family. Police denied anything related to spurious liquor consumption but followed all the SOPs laid down for cases of deaths related to hooch poisoning. At least 63 persons have reportedly died from hooch poisoning in Gopalganj, West Champaran, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur since Diwali eve. Overall 116 persons have died in the ‘dry’ state after consuming poisonous liquor this year. The series of hooch deaths followed by statewide crackdown against liquor smuggling were the main issue at the weekly review meeting held by senior police officers at the state police headquarters on Friday. Sarairanjan police station SHO Raja Kumar said the postmortem of Chandan’s body was conducted at the Sadar hospital. “The viscera samples have been preserved for further forensic analysis to know if poisonous hooch consumption was the reason behind his death,” he said. The SHO said police recorded his family’s statement in which they denied that Chandan had consumed any bad thing. “However, there were murmurings in the village over his death due to which a postmortem was conducted,” he said. He said the family members had rushed him to the Dalsinghsarai sub-divisional hospital on Thursday after he fell ill but brought him back home on Friday morning, after which he died. When asked, the SHO could not tell what kind of health complications Chandan developed all of a sudden due to which he was rushed to the hospital. However, sources said Chandan’s family members had initially told the villagers that he had gone somewhere with his friends for a party and fell ill on his return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-more-hooch-death-in-samastipur/articleshow/87673602.cms||Debashish Karmakar

However, if vaccines for kids under 17 do not come in by the time the fair starts on January 31, they will be allowed in said authorities of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild on Friday while announcing the 45th edition of the fair. If all goes well, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina might attend the fair since her country is the theme country of the fair this time. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to invite her to the fair this year when it got cancelled because of Covid. The fair will celebrate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the golden jubilee year of the independence of Bangladesh. TimesViewThis is one event that millions in Kolkata and Bengal look forward to every year. Plans to bring it back is an index of the city’s yearning to return to normality. It is difficult to predict the pandemic’s status two months later but one can assume that Covid will not be gone. So the focus should be as much on maintaining Covid-safety protocols as on having a grand book fair. Organisers can look at increasing the size of stalls, maybe at the cost of the number of stalls, if the fairground area cannot be increased; limiting the number of visitors at any given time is another option.The fair will be held at Salt Lake’s Central Park. Many alterations are being worked out by the Guild so that the fair, which will continue till February 13, can be safely held in these Covid times. “We will have open stalls as far as possible and their size will be reduced to allow space for visitors to move around with social distancing in place,” said Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the Guild. E-passes will be distributed to facilitate entry, automatically reducing crowding at the gates, it was said. These e-passes will be given from different online portals. “It is likely there will be a special entry channel for pass holders and it will stagger the crowd,” Chatterjee said, adding that it will take several more meetings with architects and members before finalising the fair design. Masks will be mandatory and hand sanitiser will be placed at vantage points. For those who cannot physically attend the fair, the Guild will start a virtual fairground visit. A click of the mouse will allow them to “walk around” the fair and they might even be able to browse and order. “We will reveal this gradually. There’s a huge book fair fan population abroad who will be able to enjoy it on the virtual mode,” said Guild president Sudhangshu Dey. In separate events, tributes will be paid to Pranab Mukherjee, Soumitra Chattopadhyay, Shankha Ghosh, Buddhadeb Guha, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and other noted personalities who have departed in the recent past. The number of stalls is likely to remain 600 and the Guild has decided not to increase the fees this time. There is yet to be a decision on whether the number of food stalls will be reduced and whether only dry packets will be sold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-entry-to-kolkata-book-fair-without-double-vax-cert-but-kids-may-be-allowed/articleshow/87673993.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Bihar: 19,000 farmers in Bhojpur apply online for selling paddy||ARA: Around 19,000 farmers of Bhojpur have already applied online at the agriculture department portal for selling their paddy yield through PACS and vyapar mandals. The number of applicants has increased by about 3,000 compared to the last year with three more days (till November 15) still left for the farmers to apply online. “Around 16,000 farmers had applied online at the Bhojpur district agriculture department portal last year for selling their paddy harvest. Their number this year has already increased to 19,000. The paddy procurement in Bhojpur will start from November 15 and continue till February 15 next year,” Bhojpur district cooperative officer (DCO) Vijay Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Friday. “The custom milled rice (CMR) will be procured till July 31 next year. The last date for the online application for selling paddy has been extended from October 31 to November 15. All arrangements for the paddy procurement have been made by the department,” he added. Agriculture scientist and head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Bhojpur, Pravin Kumar Dwivedi said: “The reason for more farmers applying online for selling their paddy harvest is that they will now get their land possession certificates (LPCs) as per the government norms. Earlier, the land documents used to be in the name of ancestors, but now farmers are getting individual ownership, so it has become easier for them to apply online for selling their produce. The increased level of awareness among the farmers is also contributing to it.” He said more than 5 lakh farmers have got themselves registered on the portal of Bhojpur district agriculture department. “So, the number of farmers applying online for selling their produce to the government agencies will increase further in future,” Dwivedi said. According to the data available till Thursday, 18,806 farmers applied online for selling their paddy harvest, out of which 13,782 are ‘gair raiyats’ while 5024 are raiyat farmers. Among them, the maximum farmers are from Piro block (3,123), followed by Barhara (176). While 18,054 farmers have applied for selling their paddy through the PACS , 752 have applied for vyaapar mandal. A total of 223 purchase committees have been selected for the paddy procurement in Bhojpur district. They include 211 PACS and 12 Vyaapar Mandals. While the minimum support price for general quality paddy is Rs1,940 per quintal, it is Rs1,960 per quintal for Grade 'A' paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/19000-farmers-in-bhojpur-apply-online-for-selling-paddy/articleshow/87673747.cms||---

According to the transport officials, the proposal is in drafting stage and fares for different stages of travel will be fixed once civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade gives his nod to the proposal. Last time the bus fares were increased in 2018. Covid pandemic has led to heavy losses to the transport undertaking. Also, more buses have been added to the operational fleet given the rise in passenger count. Currently, around 50 buses — 50% of the total fleet available with the KMT — are operational. The officials claimed that it will take at least a month to get the operations back to normal. A senior KMT official said, “The final proposal with fare hike rates will be tabled before the regional transport authority headed by district collector in the next couple of weeks for approval. Even if the passengers count increases back to normal, then also losses will continue due to higher fuel prices. Maximum number of passengers are school students, women and elderly people. Since the schools and colleges are opening and markets are resuming slowly, we expect the entire fleet of over 100 buses will be on roads by month-end.” In normal situation when all the buses are on road, then around 4,000 litre of diesel is required for operations. Around 80,000 passengers board the buses on a daily basis. The revenue from passenger tickets is the major source of revenue for the KMT and pre-pandemic, the transport undertaking was facing a loss of around Rs 2 lakh every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmt-plans-to-raise-bus-fares-by-25-to-tide-over-loss/articleshow/87673146.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC questions move to book those who housed Tablighis||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday questioned the city police’s move to book Indian citizens for housing foreigners who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event last year amid the Covid-19 lockdown. “Suddenly, when a lockdown is imposed, where does one go after that? What is the offence committed? Is there any bar on Madhya Pradesh residents on staying in Delhi in any mosque, temple or gurdwara? They can stay wherever they want. Was there a notice that everybody will throw out whosoever was staying (with them) ?” Justice Gupta said, pointing out that the government had not imposed a ban on people from staying at any particular place. HC was hearing a batch of petitions to quash the FIRs against the hosts. It said the Jamaat attendees sought refuge before the lockdown was imposed and there were no allegations of them violating the orders restricting movement. “I have brought out the point...you will tell me where is the violation when there is no question of changing places at that time? I can understand they went out, that they violated the (lockdown) notification. When lockdown was imposed, there was no bar on anyone residing (sic),” the court said and gave time to Delhi Police to file its response to the petitions. The police's lawyer sought time to file a status report, and said that at the relevant time, there was a bar on any type of religious events. The petitioners' lawyer said that since the Jamaat attendees began staying on the premises in question before the lockdown was imposed and none tested positive for Covid, no case was made out against her clients. While some of the petitions for cancelling the FIRs are by individuals who had provided shelter to the foreigners and could not travel due to the subsequent lockdown, others are by people like managing committee members or caretakers of mosques who have been accused of providing housing facilities to the foreigners at mosques under the jurisdiction of the Chandni Mahal police station. Earlier, the court had told Delhi Police to file a status report, indicating the role of each accused and as well as the duration of their stay, and whether the housing facility was given after or before lockdown orders were issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-questions-move-to-book-those-who-housed-tablighis/articleshow/87675719.cms||---

The school, which has a strength of 200 students, has two sanctioned Science teacher posts. However, the school just has one Science teacher at present and even he is not able to take classes as he has been made the acting principal of the school. The other post remains vacant. When asked about the issue, Padmendra Saklani, chief education officer, Bageshwar, told TOI, “We have sent a letter to the state government regarding the matter. Once we get the nod, more teachers will be deployed in the school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-school-students-take-to-streets-demanding-deployment-of-teachers/articleshow/87673163.cms||---

It caused a traffic bottleneck. The vehicle was shifted after two hours,” he said.Several roads in the locality require urgent attention, said Manikandan. “We took the issue to the notice of zonal officials several times, but no action was taken. We will stage a protest if roads are not relaid at the earliest.”Garbage woes are plaguing the locality, said R Shanthi, another resident. “As waste is not cleared periodically, garbage piles on roadside are a common sight. Garbage bins overflow every day because of ineffective door-to-door garbage collection,” she said. “Pack of stray dogs can be seen near the piles, instilling fear in the minds of residents. Dogs thrive in the area because of the poor waste collection system. The dogs run after two-wheeler users, causing accidents.”An official at the corporation’s north zone office promised to address the issues. “Garbage and stray dog menace would be addressed immediately. But it will take some more time to lay roads. We will carry out repair works,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bad-roads-garbage-heaps-irk-gandhi-managar-residents/articleshow/87674818.cms||V Devanathan

JD(U) and BJP are allies in Bihar as well as at the Centre. Jhanjharpur MP and JD(U) national secretary Ramprit Mandal, who is the party’s in-charge in Manipur, will visit the northeast state on November 13 to review the present political scenario and the party’s preparations for the forthcoming polls. “Mandal, during his four-day stay, would review the ongoing preparations for the party’s proposed mega rally at Imphal on December 11,” JD(U) Manipur state president and former minister Hangkhanpao Taithul told TOI over phone on Friday. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh will lead the rally. The JD(U) wants to show its strength in Manipur through its proposed rally to be addressed by several top party leaders. “We have already got formidable candidates for at least 15 seats. More candidates, including some sitting and former MLAs, are to join the party at its rally….We are girding up loins to contest around 20 seats,” Taithul said in a response to a query. He, however, said the final decision regarding the number of seats would be taken by the JD(U) national leadership. The importance of Manipur polls for the JD(U) can be gauged from the fact that Lalan himself led a four-member team of senior party leaders to Imphal on October 8. The visiting team, comprising K C Tyagi, Afaque Ahmad Khan and R P Mandal, stayed in Manipur for four days to assess the party’s strength in different constituencies in the assembly polls. In the last assembly polls held in 2017, the Congress had won 28 seats to emerge as the single largest party. Later, in a dramatic turn of events, the BJP, which won 21 seats, formed the government with the support of three regional parties — the Naga People’s Front (NPF), National People’s Party (NPP) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), and the support of another MLA. The lone LJP MLA, Karam Shyam, joined the BJP on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-likely-to-contest-20-of-60-assembly-seats-in-manipur/articleshow/87673925.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Dehradun||SC stays felling of trees on Delhi-Dehradun expressway till November 16||DEHRADUN: The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday directed the Centre to put a stay on proposed felling of around 11,000 trees for expansion of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, till the next hearing on November 16. The court’s order came in response to a petition filed by a Doon-based NGO, Citizens for Green Doon. The NGO had initially approached the top court in early September and been told to go to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) instead. The NGO found the tribunal’s response unsatisfactory and moved back to the SC. The court also pulled up the NGT during Thursday’s hearing for “failing to deal with the issue in a satisfactory manner.” The matter pertains to a 19.5-km-long four-lane elevated stretch on NH-72A, from Ganeshpur (Uttar Pradesh) to Asharori (Uttarakhand), for which around 8,800 trees would need to be felled in UP and 2,200 in Uttarakhand. The trees on the chopping block include 1,600 British-era Sal trees, which was first reported by TOI in August last year. Himanshu Arora, secretary, Citizens for Green Doon, said that they had approached the Supreme Court in the matter on September 7. “The court refused to entertain our PIL, saying the NGT should resolve the matter, as it pertains to wildlife and forest clearances. However, when we went to NGT, we were told that this was not an environmental emergency. This was unacceptable to us. Cutting down so much green cover definitely qualifies as an emergency. So, we went back to the Supreme Court.” He added that the court thereafter assured them that it will listen to the case. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, while hearing the matter, said, “The NGT should apply its mind. It has original jurisdiction over matters related to the environment. The way orders are passed by the NGT nowadays is totally unsatisfactory. The tribunal has to work in a different way and not this way. It cannot just pass any order and shift its burden to the Supreme Court.” Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said all clearances were in place for the project and no additional ones were needed for tree felling. Senior advocate Anita Shenoy, appearing for the NGO, cited an RTI reply to show that only stage-one clearances had been secured for the project. No orders had been issued by either the UP or the Uttarakhand government, giving a go-ahead to the project, which she said made tree felling illegal. She argued that tree felling and construction should immediately be stopped. In reply, Venugopal said the petitioner lacked “complete know-how of things” and that stage-two clearances had been granted, which could be checked at the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) website. The bench asked Venugopal to file all relevant details in the matter when the case is heard next Tuesday.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Inauguration of Purvanchal expressway a ‘tamasha’, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Taking a jibe at the BJP leadership visiting Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the saffron brigade is jittery as they can see defeat staring them in their face. He described the government's plan to inaugurate Purvanchal Expressway as a ‘tamasha’ (concert). SP chief ’s comment came on a day when BJP’s poll planner Union minister Amit Shah was in Varanasi to fine tune party’s election strategy, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi may visit the state four times this month with his Sultanpur visit on November 16 to inaugurate the state’s longest Purvanchal Expressway at a three-km long airstrip built on it. Describing Purvanchal Expressway as a project that was conceived by Samajwadi Party government and land procured for the project between Lucknow and Ballia, the former UP CM said the BJP is planning to put up a ‘theatrical adaptation’ of what the SP government had done when the Agra Expressway conceived and executed by the SP government: touch down of fighter planes on the e-way. “People know that fighter planes ‘touched-down’ on an expressway for the first time during the Samajwadi Party government. Now the BJP is only copying it,” he said. “The only difference is that SP completed the entire expressway within 22 months and the Purvanchal Expressway is not even close to completion,” the SP chief said. Akhilesh said the fact that the government has planned to inaugurate incomplete projects explains that the BJP knows it will be defeated in the polls. “The CM and PM can put out foundation stones to claim credit for such halfcomplete projects, but people will not be misled now. They can see through such gimmicks. In fact, there is anger among the people over the deteriorating law and order and crime scene in the state. The condition of the health and education sectors is equally bad. Unemployment is on the rise and trade and businesses are passing through a lull. In such a situation, the government wants to indulge in chest thumping by inaugurating incomplete projects,” Akhilesh said.

---||Lucknow||BJP poll publicity blitz with art & performances||Lucknow: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has begun a publicity blitz in the state by roping in local artists from different genres, targeting rural areas for the Assembly polls due in Uttar Pradesh early next year. From songs, jingles, poetry, paintings, street plays, sculptures, drama, and bhajans to publicise the Modi and Yogi government’s achievements, BJP’s cultural wing is inviting artists to perform through its two-month-long publicity campaign. For instance, a poet in a recently held competition in Meerut sang, “Saare jag me mere desh ka maan badhaya…Modi-Yogi ki Jodi ne geet Bharat ka gaya.” In another example, a painter drew a portrait of PM Narendra Modi showcasing his stand on criminalisation of triple talaq. The idea, said party functionaries, is to target every booth by means of artwork. The party has given themes such as construction of historic Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, formation of anti-Romeo squad, bringing an end to ‘goonda raj’, triple talaq, Ujjawala scheme, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and many others. State convener of BJP’s cultural wing Ravi Satija said, “The campaign focuses on schemes and achievements of the double-engine government. It sends a strong message of PM Modi emerging as a strong leader for solving mass problems. We want artistes to woo voters through their own ideas and take the massive work done by BJP government to public.” Satija’s latest song applauding the PM’s work goes like, “Har har me dikhte hain Modi, ghar-ghar me dikhte hain Modi… Bharat nav nirman karenge Modiji, shaktishali rastra banaye Modiji.” In charge of events across the state, co-convener of BJP’s cultural wing Gaurav Awasthi said the top three winners of six regions will compete at state level. “These artists will take selfies with common people and post it on social media to connect with them,” Awasthi said. On Article 370, Ruchi Chaturvedi, a poetess, wrote, “Chhaya tha ghangor andhera, ek suraj ne chata diya...Jinko ank (numbers) nahi bhaaye, un anko ko hata diya...Wo dhara 370 thi jisne apno se door rakha, Bharat maa ke beton ne us dhara ko hi hata diya.” “The campaign is serving dual purposes of giving a platform to artists to present their thoughts on the government’s schemes and also helping us promote the party’s agenda in each constituency,” Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-poll-publicity-blitz-with-art-performances/articleshow/87675401.cms||Isha Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Jaipur man’s kids & dad to appear in HC today’||Mumbai: The Bombay high court was on Friday informed by the lawyers for a Jaipur man and his parents that the grandfather would appear before it with the two minor children on Saturday. The vacation court bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja had on Wednesday directed the Jaipur-based man to appear on Friday with his two minor children, failing which orders to ensure their presence would be passed and may include issuance of arrest warrants against him and his parents. The interim order was on an urgent plea by his ex-wife, who resides in Kemps Corner in South Mumbai now after her remarriage in September. Her case was that her husband, who is a businessman, had divorced her by pronouncing talaq three times while they lived in the US in 2017. She had moved the HC with an urgent plea for directions to produce her children, who she alleged were illegally detained by her ex-husband after Jaipur police came to Mumbai and took her and them along with their passport and documents on September 30, allegedly on the basis of a ‘false FIR’ against her of jewelry theft. Her counsel Rizwan Merchant, at the hearing kept at 10.30am, said despite the HC order, the father and children remained absent. Merchant said he had also spoken to the Jaipur police chief. The HC was on the verge of directing that the grandfather be produced along with the children on Saturday at 3pm, when advocates Rafiq Gori and Karan Singh appearing for the Jaipur family submitted that the children will be brought by their grandfather himself along with a list of documents, including the green cards of the minor children and their permanent resident cards of Hong Kong, their passports and re-entry permit of US as well as the green card of the petitioner — their mother. The mother had expressed her apprehension that the children may be taken to Hong Kong against their wish as the ex-husband has business there and in the US. The HC had on Wednesday restrained the kids from being taken abroad till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jaipur-mans-kids-dad-to-appear-in-hc-today/articleshow/87674834.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCB records statement of Aryan Khan at Kharghar||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) vigilance team on Friday recorded the statement of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan at its temporary office in Kharghar as part of its probe into allegations of pay-off to its zonal chief, Sameer Wankhede. After he reached the NCB office at Ballard Pier to record his attendance as per the bail condition, he was taken to Kharghar. NCB deputy director Gyaneshwar Singh told the media at its CISF camp at Bandra that in the last 10 days they had recorded statements of 14-15 persons connected with the case, and they are yet to examine few more. Singh said the team recorded statements of Gosavi’s bodyguard Prabhakar Sail twice and if needed they may call him again. “We met Mumbai Police officials and collected CCTV footage of few places, digital, oral as well documentary evidence, and are yet to analyze the data collected. I will not disclose anything on the probe, not even the preliminary inquiry report, which may hamper our inquiry,” he said.' He said that they have not reached any conclusion yet as they still have to examine some key witnesses, including Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, and the witness Kiran Gosavi. Singh said his team moved an application before a court in Pune to seek permission to interrogate Gosavi, who is in Pune police’s custody in a cheating case. “We have moved court to record Gosavi’s statement and the court is likely to hear the matter on Monday,” he said. If the court grants permission, the NCB team will next week record Gosavi’s statement in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-records-statement-of-aryan-at-kharghar/articleshow/87674041.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Patna||Bihar seeks central funds for Kosi-Mechi project||PATNA: State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Friday sought financial support from the Centre under the 90:10 ratio formula for the Kosi-Mechi intra-linking river project in north Bihar. Jha was addressing the 19th meeting of the special committee on the interlinking of rivers in the country held at Delhi. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat chaired the meeting. The Kosi-Mechi project has already got Centre’s clearance, but the resolution of its financial aspects was in the process. While it is an ambitious project of the Bihar government, the WRD has also identified three other intra-river linking projects, including for south Bihar, to address the flood and drought mitigation concerns. Pointing out that the state was “happy” with the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) in connection with the Kosi-Mechi project, Jha said, “This will contribute significantly in mitigating the double whammy of flood and drought, which the state faces every year.” The project is purported to mitigate flood problem and also provide water for irrigation purposes to four eastern Bihar districts. Stating that CM Nitish Kumar has been working on a broad vision pegged to the flood-drought mitigation, Jha also thanked the Centre for considering three other intra-linking of Bagmati-Ganga, Budhi Gandak-Noon-Baya and Bagmati-Budhi Gandak rivers projects in north Bihar. Jha also said the state’s mathematical modelling centre (MMC) has undertaken the study for the intra-linking of the rivers concerned. One such study with regard to the Bagmati-Ganga linking had shown “positive results”, he said. “If the scheme is implemented, it will help free Kusheshwar Asthan from the flood menace caused by Bagmati, Kamla and Kosi rivers,” he added. Jha argued for the interlinking of Bagmati, Kosi and Kamla rivers in north Bihar and Punpun with Harohar in south Bihar. He also requested the Centre to deploy more officials at the NWDA regional office at Patna to facilitate better coordination between the state WRD and the agency. Referring to the visionary plan envisaged by CM Nitish with regard to greening of the state through the Jal Jeevan Hariyali (JJH) campaign, Jha said the UN had recognized him as the Global Climate Leader, and Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates has also appreciated his efforts. Jha referred to the efforts being made for the plantation drive to increase the green cover, stress on using solar energy, rainwater harvesting and reviving dead water bodies. He said all this was in sync with the COP26 agenda concerns. Besides, as many as 29,952 schemes had been identified to provide irrigation water to every plot of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-seeks-central-funds-for-kosi-mechi-project/articleshow/87673637.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore Medical College Hospital surgeons remove metal object from 53-year-old woman’s chest||COIMBATORE: Surgeons of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) proved their mettle again by removing a sharp metal object that pierced the chest of a 53-year-old Pollachi resident. The patient had stabbed herself in a fit of anger during an altercation with her family, a doctor said. “She was brought to the hospital on October 20 by her relatives, with the object lodged in her diaphragm and a portion of it protruding out. It had narrowly missed the heart, leaving the muscles around the pericardial chamber that accommodates the heart injured.” The patient underwent sternotomy – a procedure that allows doctors to reach out to the heart and nearby blood vessels, within a couple of hours. “As the patient had suffered internal bleeding, blood was getting deposited in the pericardial chamber. Usually, it will have 30ml of pericardial fluid for lubrication of the heart, which expands and contracts. Accumulation of blood was harming the heart, requiring immediate surgery,” the doctor added. “We immediately performed sternotomy on her and 300ml of blood deposited in the pericardial chamber was removed along with the metal object, and the injured muscles were repaired,” said cardiothoracic surgery associate professor A Shivanraj. Four weeks after the surgery, the patient is out of danger. CMCH dean A Nirmala said that timely intervention saved the life of the patient, who was operated free of cost under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-surgeons-remove-metal-object-from-53-year-old-womans-chest/articleshow/87674832.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp’s sewer connectivity dream a challenge for KWA||Thiruvananthapuram: While the corporation plans to attain sewerage connection in 80% of city wards in six years, Kerala water authority (KWA) has had to deal with tender excess, technical difficulties, contractual issues and local protests while undertaking sewerage schemes in the last five years under AMRUT-1. Recently poor performance of contractors coupled with mounting pressure to expedite the work forced the KWA to terminate the work on laying transmission main and sewer network in Karimanal (Block J), collection and conveyance system phase 1, trunk main from Arasumoodu to Karimanal pumping station. In November 2020, the chief engineer sent a letter to the executive engineer saying that the work shall be completed by February 2021. The latest project status of the work shows that due to poor performance, the original work is cancelled and the balance work is arranged at the risk and cost of the contractor. Work has been tendered again and two offers were received and a tender process is underway. The unexpected hurdle in the implementation of the work is likely to slow down the progress. It had taken nearly two years for all major works under AMRUT since the date of obtaining technical sanction to get into the implementation stage. Between this time period the KWA had a horrid time finding experienced firms with the required expertise to get the work done. Often the KWA was forced to present an excess amount for works as serious on-field issues were cited by the contractors which called for additional cost. In January, the city corporation decided to go ahead with four sewerage works for which excess tender was quoted. About 40% tender excess was approved for three sub works. These included providing sewerage facility to eastern side of Amayizhanjan canal between Vanchiyoor junction and Samad hospital road junction, rehabilitation of sewer line, including cleaning, replacing damaged lines etc at Kaithamukku, Thengappara area and rehabilitation of damaged sewer network at Palkulangara. The corporation also executed a work agreement on 27% tender excess for the work that involves laying transmission main and sewer networks in Karamanal collection and conveyance system. The corporation had also agreed to bear 40% tender excess for laying sewer network from Murinjapalam to Kannamoola. Another work was approved at 45% tender excess. The work involves laying of pipe and construction of new manholes at Chengalloor and Vattavila of Punnakamugal ward. The high powered committee approved the tender excess citing that the state faces an acute shortage of experienced contractors in the sewerage sector and high risks are involved in executing the work. The administrative sanction for sewerage pump house at Edathara was fixed at Rs 5.87 crores and the amount had to be revised later. The contractor had cited that the site for construction was slushy and there was high risk for tilting of the well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corps-sewer-connectivity-dream-a-challenge-for-kwa/articleshow/87654393.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Single-day Covid tally at over 3-month high||NEW DELHI: The capital on Friday recorded 62 cases of Covid in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day tally in more than three months. The state health department, in its latest bulletin, also confirmed two fresh fatalities due to the viral infection — the spread of which is on the rise again, though it is nowhere near the alarming levels witnessed in the runup to the second wave of the pandemic in April and May. Back then, there was an acute shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs at hospitals in Delhi. With the new cases, the Covid infection tally in the city reached 14,40,332. Of this, over 14.1 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. A total of 49,874 tests were conducted a day ago, including 38,408 RTPCR/CBNAAT/True Nat tests, while the rest were rapid antigen tests. The toll stands at 25,093, including the two reported on Friday. Before this, the city did not report any death due to Covid in November. Last month, Delhi recorded four deaths due to the infection while five people had succumbed to the viral disease in September. The number of active cases in the city is 371. Of these, 152 patients are being treated in various city hospitals and 156 are in home isolation. There are 111 containment zones in the capital. Delhi reported 25 Covid cases on Monday, 33 on Tuesday, 54 on Wednesday and 40 on Thursday. Doctors say there is an urgent need to step up measures to prevent the disease spread, which includes increased testing, stricter enforcement of mask rules and speeding up of the vaccination drive. “The increase in cases as well as the positivity rate is marginal. However, that should not make us complacent. We need to increase testing to be able to identify potential areas where disease is spreading and enforce strict measures to prevent overcrowding. Mask rules have to be enforced strictly,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital. The hospital has 470 Covid beds, of which only six were occupied on Friday. Other hospitals, too, have very low occupancy of Covid beds, data shows. “We cannot afford another spike in Covid cases as we are struggling with a rise in OPD and IPD visits due to mosquito-borne illnesses and respiratory problems caused by air pollution,” Dr Arun Gupta, the president of Delhi Medical Council, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/single-day-covid-tally-at-over-3-month-high/articleshow/87675746.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Patna||‘Many in Purnia forced to sell paddy much below MSP’||PURNIA: The state government had announced paddy procurement on November 1 through PACS (primary agriculture cooperative societies) at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1940-Rs1960 per quintal, but the farmers are forced to sell their produce at a throwaway price in several blocks of the district. “Before the Chhath holiday, two PACS centres were opened under Banmankhi and Dhamdaha subdivisions of the district for the procurement of paddy at the MSP fixed by the state government. But, it remained a formality as procurement has not started at the two centres yet,” said Nyaz Ahmad, the coordinator of Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti as well as Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, Purnia unit. “The delay has forced the farmers in the district to sell their produce at Rs1,100-1,200 per quintal to the middlemen and arhatiyas as small and marginal farmers don’t have storage facilities. Traders and middlemen are making money by selling the same produce (obtained from farmers) to PACS at MSP. We urge the state government to check hoarding and ask the PACS to procure paddy,” Nyaz added. Shaukat, a farmer from Jhunni Estambrar village under K-Nagar block of the district, said the PACS will start obtaining paddy from mandis when the distress sale by farmers is over. “I had paddy in seven acres of land, out of which crops in three acres were destroyed due to heavy rainfall in the district in October. The BB11 variety, in the remaining portion of the land, has been processed and will be sold at the market price,” he said. Yamuna Murmu from Pathraha panchayat under B-Kothi block said, “The announcement was made on November 1, but the procurement through PACS has not started yet. We will be happy if the process starts in our panchayat.” Varun Kumar Mehta, a farmer from Jhunni Kala panchayat under Srinagar block of the district, said, “The paddy procurement at the MSP is just on paper. We are selling our produce at Rs1100-1200 per quintal. Zamini hakikat kuch aur hai (the ground reality is something different).” When asked about the delay in paddy procurement by the PACS, president of all the 252 PACS in Purnia district, Amin Akhter, said, “It has begun at Touli under Dagrua block, Jhowwari (Amour), Jagni (K-Nagar), Rupaspur Khagha under Dhamdaha subdivision as well as under Harda block. Though, the process was to start on November 1, it didn’t happen due to high moisture content in the paddy due to heavy rainfall in October. From November 20, the procurement process will be fast-tracked at all the PACS.” Akhter said the MSP for grade A paddy is Rs1960 per quintal whereas it is Rs1940 per quintal for grade B produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-in-purnia-forced-to-sell-paddy-much-below-msp/articleshow/87673800.cms||---

Those acquited by the special judge, VY Jadhav, included two workers, a farmer, a grocery shop owner, an auto-rickshaw driver and a carpenter. According to the prosecution, the accused armed with a knife and other weapons entered the premises of Trimurti Petrol Pump around 2 am on July 6, 2011, assaulted the staff and robbed Rs 20,100 in cash. The counsel for the accused, Punit Mahimkar, told the court that his clients were not involved in the alleged incident of armed dacoity.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Five men held for killing wall painter||COIMBATORE: The Madukkarai police arrested five men on Friday for murdering a 23-year-old wall painter. Police identified the victim as M Vijayan, of Palathurai at Madukkarai. Vijayan was killed by S Shabir, 24, of Malumichampatti and A Binas, 26, of Atlantic Nagar at Madukkarai with the help of S Dhanush, 25, of Madukkarai and S Hariharan, 21, of Ganeshapuram at Podanur who worked as wall painters and R Paruthi Vinayagam, 22, a Sundarapuram-based college student, a police officer said. “Shabir and Binas were rearing dogs and roosters for sales. Dhanush, Hariharan and Vinayagam, who were regular buyers, had struck up a friendship with them. After roosters were stolen from Binas’s place at Madukkarai, he found that one Sasikumar was behind the thefts. Sasikumar used to hand over the stolen roosters to his friend Vijayan, a wall painter. Recently, Vijayan sold a stolen rooster to one Gowtham. When Binas and Shabir apprehended him, Vijayan returned the rooster,” the officer said. Binas accused Vijayan of stealing several roosters in the last two months and demanded compensation. “On Thursday night, Shabir, Binas, Dhanush, Hariharan and Vinayagam took Vijayan to an isolated place at Madukkarai to sort out the issue. When a quarrel broke out, Binas and Shabir stabbed Vijayan with a knife. The other three men helped them. Vijayan died on the spot,” the officer added. Madukkarai police inspector Vairam and team arrested the five men on Friday and remanded them in judicial custody. They were booked under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 342 (wrongful restraint), 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/five-men-held-for-killing-wall-painter/articleshow/87674835.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Is UP Zika’s new home in India?||Lucknow: On October 16, a 55-year old Indian air force officer decided not to take his fever lightly. He visited the IAF hospital in Kanpur Cantonment for treatment as he was not just suffering from fever. He even had rashes on his body and pain in joints and muscles. Doctors prescribed the primary line of treatment comprising antibiotics, anti-allergic and anti-pyretics. A week went by but there was little relief. On the contrary, the patient grew weaker. His sample was then sent to the microbiology lab at SGPGI Lucknow and National Institute of Virology, Pune, for assessment. On October 23, the patient was declared UP’s first case of Zika virus infection. Since then the state’s Zika tally has swelled to 125 with 121 cases in Kanpur alone. Other cases are in Lucknow (3) and Kannauj (1). Among the affected are three pregnant women, 18 children under 12 years of age and 11 IAF personnel. Two cases were detected in Lucknow on Thursday. State on high alert On October 23 itself the UP government issued an advisory on Zika virus. Marked to district and health chiefs, the order issued by director general medical and health Dr Ved Vrat Singh apprised officials about the vector-borne disease and directed them to keep vigil on suspected cases, draw a detailed micro-plan of action, organize training of health staff, assess availability and requirement of logistics, undertake fresh entomological survey and alert hospitals to notify any suspected cases. Officials at the integrated diseases surveillance programme rolled out a separate strategy for Kanpur. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said aggressive contact tracing, surveillance and monitoring activities have been launched in the district. Two days later, on October 25, the Union health ministry sent a multidisciplinary team comprising an entomologist, public health specialists and gynaecologist to take stock of the situation in Kanpur and extend help to state authorities in containment. Two other teams from the Centre and four teams from the state have visited Kanpur and Kannauj. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is keeping an eye on the situation daily. On Wednesday, he also paid a visit to the affected areas in Kanpur. Health minister Jai Pratap Singh, who accompanied the CM, claimed that all efforts were being taken to contain Zika and urged people to cooperate with the health staff. “The role of people is crucial here. While the government is doing its bit, adherence to prevention protocol and flagging the system in case of any complication lies in their hands,” he said. Surveillance underway State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said: “Of the total cases in Kanpur, 17 have recovered which leaves the district with 88 active cases. The surveillance area has been expanded to a radius of 3km from the first case.” About the entomological survey, he said that 246 mosquitoes isolated from the affected area have been sent to National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) in Delhi. “Vector control activities have been launched even as the report from NIMR is awaited,” he said, adding that nearly 5,000 samples of suspected patients from Kanpur, Kannauj and half a dozen neighbouring districts have been sent for analysis. Locals on the guard While the containment strategy is on, locals remain concerned. “The disease has been reported in Kanpur for the first time. This is bound to create panic,” said Sonu Jaiswal, a resident of Pokharpurwa. Businessman in Shyamnagar Farea, araz Ansari, said: “Some of my relatives are also under scanner. Fever seems scary now. The biggest challenge is to differentiate between normal fever and what is something else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/is-up-zikas-new-home-in-india/articleshow/87675416.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||HC dismisses DUSU plea over admission criterion for Kerala aspirants||Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU), challenging the varsity’s decision to consider only Class XII marks for the admission of students from the Kerala state board, which determines the grades by combining marks of classes XI and XII. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the petition was “highly belated” and lacked merits. The court said it cannot pass any order on presumptions and will see if some student from Kerala files a petition with a grievance. “They have changed it so changed it, how can anyone grutch about it If you don't want to read the clear writing on the wall, then that is your choice,” the bench said while perusing the June admission bulletin issued by DU which said that if a candidate mark sheet contains both class XI and XII marks, he or she shall enter only class XII marks. DUSU, in its plea, said it was approaching the high court against the “arbitrary, irrational and unfair conduct” of authorities that have violated the fundamental and legal rights of innumerable students. It said that in terms of the consistent policy, certain state boards including the Directorate of General Education (Higher Secondary Wing), Government of Kerala, gives combined marks of both XI and XII standard on the mark sheets. The policy explicitly states that to determine grades of students, combined marks of both XI and XII shall be considered, it said. Advocate Ashish Dixit, representing DUSU, said the Delhi University for several years correspondingly incorporated provision in admission bulletin stating that in cases where state boards publish marks of both XI and XII standard, the merit of students shall be determined based on such consolidated mark sheets. However, the Delhi University has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided in its admission process of 2021-2022 that students would only be required to fill marks of XII standard, he said adding that when the admissions began for the sessions 2021-2022, the colleges raised and conveyed objections concerning mark sheets containing marks of both XI and XII. The plea was opposed by Delhi University's counsel M Rupal who raised objection over DUSU's locus standi to file the petition since the association only represents students of Delhi University and not those who have not yet taken admission here. He further said the admission bulletin was issued by the varsity in June and the petitioner has approached the court in October which is highly belated. However, Dixit said the issue was first highlighted on October 4 then they have a representation to the vice-chancellor on October 9 but to date, no decision has been taken. The plea said initially, the university directed that such cases be kept on hold, however, within a few hours, the admissions office of DU circulated an email to colleges asserting that the Admission Advisory Committee has decided that only marks of XII standard shall be considered. It said the state boards declared results following a long-standing policy which was notified for the examinations conducted for the academic session 2020-2021. It said the union gave a representation to the authorities and met the highest officers of the university but they have not acted in any manner for the welfare of students after which the petition was filed. Earlier, the high court had dismissed a petition which alleged a “disproportionate” number of admissions of students from Kerala state board in Delhi University, saying fixing of cut-offs was a matter of the varsity's admission policy. The earlier petition was filed by a DU-aspirant seeking a “scaling mechanism” for marks scored by students from different boards in order to provide a level playing field.

---||Nagpur||Police protecting ‘real murderers’ of MBBS student, say agitators||Yavatmal: All students, junior and senior residents and interns in government medical college (GMC), Yavatmal, have joined the indefinite strike to press demand for arresting the assailants responsible for murder of final year MBBS student Ashok Pal on Wednesday night. The police had arrested two suspects on Wednesday midnight. SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal had constituted four teams to nab the assailants. “Two youths, Akash Dilip Gapane (21) and Tushar Shankar Nagdive (24), both residents of Waghapur, have been arrested. The court has granted them PCR till November 17,” said the SP. Resident doctors from GMCH Nagpur, IGGMCH Nagpur and GMCH Akola and those agitating in Yavatmal GMC alleged that the police are working under political pressure and protecting the “real murderers”. Residents from GMCH Nagpur, IGGMCH Nagpur and GMCH Akola have threatened to go on strike from Saturday morning. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) committees of the three GMCs served the strike notice to their deans on Friday afternoon. Dr Sajal Bansal, president of MARD at GMCH Nagpur alleged that the arrested criminals are enjoying political protection from those in power. According to doctors in Yavatmal, a Shiv Sena leader, who was seen in a video threatening them during their protest on Thursday, is protecting the assailants as they are from his locality. SP Bhujbal said that a complaint was lodged in the city police station by Dr Surendra Bhuyar. “We have registered a criminal offence under sections 302 and 34 of IPC and section 4/25 of Arms Act,” said Bhujbal. “We will go on strike from tomorrow morning. A doctor’s murder on college campus is a very serious issue and no one is paying heed to it. It’s about the life of life saviours. Such neglect and ignorance by police, administration and political leadership is unacceptable,” he said. Pal hailed from a poor family and is survived by his mother, a younger brother and sister. He had lost his father, an auto driver in Thane, to Covid. Pal was never involved in any squabbles, as per his classmates. On Friday, senior Shiv Sena leader and former minister Sanjay Rathod visited the agitating doctors but they turned down his appeal to call off the strike. The agitators have even refused to meet the SP and district collector. They want an open dialogue in their pandal and written assurances from the authorities. While addressing a press conference at GMC Yavatmal, general secretary of Central Committee of MARD, Dr Swapnil Kajale from Solapur, declared that they won’t join the duty unless the assailants are arrested. General secretary of the students union, Dr Kartik Kunapwar, said that all UG students, interns, MARD members (both junior and senior residents) and Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra Nurses Union and others are supporting the agitation. Besides arrest of all the assailants, their demands include adequate compensation to the next of kin of the deceased, foolproof security arrangements, street lights and CCTVs, construction of compound walls, immediate appointment of regular dean and others. Dr Aniket Gaurkhede said that they are attending to emergency cases. “Only the main gate was locked,” he said. The agitators also condemned the medical education minister Amit Deshmukh who has so far not visited the college after the incident. “The minister should have heard our grievances,” said Dr Swapnil Kajale. District collector Amol Yedge, who was in Pune on Friday, told TOI over phone that he has ordered heads of departments concerned to update the security arrangements and install street lights and CCTVs on the entire campus. Yegde also said that he has given instructions for cleaning the campus, construction of broken compound wall and the removal of encroachments around the GMC campus. Political parties have so far stayed away from the agitation. “Politicians who used to call us ‘Covid warriors’ are now not even visiting us,” said Sagar Dole, an agitating student. The police sources said that they nabbed the duo on the basis of the complaint of the RMO of the GMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-protecting-real-murderers-of-mbbs-student-say-agitators/articleshow/87674855.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Thane||Maharashtra: HSC, SSC students to get part of their board exam fee back||MUMBAI: The state education board has decided to refund 14-18 per cent of the fees collected for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School (HSC) exams that got cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools and junior colleges have been directed to upload details of students who had registered for the SSC and HSC 2021 exams. The amount to be refunded will be transferred to each school’s bank account. It will then be the responsibility of the school to return the refunded fees to students. More than 16 lakh class 10 and 14 lakh class 12 students had registered for the board exams. The results, based on internal assessments, were declared by the board in July-August. After a retired principal from Miraj in Sangli district filed a PIL seeking refund of exams fees, the Bombay high court had asked the board to consider the plea. The petitioner had pointed out that the board had collected over Rs 150 crore from students, and not returning it after cancellation of exams would amounted to profiteering. On Thursday, the board decided to partially refund the collected money. Class 10 students who paid Rs 415 for the SSC exam will get a refund of Rs 59 or 14%. Class 12 students who had paid Rs 520 will get a refund of Rs 94 (18%). Students who appeared for the supplementary exams in October will not be entitled for the refund.

In one of the incidents, a woman resident of Nageshwar road was trying to place order for an apparel online. Before confirming the delivery, a fraudster contacted her and asked her to confirm the order. He asked her to pay Rs 5 as a test payment. However, the fraudster later siphoned off Rs 65,000 from her account. An FIR has been filed at the Cantt police station. In another incident, an imposter called up a Dehradun-based family planning to hold a puja. The fraudster, pretending to be their family priest, asked for Rs 1 lakh. After making the payment, the family visited the priest only to find out that they were duped. A probe is underway into the case. In the third incident, a 72-year-old Race Course resident was duped of Rs 16 lakh by a man running a fake kitty fund.

---||Chandigarh||Employee cannot be demoted without chance to be heard, says Punjab and Haryana high court||CHANDIGARH: Even if an employee of the state (Haryana) government has been wrongly promoted, the person cannot be demoted without giving him an opportunity of being heard. The Punjab and Haryana high court made this observation while deciding the petition against reversion of an employee of Board of School Education Haryana in Bhiwani and pointed out that "the rules of natural justice and procedural rules cannot be given go by in such a light and casual manner”. “Merely by saying that petitioner had managed to get an order with regard to his promotion does not shield the respondents from explaining as to why allegedly wrong promotion was granted to the petitioner. The officers and other authorities of respondents were not expected to be so ignorant, naïve and novice so as to pass an order granting promotion to the petitioner without due application of mind…” the HC has ordered. Justice H S Madaan of the HC has passed these orders while allowing a petition filed by Devender Kumar Bansal, an employee of the Haryana board of school education, who was ordered to be demoted from the post of senior system executive to senior computer operator. The petitioner was appointed as a computer operator with the education board in February 1987, promoted as senior computer operator in1989, and as senior system executive on December 19, 2016. The board, which is the competent authority to modify the regulations, had taken a decision on October 7, 2017, that for promotion to the post of senior system executive, three years’ experience as system executive/ senior computer operator is required because system executive/senior computer operator is the same post. The decision was duly approved by the additional chief secretary, school education department, Haryana. The petitioner argued that although decision of board of directors approved by additional chief secretary, school education department, Haryana, could not be upset by director general, school education, Haryana, even then, on the basis of a letter dated February 11, 2020, issued by the latter, a reversion order dated February 25, 2020, was passed. The petitioner had approached the HC contending that before passing of the order neither any show-cause notice was issued to him nor any opportunity of being heard was given. The state authorities responded that the petitioner had managed to get the promotion in that way an accusing finger was being pointed out towards the authorities that had granted promotion to the petitioner. While setting aside the demotion orders, the HC observed, “Even if, the respondents felt that the promotion granted to the petitioner has not been so done legally and validly and it deserved to be withdrawn, then rules of natural justice required that at least an opportunity of being heard should have been afforded to the petitioner getting his version...” The HC also made it clear that the board would be at liberty to serve a show-cause notice upon the petitioner as to why he should not be reverted to the post before promotion, get his response and then proceed to pass appropriate order in accordance with law. NO SHIELD:“M erely by saying that petitioner had managed to get an order with regard to his promotion does not shield the respondents from explaining as to why allegedly wrong promotion was granted to the petitioner....” the HC observed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/employee-cant-be-demoted-without-being-given-chance-to-be-heard-hc/articleshow/87674842.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM Chalai unit’s queer poster is a head turner||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Bare-chested men stretch their hands gripping the hammer and sickle; their arms intertwined and pressed against one’s belly in the backdrop of gay pride flag. On the corner sits another couple. The endorsement poster prepared by CPM Chalai area committee as part of the CPM Chalai area conference proclaiming solidarity for the LGBT community has struck a chord with many. It symbolizes homosexuality which aims at giving a message to the society that all the categories, including LGBTQ must be treated equal.  The poster carries a tagline “ee lokam ellavarudeyum” (this world is for everyone). The poster was published on the Facebook page of Chalai local committee. The poster portrays a lesbian couple and a gay couple. The decision of designing a poster like this was made in the local committee meeting. The poster also gives awareness among the people who are not ready to accept the LGBTQ community. They are also planning to launch another poster which will portray the transgender community.  “Our party aims at providing equal importance to all categories of people; this poster was driven by this objective,” said S A Sundar of CPM Chalai area committee.  “The Communist Party of India aims at providing equal rights to all categories of humans; thus, we also support LGBTQ. It is important for society to accept one’s personal interest. I have taken reference from an old painting and a statue to depict the couples,” said Unni D S, the designer. LGBT community has welcomed the gesture.  “It is encouraging to see the CPM taking a welcome gesture. The government has not informed the High Court of its assent to homosexual marriages. I believe that if the government can expedite those procedures, it will be a significant victory for people’s lives,” said Prijith P K, a queer activist.  The conference will be held on December 5, 6 and 7 at Mudavanmugal. Sports and arts competitions will also be held as part of the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-chalai-units-queer-poster-is-a-head-turner/articleshow/87654416.cms||---

It was not possible due to Covid-19 protocols,” he said. Amit said the aim of organising the reunion programme is to pay back to the society and give a positive message to everyone that parties and functions can be organised without liquor, too. “That’s why this reunion has been organised especially in ‘dry’ Bihar,” he said.

---||Coimbatore||Prolonged rain pushes up veggie prices||Coimbatore: The recent showers have shot up the prices of locally grown vegetables, be it tomatoes, ladies' fingers, lima beans, brinjal, cluster beans and all gourd varieties.Tomato, which is extensively grown at Thondamuthur, Nasiyapuram, Thenkarai, Nachipalayam and Theethipatti, has seen the highest increase of Rs 50 and is now priced at Rs 80 per kg, compared to Rs 30 earlier.Traders said the recent spell of rain had damaged most of the vegetable crops, the flowers of which had fallen off. They attributed the price rise to short supply. “While vegetables from other districts and states used to reach the district, supply is affected because of the widespread rain.”P Kanthasamy, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association, said while the locally grown vegetables were fetching good prices, most farmers were not benefitting from the same. “Only a few farmers, whose farms were not affected by the rain, are benefitting presently. While brinjal varieties are being sold up to Rs 60 per kg in the wholesale market, many farmers don’t have the produce to sell. Ladies' fingers are also in short supply.”M Sivaranjini, a resident of Nallampalayam, said the price of most vegetables had doubled, compared to two weeks ago. “I go for vegetables like potato, cabbage, snake gourd, elephant foot yam and banana, which are comparatively cheaper. While tomatoes are expensive, they are an indispensable item.”R Velmurgan, a trader from Gandhipuram market, said it might take at least another couple of weeks for the vegetable prices to come down. “The prices will drop when vegetables from the district and neighbouring areas reach the city markets. By mid-January, prices of most vegetables will take a downward dive.” He said his regular customers had cut down on the quantity of vegetables being purchased because of the price hike. “Sale of carrots and beans is good, although the prices are on the higher side. Many customers feel the price of vegetables grown in hilly areas is better, compared to that of the locally grown ones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/prolonged-rain-pushes-up-veggie-prices/articleshow/87674859.cms||V Devanathan

---||Coimbatore||‘Encourage faculty to work on outcome-based research’||Coimbatore: Bharathiar University Vice-Chancellor P Kaliraj suggested more weightage for outcome-based research while deciding on promotions of faculty members in higher education institutions.The vice-chancellor participated in the 5th edition of the national higher education conclave – 2021 organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Coimbatore on Friday. He said that many teachers will be interested to collaborate with industries to translate their research work into a product if the product development index is considered while assessing their promotion.Most research activities in the institutions are largely limited to receiving grants, publishing research papers before moving on to the next project. There is less focus on technology transfer and licensing.He said, “Institutions need to be an interface to make the education system take care of the industry needs. This will help the industry to have faith in the faculty members.”Saying that manufacturing processes are changing in the industry, he said the type of jobs that exist may not continue after three years with the fast-emerging disruptive technology. So, the focus of higher education institutions should be to facilitate faster adaptability to changing trends.“We will have more jobs in the coming years, but it would require different skills. It is the responsibility of the educational institutions to prepare students with the skills that are required for jobs that will emerge in the next two to three years,” he said.Having this in mind, Bharathiar University introduced industry 4.0 components like data Internet of Things, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, and data analytics into their curriculum before the pandemic, the VC said.While we are motivating institutions to start new innovative programs, parents should encourage students to opt for such courses and job-oriented certificate courses to make themselves fit for various components of new opportunities.“By making affiliated colleges give equal weightage to both internal and external assessment, we can offer a level playing field for these colleges on par with autonomous colleges. Students were preferring autonomous colleges during admission as they were offering more weightage for internal assessment unlike in affiliated colleges where internals had 25% weightage,” he said.Highlighting the challenges in the implementation of new education policy 2020, S P Thyagarajan, chancellor of Avinashilingam University said that its implementation in a flexible manner is essential for uplifting the standards of higher education to global levels. Association of Indian Universities is taking up the task of collecting feedback on the issues faced during the implementation of the NEP from institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encourage-faculty-to-work-on-outcome-based-research/articleshow/87674867.cms||---
---||Delhi||Liquor prices in Delhi may rise by 8-10% despite VAT cut||NEW DELHI: With a new excise regime becoming operational from November 17, Delhi government notified reduced value added tax on liquor on Friday. Industry experts, however, expect retail prices to go up 8-10%. Delhi government’s finance department notified some amendments in the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004, which now mandates a fixed 1% VAT on alcohol sold by a wholesaler to a retailer from November 10. The on foreign liquor and Indian made foreign liquor consumed off premises from the retailer has been reduced to 1% from November 17. However, for consumption on the premises of hotels, clubs and restaurants, VAT will remain 25%. “While VAT used to be 25% and has been reduced to 1%, this will have no real impact on prices because the entire pricing structure has been changed,” explained Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. He said that instead of a nominal rate charged for a retail license plus excise duty and VAT, the government has factored these into the base price for the auction. License holders who bid more than the base price, Rs 225 crore for most locations, will want to recover the amount and some licensees, Giri said, had demanded a hike of 30-35% on the maximum retail price. Such a hike would have meant Delhiites buying cheaper liquor in the neighbouring states. “Going by the pattern, you are realistically looking at the new prices being 8-10% higher than earlier,” Giri said. With VAT and excise subsumed in the license fee, a Delhi government official said the price would now depend on the competitive forces. “The new policy allows discounts too, so we could actually expect the prices to go down,” the official added. The excise department has asked all current liquor licence holders, from guest houses to restaurants and hotels, to migrate to the new excise system by November 16. They will also have to pay the difference in the previous and new license fees for a period from November 17 to March 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/liquor-prices-may-rise-by-8-10-despite-vat-cut/articleshow/87675750.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Her husband, who is missing ever since Thursday morning, is the prime suspect in the case. Nasila, daughter of Abdul Manas and Jameela Biwi of Navaz Manzil, Parankimamvila under Palode police station limits is the deceased. Her husband Abdul Rahim, a government employee who works as a clerk at Industrial Training Institute at Chackai, is missing. The police said that Nasila was found dead by her parents around 6 am on Thursday in her bedroom. Normally, Nasila wakes up early before the other family members. Abdul Manas and Jameela Biwi went inside the bedroom to check on her as she failed to respond to their calls. The body was lying in a sleeping position, covered by a blanket. There were two lacerated wounds on her neck and chest, apparently made using a sharp weapon. Though Nasila's 12-year-old daughter was also sleeping in the same room, she had not woken up then. Her elder son slept in a separate room. Rahim was nowhere to be found. “From prima facie evidence collected, we suspect that Rahim committed the crime over suspicion of infidelity. We have recovered a handwritten note from the room, apparently written by Rahim, in which it was mentioned that he was doubtful of his wife's fidelity,” said Palode station house officer inspector C K Manoj. He also said that it has been learned that Rahim was ailing from mental illness for which he was undergoing treatment. Nasila's parents told the police that they were not aware of any marital dispute that existed between the couple. Rahim returned home relatively late on Wednesday night as he had gone to attend a party with friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-found-dead-in-bedroom-with-stab-injuries/articleshow/87654424.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Despite 3 extensions, UP Board gets lowest registrations||Lucknow: Even after three extensions, only 51.2 lakh candidates registered for the UP board class 10 and 12 examinations scheduled in first quarter of 2022, which is lowest in a decade. Conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB), the registrations increased by merely 10,000 in the last lap of the registrations, which ended on November 8. Before the UPSEB closed the online window for filling online forms on November 8, 51.2 lakh candidates confirmed registrations by paying the fee. The figures are 5 lakh less than last year (academic year 2020-21) when 56.1 lakh candidates registered for the exam. In 2019-20 stood at 57.9 lakh, while in 2017-18, 66 lakh candidates had registered for the exams. In 2011, UP board saw 57.2 lakh candidates registering for the exam. In past one decade, 2014 saw highest of 69.9 lakh registrations. Though officials, neither from UPSEB nor the secondary education, were available for comment, departmental officials reasoned out prolonged school closure due to Covid-19 pandemic and lack of online teaching as major reasons for UP witnessing the lowest registrations in 10 years. “Over the past one and half years, schools are just like any other building. The government has hardly made attempts to continue teaching-learning, leaving students in the lurch. The end result is that students are turning their backs to UP board,” said RP Mishra, state president, UP Secondary Teachers’ Association. He added that even when the UPSEB extended the date thrice — the last one from October 22 to November 8 — there were hardly 10,000 more students, that too in class 12, who registered. In all, 27.7 lakh candidates have applied for class 10, while 23.5 lakh have registered for class 12 for the examinations to be held in early 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/despite-3-extensions-up-board-gets-lowest-registrations/articleshow/87675433.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||No achievement by Cong in special assembly session: AAP||Chandigarh: The AAP on Friday questioned the achievement of the Congress during the two-day special session of Punjab assembly. Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said the Charahnjit Singh Channi-led government had only staged a drama in the name of special assembly session and wasted crores of rupees in the exercise. “In over four years of the Congress rule, it has only politicised issues of sacrilege, power purchase agreements (PPAs), unemployment along with drug, cable sand and transport mafia. But no concrete decision has been taken in the interest of Punjab,” he said. All Congress leaders, be it former chief minister Amarinder Singh to party state president Navjot Singh Sidhu and current chief minister Channi, have been talking about the cancellation of PPAs but done nothing, he alleged. During the session, the opposition MLAs were encouraged to change their party, he said. Cheema also questioned the purpose served by introducing draft of bills regarding Punjabi language in English language. How can major issues of Punjab could be resolved in the session with a 2-4 minute debate amid commotion, he added. The AAP leader demanded that the assembly session should have been convened for at least 15 days to discuss the problems of Punjab with an open mind and the session telecast live on channels. Box AAP to gherao CM’s residence on Nov 13 Cheema said AAP will gherao the official residence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh on November 13, because the Channi government has ignored the future issues of the state, including giving government job to deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s son-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-achievement-by-cong-in-special-assembly-session-aap/articleshow/87674885.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC transfers murder case to CID after wife alleges police inaction||Nagpur: After a woman moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court complaining about Mouda police’s inaction in investigating the murder of her husband, the HC transferred the probe to State Criminal Investigation Department (CID). “In our considered opinion, there should have been a fair investigation in this matter. We are of the view that whatever investigation is done, is not at all satisfactory. It is not made with the intention to find out the truth, but obviously to dilute the gravity of the accused’s act. Thus, we are inclined to hand over the entire case for fresh investigation to CID,” a division bench comprising justices MS Sonak and Pushpa Ganediwala said. While directing the Mouda police to hand over the case papers to CID, the bench said having regard to the chronology of the events, as are discernible from the case diary and from the petitioner’s contentions, there should be a fair and impartial investigation into the suspicious death of the deceased. “The police case diary shows statements of many witnesses that the accused went to the deceased’s house with sticks in his search. In clear words, they gave threats to the petitioner to kill the deceased. There were injuries on the dead body of the deceased,” the HC said. After petitioner Rajni Wakde’s husband’s body was found in the river near their home at Dhanla village in Mouda, she lodged a police complaint against accused persons – Rajendra and Pranay Rajgire, and Harshad Bawne, accusing them of killing him. However, after the Mouda police failed to register an offence against accused for murder under Section 302, she approached the judiciary’s doors through counsel Firdos Mirza and Akash Moon. She contended that the police were diverting the investigations in wrong direction to defeat the ends of justice. She also blamed them for fabricating her statements and failed to arrest main accused Rajendra. The HC noted that the petitioner’s husband had been missing since September 7 and his body was found the next day in suspicious circumstances. Moreover, his vehicle was found in a substantially damaged condition. “There is absolutely nothing in the case diary about the investigation about the damaged vehicle. The petitioner noticed several injuries on husband’s dead body. It appears that the investigation officer did not find it necessary to investigate the cause for such injuries. The statements of alleged eyewitnesses, as per the petitioner, appear to have not been recorded deliberately,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-transfers-murder-case-to-cid-after-wife-alleges-police-inaction/articleshow/87674883.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sitaram Kunte may not get extension as chief secretary||MUMBAI: With less than a fortnight left for retirement of chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, hectic lobbying is on. Kunte may not get an extension as his predecessor Sanjay Kumar did not ask for one, but immediately after retirement, he was appointed to lead Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. In Kunte’s case, immediate appointment on a state-run corporation or board appears difficult as there is no vacancy. Kunte will have to wait till February-end for the retirement of chief services commissioner Swadheen Kahsatriya. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should do away with granting extensions to chief secretaries as it does not serve any purpose and results in injustice for others,’’ a senior bureaucrat said. The bureaucrat said in view of bitter relations between state government and NDA government, it may not approve the proposal for Kunte’s extension. Kunte is followed by Shyamlal Goyal, who is on central deputation, additional chief secretary (school education) Vandana Krishna (planning) and ACS Devashish Chakrabarty, belonging to 1985 batch, additional chief secretary (home) Manukumar Srivastava, ACS Jayashree Mukherjee, both 1986 batch, ACS (services) Sujata Saunik, ACS Ashwani Kumar and ACS Manoj Saunik, all 1987 batch. The bureaucrat said Saunik is emerging as the front-runner. If chosen, she will be the first woman officer to lead the bureaucracy. After the retirement of Sumit Mullick, there was an opportunity for the appointment of Medha Gadgil, an IAS officer of the 1983 batch, as CS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sitaram-kunte-may-not-get-extension-as-chief-secy/articleshow/87674059.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Vadodara||Price difference lures MP, Raj vehicles to fill fuel in Gujarat||Vadodara: With significant difference in fuel prices between Gujarat and neighbouring states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, many people have started fuelling their vehicles at petrol pumps located on the state borders. Differences in prices of petrol, diesel and CNG have been evident for quite sometime now, but the significant difference witnessed after the recent revision has led vehicle owners to make a beeline at fuel stations in Dahod. Besides prices of diesel sold in large quantities on highways, prices of petrol and CNG differ significantly. Transporters have been filling diesel in their trucks regularly in petrol pumps on the state borders in Dahod, but now even passenger vehicles and two-wheelers too are following suit. Ketan Patel, who owns a petrol pump in Jhalod located close to Rajasthan border, said that around 100 to 150 vehicles from Rajasthan fill petrol at his petrol pump. “The difference in prices is significant. Many visit Jhalod regularly to buy fuel here,” said Ketan. Zulfikar Tena, who owns a petrol pump on the Ahmedabad-Indore highway in Dahod said, that the sale of CNG has jumped significantly at his establishment. “The rise in sales is of around 1,000kg. The price of CNG is around Rs 65 per kg in Dahod and around 76 per kg in MP. Several vehicles prefer filling in Gujarat due to this,” he said. Owners point out that since long commercial vehicles that have to cross the Gujarat border prefer getting diesel in Gujarat. “Our diesel prices have been on the lower side. A significant percentage of our sales is in vehicles from Rajasthan. Now, some rise is seen in petrol and CNG,” said Jyoti Patel who has a petrol pump on the Jhalod bypass. In the past when difference in diesel prices was significant between MP and Gujarat, petrol pumps on the Gujarat-MP border in Chhota Udepur had put up boards and banners asking vehicles to get fuelled there as rates were cheaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/price-difference-lures-mp-raj-vehicles-to-fill-fuel-in-gujarat/articleshow/87674657.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Top Maoist leader carrying Rs 1 crore bounty arrested||RANCHI: In one of its biggest achievements in the fight against the Maoists, the Jharkhand Police arrested CPI (Maoist) politburo member Kisan da alias Prashant Bose, who carries a reward of Rs 1 crore, on Friday from Seraikela district. Bose, now in his mid-70s, has been a key Maoist ideologue and was a signatory to the merger of the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI), which was operating in north India, and the CPIML (People’s War), active in south India, in September 2004, leading to the formation of CPI (Maoist). It was after this merger that the ultra Leftist movement grew stronger and fiercer, creating a Red corridor running from north to south through the central parts of the country. DGP Niraj Sinha, however, said a few people have been detained on suspicion, but their identity is being verified. “We can confirm only when the identity is established,” he said. According to highly placed sources in the police, Bose along with his wife Sheela Marandi and two others were intercepted along with the vehicle they were travelling in and taken into custody near Kandra in Saraikela-Kharsawan district. The sources said the arrest was made at a check post in the Kandra area while Bose and the group were reportedly returning from the Parasnath Hills in a Scorpio vehicle. The district police along with the intelligence bureau personnel were involved in the operation. It is learnt that police are interrogating Bose and his wife in Ranchi at present. Bose, who went by several aliases, was considered the second man in the present-day hierarchy of the CPI (Maoist) and headed the eastern regional bureau of the outfit. His wife, Sheela Marandi, commonly known as Sheela Didi, was recently elevated as a central committee member in the organization. She, however, did not carry any bounty as she was arrested and was out on bail recently. It may be stated that Bose is one among the four Maoists of Jharkhand who carry a reward of Rs 1 crore. The others are PBM Misir Besra and central committee members (of CPI-Maoist) Asim Mandal and Anal Da. Bose has been active in Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. He is said to be the key accused in around 100 extremist-related violent acts in different states. Several other states have also announced rewards on him. Police have been looking for Bose for the last several decades. He was reported to be present at Jhumra, Parasnath, Saranda forest and Burha Pahar at different periods. Even though police conducted operations, he had managed to escape the police net. Bose is a native of Jadavpur in 24 Paragana district of West Bengal. He has become disabled after suffering a heart attack. Police sources confirmed that he was not keeping well and was physically incapacitated. “He was senior to Sudhakar, another Maoist politburo member who surrendered in Telangana in 2019,” said one of the police officers, admitting that his arrest is a blow to the ideology and morale of the banned outfit. The sources also said he went to jail for the last time in the late 1970s during the emergency and came out in 1978. Thereafter, he has been involved in the ultra-leftist movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cpi-maoist-leader-kishan-da-wife-held/articleshow/87673846.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

After the amendments, pension will be available universally to all eligible people with two exclusion categories. A person of 60 years of age, any specially-abled person or widow above the age of 18 years and those entitled to pension under any other category will now be excluded only if the beneficiary or an immediate family member is an income tax payee or if the beneficiary or family member is a permanent employee of the state, Centre or public-sector undertaking. The amendments have been introduced in centrally sponsored pension schemes under the National Social Assistance Programme and social security pension schemes operated under the state plan. In another decision, the council of ministers sanctioned Rs 636 crore for bolstering health infrastructure to combat Covid-19. The ministerial council’s approval will pave the way for commissioning new Covid-19 testing centres and state-of-the-art Covid-19 paediatric wards in rural areas. The 11-member cabinet also approved a new Mukhyamantri Swasthya Sahayata Yojana. The scheme will provide one-time financial grant to people from SC, ST and OBC communities if they lose their capabilities to earn their livelihood due to ailments. Senior citizens will get one-time benefit up to Rs 10,000 while those below 60 years will get benefits up to Rs 5,000. The cabinet also gave its approval to the state department of school education and literacy’s proposal to provide free textbooks to students of class 9 and 10 in all government schools. It also approved a proposal to provide bicycles to all government school students. Earlier, the money for cycles were provided to schoolchildren through direct-benefit transfers. In another decisions, the cabinet approved a proposal to extend the contract of all contractual teachers in government schools till July 7, 2022 and extended the service period of the doctors in state health services who are superannuating by March next year by another six months. The cabinet also approved a proposal to hike the dearness allowances of state government employees by 7% and sanctioned the inclusion of 64 lakh beneficiaries in the state-sponsored Sona Sobhran Dhoti Saree Scheme.

The state unit of PUCL, that conducted a fact-finding mission over the last two months by speaking to the aggrieved family, eyewitnesses, police and excise department officials, expressed surprise that the family members of Mehta were compelled to foot the medical bills of the hospital, despite the fact that excise department admitted to have taken him into custody.

His wife told PUCL that no warrant was shown, nor did the officials say why he was being taken into custody. “Claiming to be excise department officials they later said Mehta is involved in illegal liquor trade,” Gita told the team. “There’s something fishy in the matter. The family members have claimed that the excise department officials did not produce any warrant while taking Mehta into custody, indicating that it could be illegal detention. Moreover, they did not pay the bills at the hospital indicating that they were not in a mood to convert the detention into arrest. But once the video of policemen carrying an unconscious Mehta went viral, they had to admit that he had been arrested” said Arwind Avinash, a member of the PUCL fact-finding team. Mehta complained of ill health, but was locked up in a room of the excise department till he fell unconscious around 4pm. He was then taken to Sadar hospital around 5pm. It was then when Kundan Kumar, his neighbour, shot a video of Mehta being carried out of the room for hospital. At Sadar hospital, doctors referred Mehta to Rims from where the doctors diagnosed him with cardiac arrest but refused to admit him citing non-availability of beds. On the insistence of his family, he was taken to Medica Hospital around 9pm where the hospital asked for an advance payment of Rs 20,000. “It was finally arranged by the family members and treatment began but he died the next day at 11am,” the report said. Ultimately to receive the body, the family had to clear the entire amount Rs 73,759 on August 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pucl-seeks-inquiry-into-custodial-death/articleshow/87673641.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The AISSF served the notice to Ranaut through its counsel Diwakar Upadhyay. The president of the unit, Satnam Singh Gambhir, said, “Either Kangana tenders an unconditional apology to the country within 15 days or we would file a complaint in the Jharkhand high court, seeking penal action against her.” Notably, the Padma Shri award-winning actor had said that the Freedom gained in 1947 was a “bheekh” while real Independence was attained in 2014. “Her statement is an insult to millions of freedom struggle heroes who made the supreme sacrifice for the liberation of the country from British colonial rule,” Gambhir added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/students-assn-serves-notice-to-kangana/articleshow/87673896.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Gaurav Diwas aimed only at BJP’s electoral gains: JMM||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Friday criticised the decision to observe Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas and claimed that the Centre’s announcement was aimed only at the BJP’s electoral gains and quell the growing dissent in the SC, ST and OBC communities. “Ironically, the Centre is observing Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas to honour the tribal freedom fighters while it is destroying their villages in Jharkhand in the name of development,” JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya’s reference was to Chemo and Saliya villages in Latehar which may get submerged once the Mandal Dam’s construction is complete. The villages were home to tribal freedom fighters Nilamber and Pitamber. Mandal Dam’s construction was kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019. “If the Centre is truly concerned about the honour of the tribal communities, then it must pass Sarna Code. The Centre should also acknowledge the tea tribes of Assam as members of the ST community and give IIT status to Sindri’s Birsa Institute of Technology,” Bhattacharya added. JMM also alleged that the erstwhile BJP-led government under former chief minister Raghubar Das had diverted the funds received from the Centre under the Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) to organise the Momentum Jharkhand Global Investors’ Summit in 2017 and spend lavishly on the state government’s advertisement blitz. “The BJP suddenly became concerned about the honour and dignity of the tribal people as election season started approaching. But will it clarify why the Centre did not implement the PESA law and provisions of the fifth and sixth schedule of the Constitution in letter and spirit?” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gaurav-diwas-aimed-only-at-bjps-electoral-gains-jmm/articleshow/87673884.cms||---

As winter progresses, the number of migratory birds will increase in coming weeks, bird experts said. Koderma-based Satya Prakash, state coordinator of the Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), said, “The temperature has already dipped drastically post Durga Puja in most parts of the state as a result of which migratory birds are landing in the wetlands. As of now, some regular migratory species such as rudy shelduck, grey wag tail, whitewag tail have been spotted in Koderma and a few other districts. By November end and early December, there will be massive surge in their numbers,” he said. SSGoswami, an avid bird watcher, based in Hazaribag, agreed, “Besides the routine migratory birds which come every year, it will be interesting to see if the number of new species or any endangered ones resurface this time.” From next week, they will formally begin tracing and tracking to evaluate the trend, he added. According to the last formal Asian waterbird census in 2018 jointly by the state forest department and IBCN, close to 52,000 birds had visited Jharkhand during the winter months. It included 73 species of wetlands, 59 species of water bird, 28 species of resident bird, 12 endangered species among others. Thereafter, no formal survey could be done. Prakash, however, said with Covid-19 on the wane, they will coordinate with the forest department this year for a formal survey. “Some of the threatened bird species that we could spot then included Black-bellied Tern, Oriental White Ibis, Ferruginous Pochard, River Lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii), Black-necked Stork, Western Marsh Harrier among others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/with-dip-in-temp-winged-guests-fly-down-to-state-more-likely-to-arrive-in-coming-weeks/articleshow/87673999.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Using a pencil to sketch, the young boy brings out sceneries live on paper. Like Sameer, his friend Anil (name changed), aged 17, also etches out beautiful landscapes. Pictures drawn by Sameer and Anil were put on display in an art exhibition organised by the State Legal Services Authority under the aegis of Jharkhand Legal Services Authority (JHALSA) here on Friday. Both Sameer and Anil are not children trained in art, but are lodged in the Child Observation Home in Khunti. Several other paintings by observation home inmates have been put up on display at the exhibition organised in the White Hall of the Jharkhand High Court. The exhibition was inaugurated by High Court Legal Services Committee chairman Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad. The exhibition is part of the programme launched by the National Legal Services Authority nationwide on October 2 by President Ramnath Kovind. The programme will conclude on November 14 and has been designed to spread legal awareness across the country, said JHALSA member secretary Muhammad Shakir. The painting drawn by Anil depicts a village scene with small thatched huts with a chopper flying over it. The pencil sketch with light and dark shades makes one wonder how a child can express so much on paper, Shakir added. Khunti probation officer Ashish Ranjan told the TOI that the boys are involved in a case of kidnapping and murder and are in detention since January 2020. Both the boys paint in their free time and have not received any formal training, Ranjan said. The White Hall of the High Court was lined up with stalls put up by the welfare department, UNICEF, Child Helpline, Association for Advocacy And Legal Initiatives Trust, an NGO working for the right of individuals who wish to marry against the norms prefixed by caste, religion and society at large. The stall put up by the Child Observation Home at Dumardagga in the capital had also laid out paper packets and small diyas made by inmates of the observation home. Diyas with mandala designs and colourful patterns were put up for sale in the exhibition. High Court advocate Satish Kesri visiting the exhibition applauded the efforts of the children in the observation homes. “There is so much of unharnessed talent in these children. It is very unfortunate that they have crossed the line set by law. I hope they come back on track and do something productive in their lives,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sketches-by-observation-home-inmates-adorn-walls-of-hc-hall/articleshow/87673915.cms||---

---||India||Decriminalising personal drug use? Ministries on same page||NEW DELHI: As part of the ongoing review of provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985, a consensus has emerged among key departments of the ministries concerned on decriminalising personal consumption involving users and dependents who are caught with small quantities of drugs. In such cases, it was felt, the suggestions under study call for a focus on putting compulsory de-addiction and rehabilitation programmes as a solution rather than stronger penalties. Sources said discussions at a meeting held earlier in the week saw representatives from various departments dwell on changes required in the law to deal with drug-dependent users caught with small quantities of drugs. The consensus on taking the decriminalisation approach towards such users and the proposed changes in the existing law are expected to take a formal shape in the coming days. The department of revenue of the finance ministry is examining amendments to the stringent law which governs the illegal drugs trade and seizures, with provisions that impose non-negotiable jail sentences and heavy fines. As part of the exercise, the finance ministry, which governs NDPS Act, had recently sought the opinion of individual ministries that are stakeholders in the debate. The ministries of social justice and empowerment, home and health are involved in battling the drug menace. Emphasising that users and dependents caught with small quantities of drugs and their families should be treated as “victims” and not culprits of substance abuse, the ministry of social justice in its recommendations for modifications to the NDPS Act had called for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation instead of jail terms and penalties for such users. The social justice ministry had suggested modifications that such users should be referred to a mandatory de-addiction and rehabilitation facility for a period of 30 days after which they may also be made to provide mandatory community service for one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/decriminalising-personal-drug-use-ministries-on-same-page/articleshow/87676272.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Namaz sites come down by nearly 50%, but protests continue||GURUGRAM: Namaz sites in the city were down by almost half as Friday prayers were read at only 20 of the 37 originally designated spots. However, the protests, which have been organised every Friday over the last few weeks, continued as usual. This time, a group of locals landed up at a prayer site at Sirhaul village in Sector 18 on the Gurugram-Delhi border and demanded a stop to namaz being conducted there. In the 19 other places, namaz passed off peacefully. No prayers were offered at the disputed sites in sectors 47 and 12A, where a Govardhan Puja was organised by some groups last Friday. Sirhaul Mod was one of the 20 public places that were recently identified by a committee where namaz would be held. However, due to unavailability of space at the intersection, the namaz site was shifted to a park, which was opposed by some residents, who assembled in the area with the tricolour and shouted slogans. “We are not opposed to namaz but it should not be offered at a public place. They (members of the Muslim community) should go to the mosque. The park is a public space and people from nearby areas, including those working in companies located close by, visit it all day. Religious activities should not be organised in such public places,” said Sudhir Yadav, a resident of Sirhaul. He added that people in the village, including many Muslims, were living in harmony. Rajiv Mittal of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti said though the outfit had given a call to oppose namaz in public places, locals were coming out to protest on their own. “Namaz should be offered at mosques and idgahs. They (Muslims) should apply for land if there aren’t enough mosques,” he added. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurugram Muslim Council and Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, said, “Right-wing groups had installed RSS wing Muslim Rashtriya Manch as so-called representatives of Muslims in Gurugram and conveniently reduced the number of places for Friday prayers.” Ahmad added that unless the government allocated land for mosques so that the community could offer prayers “with dignity”, the disruptions would continue. Khurshid Rajaka, chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch and member of Haryana Waqf Board, said the imams, in consultation with authorities, had identified the places for namaz. “Establishing peace, not politics, should be the priority,” he said, adding that if land is needed for construction of mosques, people should approach the waqf board. A district administration official said if locals are opposed to namaz at a particular site, then it will be changed. “Namaz will be offered at places where residents have no objection. Maintaining law and order is our priority,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/namaz-sites-come-down-by-nearly-50-but-protests-continue/articleshow/87675088.cms||Bagish Jha
---||India||Members object to tweaks, JPC data bill report stalled||NEW DELHI: The joint parliamentary committee on Personal Data Protection Bill was unable to adopt its draft report on Friday as panel chair P P Chaudhary sought to insert last-minute amendments that did away with the clauses on social media platforms on grounds that they were covered under the new IT rules. The move ran into vehement protests by opposition members, including BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab and Amar Patnaik, Congress’ Manish Tewari, Jairam Ramesh and Gaurav Gogoi, and even BJP’s Satya Pal Singh, who said there is an urgent need for a law on the subject. Key objections raised by MPs pertained to a bid to “dilute” the penalty clause that fixes 2% and 4% of global incomes of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, if they are found in violation of privacy laws. The last-minute amendments, sources said, sought to bring this down to a standard sum of Rs 10-15 crore, which led to heated exchanges between some members who alleged that the government was attempting to dilute the penalty clause following pressure from the Big Tech. They said the social media firms pressured the government to tone down the applicable penalties. The JPC has seen discussion on whether social media can be merely termed as a platform or aggregator or is in fact a "publisher" with the same responsibilities as a publication. Chaudhary did argue that the IT guidelines were not formulated when the panel had taken up the matter but MPs felt there is a need for a specific law and the data bill presents an excellent opportunity given that there was unanimity in the panel over the need for Big Tech to be more accountable. After considerable discussion during which Chaudhary said the penalty clause was not very practical, it was decided that a fresh draft of the committee’s report will be circulated by November 18 and the committee will meet again on November 22 to consider the bill afresh. Sources said MPs also demanded that the issue of the IT rules covering accountability of social media platforms should be specifically written into the JPC’s report if this was the argument Chaudhary wanted the committee to consider. Deliberations also saw members oppose the contentious clause 35 of the draft data protection bill, which grants blanket exemption to the government and its agencies from complying with any and all provisions of the PDP bill. Members argued that government should only be exempted under a "just, fair, reasonable and proportionate procedure", and that exemption should only be exercised in "exceptional" cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/members-object-to-tweaks-jpc-data-bill-report-stalled/articleshow/87676333.cms||Swati Mathur

Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 4.5%, slightly higher than the 4.4% in the previous month and below the 7.6% recorded in October 2020. Urban inflation was at 5% while rural inflation slowed to a 10-month low of 4.1%. Core inflation (which is minus food and fuel) remained sticky at 6.1% in October, above the 5.9% in the previous month. Prices of vegetables fell 19.4% during the month while oils and fats rose 33.5% during the month. “Measures such as cut in excise duty on fuel, imposition of stock limits and waiver of basic import duty on edible oils are expected to restrict domestic inflation despite soaring prices of fuel and edible oils in the global markets. The inflation in the services sector is likely to remain elevated as momentum in vaccination continues and mobility rebounds to the pre-pandemic level,” Care Ratings said in a note. Separate data released by the NSO showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose an annual 3.1% in September, lower than the 11.9% in the previous month and above the 1% recorded in September 2020. The manufacturing sector grew 2.7% in September compared to 0.4% in the year earlier month while mining grew 8.6%. The electricity sector rose 0.9% in September, lower than the 4.9% recorded in September 2020. The capital goods sector, seen as a barometer of industrial activity, rose 1.3% compared to a contraction of 1.2% in the year earlier month. “India’s IIP growth slipped to a 7-month low of 3.1% in September 21 with an adverse base and sequential contraction in activity both at play. The month was a testimony to supply side disruptions weighing on production, with the downside thankfully getting capped by ahead of festive season led ramp up in consumer durables sector,” according research firm QuantEco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-inflation-up-at-4-5-in-october-iip-slows-in-september/articleshow/87676352.cms||---

Goyal, who was detained on the basis of a look out notice pending against him, and IREO are facing a multi-agency probe for foreign direct investments (FDIs) worth Rs 7,300 crore that came to at least two dozen companies from a suspicious address located at Port Louis in Mauritius. 15 of these companies, registered at two identical addresses in New Delhi, were found linked to IREO. The probe against suspicious FDI inflows into IREO began in early 2010 during the UPA-2 regime. The income tax department conducted a series of searches on related entities on October 19, 2010. Goyal, a close relative of BJP’s Sudhanshu Mittal, had then claimed that IREO is a private equity fund with investors based in different continents. Mittal had distanced himself from IREO and told TOI that neither he nor Goyal had any equity in any of the IREO group companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-continues-quizzing-ireo-promoter-in-laundering-case/articleshow/87676390.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Good diagnostics, healthcare prompting better reportage of cancer, say experts||PANAJI: While the incidence of cancers in Goa appears to be high over the past few years, the jury is out on whether the numbers are in fact alarming. Experts handling cancer patients say the feared disease might be highlighted because Goa has better reportage than other states even as it lacks specific studies and data collection. “Goa’s numbers will have to be seen in the light of age standardisation and population. We are not witnessing an increased incidence of cancer, but the population is small. This is unlike Maharashtra or Karnataka because both those states are large,” gastroenterologist Dr Harish Peshwe, said. “Goa has much better healthcare facilities than other states and doctors are also able to pick up cases of cancer.” The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers has been more prevalent among elderly people, who comprise a significant portion of the state’s population. As per Census 2011, 11.2 % of Goa’s population was 60 years of age and above. While breast cancer tops the overall list, cancers of the colon, liver and stomach region — which are common in Goa — are mostly found in people who are 50 or 60 years and above. “Goa is a highly literate state and people have better access to healthcare facilities, so cases do get reported. I really do not know if the incidence of cancer is rising or if diagnostic facilities are getting better. But if one goes back 30-40 years and if somebody had died of lung cancer, people would probably say he died of a heart attack. Apart from his family or friends, nobody would know the real cause of his death. This, however, is no more the case,” Dr Eugune Rent, an oncologist, said. Senior gastroenterologist and endoscopist Dr Jose Alvares contended that the ‘westernised’ diet of the people of Goa has prompted the advent of western diseases as well. “The commonest cancer I see is that of the colon. Increased fat in the food, whether you are a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian, is a risk factor. People who work long night shifts for a prolonged period are also exposed to the risk of developing colon or breast cancer.” The problem for India’s smallest state is that it does not have comprehensive data on the incidence of cancers. “Data has not been collected at the central source. A trend can be gauged when we exchange notes with other doctors but this cannot be a reliable method as some biases would factor in,” head and neck surgical oncologist Dr Pawan Rane, said. While Rent said besides better diagnostic facilities and awareness among people about the disease is high, partly due to information dissemination on social media platforms, Rane said he has been seeing more cancers of the mouth and tongue because of tobacco consumption or smoking among the youth. “At the end of the day, cancers are the manifestation of the mutation process, and as mutation builds up, the incidence of cancers will also rise. Certain cancers like those of the pancreas, liver, colon and oesophagus are diseases of advancing age. Goa has a significant population that is 60-plus,” Peshwe said. He added that while doctors operate even on 70- and 80-year-old cancer patients in Goa, individuals above 60-70 years in other states are unlikely to withstand a surgical procedure “as they are not as well nourished as their counterparts in Goa”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/experts-good-diagnostics-healthcare-prompting-better-reportage-of-cancer/articleshow/87674721.cms||---

The revamped startup policy, which has been in the works since early 2020, aims to have at least 500 startups in Goa over the next three years and provide employment to at least 6,000 Goans. Interestingly, rather than pursue the creation of new startups in Goa, the department of information and technology hopes to convince existing startups and entrepreneurs from other parts of the country to shift their operations to Goa. “All startups registered under the Startup Policy 2017 shall continue to be registered under the Startup Policy 2021. All incentive applications submitted on or before September 30 shall be processed,” said director of information and technology Ankita Anand. She also said that all registered startups will be allowed to operate round the clock. “An intimation from the startup promotion cell (SPC) will be issued to the panchayats and local bodies intimating them on the startups certified to operate 24x7,” Anand said. The new policy hopes that the state’s cosmopolitan culture, quality manpower, clean environment and qualify of life will convince entrepreneurs to make it their base. “It is towards this objective that this new Goa Startup Policy has been drafted. While the government is committed to promoting entrepreneurs from Goa and generating employment for Goans, it is equally committed to inviting the best entrepreneurial talent, the brightest innovative minds, and startup ecosystem enablers like incubators, accelerators and investors from outside Goa in order to build a robust startup ecosystem within the state,” the IT director said. The state is also offering exemptions beyond the scope of the policy on a case-to-case basis for startups operating in the domains of smart cities, urban management, mining, tourism and hospitality, gaming, waste management, renewable energy, education, healthcare, communication, and entertainment. The earlier startup policy lapsed in 2020 and was extended two times for six months each till September 30. Stakeholders and beneficiaries of the policy incentives have urged the department to implement the Goa Startup Policy 2021 in a time-bound manner with clear guidelines and clarity on the rollout of the incentives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-works-since-2020-govt-notifies-new-startup-policy/articleshow/87674767.cms||---

While the physics paper will be held in the morning half on May 11, the chemistry paper will be conducted in the second half of the same day. The mathematics test will be held on the morning of May 12. The GCET is conducted based on the Class XII state board syllabus. For the 2021-22 session, due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, GCET was conducted only in the second week of July, much later than its usual schedule in May. This delayed the entire admission process for the current academic year, with only one round of admissions for engineering and pharmacy completed so far. With the 2021-22 academic cycle delayed, there are likely to be changes in the next academic cycle as well. Around 3,000 students appear for GCET each year for entry to engineering and pharmacy degree seats. Admissions to medicine, dentistry, homeopathy, ayurveda, nursing and five allied health programme degree seats in Goa are held based on the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) (UG). Similarly, admissions to the architecture programme are held through the National Aptitude Test in Architecture. The GCET consists of an objective type question paper of 75 marks each, with no negative marking. It is conducted by the state directorate of technical education with the help of a team from IIT Bombay. The answersheets are machine read, which ensures declaration of results in less than a week from the time the test ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcet-for-2022-23-admissions-to-be-held-on-may-11-12/articleshow/87674795.cms||---

Khurshid’s book is in controversy for comparing Hindutva forces to Islamic terrorist outfits in a chapter titled ‘The Saffron Sky’. “Congress leaders know nothing else but to slur Hindutva. They don’t let go of any opportunity to divide Hindus into castes, and to divide our country. Wasn’t Rahul Gandhi the first to go to those who said ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’? Salman Khurshid is promoting the same agenda through his book,” Mishra said. Police to probe complaints against Khurshid’s remark: Complaints lodged by advocate Vivek Garg and Naveen Jindal against Salman Khurshid for allegedly comparing Hindutva with ISIS and terrorism have been transferred to the crime branch for further inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mp-mantri-says-khurshid-book-to-be-banned-for-divisive-agenda/articleshow/87676460.cms||---

Work had started in the morning and debris, plastic and other waste was being dumped for road expansion, encroaching into a water body on the north-eastern side of the highway, causing blockage of the inlet that takes tidal water from the Mandovi to the vast khazan land in Merces and Santa Cruz on the highway’s western side, including the periphery of KTC terminus. Noticing the haphazard work, some villagers questioned the site supervisor and workers, but work continued for a few hours. By 3pm, some villagers from Merces and nearby areas gathered at the spot. Santa Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes too arrived and grilled the company officials and demanded stoppage of the work. PWD officials also arrived on the scene and finally, officials of the company relented and stopped the work. “If the inlet had been reclaimed, and the flow of water across the highway stopped, it would have caused massive flooding of the road and vast areas on either side,” a senior resident of Merces Jose Carmino Joao said. “It is senseless to reclaim the area without ascertaining the consequences as it would have submerged the highway and stopped flow of traffic itself,” Merces biodiversity management committee member Michael Dias said. Earth moving machinery was later moved to the site and clearing of debris. to restore it to its earlier state was in progress till late Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/merces-santa-cruz-locals-stop-land-filling-of-inlet/articleshow/87674829.cms||---

TRS working president and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao, other ministers and scores of party functionaries participated in the protests demanding that the Centre procure the paddy. KTR who led the dharna in his assembly constituency Sircilla, trained his guns on Telangana BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar calling him 'thondi Sanjay' (unfair Sanjay) and a mad man. Rama Rao said: "On one hand, the Centre is discouraging farmers to cultivate paddy in the coming rabi season and on the other, Sanjay is asking farmers to go for paddy cutivation in the state. He alleged that the NDA government at the Centre was adopting double standards on the paddy issue. Centre is buying paddy from Punjab while denying the same to Telangana. "Agriculture is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The Centre has to procure paddy from states. The NDA government is creating problems after the Telangana government started creating records in paddy production for the past six years," KTR said. Along with KTR, several ministers, MPs, MLA, MLCs took part in protest in respective districts and assembly constituencies. At some places, TRS leaders even resorted to road blockades. KTR urged the farmers to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi en masse to purchase raw paddy from Telangana. He said TRS will expose the BJP on this issue. "TRS means Telangana Rashtra Samithi, but it is also Telangana Rythu Samithi too. We won't leave the saffron party till it announces procurement of paddy from farmers," the minister said. KTR said Telangana has become a role model for many states. He said as many as 11 states and the Centre were implementing schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Mission Bhagiratha. Health minister T Harish Rao, who took part in the dharna in Siddipet, said TRS was staging dharnas for protecting the interests of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-trs-ups-the-ante-on-paddy-row-k-t-rama-rao-takes-aim-at-centre/articleshow/87676463.cms||Koride Mahesh

The regulatory commission has also asked all the local bodies and government departments to clear their dues within two weeks to avoid disconnection of services. In a letter to the energy secretary and the CMDs of discoms, the APERC said that the commission has examined the data submitted by the discoms with regard to the pending dues towards tariff subsidy from the government, and consumption charges from the local bodies and government departments. "It is observed that though there is a reduction of due amounts from Rs 16,568.21 crore to Rs 15474.43 crore in respect of tariff subsidy, the consumption dues from local bodies and government departments have increased from Rs 8391.45 crore to Rs 9783.37 crore as of September 30, 2021 since March 2021. The situation looks alarming, to say the least, and the very survival of the discoms is at stake which, if not addressed, will also adversely impact the consumers in the state," said the ERC. It further said that it was really unfortunate that discoms have not realised the seriousness of the situation and were not making their best efforts to collect the dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/clear-all-discom-dues-aperc-tells-andhra-pradesh-govt/articleshow/87676474.cms||Samdani MN

This also means that all the trains will halt at all the designated stations as it was before the pandemic. The normal train operations were discontinued from March 25 after the lockdown was imposed. Though the railway operations were restored partially, all trains were operated as “special” trains.

Congress wants the government to withdraw the condition that Konkani and Marathi films will be screened at the forthcoming 52nd edition only if more than four entries are received. Congress also alleged that BJP is using Iffi as a “grazing ground” for karyakartas who are involved in massive scams. Congress media cell chairman Amarnath Panjikar said that Congress is keeping a close watch on the tendering process of Iffi-2021, and already has “preliminary information that there is a huge scam of almost Rs 25 crores” pertaining to the organisation of Iffi-2021. Panjikar accused the BJP government of “converting” the International Film Festival of India into an International Fraud Festival of India. Reacting to the conditions imposed by the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), Congress said that even if a single entry comes in for the special Goan category, ESG must screen the film during the official section of Iffi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-have-strong-protests-if-goan-films-not-shown-at-iffi-congress/articleshow/87674893.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal plans resolution to oppose BSF ambit order||Kolkata: Raising the ante against increasing BSF’s operation area from 15km to 50km within the India-Bangladesh border, the Bengal government is likely to move a resolution against the Centre’s order in the state assembly on Tuesday. The Punjab assembly had moved a similar resolution on Thursday. Trinamool will protest in Parliament’s winter session against the Centre’s decision to enhance BSF’s operation area, which it says encroaches on the state’s jurisdiction. The BJP-led Centre had amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50km stretch, instead of 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said the resolution on Tuesday will oppose the Centre’s move because it infringes on the state’s rights, as law and order is a state subject. He felt the Centre was trying to grab the state government’s powers. Sources said several Trinamool MLAs from bordering districts expressed willingness to party chief whip Nirmal Ghosh to take part in the one-hour discussion on Tuesday. MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Trinamool’s leader in Lok Sabha, said the issue would be raised in Parliament as the Narendra Modi government was trying to bulldoze federal structure and increase BSF’s jurisdiction without consulting the states. The party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, had flagged the issue in the parliamentary committee for home affairs. The matter will be taken up by the committee. Bengal Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury backed the resolution move. He said the state government should make it clear to the Centre that it was unwilling to accept the MHA decision and for this, an assembly resolution was needed. People of bordering districts would not feel safe with BSF’s powers enhanced, he added. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had already opposed the move and written to PM Modi on October 24. “BSF was effectively entering into non-border areas within the state’s territory and thus was violating the BSF Act,” she had written. “The entire territory of West Bengal comprises 88,752 sq km, of which 32,400 sq km will come under the jurisdiction of BSF. It will interfere with the executive power of the state. 37 per cent of the state’s territory will be affected due to the order,” the letter further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-plans-resolution-to-oppose-bsf-ambit-order/articleshow/87675093.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BSF fires at cattle smugglers,2 Bangla men, 1 Indian killed||Cooch Behar/Kolkata: Three persons, including two suspected Bangladeshi nationals and a 35-year-old Indian citizen, died after BSF personnel fired at cattle smugglers on the India-Bangladesh border in Cooch Behar district’s Sitai early on Friday morning. Officials said a jawan too was injured in the incident, which occurred after BSF personnel fired in “self-defence”. The BSF initially said jawans had found two bodies of unknown miscreants between the border fence and the international boundary. State police officials, however, insisted from the morning that a third person — an Indian citizen (Prakash Barman) — had died. BSF officials confirmed the death of an “Indian citizen” several hours later. A few hours after the incident, state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said the government would introduce a resolution in the assembly next Tuesday against the Centre’s move to increase the BSF’s area of operation to 50km within the border from the current 15km. The party would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha’s winter session, Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said. Friday’s incident took place at 3am, a few hours before Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla met senior state government officials, including the chief secretary, the home secretary and the director-general of police, in Kolkata, 730km south from the point of the skirmish. Miscreants from Bangladesh were spotted around 2.30am near the fenced border at Sitai’s Satbhandari, BSF officials said. They had set up two devices made of bamboo at two different locations to hoist cattle across the border. Jawans patrolling the area first ordered them to back down and, when this did not work, the jawans used “non-lethal ammunition” to stop them. This enraged the cattle smugglers, who attacked the jawans using sickles, rods and sticks, officials said. The BSF party “fired in the air towards the miscreants... sensing imminent threat to their life”, the spokesperson said. Bodies of two unknown miscreants were found between the border fence and international boundary,” the BSF version added. It was only later on Friday afternoon that the BSF confirmed the third death of an “Indian citizen”. Cooch Behar police officials identified the Indian citizen as the 35-year-old Barman, a resident of Chamta (a village about nine kilometres from Sitai). Some local residents, however, questioned the BSF version. “Why did the BSF not say right at the start that an Indian villager, too, had died?” one of them asked. Dinhata Trinamool MLA Udayan Guha had one more question: “Why was the Indian citizen Barman shot in the head?” The centre must rein in the BSF or there would be bigger tragedies, he added. “No one has the right to gun down Indian citizens. Why is cattle-smuggling continuing unabated despite BSF claims of increased vigil? How can cattle-smuggling take place over a prolonged period without help from a section of BSF officers? Did any deal go wrong, prompting the BSF to open fire today?” MLA Guha, who won a recent bypoll by a record margin of 1.6 lakh votes, asked. Bengal BJP president and Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar, however, went along with the BSF version. “The cattle were not para-dropped in the area. They were being smuggled with the help of local political leaders and a section of administration and police. The BSF has been trying to prevent cross-border smuggling,” Majumdar said. Cooch Behar additional superintendent of police Kumar Sunny Raj said the BSF informed cops that six cattle were recovered. Nearly 40 people were trying to smuggle cattle from India to Bangladesh, according to the BSF complaint.

The Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) programme, funded by the US department of state’s Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, is being implemented in over 50 countries and has engaged with more than 5,000 women entrepreneurs despite pandemic challenges. The Kolkata programme marks the first AWE in India, which has supported 150 early-stage entrepreneurs and business owners from Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagland through structured online education from the University of Arizona’s Dreambuilder course. Consul general Melinda Pavek said: “The United States believes strongly in women’s empowerment through entrepreneurship, and stands firmly for women’s equality and inclusion in all public endeavours..” The programme has so far provided Dreambuilder certification to 80 women entrepreneurs. The grand finale brought together 25 top entrepreneurs from the northeast who will take part in a Shark Tank-style business pitch session that will be evaluated by a jury panel. Top performers will be awarded seed funding and/or entry slots as part of the January 2022 cohort of the Nexus incubation programme at Delhi’s American Center.

---||Kolkata||Border issues: Bhalla meets state officials||Kolkata: Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Friday held a meeting with senior state officials to speed up 100% fencing along the Indo-Bangla border, held up in places mostly due to problems of land acquisition. Saying that the work was essential for the country’s security, Bhalla took stock of the fencing work and the related problems at the meeting at Hidco Bhawan, where chief secretary H K Dwivedi, home secretary B P Gopalika and director general police Manoj Malviya were present. According to sources, senior BSF officials also attended it. Bengal shares the longest border with Bangladesh spread over 2,216.7 km, of which 1,638 km is fenced. State officials missed the 2019 deadline of fencing the remaining 579.7 km due to several reasons — difficult terrain, riverine and marshy land, short working season, land acquisition problems, public protests and objections by the Border Guard Bangladesh. Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura have a total 973 km of unfenced border with Bangladesh. The state government assured help to the Centre over land acquisition. Officials said the state was regularly monitoring the progress of work and had sorted out problems across the 107-km stretch of the 289-km stretch having land acquisition glitches. During talks on managing the riverine stretches, Bengal officials were informed that BSF had deployed personnel along with floating Border Outposts and boats were posted in the riverine areas. The issues of infiltration, cross-border terror, cattle smuggling and smuggling of contraband were also discussed at Friday’s meeting. Bhalla sought better management of the integrated check posts and also took feedback on the problems. The powerpoint presentation by the MHA was not seamless though. State officials pointed out that many border areas were wrongly named. The Union home secretary also emphasized beefing up management of integrated check posts at Petrapole, coming just a fortnight after the MHA issued a notification to make this major Indo-Bangla bilateral trade port operational round the clock. Bhalla also talked about the MHA’s plans to set up seven land ports along borders India shares with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The extended jurisdiction of the BSF also came up at the meeting, albeit informally. Bhalla held that the issue should be addressed at the ministerial platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/border-issues-bhalla-meets-state-officials/articleshow/87675117.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pandemic isolation stunting speech skills in kids||KOLKATA: Three-and-half-year-old Akshay had been a bright and happy child, until his parents noticed something amiss last year, six months into the pandemic. The child, a playschool student aged two-and-half then, could not yet speak. His distraught parents sought help from a mental health institute in the city, where it was revealed that sudden isolation from peers and elders in the family, because of the lockdown, had stunted his speech- and language-development skills. With months of speech therapy, play and group therapy, the boy can talk fluently, like others of his age, and has a large group of friends with whom he regularly interacts. Akshay’s case is not an isolated one. Experts across the city said they have seen hundreds of similar cases since the pandemic caused a significant drop in social interaction. “Due to Covid restrictions, there has been a complete lack of interaction with children of the same age and older individuals,” said Minu Budhia, psychotherapist and founder of Caring Minds, where Akshay underwent therapy. “Akshay, like many others, was cut off from play groups, pre-school and playgrounds, where he could have experienced ‘normal’ activities. This resulted in him using only gestures to communicate. He would point at objects or pull his parents’ clothes to get their attention.” Children’s social and language skills develop through interaction with peers and adults, pointed out psychiatrist J Ram. “This has been seriously jeopardized since the onset of the pandemic. Stuck at home, very young children have been forced into online classes, where the interaction is virtual and doesn’t help develop either speech or language skills, leave alone social skills. Parents, too, have been busy working from home and their interaction with children have reduced. As a result, basic skill development has been hindered,” Ram said. Delayed speech is now common among two-to-three-year-old children, said paediatrician Santanu Ray. “Almost a fourth of such children I have treated since last year started talking late or needed speech therapy. Also, disorders like autism and hyperactivity (lack of focus and concentration on tasks) are being detected late, since children are no longer being observed continuously. These would earlier be detected in school,” Ray added. The best — and the only — way of developing speaking and language skills is to talk to peers, which has been denied to children since March 2020, Ram said. “We call it the ‘serve-and-volley’ mechanism, where you talk to a child and the child talks back to you.” Children need to return to group activities soon, felt Budhia. “In Akshay’s case, group therapy sessions provided the essential social environment with children of his age, while speech therapy sessions gave him individualized help. The play therapy sessions used toys, games, action stories, role-playing and interaction with a mental health expert to create a safe space to explore and express his emotions non-verbally,” she said. In normal circumstances, these would have happened naturally without assistance. Experts saw some light at the end of the tunnel, with schools set to reopen on November 16. “But it will be for classes IX to XII. Those aged between three and six need to attend school not only for studies but perhaps more to acquire language and social skills. Children need a stimulating environment to learn social, language and adaptive skills. This lost time can’t be recovered,” said Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-isolation-stunting-speech-skills-in-kids/articleshow/87675391.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Our (Left Front) government had acquired Singur acres under the Land Acquisition Act. Is the state government going to follow those rules?” Chakraborty said here on Friday. The leader wants the government to publish a white paper with project and rehabilitation plan details. A CPM delegation led by Chakraborty later met the bereaved family of local party leader Badal Sheikh, who was allegedly beaten to death on Monday. The leaders claimed Badal was murdered because he hoisted the party flag to mark the November Revolution in Russia. They offered financial aid to his widow. While police have lodged a suo motu murder case over Badal’s death, his family had not filed a complaint till Friday evening. CPM’s Birbhum acting secretary Goutam Ghosh said: “We fear the family is under pressure and is not being able to speak out on the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-demands-white-paper-on-deocha-pachami-coal-project/articleshow/87675203.cms||---

Cherry on the cake was that the vehicle was delivered just around the auspicious period of Navratri! "I could not and did not want to wait for 2.5 months to get the vehicle of my choice. The agent from MP helped me buy the vehicle from the neighbouring state at a small premium amount to cover the transportation cost involved," said Kaneriya. As the semiconductor shortage has intensified, adding to the waiting period for new cars, street-smart Gujaratis who need cars on an urgent basis are not shying from paying a marginal premium to procure the vehicles from other states such as Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, among others. Sunny Moradia, partner in a ceramic manufacturing company, bought a car from Chhattisgarh recently. "I wanted a black coloured car of a certain model which was not readily available and the local dealer quoted a minimum waiting period of three months. I needed the new car in an emergency and decided to check for it outside Gujarat," he said. Similarly, Jayesh Thakor, who works in Gandhinagar and wanted to buy a car for office purposes was surprised to be told he will have to wait for 9-12 months due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. "As I needed the car urgently for work, I contacted a dealer in Chandigarh and got the paperwork done to get the car back to Ahmedabad," said Thakor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-getting-car-fast-from-1000-km-away/articleshow/87676615.cms||Niyati Parikh

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya kant and Hima Kohli had expressed dissatisfaction over pace and quality of SIT probe and told the UP government on November 8 that there was an urgent need to appoint a retired HC judge from outside the state to supervise the probe so as not to mix up evidence in three distinct incidents which took place within a short span of time on October 3. The court had suggested names of former Punjab and Haryana HC judges — Ranjit Singh and Rakesh Kumar Jain — and asked the state to appoint one of them to supervise the probe. When the court gave the option to the state to either make the appointment on its own or under court direction, senior advocate Harish Salve had said UP would do so on its own and that a court direction would not be needed. On Friday, Salve informed the court that he had been able to convince the state government to appoint a retired judge for the task of supervision. “I have convinced them and the appointment will be made by Monday,” he said. The bench adjourned the hearing of the case till Monday. Asked which of the two former judges has been chosen for appointment for supervision of the SIT probe, Salve told TOI that “the decision would be made by Monday and duly informed to the court”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-to-appoint-ex-judge-for-kheri-probe-by-monday/articleshow/87676618.cms||---
---||India||Those who love Jinnah should go to Pakistan: Naresh Agarwal||LUCKNOW: BJP leader Naresh Agarwal on Friday waded into the controversy over SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “Jinnah remark”, saying that people who loved Jinnah should leave India and “go to Pakistan”. Speaking to reporters ahead of a BJP backed state-level ‘Vaishya Sammelan’, scheduled to be organised in Lucknow on November 14, he said that the country belonged to the followers of “Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi) and Patel (Vallabh Bhai Patel)”. He was reacting to Akhilesh’s recent remark comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel. Agarwal has been keeping a low profile since 2018 when he joined the BJP after being denied a ticket to Rajya Sabha by the SP. Cine star turned politician Jaya Bachchan was chosen over Agarwal by the SP leadership, a move that left the former RS MP and seven-time MLA from Hardoi riled. Agarwal’s jibe at Akhilesh marked his aggressive emergence from a relatively dormant political stage to woo the ‘Vaishya’ (trader) community in favour of the BJP ahead of the UP assembly elections. His son, Nitin Agarwal, who now represents Hardoi constituency, was recently propped by the BJP as a candidate for the post of deputy speaker in the UP assembly, a move which was seen as the saffron party’s attempt to bewilder the opposition ranks, mainly the SP, which had fielded its senior lawmaker Narendra Singh Verma, a Kurmi. The BJP has traditionally been banking on the votes of the upper caste, including Vaishya (trader community). Agarwal said that the BJP has been organising conventions for various communities. “The Vaishya sammelan is also part of the BJP campaign,” he said. He claimed that no political party will be able to stand against the BJP which will have the full support of the Vaishya community and win more than 300 seats. Earlier this week on November 7, Agarwal had made a scathing attack on the opposition parties in Hardoi, saying that those who did not believe in Lord Rama and considered Jinnah as their leader have been taught to go to temples. In an apparent reference to BSP, Agarwal had said that those who used to say that toilets should be built in Ayodhya have now started remembering the Ram temple. He had also pitched for a law to be made applicable to those who chant “Pakistan Zindabad”. “They have no right to live in this country,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/those-who-love-jinnah-should-go-to-pakistan-naresh-agarwal/articleshow/87674052.cms||Pravin Kumar
---||World||Afghan foreign minister rules out presence of anti-Pakistan elements on its soil||ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s interim foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, has ruled out the presence of anti-Pakistan elements in his country, saying that the reasons for the conflict that did exist had been eliminated. Muttaqi has been on a three-day visit to Pakistan. He was specially invited by Pakistan to attend the meeting of the Troika Plus, a group comprising Pakistan, China, Russia and the US, on Afghanistan. At a meeting on Thursday, the US, Chinese and Russian representatives gave a clear message to the Taliban government to uphold its international legal obligations, including universally accepted principles of international law and fundamental human rights. Speaking at a separate event in Islamabad on Friday, the Afghan envoy said the Taliban have cleared all areas of anti-state elements that posed threats to others. "We are trying our best and exerting efforts in terms of not allowing the territory of Afghanistan to be used against anyone. The people of this region have suffered a lot and we must no longer let this suffering continue," the minister said. On Pakistan’s talks with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Muttaki said that there have been some improvements. "We are hopeful of a positive outcome from the talks. The ceasefire has taken place between the TTP and the Pakistani government and we are hopeful that this process will be extended," he said. The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has provided an opportunity for Pakistan to use its leverage on authorities in the war-ravaged country. One of the biggest challenges that Pakistan has been facing from across its western border was the presence of the Pakistani Taliban there. The TTP is a terrorist organisation formed by its first chief, Baitullah Mehsud, in 2007 after the merger of dozens of armed groups. The group’s aim is to replace Pakistan’s government with an Islamic system that was in place in Afghanistan from 1996 till 2001. It can be described as a Pakistani affiliate of the Afghan Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban had always fought on the side of their Afghan counterparts against Western forces and those of the former Afghanistan government. When the Afghan Taliban were driven out of Afghanistan in 2001, their Pakistani comrades had provided them shelter in the tribal areas, including in their own homes. The Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network had started their spring offensives from their safe havens in Pakistan. Before the onset of spring, the Taliban used to cross into Afghanistan to carry out attacks on US-led Western and Afghan forces. After achieving their objectives, they would return to their bases in North Waziristan and other tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghan border. The first suicide bomber of the Haqqani Network to carry out an attack in Afghanistan was trained by Baitullah Mehsud, the TTP’s first chief. After the fall of Kabul on August 15, Anas Haqqani, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani Network, had visited the suicide bomber’s grave to pay tribute. The Afghan Taliban are believed to have not forgotten that support. Following the Taliban’s return to power, Islamabad’s first and foremost demand of them was to use their influence to stop the TTP from using their country for terrorist attacks against Pakistan. Pakistan had turned to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the interior minister in Afghanistan’s Taliban government and chief of the Haqqani Network, for help in starting talks with the Pakistani Taliban, a source familiar with Islamabad’s ongoing talks with the TTP said. The Haqqanis and the Afghan Taliban had subsequently facilitated the talks that culminated in a month-long ceasefire from November 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-foreign-minister-rules-out-presence-of-anti-pakistan-elements-on-its-soil/articleshow/87674218.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The terrorist killed in Srinagar was a relative of one of the accused in the February 2019 suicide attack in Pulwama's Lethpora, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel lost their lives, said inspector general, Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar. Kumar added that this year so far, 133 terrorists, including top commanders, had been killed. IG Kumar said the Gazwatul Hind terrorist Aamir Riyaz, from Khrew in Pulwama, had planned a suicide attack at the Bemina police station in Srinagar but the alert security forces got information of this and killed him during an encounter. The encounter in Srinagar broke out on Thursday evening in the Hamdaniya Colony area of Bemina. An AK rifle, along with some ammunition, was seized from the site of the encounter after the slain terrorist's body was recovered. Meanwhile, police said a district commander of Hizbul Mujahideen was among the two terrorists killed in Kulgam’s Chawalgam. IG Kumar said that police, Army’s 9 RR and CRPF cordoned off the suspected spot and offered surrender to the hiding terrorists. “The terrorists refused to surrender and instead fired at the forces. In the ensuing gunfight, one unidentified terrorist was killed,” the officer said. “With the first light, the operation was resumed by the forces resulting in the killing of the second terrorist, while a search operation is on in the area," he said. Kumar said that they have identified slain HM terrorists as district commander of Hizb Shiraz Ahmad alias Shiraz Molvi and Yawar Ahmad Bhat. The IG said that according to police records, both the slain terrorists were part of groups involved in several terror attacks. “Shiraz Molvi was an A++ categorized terrorist and was active since year 2016 figuring among the list of most wanted terrorists,” he said, adding that “he was also involved in recruiting innocent youth into terror ranks and in spreading a reign of terror by killing civilians as well as political workers in Devsar and Brazloo areas of Kulgam. There are 15 FIRs registered against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorist-killed-in-srinagar-was-assigned-to-carry-out-suicide-attack-jk-police/articleshow/87674288.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The PM will take part in a major programme at Bhopal to mark the occasion, where more than two lakh tribals are expected to join. He will also virtually launch the Birsa Munda Freedom Fighter Museum in Ranchi. On Monday, the PM will first pay floral tributes at Birsa Munda’s statue at Parliament House and then virtually inaugurate the Birsa Munda museum before leaving for Bhopal. The tribal affairs ministry has sanctioned 10 tribal freedom fighters' museums which are to be set up in different parts of the country. Besides highlighting the life story of Birsa Munda, the museum in Ranchi also has statues of 13 tribal freedom fighters, and it will have a light and sound show for visitors. The Union Cabinet earlier this week decided to observe November 15 as a day dedicated to the tribal freedom fighters as India gets ready to celebrate 75 years of independence. Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda said a large number of national and state-level programmes will be held all through the week till November 22 to build awareness about the role of tribal freedom fighters. “It will be for the first time that programmes will be organised on a large scale to pay tributes to tribal freedom fighters who have been unsung heroes of freedom struggle till now,” Munda said. The minister said more than 85 tribal movements of pre-Independence and over 200 tribal leaders have been identified and their contributions are being compiled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-to-launch-janjatiya-gaurav-diwas-celebrations-on-monday-to-mark-birsa-mundas-birth-anniversary/articleshow/87674933.cms||Ambika Pandit

Well, that may not be the end of your woes, as you could be the target of a phishing attack next! In a recent Twitter thread, Delhi resident and social media strategist Vedant Khanduja reveals that he didn’t just have his iPhone stolen, but his login credentials too – despite taking all the necessary post-theft precautions, such as getting his SIM card blocked and contacting the police. What made him – and others with stolen iPhone users – vulnerable is a trick used by scammers to steal login ID. Read on to find out how your panic and desperation to get back your phone can be used against you to access your login credential and other critical data. HOW A DELHI RESIDENT WITH A STOLEN iPHONE WAS TRICKED INTO SHARING HIS APPLE IDIn a Twitter thread, Vedant detailed how his iPhone 12 was snatched by two men on a scooty in a crowded area in Vikaspuri, following which he reported the incident to the police and got an FIR registered and blocked his number. He also put his stolen phone in ‘lost’ mode through the Find my iPhone feature, which ensures that others can’t access or reset the device and a notification will be sent to the original owner if the device uses a Wi-Fi connection. He then received a text saying his phone had been located, and was temporarily switched on. It provided a link he could click on to see the phone’s current location. “I clicked on the link. It prompted me to sign into my iCloud. When I signed in, it showed me a location so I immediately went to the police station and I told them the location.” The police informed him that since the IMEI tracker had been on, they would have received a notification too if the phone had been on. That’s when Vedant checked the link again and realised it wasn’t genuine and that he had fallen victim to a phishing scam. “I realised that when I logged in, a (pre-recorded) video was shown to me and it was not a real location. I then got an email notification that someone accessed my Apple ID from a Windows desktop. I couldn’t recognise the device. I immediately changed my password and removed the Windows desktop from my Apple ID, but it was too late, as my stolen iPhone was already removed from my ID and its ‘Find my’ feature was also switched off,” wrote Vedant. The incident isn’t an isolated one, says Vedant, adding that he received messages from several victims of similar scams after he posted the thread on social media.

---||Delhi||Delhi turns gasp chamber on season’s worst air day||NEW DELHI: The “air emergency” in Delhi-NCR took a more serious turn on Friday as a smog of toxic chemicals thickened sending air quality to its worst level this season. Delhi’s Air Quality Index touched 471 on a scale of 500, higher than 462 reported a day after Diwali. As Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations have been over 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 17 and 19 hours, respectively, states have been told to be prepared to implement “emergency” measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), including a ban on constructions, odd-even traffic scheme and closure of schools. Officials said no major change in AQI is expected for four-five days. Pollution is becoming a health crisis with hospitals saying patients are being rushed to the emergency with complaints of chest congestion, bouts of cough and difficulty breathing. Read AlsoAQI touches 'severe mark', Delhi in a haze as relief disappears into thick airAfter a blink-of-an-eye respite on Monday, the city’s air degraded once again to fall in the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reading 404. Weather officials said the air pollution level was likely to fluctuate in this manner between the higher end of ‘very poor’ categoryFriday was the sixth “severe” air day reported in the last eight days. Experts said pollutants have accumulated due to calm wind conditions, high moisture, low mixing layer height and low temperature. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 rose from 26% on Thursday to 35% on Friday. When air quality remains above 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre for over 48 hours, “emergency” measures of GRAP are implemented in the region. As per CPCB data, Delhi-NCR’s 24-hour PM10 concentration was at 557.4 micrograms per cubic metre at 7 pm on Friday while PM2.5 was 373.1 micrograms per cubic metre during the same time. The safe limit for PM10 and PM2.5 is 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. #Delhi airport witnessed low visibility earlier today. (ANI) https://t.co/rIEE8XIIo4— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1636698639000R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Delhi has reported moderate smog conditions through the day with poor visibility at the range of 300-800m. For the first time in this season, poor visibility conditions, especially during the afternoon, were recorded due to smog cover across Delhi-NCR throughout the day.” The visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, ranged from 300-500 metres, while Palam recorded the visibility of 500-800 metres. In comparison, the visibility was better on Thursday afternoon at 800-1200m. “The main reason behind worsening of air quality and smog cover is calm or light winds continuing to prevail through the day along with high humidity level,” said a met official. Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory said, “The back pressure from southeast has resulted in calm conditions in the northern region. The ventilation coefficient and mixing layer height are also low.” Experts said no relief is expected from toxic pollution levels in the next few days. V K Soni, head, environment and research centre, IMD, said, “The wind speed is likely to remain the same for the next few days, hampering the dispersal of pollutants. No significant change in air quality is predicted for the next four to five days.” A smoggy view of Red Fort as air quality worsens in the city, in New Delhi on Friday.

---||India||China biggest security threat, says General Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: China is the biggest security threat facing India, “much bigger” than Pakistan, and the country is prepared to deal with “any misadventure” on the “land borders or the high seas”, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat said. Asked whether China was “enemy number 1” for India at the Times Now summit on Thursday evening, General Rawat said there was “no doubt” about it. “The threat on the northern borders is much bigger,” he said. “We are well prepared for any misadventure... Should they carry out a Galwan-like incident again, they will get it (back) in the same coin as they got last time,” said Gen Rawat. The CDS was referring to the violent skirmishes between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 last year. On the 18-month-long military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, he made it clear that India’s immediate priority is to ensure troop disengagement at the friction points with “sufficient separation and distance” to ensure no inadvertent incident takes place. While such disengagement has taken place in “almost all areas” including Pangong Tso-Kailash Range region, some places like the strategically-located Depsang Plains and the CNN junction in Demchok are left. “Disengagement is likely and will happen. But de-escalation appears to be far-fetched because of the kind of infrastructure the Chinese have developed…it will take a long time,” he said. The Indian armed forces, on their part, remain well-prepared for forward deployment for the second consecutive winter in the high-altitude region, and will not pull back till China agrees to withdraw its troops to their pre-April 2020 positions. “We have already stocked up for the winter. We have adequate resources to combat the adversary if he indulges in any misadventure. We will not budge because we are concerned about China re-occupying the positions. If the Chinese are going to stay there permanently, so will we,” the CDS said. Noting that there is “mutual suspicion on both sides”, he added that India will not “let its guard down” because the People’s Liberation Army has better infrastructure on its side and could come back faster to forward locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-biggest-security-threat-says-general-bipin-rawat/articleshow/87675595.cms||---

The Taliban claimed that they have already fulfilled all the demands mentioned at the India conference on Afghanistan, reported TOLO News. The demands made included ensuring Afghanistan did not export terrorism and there was unimpeded access for humanitarian support to people in the country. The Taliban’s claim that it had fulfilled the Delhi Declaration's concerns flies in the face of reports of deprivation and new restrictions in line with religious prescriptions. So far, barring Pakistan, most countries expect the Taliban to provide more evidence that the regime is prepared to be tolerant, inclusive and mindful of civilian distress. “The Islamic Emirate (Taliban) welcomes the India meeting. We are trying to take solid steps in governance, and countries should not be worried about Afghanistan soil being used against anyone,” deputy spokesman for the foreign ministry, Inamullah Samangani, was quoted as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/already-fulfilled-delhi-meet-demands-say-taliban/articleshow/87675637.cms||---

He believes he lost 10 years of his life in the past 18 months thanks to the stress that went hand-in-hand with the excitement of developing Covaxin. In a face-to-face interview, Ella opened up to TOI about the thrill of developing India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, but also spoke about the dangers and controversies that dogged the company throughout. “The past 18 months were tough. I have not battled so much for anything in the last 25 years (since he set up Bharat Biotech),” he says. “I feel as if I have lost 10 peaceful years in this battle.” He says that although Covaxin is not the first vaccine to have been developed by his company, it was certainly the first time that Bharat Biotech was under constant spotlight. “For Covaxin, we were working with a 1,000-litre fermenter with such a high density of live virus that this was enough to infect entire India. It was dangerous.” Pointing out that any death due to infection in the company, that too when there was no vaccine, would have been disastrous, he explains: “Today, we are vaccinated but then there was no vaccine. So, for about 4-5 months, some 20-25 of our critical employees could not go to their families. We took some apartments close to our plant (Genome Valley, Hyderabad) and put them up there till we had the animal challenge studies that indicated the vaccine offers 100% protection.” So how does he deal with the intense scrutiny? Ella says he switches off once he reaches home and does not pick up any calls. Instead he spends his time doing what he loves the most – reading up on the latest advancements in the world of science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lost-10-years-of-life-in-18-months-due-to-covaxin-stress-says-krishna-ella/articleshow/87675738.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two police personnel have been admitted to a hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, the local police said. The police have detained four people in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen — an ASP, an inspector and six constables — were injured. At least three vehicles were damaged in stone-pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said that a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG (Nashik Range) B G Shekhar Patil told TOI that the police had a tough time bringing the situation under control as the group kept throwing stones at policemen. “The police had to resort to a mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” Patil said. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters threw stones at a building with shops in the basement and a hospital on the first and second floors. Some windowpanes of the hospital were broken. Both the DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded SP Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to the tehsildar at around 3 pm, the gathering had started to disperse when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, injuring policemen. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, and unlawful assembly. The injured officers include ASP Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fractured leg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/police-shops-attacked-in-maharashtra-towns-during-protest-against-tripura-violence/articleshow/87675713.cms||Santosh Sonawane

They are too expensive, unaffordable and there’s uncertainty about the outcome. It is the civil society that can be subverted, divided and manipulated to hurt the interest of the nation. You are there to see that this land is fully protected,” Doval said. Doval, an alumni of the academy, was the chief guest at the ‘Dikshant Parade’ of the 2020 batch on Friday which saw 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees participating. “People are most important. The new frontier of war, which is called the fourth generation of warfare, is civil society,” he said. He also emphasised on the greater role of police in border management spanning over 15,000km covering Pakistan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. He said managing the 32 lakh square km of India was the responsibility of police forces. “But it will extend. You will be responsible for border management of this country. Most of the 15,000 km of border has got peculiar problems of its own,” he added. Doval said there were different types of security issues on each border. “There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations,” he added. Doval’s comments on greater policing comes a day after the Punjab assembly adopted a resolution against the Centre extending the jurisdiction of the BSF, which the Punjab assembly said was an insult.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/subverting-civil-society-is-new-frontier-of-war-nsa-ajit-doval/articleshow/87675717.cms||---

On Monday, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will meet state chief ministers and FMs to identify measures that may be required to get investment rolling. This will be followed by a meeting with bank chiefs on Tuesday to identify sector-wise problems. And, on Wednesday, the issues will be presented before Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he meets bank chiefs, in what is also seen as a signal to spur lending at a time when credit flow remains muted. “There is capital expenditure from the government side, and there is a positive sentiment from the private sector side, though perhaps not fully translated into actual investment on a big scale. Capital market activity indicates that a lot of investment is probably on the cards,” finance secretary TV Somanathan said. The top civil servant added that the government believed that it should capitalise on the positive sentiment to take the economy and investment to a higher growth trajectory. “It’s an opportunity, an opportunity that we should not let go,” he said. With demand, including in the services sector showing signs of bouncing back strongly, the government believes that the private sector is now in a position to invest. At the meeting with bankers, sectoral issues will be discussed as the Centre, along with the states, seeks to remove the bottlenecks and spur investment, which it hopes will translate into jobs. Somanathan said that at least seven states — Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Punjab, Rajasthan and Telangana — have so far taken advantage of the incentives announced by the Centre for enhanced capex during the first half. As an incentive, these states have been allowed to borrow an additional amount of Rs 16,691 crore from the markets. Economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth said the discussion with the states will revolve around issues such as land, water, electricity availability and how policies can be eased for attracting investments. “While the investor sentiment is good, there is a need to capitalise on the momentum already created. The first four months of FY 2021-22 have already witnessed inflows of $64 billion foreign direct investment,” a statement said. The interaction will attempt to create a policy discourse and a facilitative environment for inward investment-led growth||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-looks-to-boost-private-investment-ease-bottlenecks/articleshow/87675897.cms||---

E Muniraju, from Chokkanahalli village in Bagalur, north Bengaluru, makes a living by grazing cattle and selling milk. After a few visits to the offices of his bank branch and the state commercial taxes department that administers GST, he realized that there had, indeed, been a huge transaction in his account and it was a fraud perpetrated on him by a family friend. Muniraju has filed a complaint with Bagalur police against family friend Zansi, a resident of Lingarajapuram who had taken copies of his PAN card, Aadhaar and bank account details on the pretext of getting him a ‘cow loan' from the government. According to police, the notice to Muniraju was issued by the additional commissioner of commercial tax (enforcement), department of commercial taxes, government of Karnataka. The cowherd told TOI that he and his wife wanted to buy a cow so that he could start a business. In April, Zansi, a friend of Muniraju's mother, assured him of getting ‘cow loan' from the government. Zansi is a vegetable vendor and her husband a businessman. "Zansi and my mother know each other for years. My mother sells vegetables in Lingarajapuram. Zansi asked me to hand over photocopies of my PAN and Aadhaar cards. Also, she asked for photocopies of my wife's PAN and Aadhaar. My wife and I have a joint account in a bank with its branch in Bagalur and gave her a photocopy of the passbook," he said. Some months later, Zansi told Muniraju that the loan work "is going on" and he will receive a one-time password (OTP) on his mobile and he should share the same with her. "Accordingly, the OTP came on August 20, and I shared it with Zansi. However, I did not get any loan from the government. Later, I called Zansi. She said my loan application has been rejected. On October 12, an official from the commercial tax department called me on my mobile saying there was a transaction of Rs 2 crore in my bank account towards which I had not paid any GST. Therefore, I'm supposed to pay a tax of Rs 40 lakh. I was shocked. I explained to the officer over phone that I'm a cowherd and earn a few thousands of rupees monthly. Also, I told him I was not aware of GST or any other kind of tax and I had not paid any tax in my life," Muniraju, who has a below-poverty-line ration card, said. Bank officials summoned Muniraju and showed him the notice sent by the commercial tax department to him through the bank. The officials, aware of Muniraju's financial status, asked him whether he had shared his bank account details with anyone. That's when Muniraju revealed the cow-loan story. As directed by officials, Muniraju visited the commercial tax department's office in Koramangala in October last week. "They took my statement that I have not carried transaction of Rs 2 crore in my account," he said. Later, Muniraju filed a complaint with Bagalur police, accusing Zansi, her husband and others of cheating him. A police officer said they will visit the GST office to collect documents on Monday. Cops said Zansi's mobile number is switched off. Cops have registered a case against Zansi and others under IPC for breach of trust, cheating, personation and dishonesty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-cowherd-with-2k-income-gets-gst-notice-for-2-crore-transaction/articleshow/87675935.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||KSRTC bans playing music on mobile speaker in buses||BENGALURU: Close on the heels of Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) also banned passengers from playing music or watching movies on speaker mode on mobile phones in its buses. The state-run corporation also said that violators will be deboarded. On Friday, KSRTC issued a circular that complaints against passengers playing songs and watching news and movies and causing inconvenience to fellow passengers has increased. It urged drivers and conductors to create awareness among passengers. However, KSRTC has no data on number of such complaints. The order will also be implemented in other two corporations, including Kalyana Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (KKRTC) and North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC). The move came after a Tumakuru-based advocate filed a PIL in the Karnataka high court seeking restrictions on playing loud music or videos on electronic gadgets in buses and trains. Petitioner L Ramesh Naik, 37, pointed out that playing loud music in buses severely inconveniences co-passengers. The court ordered notices to the commissioner of road safety and railway board earlier this year. However, the PIL was dismissed on Nov 9 for want of prosecution as the petitioner was not present in court. "The question raised in the petition is left open to be considered in some other appropriate case," a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi held.In 2019, BMTC had taken action against passengers playing on their mobile phones or iPods during commutes. However, many regular passengers complain there is no enforcement and many continue to play music without earphones/headsets. According to section 94 (V) of Karnataka Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, if a passenger using a stage carriage bus, sings or plays any musical instrument or operate a transistor radio, then "the driver or the conductor may require such person to alight from the vehicle and may stop the vehicle or keep it stationary until such person has alighted. Such person shall not be entitled to a refund of any fare which he may have paid and any person failing to comply may be removed by the conductor or the driver, or any police officer on being requested by the driver or conductor or any passenger."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ksrtc-bans-playing-music-on-mobile-speaker-in-buses/articleshow/87675940.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||K’taka: Pvt unaided schools to charge 85% of tuition fees||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Friday capped fees to be charged by private unaided schools for academic year 2020-21 at 85% of their tuition fees for 2019-20.No other fees like development fees, donation or charity to trusts or other facilities can be collected. The order is applicable to all school boards. In case a school has already collected the full fees, it's bound to return the excess fees or adjust it with fees of academic year 2021-22. In case parents have grievances, they can approach grievance redressal committees that will be headed by directors of the department in Bengaluru and principals of DIETs and senior education department officials in districts. On January 29, 2021, Suresh Kumar, then minister for primary and secondary education, had announced that private schools can collect only 70% of tuition fees. Other fees under the banner of development fee, donation to trusts, or other facilities like transport and extra curricular activities could not be collected. Private schools challenged the order in the high court. On September 16, the court disposed of the petitions in terms of the Supreme Court's decision in Indian School Jodhpur vs State of Rajasthan case on May 3. As a one-time measure, the Supreme Court had directed for providing deduction of 15% on fee amount in lieu of unutilised facilities by students during 2020-21.As per the high court order, the school management can collect annual school fees fixed for academic year 2019-20 (schools were not allowed to hike fees in 2020-21) after deducting 15% in lieu of unutilised facilities by students during 2020-21. The order states that schools are free to provide further concession over and above this 15% in tuition fees. At the same time, schools cannot debar a student from attending online or offline classes on account of non-payment fees and cannot withhold their results. Schools cannot withhold the name of candidate appearing for board exams too. In case of a request by a parent finding it difficult to pay fees, schools have to consider them on a case-by-case basis. The order mentions this will not affect collection of fees for academic year 2021-22."If a school collects Rs 70 as tuition fees, Rs 15 as term fees and Rs 15 as development fee, it can only collect 85% of Rs 70 as per the order. The fees to be collected would come to Rs 59.50," explained a department official.Parents' associations which had been fighting for fee reduction, are happy the case has come to a conclusion. "Private schools had gone to the highest court of the state. Since the verdict has come and the order is here, at least now they should implement it," said Ganesh Poojary, executive member, Karnataka State Parents Coordination Committee. "The high court has specifically said schools can collect annual fees after deducting 15%. However, the department has divided it into tuition fees and other fees. This is unacceptable and a contempt of the court order. We'll be forced to challenge it again in the court," D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-pvt-unaided-schools-to-charge-85-of-tuition-fees/articleshow/87675993.cms||---

Sources said Shettar is lobbying for a ticket for his younger brother Pradeep Shettar, who is eyeing a second term in the legislative council. The junior Shettar, who was elected MLC in 2015, is hoping to contest from Dharwad again in the December 10 council polls despite strong opposition as it violates the party’s policy against dynasty politics. Sources said BJP is looking to rejig its organisational structure in the state ahead of the 2023 assembly polls and Shettar was summoned to seek his opinion. Shettar, however, said he is in Delhi for personal work. “I had booked air tickets three days ago; my visit has nothing to do with politics,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/buzz-over-shettars-delhi-visit/articleshow/87675999.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Congress claims cops gave hacker Sriki ‘mind-altering drugs’||BENGALURU: Congress on Friday demanded a probe into the alleged bitcoin scam by a sitting Supreme Court judge, claiming police administered ‘mind-altering drugs’ to kingpin Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki in custody and tampered with evidence. The party said it will move the SC if the state government fails to order a probe. Priyank Kharge, a former minister and Congress MLA, shared some legal documents with the media to press various charges, which, however, could not be independently verified by TOI. Kharge said that on January 11, 2021, accused Sriki’s father, in his application before the court, had stated that police officers administered ‘mind-altering drugs’ to his son in police custody. “Sriki himself has told the magistrate that he used to take Alprazolam when in custody. If so, how did he get the drugs? Who gave them to him and why?” Kharge asked. At the time of investigation, Kharge alleged, Sriki’s wallet had 186 bitcoins, the current market value of which is around Rs 100 crore, while the accused in his sworn statement before cyber cell police had confessed that he had hacked around 5,000 bitcoins worth more than Rs 2,500 crore. “Where are these bitcoins now? How much of it has been recovered by police? The government must answer,” he said. Kharge also accused the state government of trying to hush up the case. “Police arrested Sriki in November 2020 and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) comes to know about it only on February 15. Why didn’t state police alert ED when they knew that Sriki hacked several websites and bitcoin exchanges and swindled crores of rupees,” he asked. Siddaramaiah questions PMOpposition leader in the legislative assembly Siddaramaiah questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for advising CM Bommai against worrying about the bitcoin allegations. Taking objections to Bommai’s statement made after his meeting with Modi on Thursday that he was asked to ignore the bitcoin charges and focus on development, Siddaramaiah said: “Instead of asking the CM to get the matter investigated, how could the PM ask him to ignore charges against him? Why is there so much hesitation towards a probe,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congress-claims-cops-gave-hacker-mind-altering-drugs/articleshow/87676001.cms||---

While 2,993 accidents were caused by overspeeding in Bengaluru last year, the number was the lowest in recent years, mainly due to the pandemic, lockdown, travel restrictions and work-from-home arrangement. Such accidents have been decreasing over the past few years: 4,143 in 2019 and 4,289 in 2018. The 2,993 accidents resulted in 596 deaths and left 2,650 people injured. The Karnataka capital led the 89 cities on both counts: deaths and injuries. Ironically, Bengaluru is one of the most congested cities where the average vehicle speed is less than 10kmph during peak hours. Experts say most of these accidents are reported on major arterial roads during late night and early- morning hours when traffic movement and police presence on roads are less. Bengaluru was followed by Hyderabad, which saw 1,785 accidents due to overspeeding, Delhi (1,493), Thrissur (1,448), Ahmedabad (1,181), Chennai (1,126), Kollam (1,124) and Jabalpur (1,072). Thrissur and Kollam in Kerala and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh are tier-two cities. Across Karnataka, 27,059 accidents were reported due to overspeeding, which led to 7,809 fatalities and 31,190 injuries last year. “More than 60% of road accidents in the country can be attributed to overspeeding. In Bengaluru, most accidents are reported at traffic police limits in Yelahanka, KR Puram, Chikkajala and Electronics City. Airport road, Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Mysuru Road and NICE Road witness most accidents due to overspeeding,” said a senior traffic police official. However, the number of overspeeding cases booked by Bengaluru police came down from 61,531 in 2019 to 59,071 in 2020. Between January and September 2021, only 45,883 cases were booked. MN Srihari, traffic expert and former adviser to the government, said: “Most victims of these accidents are youngsters, especially two-wheeler riders. Most of them don’t wear quality and full-face helmets. There are several reasons, including negligence and driving under the influence of alcohol, for road accidents. In urban areas, the safe speed is 40kmph and most of these accidents happen when motorists tend to go above 80kmph.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-saw-most-accidents-caused-by-overspeeding-last-year-ncrb/articleshow/87676008.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

He was 75.Shyam West Wind for his friends and fans, the singer became an idol for music lovers in Bengaluru in the 1970s and 1980s when live bands ruled the music scene. His performance at Mandarin Room restaurant at Ashoka Hotel is nostalgic for many Bengalureans who spent their young days attending the band’s shows.“Shyam and his band held a superstar status in the city, especially in the late 1970s and 1980s. Those were the days of beautiful live music, much before DJs. West Wind was the best of the lot here. As a school kid, Shyam was my inspiration. Apart from being a talented musician, he was a wonderful human being as he always helped fellow musicians, especially budding talents, with their gigs,” reminisced Dominice D’Cruz, a guitarist who played with Shyam on many occasions.A sales executive with a fertiliser company in Kochi, Shyam relocated to Bengaluru in 1983 and began playing at East West Hotel (later Gateway and now Vivanta) on Residency Road before moving to Ashoka Hotel. “Shyam sang popular numbers of Elton John, Elvis Presley and other stars of the times. He was not only a talented singer but a versatile one too. He and his band performed when I was in Mount Carmel College in the early 1980s to a rousing reception from students. They were quite a sensation those days and indeed a household name,” said Bengalurean Shubha Chacko, executive director of Solidarity Foundation.Stanley Carvalho, author and Richards Town resident, said Shyam was the most popular western music vocalist of the 1980s and his band drew crowds with their performances in hotels and at other private events. “The band toured other parts of the country as well, including Jammu and Kashmir,” he added.Shyam remained active in the music scene in Bengaluru with his solo gigs till the pandemic struck.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: TikTok friend, nephew held for helping homemaker kill spouse||BENGALURU: Continuing investigation into the murder of real estate businessman Palar Swamy aka Swamy Raj in which his wife had surrendered, police on Thursday arrested two more persons, including the woman’s TikTok friend. According to Madanayakanahalli police, Raj’s wife Nethra, 37, surrendered before police past Saturday midnight, minutes after bludgeoning her husband to death at their house in Harokyatanahalli village, off Tumakuru Road. Nethra claimed Raj was harassing her sexually and hence she killed him. But investigation by police inspector BS Manjunath and his team revealed that Nethra took help from her TikTok friend Bharath, 32, of Bidarahalli, near KR Puram, and her nephew Vijay Kumar, 25, of Sunkadakatte, to eliminate Raj. Probe revealed Nethra came in contact with Bharath, who was in the business of pet animals, on TikTok. The duo became friends and later developed a relationship. Raj came to know about their affair and warned her several times; he also asked her not to meet him. But the two allegedly continued to meet. Nethra planned to kill Raj late Saturday night and summoned Bharath and Kumar to her home. She asked them to wait outside and alert her if anyone came. She took an iron object and bludgeoned Raj to death. Nethra reportedly gave Bharath and Kumar some money before rushing to the police station to surrender. Police came to know about the two other suspects while checking Nethra’s call details. “We have produced all three before the court, which remanded them in judicial custody,” a police officer said. Raj’s father Basavaraju M lodged a complaint with police, alleging that Nethra wanted to grab all the property earned by him and his son. According to him, Raj married TR Satyakumari 25 years ago and they had two children, including a daughter. Later he got acquainted with Nethra, a beautician, and married her six years ago. The incident came to light around 11.30pm, when Basavaraj came to Raj’s house after the latter did not respond to calls. “I rushed to his home and found him lying in a pool of blood. He had severe head injuries. Nethra was holding an iron rod and fled as soon as I entered the house,” Basavaraju stated in his complaint. Satyakumari too alleged Nethra murdered Raj to take possession of his property. Raj had developed a layout on two acres of land belonging to Nagesh in Harokyatanahalli. Later, he returned the property to Nagesh, keeping six sites with him. Three years ago, Raj built a posh house on these sites and lived there with Nethra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tiktok-friend-nephew-held-forhelping-homemaker-kill-spouse/articleshow/87676010.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The students claimed when the UGC directive issued in the wake of the pandemic was clear that students of intermediary semesters should be promoted on betterment and exams have to be held only for final-year candidates, KSLU had issued a circular on September 17 mandating exams. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/intermediate-sem-llb-exam-stayed/articleshow/87676011.cms||---

The wily pacer made his ODI debut against England in which he picked up four wickets in India’s 66-run victory. The 25-year-old took a giant step on Friday towards earning a Test cap when he was named in the India’s squad for the home series against New Zealand later this month.Prasidh has been on the Indian Test squad radar since being added to the team ahead of the fourth Test against England at The Oval in London in September after being a standby. He had travelled and was training with the team during the tour of England. Also, he has been a standby player since the World Test Championship final. Prasidh, who made his first-class debut for Karnataka in 2015 is excited about being a part of the squad.Speaking to TOI on Friday before leaving the Karnataka team in New Delhi, Prasidh said, “I’m very grateful for the opportunity because it gives me another chance to rub shoulders with the greats, learn from them and add to my skillset.”Prasidh believes the time spent with the team in England has helped him evolve into a better player. “The tour helped me a lot because bowling in England required different work ethics and it was a good platform to learn. I believe that tour gave me a lot of confidence and also helped me evaluate at what level I was and set the vision for how I want my career to pan out in the future.”The time in England also helped Prasidh work on his shortcomings. “It helped me polish my skills and work on my consistency. To play at that level, we require an X factor and I worked on it. It also taught me how to handle pressure," he added. With Indian batting stalwart Rahul Dravid taking over the coaching reins from Ravi Shastri, Prasidh believes he is in for another learning experience. “I’ve interacted extensively with Rahul sir during my time with the India ‘A’ squad and at the National Cricket academy. He is somebody who is always calm and pressure never shows on him. These are among the many aspects of the game we get to learn from him. So, I’m looking forward to this crucial learning curve in my career,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/england-tour-helped-me-evolve-as-a-player-prasidh/articleshow/87676014.cms||Manuja Veerappa
---||India||Boost for small investors: PM Modi unveils scheme on government bonds||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday underlined the need for ease of investment, trust in the system and convenience for the common man along with financial inclusion and ease of access as he unveiled a scheme that allows retail investors to buy government bonds from a dedicated RBI platform. PM Modi, who also launched an integrated ombudsman scheme, underlined the need for a strong banking system, while listing out several initiatives by the government and Reserve Bank of India, including a clean-up of the books of banks. “With the RBI Retail Direct Scheme, small investors now have a medium through which they can safely invest in government securities. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme has led to the ‘One Nation, One Ombudsman’ system taking shape in the country,” he said, adding that the investment will also help the government undertake development work. The PM complimented RBI and the finance ministry for steps taken and said reforms initiated in recent years have resulted in greater inclusion. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a coordinated effort by the finance ministry and RBI has led to a recovery post Covid-19. She said the Retail Direct Scheme will facilitate retail participation, deepen the bond market and allow for a fair market determined rates for all the across the yield curve. “The retail participation has been hesitant all these years, because of the cost involved and because of the traditional intermediary system which has prevailed. Now this will probably bring in a direct cost free, convenience driven, and also build confidence in the retail participation in the government securities,” she said. Modi said that financial services – from banking to pension and insurance -- used to be like an exclusive club in India till six-seven years ago, but are now accessible to common citizens, poor families, farmers, small traders-businessmen, women, Dalits, deprived and backward. “Those who had the responsibility of taking these facilities to the poor never paid any attention to it. Rather, various excuses were made for not changing. It was said that there is no bank branch, no staff, no internet, no awareness, no idea what the arguments were,” he said while criticising the earlier government. Soon after taking charge, the Modi government had launched the Jan Dhan scheme which was followed by group health and life insurance schemes. Besides, he said, last mile financial inclusion was possible due to digital empowerment. While pointing to the spread of UPI, the PM said digital transactions have shot up 19 times in seven years. “Today, 24 hours, seven days and 12 months, our banking system is operational in the country. We have seen its benefits during Covid times.” He called upon policymakers to strengthen trust and confidence of investors in the financial market. “We have to keep the needs of the citizens of the country at the centre and keep on strengthening the trust of the investors. I am confident that RBI will continue to strengthen India's new identity as a sensitive and investor-friendly destination,” the PM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boost-for-small-investors-pm-modi-unveils-scheme-on-government-bonds/articleshow/87675997.cms||---
---||Surat||Umargam BJP leader, wife among three killed in accident||Surat: Three persons including BJP Umargam taluka panchayat member, his wife and an employee died after their tempo was hit by container truck and a private passenger bus near Bhilad railway crossing in Valsad district on Friday. According to the police, the incident took place when 45-year-old Mukesh Dhodi’s tempo was being pushed to the side of the road by other passengers when it developed some mechanical snag. Dhodi, a resident of Kandadu village operates DJ music system business and was also elected as a first time member of Umargam taluka panchayat. Along with his wife Kalpana (42), son Kapil and four other employees, Dhodi was returning in their mini truck at night from Vapi after a performance there. When the vehicle reached near Bhilad railway crossing, it broke down and then, Kapil and three other employees got down to push the vehicle on the road side. While Dhodi was steering the vehicle, his wife was seating beside him. Suddenly a container truck hit the tempo from behind. The tempo lost control and got pushed to the opposite side of the road and crashed into a private passenger bus coming from the opposite direction and going to Ahmedabad from Mumbai. In the collision, both Dodhi and his wife died on the spot along with an employee, Hiten Halpati. A few passengers of the bus also received minor injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.

Launched in 2019, Tata Q, with a manufacturing facility in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, is the number 2 player in India’s ready-to-eat market. On October 21, TOI had reported about the impending transaction. Previously, Tata Consumer had bought the packaged foods portfolio from another sister company Tata Chemicals, consolidating its play in the broader sector. The Tata Q deal marks Tata Consumer’s entry into the ready-to-eat segment, which is growing at a significant pace benefitting from demographic tailwinds such as urbanization, and high disposable income nuclear families looking for convenience food on the go. Last month, the Rs 11,600-crore Tata Consumer transferred the management rights of Tata Cha—a tea parlour chain—to a third sister company Indian Hotels. Indian Hotels, which runs Taj, has rebranded Tata Cha as Qmin as part of its larger play in food and beverages. It now plans to take over the entire operations of the tea café outlets on its books from Tata Consumer, said people in the know.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-consumer-to-buy-tata-q-from-group-co/articleshow/87674900.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Goa||Goa expert panel gives nod for offline classes for I-VIII||PANAJI: The committee on Covid has decided to recommend to the state government to reopen schools for classes I to VIII. The final call will now be taken by the state task force. Dr Shekhar Salkar, of the expert panel, said that paediatricians in the committee were overwhelmingly of the view that the situation is safe for younger children to return to school. He said that hybrid mode — with a combination of online and offline sessions — may be adopted and it may be left to the education department and the school managements to work out the modalities based on the ground situation. Salkar said that since physical classes have begun for Class IX to XII, no increase in positivity rate in children has been seen. “Today’s agenda was only one, on whether schools should start from Class I onwards. And the paediatricians, who were there, strongly felt that we should start. After discussing this, we have decided that we should recommend to the government that they should start classes from Class I onwards up to Class VIII. They should start by following proper Covid appropriate behaviour and the SOPs given by the education department,” Salkar told reporters. He said the overall positivity rate for the state is presently below 1%. “We have said hybrid mode. It is very important that it is left to the education department and the managements, how they can manage it. But from our side it is quite safe now considering this week the positivity rate is below 1%. So I think it is the right time to start,” Salkar said. State epidemiologist Utkarsh Betodkar has told the committee the average rate of Covid-19 infection for children at 10% has remained constant even after Classes IX-XII started, he said. Schools can open from Classes I to VIII even immediately, if the government so wishes, the expert committee member said. “Once central government gives clearance, we can go all out and give vaccination first to children who have co-morbid conditions like cancer, diabetes, obesity in the 12 to 18 age group. Our health director said we have got enough vaccine stock,” Salkar said. He said that children as well as parents are seen to be suffering ‘psychologically’ due to schools remaining shut for such a long period. “Psychologically children are suffering because they have not seen their friends. Parents are also suffering because they have to be at home to look after their children and with both the parents working it is difficult. In Bicholim, we had almost 40 primary school children whose parents were sending them to school saying that ‘you play with them or do whatever but take them in the school’,” Salkar said. He said that it will be a challenge for schools to work out the modalities to make all classes from I to XII operational. “The number of students will increase, but the number of classrooms will be the same. At present, only Class IX and X students were coming to school and the rest of the classes were empty. But now that Classes I to VIII will also start, how to do it will be a problem that will have to be solved by the education department and the managements,” Salkar said. Since physical sessions for Class IX to XII resumed, the admission of children in hospitals primarily for Covid has been nil, he said. “In fact cases are down since the time Classes IX to XII started. Most of the children who tested positive were those who had been brought for treatment for some other ailment. The admission for Covid itself is nil. Once classes resume for younger children and if there is some Covid infection in some school or cluster, we can advise the government based on the situation, maybe by shutting only that school. If the overall positivity in schools goes up then too we can guide the government in that regard,” Salkar said. The fact that nearly all sectors have opened up in the state and the positivity rate is still low means that Covid situation is under control in Goa, the doctor said. “Practically everything is open and with that also if the rate of positivity has come down that means Covid is under control. Not that we should be relaxed, we should follow all the Covid appropriate behaviour. We saw last year that despite the heavy rush in December-January, Covid cases did not increase, they increased in April, which means there was a mutation. So, we should wait, and if there are no mutations, we may escape a third wave. As of today, at least we feel there are no more mutations,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-expert-panel-gives-nod-for-offline-classes-for-i-viii/articleshow/87674922.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Mineral corporation report on leases likely by November-end||PANAJI: The Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) is likely to submit the mining leases inspection report by the end of the month, based on which the state government will take a decision on the number of leases to be put up for auction. MECL representatives have commenced site inspections of 77 leases to quantify the ore lying in these leases. Once this quantity is determined, the leases will be auctioned. The MECL will also determine if there is vegetation or habitation on the land. “We are likely to get the MECL report on mining leases by end-November,” a senior officer said. The state government has provided documents pertaining to these leases to MECL. Earlier, the government had signed a MoU with MECL to identify new iron ore mines in the state. Keeping in mind the delay in the resumption of mining, the state government recently formed a mining corporation to identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. The officer said that once MECL finalises the blocks to be auctioned, the leases will be transferred to the mining corporation, and thereafter, auctioned. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 leaseholders had applied for first renewal. Subsequently, 413 leaseholders had applied in 2006 for a second renewal. Out of the 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 of those holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987 and 2007. In October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled and another 133 in November 2013. Goa has large deposits of iron ore (1,456 million tonne) as well as significant occurrences of other major minerals like bauxite (55 million tonne) and manganese ore (34 million tonne).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mineral-corp-report-on-leases-likely-by-nov-end/articleshow/87675031.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Business||Rural markets growing faster than urban: Mondelez India||MUMBAI: Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez India has witnessed a double-digit growth in the third quarter of 2021, with urban markets rebounding and rural growing faster than urban for the company. Consumption trends driving growth for Mondelez in India include more people consuming premium chocolates, even in rural India. Mondelez International president (India) Deepak Iyer told TOI, the company has seen a double-digit CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in the last two years. During the third quarter, over 80,000 stores were added in India. Among categories, biscuits witnessed a mid-single-digit growth, while chocolates grew in double-digits. Given that rural India has witnessed huge tailwinds, Mondelez India has expanded its reach to almost 1 lakh villages, said Iyer. “This year, urban has rebounded very strongly for us, while rural is growing at 1.5 times urban because we believe there’s a lot of headroom for growth given the difference in per capita consumption between urban and rural markets. We have noticed rural consumers are happy consuming chocolates at Rs 5 and Rs 10 price points but they are also asking for ‘Silk’ (Cadbury Dairy Milk (CDM) Silk). In a digitally connected world with smartphones, rural consumers are aware of premium products.” CDM at price points of Rs 20 and Rs 40 are also very salient now, said Iyer, while adding that Silk is now a fast-moving SKU (stock keeping unit) for the company. “A small village store would have 50-75% of the SKUs that one finds in an urban store,” said Iyer. As to how the company is managing inflationary pressures along with maintaining price points, Iyer said, the company tries to maintain a balance between the three portfolios of affordable, mainstream and premium. The affordable portfolio is used to recruit new consumers and thus no pricing action is taken here. On the other hand, the premium portfolio is where pricing actions are taken. “The affordable portfolio will get us volume and new consumers. The premium portfolio will get us profit, while the mainstream portfolio will be somewhere in between,” said Iyer. On the kind of mega trends he sees for 2022 — whether they’ll peak or taper — Iyer said: “We may have to learn to coexist with Covid in 2022. It’s not going to be the old normal. It is going to be somewhere in between.“ On what kept the company going since the pandemic broke, Iyer credits it to the company’s employees and the workplace culture. “Even though the external situation in the country posed a lot of uncertainties for the industry, there’s one thing that kept our business chugging along in these testing times, and that’s our people. Our purpose of empowering people to snack right, our mission of leading the future of snacking is something which really energises our teams very well. Over the years, we have curated and nurtured a very enabling culture around mindsets and behaviours, which have really helped us come out stronger from every disruption that has come our way,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rural-mkts-growing-faster-than-urban-mondelez-india/articleshow/87674876.cms||Namrata Singh

Almost 60% of the patients visiting different hospitals are suffering from diseases caused by fluctuations in temperature, say doctors. According to health experts, change in weather brings out a spell of sickness. The weather itself does not make one sick, but the viruses do. Rhinovirus and coronavirus are the two main viruses that cause common cold, cough, and fever. They multiply rapidly during seasonal shifts, resulting in an increase in the number of people getting sick, they say. Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital claims that 50-60% of the OPD patients visiting the hospital are victims of seasonal change. Most of them complain of sore throat, stuffy nose, respiratory problems, and fever. He adds, “A human body performs its functions at a certain temperature. However, during a change in season, it is forced to readapt itself, making it highly susceptible to viruses and infections. People with lower immunity and prone to allergies are highly susceptible to these changes.” Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, the former president of Indian Medical Association (Bihar branch), says during the current seasonal change in the state, pulmonary diseases and dengue are on the rise. TB is also showing a rising trend this year and the number of Covid-19 cases has also shown a slightly upward trend during the last three to four days. He advises the people to protect themselves from cold and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour in order to stay medically fit and healthy. “Eating a well-balanced diet, getting plenty of sleep, and keeping stress under control can help one deal with seasonal sickness better.” Paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, points out that children are most vulnerable to seasonal changes. They must be protected from cold and kept away from others affected by viral diseases. He adds, “Hospitals and nursing homes of almost all the cities in the state have reported maximum number of children suffering from seasonal diseases this year. Only a month back, the situation had come to such a pass that sick children were lying on floors and two to three kids were occupying one bed in different hospitals. Most of them suffered from viral fever and diarrhoea.” Dr Shah further says children above six months must be administered a dose of influenza vaccine every year so that they stay protected against this virus during the change of season. Moreover, children also need to be protected against Covid-19 as they are yet to be vaccinated for the same. Dr Prabhakar Devaj, former chief medical officer of Patna University Central Dispensary, says, “Every time we observe a change in season, the count of allergens in the environment also goes up to nearly 200 viruses in the air. The shift in temperatures provides an apt condition for different groups of viruses to flourish, which then spread contagious diseases.” He suggests that with some minor precautions and lifestyle changes, it is possible to dodge seasonal sickness. “Practise good hygiene, exercise regularly, eat well, and take proper rest to avoid viral infection,” he urges people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/exercise-regularly-and-eat-well-suggest-doctors/articleshow/87673311.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Perform breathing exercise & yoga to keep pneumonia at bay: Doctors||PATNA: Pneumonia is dangerous, but it is preventable by adopting a healthier lifestyle, medical experts say. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said respiratory exercise is the best way to strengthen lungs. “It may be done by yoga or even inculcating the fun of blowing balloons,” he said and added that pneumonia may be allergic, infective or atypical and affects lungs leading to problems in breathing and other symptoms in people of any age, though children are more susceptible to catch this disease. “About 400 of the 1800 Covid patients who died at the IGIMS had severe pneumonia,” Dr Mandal said. He, however, said yoga or breathing exercises can minimise its chances among the people. Dr Lokesh Tiwari, head of paediatrics department at the AIIMS-Patna, termed pneumonia as an ongoing health concern. Malnutrition, unhealthy lifestyle and weak immunity are the main factors leading to bacterial or viral pneumonia. “About 40% of the children admitted to paediatric ICU at the AIIMS-P suffer from pneumonia of varying severity,” he said. Though anti-pneumonia vaccines are available free of cost at government hospitals, many people fail to get their children vaccinated just because of lack of awareness. The best way to protect children from this disease is to encourage them for outdoor games or inculcate the practice of breathing exercise like 'pranayam' at home or schools, added Dr Tiwari. A child specialist of Mahavir Vatsalya hospital, Dr Vivek Kumar Pandey termed unsafe delivery and malnourishment as the main causes of pneumonia in the newborn and children. “It may prove fatal in case of children within one year of age if proper medication is not followed at the earliest,” he said. Unhealthy way of living and exposure to dirt and dust may trigger the disease. However, regular exercise can strengthen lungs, he added. Senior paediatrician Dr Arun Shah from of Muzaffarpur said, “Pneumonia in India accounts for 20% of the deaths in children worldwide. It causes difficulty in breathing and limits oxygen intake. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses and is a contagious disease.” He said pneumonia symptoms include a cough, difficulty in breathing, fast breathing or wheezing. Infants may experience inability to feed or drink, unconsciousness or convulsions, or worse. Pneumonia is the largest infectious cause of death among children in the world. Shah said exclusive breastfeeding for six months, vitamin A and zinc supplementation and adequate nutrition are the best ways of prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/perform-breathing-exercise-yoga-to-keep-pneumonia-at-bay-doctors/articleshow/87673266.cms||VK Tripathi

And to address this issue, the state health department will hold a special counselling and vaccination drive on Saturday to club it with the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan (PMSMA). Gynaecologist at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Mukta Agarwal, said many of the pregnant women are not even aware that they can take the vaccine. “Nearly eight out of ten women visiting the OPD have not taken the vaccines and majority of them do not know that they can get themselves vaccinated. We then counsel such women at our hospital. All the vaccines given against Covid-19 are safe for pregnant women,” she said, adding that more awareness is needed in this regard. Dr Neelam, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said she had somewhat the same experience as at least 70% of the pregnant women who came for routine check-ups had not been vaccinated. “We counsel them to take the shot,” she said. As per the data available with the health department, there are 30 lakh pregnant women in the state. Though the exact figure of those who have not been vaccinated is not available, officials said the number was huge. State health society additional executive director Animesh Kumar Parashar said to address this issue in particular, the department has planned to use nearly 600 session sites of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyaan (PMSMA) for counselling pregnant women, followed by their vaccination. One day of each month has been fixed for providing health facilities to pregnant women under PMSMA. They are given free antenatal check-up four times during their pregnancy along with counselling on nutrition. This has to be held on 9th of every month, but in case of festival or Sunday, it can be shifted to another day. This month, it is being held on Saturday. “When these women come for availing the health benefits under the PMSMA, they are also counselled regarding Covid-19 vaccine. People have to understand that two lives can be protected with this vaccination,” said Parashar while asking doctors, especially obstetricians and gynaecologist to counsel those who come for treatment. 1 from Vaishali tests Covid +ve: One new Covid-19 case was registered in the state on Friday against 11,43,87 samples tested.

Pahalwan has been nominated as the state president and Kameshwar Singh its general secretary. The former legislator, who was himself a wrestler before stepping into politics, said the sangh office-bearers would identify the old ‘akharas’ across the state and inspire youths to join the organisation, which will hold wrestling practice on a regular basis. The sangh has decided to organise a state-level wrestling championship at Motihari in East Champaran district and later a national event in Madhepura to be attended by some noted wrestlers of the country, he said. “Wrestling is not only good for health, but it also provides an opportunity to show one’s talent at the national level. We will urge the state government to provide jobs to young wrestlers on sports quota to promote the traditional sports,” he told this reporter over phone. He cited a few names like Yogeshwar Dutt, Sushil Kumar, Narsingh Pancham Yadav, Geeta Phogat and Sakshi Malik, who were offered jobs either by the state government or the central government, depending on their choice. “Our idea is to create at least one ‘akhara’ in every village so that youths who waste their time in gossips and other non-productive exercises, practice wrestling on a regular basis. It will be of great help in nation building,” the former minister said. He expressed concern over the sorry state of wrestling, which has been in practice since the Ramayana and the Mahabharata era. The Pahalwan said he would do whatever required to revive wrestling in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/former-dumraon-mla-to-promote-wrestling-in-bihar/articleshow/87673382.cms||Ramashankar
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Patan girl tonsured, shamed for eloping||PALANPUR: A video of a shocking incident of a young woman being tonsured and her face blackened before being paraded in the Vadi mohalla of Harij town in Patan district has sent shock-waves across the state. The video is believed to be a week old, but went viral on social media on Friday. Harij police have arrested at least 17 persons in connection with the incident including a few of the young woman’s family members and neighbours. In the video, the girl is seen sitting on the ground with her hands tied. A man brandishing a pair of scissors is seen chopping off her hair even as she pleads for mercy. Those tormenting the victim are members of her family and also neighbours. In another video of the same incident, some people are seen smearing her face with black ash before being paraded thus in the locality where she lives with her hands still tied. According to Patan district collector, Supreet Singh Gulati, the woman belongs to Vadi community. “The woman was tonsured, her face blackened and she was paraded in the locality where she lived. According to what I could gather, the woman who is engaged to be married to some other person from the community had eloped with her lover. The tonsuring, and blackening of her face was some sort of a purification ritual of the community,” Gulati told TOI. “This is against the law,” Gulati said, adding that a case is being filed and 17 persons have been arrested in connection with the incident. Patan superintendent of police Akshayraj Makwana said that age of the young woman could not be ascertained immediately. “We are trying to get documents with regard to ascertain her age. Based on her age accused will be booked accordingly,” he added. Sources said that the woman had eloped with the man last month and when she returned about a week ago, she was subjected by the community to the “purification ritual”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patan-girl-tonsured-shamed-for-eloping/articleshow/87674178.cms||---

Taking cognizance of the incident, the district education office issued a notice to the school. The stickers were shared in the WhatsApp group of Class I of the Hasteshwar School in the Limkheda taluka of Dahod district. They were allegedly forwarded from a parent’s phone. The act drew a lot of flak in the group and parents informed the school principal as well. The school principal, who was also a member of the group, deleted the stickers. Principal Suresh Jadav said that the stickers were such that anyone who opened them automatically shared them. He added that the parent from whose phone the stickers were being shared was contacted and summoned to the school. Jadav said that the parent claimed that he was out of station. “He said that he had left his phone at a shop to charge it when the stickers were shared,” said Jadav. He pointed out that the parent had claimed that the shopkeeper told him that the phone was used by some youths who had come to the shop. The school has been issued a notice by the district education office. It has been asked to reply to the notice within two days. Jadav said that the WhatsApp group was formed to facilitate online learning for students. “We will now register a complaint so that the truth comes out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/obscenities-shared-on-school-group/articleshow/87674606.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Amid row, fresh order on aided institutions||VIJAYAWADA: Amid protests and controversy over the proposal to withdraw aid to and take over posts in aided educational institutions, the state government on Friday issued fresh orders giving clarity on the issue. The government has proposed another two options for existing aided educational institutions and left the decision to them. The government said the first option is to surrender the aided institution along with its assets and the existing staff to the government, which in turn would make the institution a government one. The second is to surrender the aided posts and the staff to the government while retaining the institution and its assets. This would make the institution a private unaided institution, the government said. The third option is to continue as an aided private institution “as per the existing rules, regulations, grant-in-aid code and other issues. The fourth and the last option is to withdraw the decision that an institution has already given to the government and continue as a private aided institution as per the existing rules and regulations. These two options were given through the GO issued on Friday, following widespread protests across the state from students and the institutions. These two options will give a chance to the institutions to withdraw the consent given earlier and remain as government aided private institutions or private unaided institutions. The state government said that 68.78 per cent of the 2,249 private aided educational institutions, which includes schools, junior and degree colleges and polytechnic colleges, have given their willingness to surrender their staff and the institutions along with assets or just surrender the aided posts and remain private unaided institutions. More than 6,600 aided staff, both teaching and non-teaching, have already reported to the government for absorption, the government said. The government further said that 702 aided institutions have preferred to be government aided private institutions. It asserted that this makes it “evident that there is no coercion on the institutions in any manner” and further added that “the entire process is voluntary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amid-row-fresh-order-on-aided-institutions/articleshow/87673581.cms||Gopi Dara

While more than 1,500 workers resumed services, 826 passengers travelled by ST buses on Friday, officials said. The MSRTC has suspended 2,053 workers so far and this figure could go up if there are more agitations near the depots, sources said. MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said that the corporation had accumulated losses mounting to Rs 12,000 crore, and during the total strike, it lost Rs 15 crore to Rs 20 crore daily. He appealed to workers to resume duties and not put lakhs of commuters to inconvenience. After the second wave of Covid 19, the MSRTC operates 12,500 buses and ferried 25 lakh-plus commuters daily, but due to the strike, bus services had come to a standstill. While talks with government failed, the impasse continued and strike is likely to continue during the weekend, sources said. Officials said they, however, expect more workers to resume duties by Monday morning, helping more buses to operate across Maharashtra. In Mumbai, four buses were operated till Pune and 78 passengers ferried while a bus was operated till Satara. A day earlier, transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab had assured police protection for all workers returning to work and stringent action against those who instruct them while performing their duties. On Friday, Parab said : “I have been meeting workers for the last many days. We have been asking the workers from the beginning to withdraw the strike.” He said, “BJP leaders like Gopichand Padalkar are provoking the workers. They can make whatever allegations they like against me but they should not cause harm to the workers. Ultimately, it is the workers who will suffer.” MNS chief Raj Thackeray met NCP supremo Sharad Pawar to press for the demands of the striking workers. MNS leaders said they were hopeful of a resolution. From Friday, BEST also began bus services to cater to the MSRTC passengers. A BEST bus attached to Worli depot is being operated from Dadar and Panvel, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-some-of-msrtc-staff-back-to-work-36-buses-operate/articleshow/87674902.cms||Somit Sen

The deceased — Puja Chanda — had scribbled a suicide note on her left palm, alleging that her mother-in-law Sheela was responsible for her death. Police said Puja was married to Sanjoy Chandra, who owns a mobile shop in the Tollygunge area, barely a year ago. On Thursday around 7.50pm, Puja was found hanging in her bedroom. “Suicide notes are usually written by the deceased on a paper or readily accessible things such as notebooks, walls or mirrors. Though writing may be found on the body of the deceased, suicide notes in a structured manner written on the palm have not been reported in forensic literature,” said a forensic expert.  Sanjoy and Sheela were arrested. Cops reportedly have evidence the duo used to put pressure on Puja for more dowry. “A case has been registered under IPC section 304B against Sanjoy and Sheela,” said DC (south) Akash Magharia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-writes-suicide-note-on-palm-hangs-self/articleshow/87674449.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||India||To avoid contempt, government, Army say will give permanent commission to 11 women||NEW DELHI: The Centre and the Army on Friday agreed to grant permanent commission to 11 more female officers and also to consider such pleas of other officers with "an open heart and an open mind" after the Supreme Court started dictating an order for holding the Army guilty of contempt of court. At the outset of hearing, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the Centre and the defence ministry, told a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna that an order has been passed to grant permanent commission to 39 out of 71 officers who were earlier denied but it cannot be granted to 11 officers who, along with others, filed a contempt petition in the SC against the Army chief. They submitted that there were adverse findings against them during the relevant period and if they were granted PC then it would lead to a flood of litigation as other officers, including their male counterparts, would seek the same relief. The bench, which is hearing the third round of litigation on PC for female officers, made it clear that it will go by its previous judgments where it had fixed criteria for granting PC. Referring to past adverse remarks against those officers, the bench raised questions on why they were denied permanent commission when they continue to serve the Army. "We are finding that the Army is guilty of contempt and we are going to pass the order. The Army may be supreme in its own authority but the constitutional court is supreme in its jurisdiction. We have given a long rope to you. But you are now in trouble," the bench said and started dictating the order. Sensing the mood of the bench, government lawyers immediately got in touch with the authority concerned, who sprang into action to ward off embarrassment of being held guilty for contempt and immediately communicated instructions to the lawyers. Jain then told the bench, which had by then dictated a couple of paragraphs of the order, that he had got instructions to tell the court that the remaining 11 officers would be granted PC within a week and the pleas of other similarly placed officers would also be considered and an order passed in three weeks. He said that the government has taken a decision by considering the "flow of hearing" in the case. The court then recorded Jain's statement that plea for permanent commission for all female officers will be decided as per the criteria enumerated by the SC in its judgment in March. The court had said that all female officers who have fulfilled the cutoff grade of 60% in the selection board held in September 2020 shall be entitled to PC, subject to their meeting the medical criteria and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance. The court then appreciated the efforts made by Sanjay Jain and R Balasubramanian in resolving the issue. There were 72 officers who were denied PC. One officer subsequently sought premature release from service. Thirty five officers moved a contempt petition in the SC against the Army chief; 21 of them were also granted PC and three were found to be medically unfit and the pleas of 11 petitioners were rejected. The bench also made it clear that PC will also be granted to those female officers who did not approach the court but are eligible as per its March judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-avoid-contempt-government-army-say-will-give-permanent-commission-to-11-women/articleshow/87676039.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Interestingly, those who were handed out IIT admit cards in 2020 will go past its gates for the first time not as freshmen, but now as sophomores after losing a year of campus life purely through force of circumstance. The Powai campus closed after the March 2020 lockdown announcement and will begin in the ensuing semester beginning January 2022 for second- and third-year undergraduate students. Students have to reach the campus in December. All full-time post-graduate students and PhD candidates beyond the first year have already come back to campus. The decision to fully open up was taken at a recent senate meeting where it was felt that damage expected from Covid-19 had certainly waned. First-year undergraduates, almost 1,300 of them, though, will not be called just yet till more hostel rooms are ready to house them to avoid overcrowding. Their campus journey will begin only when student housing pressure eases and an under-construction hostel will be up and available. Officials are hopeful the hostel would open by February which would allow freshmen to join the campus by March. “We have written to all second- and third-year students that we are happy to have them back in December. On their part, they have been eager to come back and we have received emails from many of them who are keen to know the exact return date,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, IIT-B. The electric campus life provides a rich backdrop to the overall IIT engineering path; students consider the memories they make at these residential tech colleges the biggest souvenir they take with them when they graduate. Final-year students were permitted to return to campus two months ago; many are back and others will return by December, well in time for lasses from January 3, 2021. They will follow soft quarantine rules of not going to the mess for meals nor the laboratories for the first week. The unvaccinated few will be quarantined before they can dissolve into campus life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-to-reopen-campus-to-2nd-3rd-year-undergrads-next-month/articleshow/87674145.cms||---

The education office in Pune had issued an order to adjust the remaining vacations in December as students had to report for the NAS survey on November 11 and 12. However, the headmasters’ association in the district and parents had demanded that the vacations be continued after the NAS survey. The education officer issued an order late on Thursday evening about the resumption of vacations from November 13 orders bowing down to the association demands. Secondary education officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, Sunanda Wakhare, issued a notification on Thursday that stated, “The decision to resume the vacations after the NAS survey was taken on Thursday. The five days of the remaining vacation will start from November 13 to 18, while on November 19 there is a public holiday on account of Gurunanak Jayanti whereas November 20 and 21 are the weekend so the schools would reopen directly on November 22.” The headmasters’ association in the district had strongly opposed the notification of cutting down the Diwali vacations and had conveyed to the education office that the schools would continue to follow the state government notifications and reopen schools only after November 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/diwali-vacation-resumes-from-today-till-nov-22-in-pune-district/articleshow/87674098.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Varanasi||City to use municipal waste to produce electricity||Times News Network Varanasi: The holy city of Varanasi is all set to go for the green energy with NTPC support by installing a ‘Waste to Energy’ (WTE) plant to produce electricity by using municipal waste. Varanasi Nagar Nigam has allocated about 20 acres of land at Ramana for setting up the WTE plant. In an endeavour towards sustainable development, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC Ltd, has signed an agreement with Varanasi Nagar Nigam for setting up the WTE plant worth Rs 180 crore. The agreement was signed between NVVN authority and additional municipal commissioner of Varanasi Dushyant Kumar Maurya on Friday. The NTPC spokesperson said that the NVVN has placed the order for engineering procurement construction (EPC) contract work of the plant for a fast execution of the project. The plant will help in mitigating environmental hazards caused by solid waste and bring clean surroundings contributing towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Swachh Bharat. The plant will be a milestone for Varanasi towards Atmanirbhar Bharat using the latest indigenous Make in India technology for solid waste management in the country. The plant with a waste segregation capacity of 600- 800 ton per day will be installed under the project. Further, this waste will be processed and fed into the reactor to produce torrefied charcoal. The torrefied charcoal which is similar to natural coal can be successfully blended with fuel in thermal power plants to produce electricity. The process is environment friendly as the temperature is lower than other technologies, due to which there are no toxic emissions. Recently, NVVN signed a similar agreement with Bhopal Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/city-to-use-municipal-waste-to-produce-electricity/articleshow/87674927.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: IPL matches can’t result in denial of I-T registration to BCCI, holds tax tribunal||MUMBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has scored a sixer in the field of income-tax litigation as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, has held that its registration under section 12A/12AA of the I-T Act cannot be denied. An entity can claim tax exemption in a particular year (if eligible for claim) only if it has a valid registration. Based on recommendations of the Justice R M Lodha Committee, BCCI had amended its memorandum of association, rules and regulations. Thus, while it had an existing registration that was granted in 1996, post-modification of its objectives on August 21, 2018, it sought a fresh registration. The principal commissioner of I-T held that BCCI’s activities as per the amended MOA, read with its rules and regulations, facilitated conducting business for profit by commercial exploitation of cricket through franchisee ownership under the 20-20 IPL format. Keeping in view the surplus generated from IPL matches, she held that BCCI’s activities could not be held as ‘charitable’ and denied the registration. In its appeal before the ITAT, BCCI submitted that the principal commissioner had placed an undue reliance on the surplus generated from conducting IPL matches, without considering its overall activities in a holistic manner. While the denial of the registration was held as legally vitiated based on the technical analysis of the I-T provisions and past judicial precedent, the ancillary observations made by the ITAT bench composed of Pramod Kumar, vice president; and Ravish Sood, judicial member, would gladden the heart of any cricket-lover. The bench viewed that the basic character of the activity of popularising cricket is not lost merely because the operational model of a cricket tournament, whether IPL or any other tournament, is more entertaining or more economically viable. They also noted that the additional funds generated by holding the IPL tournaments are employed for promoting cricket. “Improvising the rules of the game, adding entertainment value to it and making it economically attractive may be a purist’s nightmare, but the same factors can also be viewed as radical and innovative ideas to popularise a game – the very raison détre of an institution like BCCI and this is how we view it.” The ITAT bench finely analysed the various provisions of the I-T Act. They pointed out that by itself, the registration does not grant any tax exemption. The eligibility is determined on a year-to-year basis based on the actual activities of the taxpayer-entity and the exception limits for income from commercial activities that have been carved out. It is not denial of registration, but denial of I-T benefits if income from commercial activities exceed the specific amount, which is the crux of the issue. On this ground, the bench held the denial of registration to BCCI as legally vitiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ipl-matches-cant-result-in-denial-of-i-t-registration-to-bcci-holds-tax-tribunal/articleshow/87674926.cms||Lubna Kably

---||Jaipur||Rise in cotton yarn prices impacts apparel industry||Jaipur: The steep rise in cotton yarn and fabric prices has started impacting the apparel industry. Apparel Exports Promotion Council chairman A Sakthivel, who was in Jaipur, said that the recent growth in apparel exports would be impaired if the runaway rise in yarn and cotton prices are not curbed. Early this month, he has written a letter to textiles minister Piyush Goyal to intervene and take measures to rein in the rise in raw material prices without which there could be shortages as early as February and March next year.“Apparel exports during the April-October have grown by 44% to $8.6 billion. In fact, the shipments have grown by double digit in the past two months. With the peak season approaching, India has the opportunity to leverage good global demand and order position and meet the $20.03 billion export target for 2021-22,” said Sakthivel. However, the uncertainties in the cotton yarn price has created hurdles. The industry is also facing increasing input cost pressure on other fronts. In the letter to the textiles minister, Sakthivel said, “The rise in cotton yarn and fabrics prices have started impacting the entire value chain. Adding to this is the volatile crude oil price, logistics cost, coal addition to the yarn prices, the rising crude oil prices, logistics cost, coal prices, prices of dyeing and chemicals etc which has impacted costing of apparels considerably. Because of this, exporters are not being able to service existing orders and finding it difficult to take new orders.” He urged the minister to consider quantitative restrictions on export of cotton and cotton yarn to bring down galloping prices. “Cotton Corporation of India should be actively involved in managing cotton prices. CCI should also be advised not to increase prices at present as it will impact yarn prices and have a cascading effect across value chain. As a long-term measure, cotton price stabilization fund scheme should be announced,” he said .Sakthivel, which is also the chairman of Apparel Training and Design Centre, said they are in the throes of upgrading the training centers. “Jaipur is one of the main hubs for garment exports. Accordingly, we have started the process of upgrading the centres here,” he said. ATDC is also focusing on upskilling existing employees for enhancing their productivity. Sakthivel said, “The new working committees are putting their best efforts to improve drastically the quality and productivity of the training centres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rise-in-cotton-yarn-prices-impacts-apparel-industry/articleshow/87675491.cms||---

While a portion of the retaining wall had collapsed and fallen on Pudumund Road, a portion of Ooty-Kotagiri stretch had caved in because of the rain. Ramachandran, who inspected both the places in the presence of Nilgiris MP A Raja, Ooty MLA R Ganesh and other officials, also attended the meeting that was convened by the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee at Tamizhagam in Ooty.

---||Goa||En route to Somalia, Amur falcon makes pit stop at Socorro plateau||PANAJI: A dreamy-looking Amur falcon — admired globally for its daring transcontinental migration — perched on a 33KV power line created a flutter at Socorro plateau on Friday, as its arrival is an eagerly-awaited event on Goan birders’ calendar. The small raptor from the falcon family spends just about ten days on some of Goa’s plateaus, but the birders’ happiness quotient soars after they spot the bird on its pit stop. “This individual made a grand entry, inaugurating the newly-replaced 33KV line, and it is a good omen,” said Kunal, secretary for power and environment, in a lighter vein. Savio Fonseca, chief naturalist of a travel company, said that “At Socorro, (the falcon) does a pit stop, gorging on the proteins provided by caterpillars on the grasses there before making an incredible non-stop flight of eight days over the ocean to Somalia”. The individual sighted at Socorro — the slight delay may be due to the extended rainy season — is one of the first to arrive in the state. Kunal, who is also state election commissioner, had gone bird watching with some birders on Friday morning. “Our power lines are favoured perching spots for the avian population, where they can rest or bask in the sun for birders to click excellent photos,” he said. This raptor breeds in parts of Siberia and China, as also near the sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan. Its migration is stuff of legend, as it flies to India and over the Arabian Sea to spend the winter in south and east Africa. Unlike many other birds that fly long-distance for migration, Amur falcons traverse diagonally across the globe, instead of the usual north-south direction. This indicates that it apparently relies on wind direction and magnetic field for navigation. In India, they hop down on plateau areas, and in 2014, the massacre of 14,000 of these beautiful birds in Nagaland sparked outrage across the world. Now, certain areas have been turned into safe breeding grounds for these falcons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/en-route-to-somalia-amur-falcon-makes-pit-stop-at-socorro-plateau/articleshow/87674880.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Aurangabad||No vaccination, no benefits for varsity staff: Maharashtra minister||AURANGABAD: Minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant said on Friday that they have made vaccination “strict” in the universities, and teachers, professors and non-teaching staff should take both doses of the vaccine or else they may not be given any “benefits”. He said such a decision was taken as students have been asked to get the vaccine as well. When asked whether the salaries too would be affected, Samant said that the vice-chancellors have been asked to take a call about which benefits should be withheld. The VCs have been asked to serve notice and give the staff 15 days to respond. “If they do not respond, the VC will take a call. We may have to take that decision too. It is not that I have a personal benefit in the teachers getting vaccinated,” he said. Samant made the statement on Friday during his visit of Aurangabad. Speaking to the media, he said, “Vaccination has been made mandatory for all the teachers, professors, principals, or else all of their benefits will be stopped.” He added that while they were “asking all the students to get vaccinated and if the students question about the teachers not being vaccinated, we will not have any answer.” He even warned the teachers’ associations unwilling to get vaccinated. Samant said, “Certain teacher associations citing that they are imparting online education, are unwilling to get vaccinated. No one will be allowed to do it. All the professors, academic staff, non-teaching staff, principals will have to take both the doses.” 8,000 vacancies to be filledMinister for higher and technical education Uday Samant said they would be filling vacancies of 8,000 professors in another seven months. “The state has approved recruitment of professors and principals. In the first phase, 2,088 posts will be filled. Old pension scheme will be implemented for 5,000 professors,” said Samant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-vax-no-salary-for-varsity-staff-minister/articleshow/87672531.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nashik||Mumbai: No vax, no benefits, Samant tells teachers; Bhujbal warns Nashik||Aurangabad/Nashik: In a bid to push inoculation, the authorities are widening the vaccine mandate and talking tough. On Friday, two ministers pitched in: higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said ‘benefits’ may be stopped for unvaccinated teachers and non-teaching staff while Nashik guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal warned of no ration or LPG soon in the district for those who have not taken even one shot. Speaking at Aurangabad, Samant said: “Vaccination has been made mandatory for all teachers, professors, principals or else all of their benefits will be stopped.” He reasoned that after “asking all the students to get vaccinated, if they question about the teachers not being vaccinated, we will not have any answer”. Asked if salaries too would be affected, Samant said vice-chancellors have been asked to take a call. The VCs have been asked to serve notice and give the staff 15 days to respond. “If they do not, the VC will take a call. We may have to take that decision too,” he said. “Citing that they are imparting online education, some teacher associations are unwilling to get vaccinated. All professors, academic staff, non-teaching staff, principals have to take both the doses,” said Samant. After a Covid reviewing meeting in Nashik on Friday, Bhujbal said the district administration would monitor the pace of vaccination for the next 8-10 days. If it remains sluggish, those who have not taken even one shot would be denied food grains distributed through public distribution system (PDS) shops and LPG cylinders. Bhujbal’s instructions are similar to the one recently adopted by the Aurangabad collector. There are 51 lakh eligible residents in Nashik. “Around 16 lakh beneficiaries have not even taken the first dose. There is a need to improve the coverage,” he said, expressing concern over the low coverage in Malegaon. The attitude is spreading. The Kolhapur zilla parishad has asked all gram panchayats to read out the names of all unvaccinated villagers during the gram sabha scheduled for Tuesday. Several panchayats have decided to put names of such villagers on walls to name and shame them. “We have set a deadline of November 20 to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries,” said Sanjaysinha Chavan, the Kolhapur ZP CEO. So far, 85% of those eligible have got the first dose and 42% are fully vaccinated in the district. The gram panchayat of Pathurdi, a village of around 1,200 people in Solapur district, has decided not to supply ration to the families that have unvaccinated members. “Instead of forcing people, the authorities should try mass counselling by conducting workshops to do away with the fear about vaccination,” said Sanjay Ghatage, a vaccination activist.

---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: BJP sharpens attack on Congress, SP on Hindutva & Jinnah||VARANASI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday sharpened attack on the Congress on the issue of its senior leaders Salman Khurshid and Rashid Alvi allegedly deriding Hindutva and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and his alliance partner Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar for praising Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The BJP attack was launched by deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, who were in the city on Friday to take part in the BJP poll managers meeting for the 2022 UP election. “This is the real face of those who turn ‘bhakts’ (devout) and start visiting temples during elections.. they have now been exposed,” they said while talking to reporters. Maurya targetted Congress leader Salman Khurshid for reportedly comparing Hindutva with jihadist Islam and terror groups like Islamic State and Boko Haram in his recently released book. “The quotes in his (Khurshid’s) book have insulted the national Hindu organisations, hence they should be removed from his book. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, ‘janeu’ wearing Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who presents herself as a priest, have not uttered even a single word in this episode in the past three days. Their silence is not correct.” Reacting to Khurshid’s book and Alvi’s remarks, Sharma said, “Some seasonal ‘Rambhakts’ have emerged recently. One of them chanted ‘Ram naam’ after wearing a ‘Ramnaami’ (stole). But, now they have returned to their old tricks. Those who termed Ramsetu as imaginary, could never be the Rambhakts. By their statements, they have made it clear to whom they are loyal." Senior Congress leader Alvi had recently said that all those raising the slogan of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ are not saints, citing a demon from the Ramayana and urging people to stay alert. Maurya also took up the issue of Akhilesh bracketing Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel and Rajbhar claiming that the partition of India could have been avoided had Jinnah been made the first PM. “It is too late. Jinnah is buried and now he will not come to help them,” he said. Sharma said, “Their Jinnahism and Talibani approach is not going to work in state politics as days of appeasement with the help of this ideology are over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjp-sharpens-attack-on-cong-sp-on-hindutva-jinnah/articleshow/87674935.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Varanasi||Objective of rath yatra is to bring change in the UP govt: Shivpal Yadav||Gorakhpur: People are very upset in the Bharatiya Janata Party government as they are facing many problems, said the president of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohiya) Shivpal Yadav while addressing a press conference in Gorakhpur on Friday. Shivapla Yadav is carrying out a Samajik Parivartan Rath Yatra in Uttar Pradesh. He said that the objective of this ‘Rath Yatra’ is to bring change in the government in Uttar Pradesh as it has become necessary. “People are facing challenges of inflation and unemployment. All the sectors of society are upset with the present government including farmers and people in power are not listening to the voice of people. Farmers are being harassed and they will become labourers instead of masters and the BJP is continuously telling lies. The party and the government are losing people’s faith and they are not fulfilling the promises,” he said. On law and order situation in the state, Shivpal said that crime is at prime and cases of murders, loot and corruption have become common. “ BJP promised that it will end corruption in 100 days while the corruption has increased in the state,” he said. On inflation and power supply, he said, “Prices of petrol, diesel and basic amenities have increased and people are not able to manage their household budget. Gorakhpur gets 24-hour power supply as it is Yogi Adityanath’s district but other districts are not getting regular power supply.” He repeated that his party will have alliance with the Samajwadi Party with conditions and in case the alliance does not materialises, they will join hands with small parties and also a big national party but not with the BJP. “I told Akhilesh that my party wants alliance with the SP but we want tickets. I have worked with Netaji Mulayam Singh Yadav for 40-45 years and my share in the SP can’t be denied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/objective-of-rath-yatra-is-to-bring-change-in-the-up-govt-shivpal-yadav/articleshow/87674944.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Inclusive Hinduism does not need divisive Hindutva: Rahul Gandhi||Nagpur/Wardha: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said Hinduism as Hindu religion was different from the Hindutva ideology practiced by the RSS, as he added that the latter was about killing innocent minorities. He urged the party workers to discuss and learn about these issues, which will help eclipse the hate that appears dominant in present times. The divisive policy of RSS and BJP has overshadowed that of the Congress, but has not finished it off, said Gandhi at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) orientation camp at Sewagram, which he addressed via video conference. Gandhi said through training every Congress worker must be empowered to propagate the all inclusive ideology of the grand old party. “They are able to overshadow us because of two things. One is our own failure to propagate the party’s ideology, and second is the complete control of BJP over media and the nation,” said Gandhi. He explained the Congress followed India’s cultural values of thousands of years, and Hinduism and Hindutva were very different, “Why do Hindus need Hindutva when they follow Hinduism ….Is Hinduism about beating a Sikh or a Muslim person? No. But Hindutva is. Is Hinduism about killing Akhlaq? I have read the Upanishads and nowhere is it written to kill an innocent man. But I can see it in Hindutva. Our orientation comes from Lord Shiva, Kabir, Guru Nanak to Mahatma Gandhi. We stand for what they stood for in their times,” he said. “It is a simple logic - if you are a Hindu, then why do you need Hindutva? Why do you need this new name?” he asked. Rahul said the RSS ideology has spread hate in the country and overshadowed the loving and nationalistic ideology of Congress. “The moment we crystallise our ideology, we will envelope the RSS. Just like Lord Shiva used to swallow the world, the Congress ideology will make the BJP’s ideology of hate disappear,” he said. He added that through training, every Congress worker can be made aware of the long history of Congress’ ideology, which has it roots in India’s origin. “Actually, we have started calling it Congress ideology, but it has been part of our culture for thousands of years. We do not differentiate between people based on their caste, religion etc. And it’s this ideology which became that of the Congress too,” said Gandhi. He said every Congress worker, senior leaders and ordinary workers alike, must undergo training to be empowered with information. “Congress workers should be completely aware of issues of national interest, safety and security like terrorism, Article 370, nationality. Only when they are aware, will they reach out to the people and explain the party’s stand on the issue to them. Training had become optional in the Congress, but I think that has to change,” said Gandhi. AICC’s training in-charge Sachin Rao said, “In our over 100 year history, Congress has shown the path of Swaraj and Sarvodaya. But today these two and the Constitution are under attack from forces of fascism that believe in the rise of only a few people. It’s also under attack from some narrow minded regional forces, which are trying to divide the politics of the country.” Sunil Kedar, guardian minister of Wardha, where the camp for some 140 participants is being organized, said, “We want an India where everyone must feel secure and safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/inclusive-hinduism-does-not-need-divisive-hindutva-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/87675505.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Another case of cheating lodged against Kiran Gosavi||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Thursday registered a case against Kiran Gosavi, the NCB witness in the cruise drug bust case involving Aryan Khan, after a 33-year-old Bhosari resident lodged a complaint accusing Gosavi of cheating him of Rs 2.25 lakh in 2015 over a promise to give him a job in Brunei. Assistant inspector Gokul Mahajan of the Bhosari police told TOI, “In 2015, the complainant had given a part of the total money to Gosavi at his office in Thane, some amount in Bhosari and the rest through online transfers. When he did not get the job, the complainant asked Gosavi to refund his money, which he never did. Recently, the complainant came across the news of Gosavi’s arrest for carrying out similar crimes. He then came to us on Thursday.” The Pune police have registered three cases against Gosavi with the Faraskhana, Cantonment and Wanowrie police stations. The first case of cheating was registered against him in Faraskhana in 2018. He was evading arrest since then. The police swung into action after a selfie of Gosavi with actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan during the cruise drug bust went viral on social media. He was arrested on October 29 and is still in judicial custody. Mahajan said that in 2015, the complainant had received an email from Gosavi’s office seeking his resume. “After the complainant sent across his resume, Gosavi promised him a job in Brunei. He took Rs 2.25 lakh from the complainant in cash and also through online modes and then duped him,” Mahajan said. “We will seek Gosavi’s custody from the court to probe into whether or not he has duped others too using the same modus,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/another-cheating-case-against-gosavi/articleshow/87674121.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In Mumbai, Delta & derivatives dominate, vaccination cuts hospitalisation need||MUMBAI: Delta and its descendants continued to be the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulating in Mumbai, according to the fourth gene sequencing exercise conducted since August. The results, announced by BMC on Friday, showed 75% of the tested samples contained the Delta variant and the remaining were Delta derivatives. Correlating the genomic results with clinical symptoms, BMC doctors said both Delta and its derivatives seemed only “mildly invasive”. “As compared to Delta, the derivative infection and transmissions seem milder,” said a doctor. Vaccination made a difference, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Of the 281 samples, only eight who took the first dose and 21 fully vaccinated people needed hospitalisation as against 69 unvaccinated. There were no deaths in the vaccinated group, and the unvaccinated had four deaths. “There are no new variants of concern in Mumbai or any Indian states. We now have to concentrate on achieving zero Covid deaths,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state Covid task force. The possibility of a third wave in the absence of a new variant of concern appears distant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-mumbai-city-delta-derivatives-dominate-vax-cuts-hosp-need/articleshow/87674968.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sikar girl drugs parents, runs away with Rs 70,000||JAIPUR: A 19-year-old girl decamped with Rs 70,000 from her Piproli Road-situated house under Udyog Nagar police station area of Sikar. Before leaving the house, the girl served sleeping pills-laced dinner to her parents who fell unconscious and were stunned to know about the incident later. According to police, the incident took place late on Wednesday, when the girl, identified as Anita Kumawat, served food to her parents. “It appears that the girl had planned to run away from the house as her parents fell unconscious after having dinner. Thereafter, the girl must have checked the safes in the house and took the money out. The incident came to light when the girl’s father woke up the next day and found various safes in the house open,” said a senior officer of Udyog Nagar police station on Friday. Heera Lal Kumawat, the father of the girl, initially attempted to find his missing daughter. “Initially, they had no idea about the missing money from their house as they kept enquiring about their missing daughter from their relatives. Finally, when they realised that the girl went missing along with the money, they lodged a case,” said the officer. Police said that the mobile phone of the girl is also switched off after the incident. “Prima facie, it appears that she single-handedly carried out the act. Still, we are probing other angles to find out if anybody else also helped the girl in the crime,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sikar-girl-drugs-parents-runs-away-with-rs-70k/articleshow/87675501.cms||---

---||India||Space diplomacy: Isro preparing to launch nano satellite for Bhutan||Bengaluru: As part of New Delhi’s space diplomacy, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is preparing to launch a nano satellite built by engineers from the neighbouring country with the help of Indian scientists in the second PSLV mission that’s in the pipeline. As reported by TOI earlier, Isro has in its pipeline three Earth Observations Satellites (EOSs): Two of them — EOS-4 (Risat-1A) and EOS-6 (Oceansat-3) — will be launched using Isro’s workhorse PSLV and the third one, EOS-2 (Microsat), will be launched in the first developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV). Confirmations are now available that the space agency is preparing to launch the satellite for Bhutan — BhutanSat — in the second PSLV mission that will have Oceansat-3 as the main payload. Other than these two satellites, the mission will also put into orbit India’s first private Earth Imaging satellite developed by Bengaluru-based Pixxel. Isro chairman K Sivan said: “This is India’s gift to Bhutan as part of the space diplomacy initiatives put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We’re helping their personnel to build the nano satellite which will be used for imaging purposes. It will be launched on the PSLV carrying EOS-6. The mission will also launch the Pixxel satellite.” Launch progressWhile Isro hopes to achieve the launch of all three EOS missions in the last quarter of 2021, multiple issues, including disruptions caused by weather, may impact the internal deadlines set by the agency. “The integration of the PSLV had begun at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC-SHAR) in Sriharikota but had to be suspended as some glitches were found with the satellite (Risat-1A). It will resume soon as the problem with the satellite will be resolved,” a senior scientist from Isro headquarters told TOI. Therefore, another scientist said, the launch of BhutanSat may stretch to early next year. However, as per internal deadlines, Isro is looking to launch it by December. Further, the launch of Risat-1A would also mark the beginning of a new model for Isro as intended by the space reforms initiated by the Centre. Earlier, Isro had a supply-driven model. That is, after Isro made a satellite, it offered it to ministries and government agencies. The three satellites that the space agency is planning to launch are meant for ministries like agriculture, home affairs, earth sciences and environment and forests. Unlike communication satellites where the entire capacity could be demanded by one customer, a single Earth observation satellite can simultaneously cater to multiple customers as the data generated by these satellites can be analysed for different uses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/space-diplomacy-isro-preparing-to-launch-nano-sat-for-bhutan/articleshow/87676061.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Bhambri targets Australian Open qualies||Bengaluru: The 2019 and 2020 tennis seasons swept past Yuki Bhambri, who was laid low by tendonitis, both knees.Bhambri returned to competition in late February, playing two ATP Tour events, where he did well for one who had spent the previous 28 months weighing medical options. Just when he appeared to be logging a run of tournaments, he tested positive for Covid-19 in Orlando, Florida, where he was to play a Challenger. That was in April.Bhambri may have beaten the virus with a negative test, but his right knee hurt again. It was the same ache that had forced him to pack away his Babolat Pure Drive sticks for two years. The 29-year-old’s career, which had once promised much, appeared to be taking a shine for the vanishing act. Bhambri, a former world No. 1 junior and silver medallist at the Youth Olympic Games, wasn’t sure what exactly the pain in his right knee was. Was it the virus talking a foreign language or was it the tendonitis acting up again? “I went back the same route (as in 2019 and 20) to find a solution, I consulted with a number of doctors in the US,” said Bhambri, who also sought out fellow players, including South African Kevin Anderson, whose right knee went under the knife twice in the last two years. “I had a surgery finally, a mini intervention,” Bhambri said of his 2021 summer. “That was in North Carolina. I feel better from it. At first, the recovery from Covid was hard, you lose endurance. I was dropping to the floor out-of-breath after an eight-minute jog. Slowly I worked my way back from there.” Bhambri, whose singles ranking, not surprisingly, has dropped to 1035, returned with his injury protected ranking of No. 100 in February, which was where he was when he had to cut his 2018 season short. A player is eligible to keep the injury protected ranking for 12 tournaments, and the Indian played two events in February and March at No. 100, before requesting for another ‘freeze’. Bhambri, who won the junior Australian Open crown 13 years ago, returns to competition at the Australian Open (qualifying) in Melbourne in January.For two years -- 2019 and Covid ravaged 2020 – Bhambri waited his turn, patiently working his way through 20 doctors, in different continents. He then settled on injections (platelet-rich plasma and stem cell), eight in all, swinging between rest and rehab. Every few weeks he came up against the wall of doubt, wondering if he was doing the right thing. “I would ask myself, is it going to work, is it ever going to work? You don’t see improvements on a daily basis, so naturally you find yourself confronted by doubts,” he said, adding that chats with fellow pros like Serb Janko Tipsarevic, ranked in the top-10 ten years ago, and who between 2014 and 2017 underwent seven surgeries, twice on his right knee, helped him focus on recovery.In his time away, Bhambri learnt that it was actually only his right knee that was the problem, the left was hurting only because he was overcompensating by literally playing on one leg.“Because of Covid restrictions, I didn’t have to rush back, I had a lot of time to practice because of which I was able to do well in my first two Tour events,” Bhambri said of coming through the qualifiers in the Dubai Duty Free where he beat Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Ramkumar Ramanathan in back-to-back matches. “The risky decision to play big tournaments paid off, these results showed me where my game was, you know you have a certain level. I know my game is not lacking. Which will help at the Australian Open qualies.”Bhambri, who has until August 2022 to complete his quota of 10 more tournaments with the protected ranking, is looking to playing more on the Tour next year. “Australia will be a good test, the two-three months after will be a good test. If I can get through it without issues, I would consider myself back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bhambri-targets-australian-open-qualies/articleshow/87676063.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Reid looks to instil team-first attitude||Bengaluru: The past few months have been a roller-coaster ride for Indian hockey. The men’s team’s bronze medal-winning feat coupled with the women’s fourth-place finish has pushed the sport into the limelight. While the dust settles on their achievements, the Vivek Sagar Prasad-led junior men’s team will look to ride on the crest of the seniors’ success and defend the junior world Cup title won in 2016.But in these uncertain times, the road to success has many challenges and the Indian team is gearing up to overcome them as the junior hockey extravaganza gets under way in Bhubaneswar on November 24.With an eye on regaining the trophy, senior men’s team chief coach Graham Reid has been roped in to put the finishing touches to the team’s groundwork. Reid has been working with the junior squad for the past month and moved to Bhubaneswar — where the team has gathered for acclimatisation — last week.While the team has been a work in progress over the past two years with BJ Kariappa at the helm, the lack of international match exposure due to the pandemic has been a dampener. But Reid believes that in the given circumstances, the team is well prepared, especially with match practice having been against their senior counterparts.“They had practice games against senior boys before the team left for Tokyo which was valuable for both the teams. In the camp in Bengaluru recently, they played against each other again and the junior boys have been performing well. Also, the senior camp will move here next week. We will be able to play more practice matches against them.” explained the Australian during a virtual press conference on Friday.In the short span that he has been with the team, Reid admitted that he can’t change much in terms of their game, but is working more as a relationship coach.“It’s more icing on the cake rather than having to rebuild anything. Togetherness and team first are very important. Those are things which can be added. In the last month I have been (more like) a relationship coach as relationships with the players are important especially when the chips are down, those things can come to the fore,” he said.Reid also pointed out that since Kariappa spent time assisting him in the senior camp during the pandemic, the juniors have imbibed the work ethics well. “Kariappa spent a lot of time with the senior group during the Covid situation. A lot of the exercise, drills and terminology we use has already trickled down to the junior group in the past year.”Given the team has been training in isolation for a long time, the players have made good use of the span to brush up their English, through classes held at the SAI, Bengaluru premises. Also, a psychologist has been working with the unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/reid-looks-to-instil-team-first-attitude/articleshow/87676066.cms||Manuja Veerappa

He had set a target of winning over 300 seats again in the 2022 UP assembly elections at a recent meet with BJP leaders in Lucknow. Earlier, Shah reached Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi on a two-day visit to a warm welcome with thousands of hoardings greeting him. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Union education minister and in-charge for UP election Dharmendra Pradhan, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, BJP state president Swatantrata Dev Singh and other leaders welcomed Shah at LBSI Airport. From the airport, Shah reached BHU helipad by chopper and garlanded the statue of varsity founder Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya at the university’s main gate in Lanka area. He then reached the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre to participate in the meeting. The party functionaries who attended the crucial meet included in-charges of all 403 assembly constituencies of the states besides the district and regional level leaders. The BJP has roped in over 50 lakh party workers from booth level upto the state unit for making preparations for the 1.63 lakh polling booths in the state. Not only this, the party will also complete all the preparatory work at the organisational level, including meetings upto the level of ‘panna pramukh’ (voter list page in-charges) by November-end. Party national chief JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh will address the booth committees presidents on November 22 and 25. These details were tabled by the Party’s state organising secretary Sunil Bansal before Shah and in-charge for UP and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and many other leaders at the meeting of party’s poll managers. Bansal also collected details of the poll preparation related exercises from the party presidents of Kashi, Gorakhpur, Awadh, Kanpur, West and Braj region units in the initial session of the meeting, in which in-charges of 403 assembly areas were present. He said, “Currently, over 50 lakh workers are busy in poll preparations of BJP in UP. The data of 49 lakh workers has also been compiled at the state office. The work of formation of committees for each of the 1,63,000 booths and 27,800 Shakti Kendras, which look after multiple booth committees, have also been completed.” “The party will hold the convention of booth committee presidents of Gorakhpur and Kanpur region units on November 22. It will be addressed by the national president. The defence minister will address similar conventions for Awadh and Kashi regional units at Sitapur and Jaunpur on November 25. On the same day, Shah will be addressing the convention of such committees of West and Braj regional units. The conventions of booth level committees and in-charges, divisional units, in-charges of ‘shakti kendras’ and ‘panna pramukh’ will also be conducted by November-end,” Bansal said. Bansal called upon the party cadres to take part in voter list revision process at each booth on November 21 and 27 and also in the on-going membership drive launched by Shah on October 29. The regional units were also assigned the task of holding conventions of teachers, ex-servicemen, lawyers, chaupals of women and labourers. Earlier, mobilising the assembly area in-charges and office-bearers from 98 district units, the party’s in-charge for UP Radhe Mohan Singh said that the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi government for the poor, needy, deprived, Dalits and backwards apart from common man is being positively debated everywhere. The same work done for social welfare should be utilised to woo the voters. He appealed to the partymen to change their daily routine as per the need of the party during election time to dedicate them for executing the programmes prepared by the organisation. Apart from Shah, Pradhan and Yogi, Union minister Anurag Thakur, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present on the dais. Many other Union and UP ministers and leaders, including Annapurna Devi, Shoba Karandalaje, Saroj Pandey, Arjunram Meghwal, Capt Abhimanyu Singh, Vivek Thakur, Sunil Oza, Sudhir Gupta, Pankaj Singh, Subrat Pathak and Mahesh Chand Srivastava were also present. It is Shah’s second visit to the state within a fortnight. Earlier on October 29, he had launched a BJP membership drive in the state capital and made it clear that Adityanath would be the party's chief ministerial face in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/shah-exhorts-party-cadres-to-improve-bjp-tally-in-2022-up-assembly-polls/articleshow/87674951.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

While addressing a meeting with in-charges of 403 assembly segments and office-bearers of 98 district and six regional units of party at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre’s auditorium here on Friday, Shah made the cadres aware about the depth of their responsibilities, asking them to “go in field with the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who gave fearless and corruption free governance to the country and state”. Giving this information, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh briefed the media about the proceedings of the closed-door meeting which was out of bounds for the reporters. Shah, who ensured landmark victories for the party in 2014 and 2019 parliamentary and 2017 UP elections, made the cadres aware about the depth of their responsibilities. He asked them to go in the field with the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who gave fearless and corruption free governance to the country and state, Singh added. There are over 100 schemes and programmes, which the Modi and Yogi governments introduced for the welfare of the poor, Singh said adding, crores of people had been benefited with housing, clean toilets, tap water, LPG, power connections, medical, ration, bank account and others. Those who taunted that date of Ram temple in Ayodhya would not be told, had witnessed its foundation laying by PM while a grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) is about to be completed, Singh told the reporters adding that due to the clear vision and intention, the country and state are on the path of development. On the basis of achievements and strength of party workers, the BJP will go among people to seek their blessing and win again in 2022, Singh further said. He said that a decision on the proposals given by people at state level to join BJP was also taken during the meet.

Goa forest department has received approval from the national Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to establish automated weather monitoring systems in the state’s wildlife sanctuaries. These are expected to help assess the short-term and long-term impact of climate change in the state’s protected areas. “The automatic weather stations will be set up in each of Goa’s wildlife sanctuaries to study the short-term and long-term impact of climate change on biodiversity of the state’s protected areas. The stations will be established in association with India meteorology department (IMD),” additional principal chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar told TOI. The weather stations being set up in each wildlife sanctuary will cost approximately Rs 20 to 25 lakh. “IMD at present only has weather stations in urban areas and not in remote areas or forests. These stations will help us record the weather in forests, sanctuary areas and study the impact of climate change there,” Kumar said. The executive council of CAMPA, under the Union environment ministry, has decided to recommend the proposal for approval of the governing body, with the condition that the central climate change division will vet the proposal ‘to ensure synergy’. Funds set aside for Goa under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016, will be utilised for the project. Recently, Goa prepared its state action plan for climate change (SAPCC), where the report warns of possible adverse impact on the state’s forests if mitigation measures are not put in place to combat climate change. The report has already rung the alarm bell that the state’s temperatures will rise by over 2 degrees Celsius in less than 15 years. As a result, the SAPCC warned of an increase in forest fires in Goa in the coming years. “Forest fire is a phenomenon that can intensify due to climate change,” the SAPCC said. “Although enough documented proof is not available on whether forest fire incidents have increased in Goa due to climate change or human activities, the trend depicts the vulnerability of Goa’s forests to fires, and this can get exasperated due to climate change by 2040.” When the SAPCC was being prepared, 92 forest fires were reported in 2016-17, notes the report, as compared to only two or four fires during the previous years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weather-monitoring-stations-in-goas-sanctuaries-soon-to-combat-climate-change/articleshow/87675007.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Telangana high court to university||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday sought to know from Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) whether it was willing to conduct a second supplementary exam for MBBS first year students who failed their annual and instant examinations. Justice B Vijaysen Reddy was hearing petitions filed by aggrieved MBBS students and parents who were contending university did not adhere to pattern of exam as was mandated by new regulations of National Medical Commission (NMC) from 2019. Students’ counsel Unnam Muralidhar Rao urged court to direct varsity to conduct special supplementary exams. “They have already lost one year due to pandemic. Though NMC guidelines prescribe multiple choice questions, the university eliminated this section and gave only descriptive ones,” he said. The counsel said students know they were studying a serious subject like medicine and hence were not seeking grace marks. “We are asking for a special supplementary exam,” he said. Appearing for the varsity, additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao said the NMC allowed universities some autonomy in fixing exam patterns. The judge asked him to verify if the varisty could accommodate students because when the entire world was crippled by the pandemic and was granting exemptions, there was no point why students should be left out, particularly when they were seeking only an exam. “We know of instances where medical colleges gave up even practical exams for PG medicine students during the peak of Covid-19,” Justice Vijaysen said. The judge gave KNRUHS till November 15 to convey its stand and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cant-you-hold-2nd-exam-hc-to-univ/articleshow/87674167.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Kanpur||IIT-K develops robust, self-sustained mechanism to check health of river Ganga||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: To study the impact of environmental changes on the riverine ecosystem, IIT-Kanpur has developed an aquatic autonomous observatory named ‘Niracara Svayamsasita Vedh Shala (NSVS) for monitoring real time data transmission and web-based visualization of river Ganga. The NSVS system was inaugurated by Prof. A R. Harish, dean, Research and Development, IIT-Kanpur at the Laxman ghat of Bithoor on October 31. The project is being implemented by a team of earth scientists, mechanical, electrical, and aerospace engineers from IIT-Kanpur, led by Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya as the principal investigator. IIT-Kanpur’s NSVS system is developed as a low-cost, multi-parameter, water quality monitoring platform that would consist of an array of sensors and auto sampler placed on a stationary platform which is semi-submersible, all-weather, robust, and perfectly stable. Prof. Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-Kanpur said, “Ganga is not just a river but a cultural heritage for us, and, therefore, it is our responsibility to save it from all harms. IIT-Kanpur has been doing rigorous research and developing various mechanisms to study the ecosystem of Ganga and the impact of climate change on it. I congratulate the team led by Prof. Bishakh Bhattacharya on the inauguration of the NSVS system, which will ensure real-time, in-situ monitoring of Ganga to ensure its good health.” In its current capacity, the NSVS system can sense three important parameters, namely, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen capacity of water. This can be further utilized to estimate Total Dissolved Solid (TDS), specific gravity and presence of metallic ions in water. The system autonomously collects the data every fifteen minutes and reports it through a wireless network to the institute. For self-sustenance, the platform is equipped with energy harvesting systems consisting of solar cells and a unique Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) system which can extract energy from the flow of river. The system has an open platform architecture such that other institutes developing sensors may integrate it with the IITK system in a collaborative mode. This development is in line with the belief that in the Indian Subcontinent, cleaning and rejuvenating the health of Ganga ecosystem is the focal point, which is often marred by some major challenges including inadequate skilled manpower, poor time-series resolution, integrated data fusion and on-demand water sampling capacity. The project has been jointly sponsored by the department of science and technology, Government of India and IUSSTF- Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum. The IIT-Kanpur has also recently launched a ‘Ganga Atlas’ and a workflow that allows users to process and analyse declassified imagery of riverine environments at minimal cost, using open-source software. Earlier, IIT-Kanpur did research on the high resilience of dissolved heavy metals in Ganga, impact of immersion of dead bodies in the river and held a roundtable discussion on the rejuvenation of rivulets in the Ganga basin; among other initiatives. In its continuous effort to tackle climate change in India, IIT-Kanpur has also signed an MoU with the Delhi government to check Delhi’s air pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-develops-robust-self-sustained-mechanism-to-check-health-of-river-ganga/articleshow/87675004.cms||---

The signing took place in Glasgow at United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26). The state EV policy, approved in July, aims to have a 10% share of electric vehicles in registrations by 2025. It targets conversion of 15% of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fleet into electric by 2025. The policy provides fiscal incentives for EV buyers and for manufacturers along with subsidies for creation of charging infrastructure. The state government said RMI is a 40-year-old non-profit working on clean energy transitions globally. “In Maharashtra, RMI has been engaging with Pune through its City EV Accelerator platform to make Pune EV-ready. We look forward to further our partnership on electric mobility, ZEV, hydrogen fuel and decarbonisation our transport sector and urban renewal sector,” said state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray at the signing of the MoU. Highlighting the need to mobilize climate finance, CEO of RMI Jule Kortenhorst said, “Maharashtra is showing leadership for climate action by sub-national governments. The size and scale of economic growth in the state provides it the unique opportunity to leapfrog to clean and modern energy systems and be the role model for sub-national governments, not only in India, but globally.” Thackeray was invited by UNFCCC high-level champions for a one-on-one chat with First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, who “commended the sheer scale at which Maharashtra government is working to decarbonise the state”. The minister emphasized that it will be up to administrative officers and elected representatives to lead and inspire sustainable development for Maharashtra. He said Maharashtra Council for Climate Change will convene to chart out a decarbonisation pathway for the state, under the chairmanship of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. “Climate is karma, it will do to you what you do to the planet. It will not discriminate between developing and developed. It will hit us all regardless of who or where we are,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-signs-mou-with-us-org-for-ev-policy-tech-support/articleshow/87674206.cms||Manka Behl

Reacting to Rahul seeking to draw a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva in the context of the controversy over his colleague Salman Khurshid’s book, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said Rahul’s remarks were part of a pattern where his senior colleagues Digvijaya Singh and Mani Shankar Aiyer have been using terms like “Hindu Taliban” , “Hindu Pakistan” and “Hindu terror” to denigrate the faith and culture of the majority community. “It is not coincidence, but part of a project,” Patra said. “While clarifying about Salman Khurshid’s book, Rahul Gandhi attacked Hinduism and Hindutva. Rahul has a history of making critical comments about Hinduism and its culture. It is in the character of Congress and the Gandhi family to attack Hinduism at every opportunity,” Patra said. Khurshid has in his book likened Hindutva to dreaded jehadi outfits like Islamic State and Boko Haram. “What Congress leaders say is not a coincidence but an experiment. And the headmaster of this experimental lab is Rahul Gandhi,” Patra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-has-a-pathological-hatred-for-hindus-bjp/articleshow/87676094.cms||---

After checking on the ground, the team found that out of total 50 sensor based AQI machines, only 33 machines are functional. The ICCC set-up has installed 50 high quality sensor-based air quality monitoring machines and equipment at various locations of the city. Divisional commissioner Raj Shekhar, heading the team, reviewed all the air quality monitoring systems of ICCC in detail and held a meeting in this regard. The meeting was attended by CEO of the Smart City Shiv Sharanappa, additional CEO PK Tripathi, nodal officer of the Smart City and the pollution control board officer. After the review meeting, the commissioner made a random visit to the two sites—Jareeb Chowki and Coca Cola crossing--check the ground situation, and found that only 33 out of total 50 sensor-based AQI machines were functional. The authorities informed him that the rest of the machines are under repair because of Metro and other road construction works. Later, he directed the CEO to get repaired and replaced 17 sensors in 15 days in coordination with Kanpur Metro and the PWD. Taking serious note that regular reports have not been sent for the last several months to the officials of the Smart City by the ICCC Tech Mahindra team, the commissioner asked the CEO to issue a show cause notice to ICCC Tech Mahindra manager for the negligence. It was found in the review meeting that the “Real time reporting of AQI '' reports are being generated and sent to the pollution control office through email, but when asked about the action taken on the daily reports, the pollution control officer said that no action has been taken against them so far. Taking it seriously, the commissioner issued a show cause notice to the regional pollution control officer for not taking necessary steps and corrective measures as required. The regional pollution control officer told the commissioner that the sensor-based systems are to be approved for reporting by the central pollution control board, Delhi. The commissioner directed the CEO and the regional pollution control officer to coordinate and get it validated in the next 15 days, and ensure that daily action and corrective measures are taken. To ensure that real time data of air quality in Kanpur reaches all the people of the city, the commissioner directed the CEO to see that Kanpur Smart City mobile app picks up the data in real times and is updated on regular basis so that people of the city can view all air quality related data (of all 50 sensor-based monitoring systems across the city) on their mobile phones. He also asked the CEO to review it on a daily basis for the next 15 days, and has fixed the next review meeting after 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/district-administration-team-visits-iccc-at-kanpur-smart-city-office/articleshow/87675005.cms||---

The beds will be lowered in each of the teaching hospitals to 200, with routine treatment services getting priority. There are 55,442 beds available in the state, including in government and private hospitals. But just 1,424 beds remain occupied (including general, oxygen, and ICU beds) and 54,018 beds are unoccupied and unused. Most patients (594) are being treated on oxygen beds. Now, Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad has the most Covid-19 patients (55) while Mahbubnagar government hospitals have around 40 patients. Around 35 people are also being treated at the Mahatma Gandhi hospital in Warangal urban district. Only King Koti and TIMS hospitals have more than 10 patients and the administration has already decided to restore regular treatment services and reduce the Covid- 19 beds in two hospitals. The health department has agreed to increase routine services at district and mandal level hospitals while gradually reducing the number of Covid- 19 nodal centres and special beds at each institution. The decision was made after it was discovered that an average of 40,000 Covid-19 tests are being conducted daily, yet no more than 200 tests are positive. “The employees and facilities will be diverted more towards routine services, as we do not expect a large surge. But if one occurs, we will promptly boost the bed capacity,” an official said. The current emphasis is on Covid- 19 immunization and officials have been ordered to pick up the pace in order to meet the targets by the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-positivity-rate-dips-t-to-lower-covid-19-bed-strength/articleshow/87674199.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In a step in this direction, they are creating enabling policies as well as sensitising the workforce about the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning) community. “Few MNCs and global consulting firms in Hyderabad are driving this as part of their hiring process that provides equal opportunity for candidates to not only foster innovation but attract the best and brightest talent,” Gautam Vohra, vice-president and business head, telecom & engineering staffing, TeamLease Digital. Currently, LGBTQ hiring has been predominantly in support functions and back-end roles, he added. Vohra said that the levels of exposure and awareness on LGBTQ issues is a notch higher in MNCs as IT companies host awareness programmes to foster inclusion by updating their policies and by being equal opportunity employers. Many of them have developed a resume application system to include gender neutral language and at offices, they have been launching ‘Pride groups’ for LGBTQ employees. Some have created gender neutral restrooms and enabling employees to self-identify as LGBTQ in internal HR systems, he added. Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) president Bharani K Aroll too pointed out that some tech companies, especially MNCs, are taking up very specific programmes for including transgenders into their overall employee base and are conducting sensitisation initiatives for all employees. A spokesperson from Deloitte, that is one of the largest employers in the city, said: “Our workplace culture supports LGBTQIA+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, and asexual). ) professionals to show up authentically and to thrive at work and beyond without fear of discrimination or prejudice.” In 2018, Deloitte Global endorsed the UN Standards of Conduct for Business in Tackling Discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people and has aligned its actions accordingly. Among other things, this UN document said that companies should ensure that gender affirming surgery, treatment and support are covered by company health insurance policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tech-cos-strive-to-create-conducive-lgbtq-spaces/articleshow/87674202.cms||Swati Rathor

Parminder Mehta, Congress leader and OSD to the mayor, has filed a complaint with the Ludhiana police to register an FIR against the actress. Mehta said, “Kangana Ranaut has made very shocking and derogatory remarks that our country’s Independence was ‘bheekh’ and true independence was attained in 2014, when Narendra Modi became the PM. She always wants to grab limelight by making such statements. Earlier too she had labelled our protesting farmers as terrorists. Now the actress has belittled the struggle of our freedom fighters. Her statement has hurt the sentiments of every Indian. She deserves to be punished, so I have filed a complaint with the Ludhiana commissioner of police to book her under sedition and arrest her immediately. We also urge the President to take away her Padma Shri as she does not deserve the honour.”The Ludhiana unit of Communist Party of India (CPI) too has lashed out against Kangana and the BJP. In a statement issued here on Friday, leaders of CPI DP Maur, Dr Arun Mitra, Chamkaru Singh, MS Bhatia and Ramesh Rattan said, “The BJP should clarify its stand on Kangana Ranaut’s statement. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has not uttered a single word on this till now. His silence smacks of his agreement with her statement. The issue is important because Kangana has been awarded Padma Shri. It is a well-known fact that the RSS/ Jan Sangh connived with the British during the freedom movement. Her statement is a cruel joke on the sacrifices of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and thousands of others who fought for our freedom. Our party demands immediate withdrawal of her Padma Shri and other awards, and her arrest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chorus-against-kangana-for-remarks-on-independence/articleshow/87673405.cms||---

Quality LED bulbs and decorative lights made by these women are available in the markets and are selling well too. This was the first time in any Eastern UP district when over a dozen women associated with two self-help groups under the UP State Rural Livelihood Mission have taken initiatives to assemble\ manufacture LED bulbs at their respective homes or in groups. Not only in Baribojh village under the Lalganj block, but women in Newadi village under the Mandhata blocks have also come forward to assemble LED bulbs and decorative night lamps. After receiving week-long training from National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) officials, they started assembling LED bulbs and are now receiving orders from different parts of the state. Nafees Ahmad, Block Mission Manager (Pratapgarh) told TOI that more than a dozen women associated with self-help groups in Lalganj and Mandhata blocks of the district are assembling good quality LED blubs after bringing required materials from Delhi and other parts of the country. These LED bulbs are on par with the branded ones available in the market. Competitively priced, these LED lights saw good demand and this was aptly proved during the recent festive season. He added that this was the first time when women had taken initiatives to manufacture LED bulbs in their respective homes. He further added that orders for LED bulbs have been pouring in from many districts including Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Amethi, and Sultanpur. He, however, said that there are plans to impart training to more women in other blocks for the manufacturing of LED bulbs. Meanwhile, women associated with assembling LED bulbs claimed they usually spend between Rs 40-45 to assemble a LED bulb and it was sold out for Rs 70-80. They have has also been receiving bulk orders where each piece of an LED bulb is being sold for Rs 65-70. Sarita, a member of the group, said, "We want that our villages, blocks and cities should be illuminated through LED bulbs. She added that they have also conveyed a message among the masses that they can save power by using the LED lights made by them." Officials said that women associated with different self-help groups are now attracted towards the new projects particularly the manufacturing of LED bulbs and lights. "The day is not far when villages in Mandhata and Lalganj blocks would be turned into the hub of LED bulb assembling," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/led-bulbs-light-up-the-entrepreneurship-dreams-of-these-women/articleshow/87673406.cms||---

The court said the conspiracy was writ large by the calculated attack on the victim by the unlawful assembly. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges of rioting, murder, unlawful assembly and criminal conspiracy against Anwar Hussain, Kasim, Khalid Ansari and Shahrukh in the case related to the death of Deepak during the riots in Gokalpuri. “It has come on record that the deceased Deepak was murdered by an armed unlawful assembly on February 25, 2020 around 1.30pm. By the manner of their mobilisation and intent as construed from their conduct, the said unlawful assembly can be said to have conducted itself for riots and other offences like murder of deceased Deepak, in prosecution of their common object. The conspiracy is also writ large by the calculated attack on the victim by the unlawful assembly,” the court said in its order on November 9. It further said that there were other public witnesses who have given similar statements implicating accused persons in the offence of riots and murder of Deepak. It added that police witnesses have also identified the accused persons as allegedly a part of the armed riotous mob. “The most important witness in the present case would be Sunil Kumar, who is an eyewitness to the entire incident and has given the complete picture as to how the deceased Deepak was killed by the armed mob consisting of the accused people,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conspiracy-writ-large-murder-rioting-charges-framed-against-4/articleshow/87675530.cms||Usha Das
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Class XII girl ends life due to sexual harassment by teacher||COIMBATORE: A day after a Class XII girl committed suicide, the RS Puram all-woman police in Coimbatore arrested a former teacher of a private school on Friday under Pocso Act and other sections for sexual harassment of the girl and abetment of suicide. According to police, the accused, 31-year-old K Mithun Chakravarthy, was teaching physics and mathematics at a private matriculation school in the city. He had resigned from the school in September this year. According to police, last March, the teacher called the girl to school under the pretext of holding special classes since lessons were taught online during the pandemic. The girl complained to the school principal about the harassment but no action was taken. The girl committed suicide on Thursday evening after her mother and sister had left for Madurai for a family function, police said. Her father was away at work. “When her father returned from work, he found the door bolted from inside. As there was no response, he, along with the help of some of his friends, broke open the door and found the girl hanging from the ceiling. They took her to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital where doctors declared her brought dead,” police said. The girl’s father said, “Mithun used to take online classes during the pandemic and talk to my daughter over WhatsApp video call and chat. My daughter had in March sought permission to go to school, stating she was among the students who were selected for a science competition and Mithun would take classes for them. While I used to pick and drop her, on more than three occasions she was late, and it was the teacher who dropped her back home. She told me that the teacher had taken her to various places alone and requested me to move her to another school.” When the girl’s father informed the incident to his wife, she told him about how their daughter was sexually harassed by her teacher Mithun Chakkaravarthi. He later lodged a complaint with the RS Puram all-woman police seeking action against the teacher. The man said his daugther had also told her mother that the teacher’s behaviour towards her was not good. “She had informed the same to the school principal and the Mithun’s wife who is also a teacher at the same school. We subsequently admitted her to the corporation school at RS Puram. However, she did not mingle with anyone and seemed very dull.” Based on the complaint of the victim’s father, police registered a case against Mithun under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 9(l) (whoever commits sexual assault on the child more than once or repeatedly) read with 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, and nabbed him. Earlier in the day, members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, Students’ Federation of India, All India Democratic Women’s Association and DYFI had staged demonstrations outside the private school and the district collectorate, demanding police to arrest the teacher. They also petitioned collector G S Sameeran, seeking action against the schoolteacher and the school management. Chief educational officer N Geetha said the school education department would conduct an inquiry into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/class-xii-girl-ends-life-due-to-sexual-harassment-by-teacher/articleshow/87675019.cms||---

---||Allahabad||City to host Indira Marathon this year||Prayagraj: After remaining off the track in 2020 owning to the pandemic, ace runners of the country would once again compete at the popular 36th edition of the All India Prize Money Indira Marathon to be held in the Sangam city on November 19. Held annually, this 42.195km (for both men and women) marathon marks the birth anniversary of late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which falls on November 19. The run would begin from Anand Bhawan and end at Madan Mohan Malaviya Stadium of the city. However, this year there has been a small change in the route of the marathon as the runners would have to go towards Rewa Road after crossing the new Yamuna bridge, and then would have to return on the same route by taking a U-turn from the Reliance Petrol Pump (located just before the flyover at Ghoorpur). Earlier, the run used to pass through the old bridge of Naini due to ongoing sewer work on the traditional route, via Mahewa. District magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri approved the new route of the Indira Marathon in a meeting and also instructed officials to undertake necessary repairs of the road, keeping the route of the marathon in mind for the benefit of the athletes. The marathon’s maiden edition was held on November 19, 1985, after being flagged off by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. “With the route finalised, instructions have now been given to officials of all departments concerned to prepare for the event. The roads will be repaired and the traffic management plan for the route will also be prepared accordingly. The ARTO has also been instructed in this regard,” said Khatri. The DM has directed the municipal corporation, health, traffic and education department to prepare for the marathon. SDM (Sadar) has been made the nodal officer of the marathon. The DM has also instructed the district inspector of schools to ensure participation of schoolchildren, including in the closing ceremony. He has also asked the ADM (city) to depute sector magistrates along with the marathon route for smooth conduct of the event. The sports department marked the ‘kilometer marks’ on the new route of the marathon on Thursday. “The runners will run with a computer chip attached to their shoes or clothes. As per the rule of Athletics Federation of India (AFI), the chip has been made mandatory in marathon. These chips will record the timing of the runners. Besides, the entire route and the run would be monitored through the network of CCTV, including the installed on major crossings of the city,” said regional sports officer Anil Tiwari. The official also said that after being flagged off from the historical Anand Bhawan gate, the participants would run on the route past Teliarganj, Mayo Hall crossing, High Court, CMP College, New Yamuna bridge, Rewa road and back to the end point at Madan Mohan Malviya stadium via Hanuman Mandir. In the last edition of this famous marathon (35th in 2019), Rahul Kumar Pal of Amethi had won by clocking a timing of 2:28:35 seconds. Harendra Kumar of Gazipur had bagged the second position, while Hetram of the services came third. In the women category, Shyamili Singh of West Bengal made history by winning for the first time.

---||Allahabad||City resident provides free goat milk to help dengue patients, doc says no scientific proof||Prayagraj: With the city witnessing increasing numbers of Dengue cases and as per common man’s belief that goat’s milk is supposedly effective in bringing up the blood platelet count, the owners of these animals have started to hike prices of goat milk upto Rs 500 per litre. However, the city also has some good samaritans like Sanjay Saran alias Guddu Bhai, a resident of Chatham Lines of Prayagraj, who is providing free goat milk to around 50 persons every morning. The district has recorded 891 dengue cases so far out of which, 643 were reported in urban pockets, while the rest 248 in rural areas. Earlier, the businessman used to run a tea-shop on the road leading to Iswar Saran Degree College (ISDC), but the pandemic forced him to close the shop and he is barely able to meet ends meet. However, despite facing the challenge, he refrains from charging any money for the milk of his goats which is given to a number of denizens of the Sangam city who visit his house every morning to collect around 100 millilitres (ml) of goat milk, believing that consuming the same would improve the patient’s blood platelet count. “Although, earlier I used to have around 100 goats, but now the numbers have come down to just seven. But since all of them are yielding milk and people believe that goat milk helps fight dengue and the falling platelet count, I thought of donating the same to those who need it. Although, I don’t ask for money but there are few, among the large number of people who come daily to get the milk, who do give some money which I keep it for the fodder of my goats,” said Guddu. It’s been over two months that Guddu has been providing around 100-150ml of milk to 50-60 people every day. But as the outbreak of the disease is getting worse in the city, more and more people come to his house. However, the medico of the city has a different perceptive in terms of consuming goat milk in respect to its benefits for dengue patients. “As far as the standard protocol or the practice goes, in terms of treating dengue patients, there is no proof that goat’s milk has any benefits in increasing the platelet count. Moreover, we never recommend consuming milk without boiling it and people should refrain from the same,” said associate professor at MLN Medical College and eminent physician of the city, Dr Manoj Mathur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-resident-provides-free-goat-milk-to-help-dengue-patients-doc-says-no-scientific-proof/articleshow/87673424.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Demoiselle cranes died of avian flu: Lab report||Jodhpur: Deaths of over a hundred demoiselle cranes, popularly known as ‘Kurjan’ in desert region has been attributed to the avian influenza. A report of the viscera of the dead birds sent to the laboratory has confirmed it. It may be noted that the dead Kurjan had been spotted near a water point in village Kaparda first on November 8 by a local wildlife activist. Many of them were found to sick and were not able to fly. Since then, the toll has reached close to the mark of 150 and has also been reported to other settlements of the birds in the villages in the vicinity of Kaparda. Keeping this in view, a meeting was also held by the district magistrate on Friday in the aftermath of the report from the National institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal stating that the birds were infected with deadly H5N1 Avian Influenza. Directions have been issued to the common persons that any spotting of dead or sick Kurjan should immediately been reported to the officials of the Medical & Health, Forest or Animal Husbandry department, so that the necessary action could be taken. Directions were also issued about the proper disposal of the carcasses of the birds in adherence to the protocol so that the infection did not spread to other birds or animals, who could dig out the carcasses from the pits. Meanwhile, taking a serious note of this unabated mortality of these migratory birds in Kaparda, Ramasani and Olvi villages, a team of medical experts from an NGO also reached here to set up a temporary rescue center in the village. “Sick birds are being administered IV fluids, multi vitamins, liver tonics and antibiotic by our team, so that they could be revived and saved. The sickness among them have caused weakness in them crippling them from walking let alone flying”, said one of the team members Rohit Gangwal. On the other hand, the count of bird mortality has been growing steadily with reports of some more birds death pouring in from other areas besides Kaparda. According to the sources, some birds were also found to be dead in Pali on Friday. However, these birds were not Kurjan but some small birds. Senior veterinarian Shrawan Singh said that the disease had also spread in many small birds last year adding that the concern should be a this stage to stop the infection from spreading to healthier birds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/demoiselle-cranes-died-of-avian-flu-lab-report/articleshow/87674211.cms||---

Conducted ahead of Children’s Day to gauge the emotional and nutritional impact of the pandemic on children, doctors from the three Fortis Hospitals at Mahim, Mulund and Vashi interviewed 7,670 parents.  They found half the parents were worried about their children's reduced attention span, and over a third about their child’s weight gain and unhealthy snacking habits. Only parents of children aged five to 18 were interviewed. Overall, 95% of the parents interviewed said the pandemic has impacted their child’s “physical, emotional and social growth”. A research paper in medical journal JAMA Network, on October 1, underlined a correlation between children’s mental health and their physical activity and screen time. The study surveyed 1,000 school-aged children in the US and found children engaged in more physical activity and less screen time had better mental health outcomes. The Fortis Hospital survey found the balance between screen time, physical activity and mental health couldn’t be maintained by many. For instance, the ‘work from home’ culture during the pandemic resulted in parents being in close contact with children, but unable to pay attention to them. “Parents worked from home, but they were not accessible to their children. We came across cases where the children were locked away in a different room so parents could work. This must have impacted young children's emotional makeup,” said Dr Sameer Sadawarte. Six out of 10 children had become agitated and irritated during the lockdown periods. Over 60% of the parents felt their children had become “clingly” and demanded that parents spend time with them. During the first wave in 2020, the lockdown was so stringent that children were not allowed to go to the playground or even the housing society's garden. Not surprisingly then, 62% of the parents said their children spent four to six hours every day in front of a gadget. The survey found 57% of the parents said their children watched TV or played video games in their free time. Over one-third of the parents (39%) said their children had gained weight during the pandemic as they frequently snacked. Pediatrician Jesal Sheth said, “As life limps back to normalcy, we must try to involve our children in physical activities, sports and help them socialize with their friends, but in a safe manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kids-snacking-screen-time-irritability-up-in-pandemic/articleshow/87675027.cms||---

Addressing reporters after a Covid reviewing meeting, Bhujbal said the Nashik administration would monitor the pace of vaccination in the district for the next 8-10 days and if it remains sluggish, the beneficiaries who are not taking the jabs would be denied food grains distributed through public distribution system (PDS) shops and LPG cylinders. Sharing the vaccination data of Nashik, Bhujbal said a total 1.02 crore doses are to be administered to the 51 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 18. “But so far, only 49 lakh doses have been administered. Around 16 lakh beneficiaries have not even taken the first dose. The pace of vaccination in Nashik is still sluggish and there is a need to improve the coverage,” he said. According to the Bhujbal, low vaccination coverage in Malegaon is concerning. “I will look into the reasons for the poor response to vaccination in Malegaon city and steps would be taken to improve the coverage in the textile town,” he said. “The district has less than 500 active Covid patients and the positivity rate has reduced to 1.4%. But we are prepared for any outbreak and have made arrangements for adequate supply of medical oxygen,” he added. Bhujbal also appealed to the people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent spread of the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-says-partial-vax-may-be-a-norm-for-foodgrain-lpg/articleshow/87672639.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Noting that nobody was present on behalf of the petitioner when the matter was called, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh observed that the petitioner remained unrepresented on the last few occasions as well. “The petition is, therefore, dismissed for default,” the bench said. Filed in January, the petition by Dhananjai Jain, a Delhi resident, also sought to remove people squatting under the garb of farmers’ agitation and to clear off all the roads and public places. The plea further demanded the removal of the then Delhi Police Commissioner from his position with immediate effect following the violence on Republic Day and prayed for a direction to the Centre to put adequate paramilitary forces to protect important monuments and to ensure the safety of life and property of citizens of Delhi and restore the feeling of confidence and security amongst them. “Grave and emergent situation arose in Delhi, when on the Republic Day, the celebrations were underway. The farmer agitation, which was going on for last so many days, took a very aggravated and violent turn and the farmers reached the interiors of Delhi armed with weapons, hockey sticks, swords and other assault weapons disturbing the peace and law and order and tranquillity in the capital apart from demeaning the Republic Day festivity,” the petition had claimed. It alleged that Delhi Police did not take timely decisions to allow officials to wield appropriate force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-rejects-petition-seeking-action-against-police-for-failing-to-discharge-duty-during-red-fort-violence/articleshow/87674251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On the same day, Shah will be addressing the convention of such committees of West and Braj regional units. The conventions of booth level committees and in-charges, divisional units, in-charges of ‘shakti kendras’ and ‘panna pramukh’ will also be conducted by November-end,” Bansal said. Bansal called upon the party cadres to take part in voter list revision process at each booth on November 21 and 27 and also in the on-going membership drive launched by Shah on October 29. The regional units were also assigned the task of holding conventions of teachers, ex-servicemen, lawyers, chaupals of women and labourers. Earlier, mobilising the assembly area in-charges and office-bearers from 98 district units, the party’s in-charge for UP Radhe Mohan Singh said that the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi government for the poor, needy, deprived, Dalits and backwards apart from common man is being positively debated everywhere. The same work done for social welfare should be utilised to woo the voters. He appealed to the partymen to change their daily routine as per the need of the party during election time to dedicate them for executing the programmes prepared by the organisation. Apart from Shah, Pradhan and Yogi, Union minister Anurag Thakur, deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were present on the dais. Many other Union and UP ministers and leaders, including Annapurna Devi, Shoba Karandalaje, Saroj Pandey, Arjunram Meghwal, Capt Abhimanyu Singh, Vivek Thakur, Sunil Oza, Sudhir Gupta, Pankaj Singh, Subrat Pathak and Mahesh Chand Srivastava were also present. It is Shah’s second visit to the state within a fortnight. Earlier on October 29, he had launched a BJP membership drive in the state capital and made it clear that Adityanath would be the party's chief ministerial face in the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/shah-exhorts-party-cadres-to-improve-bjp-tally-in-2022-up-assembly-polls/articleshow/87673468.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Hyderabad||Third Covid dose is the real booster, the magic bullet: Dr Krishna M Ella||HYDERABAD: In a candid conversation, Dr Krishna M Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, tells Swati Bharadwaj and Swati Rathor about vaccines, his passion for science and innovation and how he is betting big on youth and startups Do you think it is time for a booster third shot?The third dose is the real booster dose, it’s the magic bullet. When we look at child immunity, for instance, in inactivated polio vaccines or pentavalent or DPT, two doses will give you enough immunity but not enough for a lifetime. The third one gives the best immunity to the body. With Covaxin, I don’t know how the variants are going to pan out and how long this immunity will last as it’s a new virus. What is the status of the intranasal vaccine?We have just completed the heterologous phase II trials. We have also figured out some new immunology. Why nasal vaccine did not work for lot of people, we have figured out. Something that even the Americans could not figure out. The nasal vaccine is ideal for Covid-19 because from nostril onwards to the throat, intestine, guts, everything is mucosal which is the place where the body’s defence mechanism is located. Nasal has the IgA, mucosal immunity, IgG and T-cell response. But nasal doesn’t really develop the immune response to all the viruses properly for various reasons and we have figured out that science. It is working extremely well with Covaxin. By end of the month we will be submitting phase II data to the regulator. It will be the next big thing because it will stop transmission. WHO claims that Covaxin’s approvals were not delayed and there were other vaccines that also took time. Comments?I don’t think it was delayed per se because we started the process in April. Usually the regulatory process for licence is to complete one year of safety profile after phase III has started. That’s why it’s called Emergency Use Listing (EUL). So, I don’t think it was delayed but what I can certainly say is there was a lot of negative publicity in international media. Regulators work differently, they have their own mind. Even WHO had a lot of questions. They looked at us with much more scrutiny as an Indian company. With WHO approval in place, how do you see the global play for Covaxin, especially gaining access to the US market?With the US market, whether we get approved or not, it’s an exercise for us to understand (the approval process). Nobody looks at that angle in this country. (By approaching the US regulator) I put pressure on the US government. I let them know that they need an alternative technology. Currently the Covaxin we are getting is based on the Wuhan strain. Have you started tweaking it with the Delta variant?We are starting work on the Delta variant now with a test licence. What were the reasons for a shortfall in supply of Covaxin as per government’s expectations and are things back on track now?Manufacturing scale-up has been carried out in a stepwise manner across our own multiple facilities in Hyderabad, Malur in Karnataka and Ankleshwar in Gujarat. For Pune, we have got a test licence. The company was able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacity in a short timeline, mainly due to the availability of its specially designed BSL-3 production campuses to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines. We have manufactured and supplied over 150 million doses with an excellent safety and efficacy profile. We are producing 50-55 million doses of Covaxin per month and we are on target to reach our goal of 1 billion doses annualised capacity by 2021 end. Do you think the timeframe to develop vaccines for Covid-19 is the new benchmark for all vaccines now? Will future vaccines be developed faster?I am totally against this sort of regulatory process. You are going to develop vaccines for children so you can’t take shortcuts. In a pandemic, the orphan status of drugs is okay. Like Merck developed the Ebola vaccine where, without an animal or human clinical trial, it was given to humans directly. This has been done in other vaccines during emergency times, for instance the mRNA vaccine never underwent animal trials. When can we expect Covaxin for kids?We have completed our trials and the data is with the government. A lot of people have been questioning whether there is a need for a children’s vaccine, but Covid-19 affects the lungs and it’s a lifetime problem. I am 66 and if I die there is no problem but if a child gets infected, it affects the quality of life of the younger generation for the next 70 years and that’s more dangerous for me. Are you a scientist first and then a businessman or the other way around?Honestly, I spend very little time as a businessman. I am a scientist and until I die I am going to be a scientist. I breathe science. That’s my passion. There is one good thing about US education – it makes you imbibe science. It’s not my grades or marks or degree. Teachers create an interest in science. I majored in virology at one of the best labs in the US at the University Wisconsin Madison. We used to have Nobel Laureates right there. Har Gobind Khorana was there when I had joined as a student. What is the next area of R&D you are excited about?I really want to get into gene therapy. Gene therapy is still controversial and sketchy, but if we can save some people who are going to die, that will be significant. And I think in gene therapy, whether it’s the CRISPR technology or vector-based, we need to get into the game. After Covid-19 where do you think the next threat to the world will come from?I fear that the next threat may come on the animal side. In India at least, we don’t eat beef. But the whole of Europe and the US depends on beef and if cattle get affected, then food shortage is going to be massive and inflation will be very high. Would you consider taking Bharat Biotech public at this point of time?You tell me, what will I do with so much money? I need to spend it also, no? Somebody else’s money is a liability. We are a cashrich company. I do not have a single loan and my salary is also very low. We have no intention to go public right now. Would you look at acquisitions or would be keen on working with startups?I am very keen on startups but not for making money. Every entrepreneur who has succeeded can help another five entrepreneurs succeed. That is my CSR (corporate social responsibility). I go by what type of promoter he or she is, is he or she good, ethical and passionate about what they are doing? It can be any field. We are not looking at startups as acquisitions. I want to help others succeed. I always tell pharma companies in Hyderabad, they have so much cash, but they only invest in real estate. Instead, if they would have funded 20 entrepreneurs and even if five had succeeded, they would have created more wealth. What’s your prescription for young scientists?Do not do anything just for the sake of the job or your boss. Your boss will not be there with you if you don’t succeed. Do what excites you. Whatever you do, be passionate. In our company we nurture a lot of young scientists and our attrition rate is less than 1%. The average age is about 26-27 years. I believe in the younger generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/third-dose-is-the-real-booster-its-the-magic-bullet-ella/articleshow/87674235.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat denied the relief to Jalaluddin, saying the accused was allegedly seen actively pursuing the object of the unlawful assembly by pelting stones upon police officials. The court said that the accused was seen in one of the videos allegedly exhorting the shopkeepers to pull down the shutter of their shops. It further said that in another video, he was seen allegedly pelting stones towards the directions where the police party had been apprehended by the violent mob and were being beaten. “The manner in which he (Jalaluddin) was pelting stones towards the police personnel who other members of unlawful assembly were beating, clearly indicates that he shared the common object of the unlawful assembly i.e. to cause injuries by the police personnel and to kill them,” it added in its order. The court said that the accused had neither made any attempt to stop the other members of the assembly from beating the police personnel nor did he try to disassociate from the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-bail-for-accused-in-case-related-to-cop-murder-during-riots/articleshow/87675550.cms||Usha Das

In Malegaon, over a dozen people were injured, including 10 policemen. Two of the police personnel have been admitted at the hospital for treatment but their condition is stable, said the local police. The police have detained four persons in connection with the incident so far. In Nanded, eight policemen, including an additional superintendent of police, an inspector and six constables were injured. In addition to this, at least three vehicles were damaged in the stone pelting, while a two-wheeler was set on fire. Malegaon police said a large number of bandh supporters were returning after submitting a memorandum to the local administration. When they reached the new bus stand area of the textile town, they saw some shops open and started throwing stones at those outlets. DIG of Nashik Range, BG Shekhar Patil, told TOI that the police had a tough time in bringing the situation under control as the group members had become violent and kept on throwing stones at the policemen. “The police had to resort to mild lathi charge to bring the situation under control. There was tension in the area for about an hour. The situation is now under control,” added Patil. Nashik SP Sachin Patil said the protesters pelted stones at a building with shops at the basement and a hospital on the first and second floor. The stone pelting left some of the window panes of the hospital shattered. The DIG and the SP are camping in Malegaon. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI that after giving a memorandum to tehsildar around 3pm, the gathering was dispersing, when some members tried to head towards the district collector’s office by passing through mixed localities but were stopped by policemen and officers. As a result, they started pelting stones, leaving policemen injured. The suspects have been booked at Itwara police station on the charges of attempt to murder, using criminal force to deter government employee from performing official duty, rioting, unlawful assembly. In addition, the suspects have also been charged with sections under the Criminal Amendment Act and Damage to Public Property Act. The injured officers include additional superintendent of police Nilesh More and Itwara police station inspector Sahebrao Narwada, while one constable suffered a fracture in his leg. Additional superintendent of police Vijay Kabade said though none of the policemen suffered any serious injuries, one constable has a fracture in the leg. He said, “The incident occurred when the gathering was returning home. The sudden stone pelting left the policemen injured and three police vehicles have been damanged. Based on the CCTV footage, an offence is being registered against some identified and about 100 unidentified suspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/protest-turns-violent-in-nanded-and-malegaon/articleshow/87677610.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Hubballi||MLC elections: Outsiders aspiring for Congress ticket earn North Karnataka leaders’ wrath||Dharwad: Congress workers in north Karnataka, particularly from the once undivided Dharwad district, are upset with the party high command as they feel leaders have been imposing outsiders on them. The southern part of the earlier undivided Dharwad district, which was earlier the Dharwad South Lok Sabha constituency (now called the Haveri Lok Sabha constituency), has been a favourite for the Congress as several leaders from outside, particularly from the Old Mysore region, who have lost elections in their areas were fielded in a bid to rehabilitate them. The rehabilitation tale has a long history. It started with the fielding of former chief minister S Nijalingappa, who was elected unopposed from the Shiggaon assembly constituency in 1967. Nijalingappa, who hailed from Chitradurga district, had lost the 1962 assembly election to GT Rangappa of the Praja Socialist Party by a margin of 5,709 votes. In the same election, Fakkirappa Taware of the Congress had won from Shiggaon against FT Patil of the PSP by a margin of 14,232 votes. So, Shiggaon was now considered a safe seat for the Congress. In 1967, the party decided to field Nijalingappa from there and as the opposition parties did not field a candidate, Nijalingappa entered the assembly uncontested. In the 1984 national general elections, the Congress fielded Azeez Sait of Mysuru from the Dharwad South constituency. The Janata Party’s candidate was Abdul Nazeer Sab. Sait won by a margin of 57,607 votes. This seat had been deemed safe for the Congress as FH Mohsin, BM Mujahid and IG Sanadi had won there earlier. But in recent times, the Congress has seen upsets in Dharwad South. Saleem Ahmed from Bengaluru who was the MLC from 1996-2002 and 2002-2008 was fielded by the Congress in Dharwad South (now Haveri) parliamentary constituency in the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Saleem lost both the elections to the BJP’s Shivakumar Udasi. Santosh Lad, who hails from Sandur, was another outsider to be accommodated by the Congress in the Dharwad district as he was given a ticket to contest from the Kalghatagi assembly constituency in 2008. His earlier constituency Sandur had become reserved for STs. After winning in 2008 and 2013, he lost in 2018. In the 2018 assembly polls, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, fearing defeat in Chamundeshwari, also contested from Badami in Bagalkot district. While he lost Chamundeshwari by 36,000 votes, he scraped through in Badami by a slender 1,696-vote margin against B Sriramulu of the BJP. Now that Saleem Ahmed is lobbying for a Congress ticket to contest elections to Legislative Council from the Local Authorities’ Constituency in undivided Dharwad district (comprising Dharwad, Haveri and Gadag districts), there is palpable resentment among local leaders. Sources said the party was inclined to field a Muslim candidate and there were several aspirants from the community. “Saleem has lost twice in the Lok Sabha election and considering him again for a ticket at the cost of several loyal party workers is not acceptable. The Upper House should have senior leaders who are experts in different fields and are capable of reviewing the decisions taken by the Lower House. It should not become a rehabilitation centre for those who cannot win assembly elections. Have you ever heard of a party a leader from north Karnataka who has lost an election being fielded in a safe constituency in South Karnataka? Why should we always sacrifice?” asked an aspirant. He said that the high command should respect the sentiments of the local loyal party workers and field a senior person for the elections from the Local Authorities’ Constituency to the Council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/mlc-elections-outsiders-aspiring-for-congress-ticket-earn-north-karnataka-leaders-wrath/articleshow/87673264.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The city has also been chosen among the top cities in the category of ‘Garbage Free’ under the Swachh Survekshan 2021. Confirming the development, Suresh Ola, district collector, Dungarpur says, “We are delighted to share that city has been adjudged for two awards in national level competition. The credit goes to the local body and the people of the city for showcasing exemplary civic behaviour.” The road to success was not easy for the tribal-dominated city with expanding at a very fast pace. The main trick which worked in the city has been cleaning drive in the night. The city is among the very few in the state where the cleaning took place in the evening and continues late in the night. Explaining the logic behind the trick, Ola, said, “The city is not fully urban in its character and people after the sunset doesn’t prefer to stay out. They give an opportunity for the local body to carry out the drive in the evening and by late-night, they are done with everything. The biggest advantage of the drive is that the cleaning process doesn’t affect the traffic and residents finds streets and lanes clean when they wake up,” said Ola. The trick would not have been successful until it is met by the civic behaviour of the residents. “It will be surprising for any outsider to take a stroll in the evening around the lake which is done by thousands but not yet find litter on the path. Also, the hawkers in the city carries dustbins to ensure that wastage from the product doesn’t travel on the road,” said Ola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dungarpur-to-get-cleanliness-awards-by-prez/articleshow/87674248.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahead of VGGS, Gujarat to launch new policies||GANDHINAGAR: To attract investors and boost positive sentiments ahead of the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat global summit scheduled in January 2022, the Gujarat government is set to announce around half a dozen new policies in key sectors like energy, IT/ITeS, electronics, and agri-business. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel is likely to announce these policies soon. The government is also expected to approve important long-pending demands made by industries. The state’s Information Technology & IT-enabled Services Policy 2016 will lapse shortly. So, the government is working on a new policy that will have a larger ambit. It is likely to cover emerging technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence and robotics. Compared to the 2016 policy where incentives were given to create IT & ITeS accommodating properties, the new policy will focus on providing easy entry-and-exit plug-and-play infrastructure on lease. The policy is also expected to offer manpower-related incentives to attract talent and boost the sector’s growth. Similarly, the current policy for the electronic industry is also coming to an end this month. To draft the new policy, the state government is consulting large, medium, and small electronic companies to understand their needs and is also studying policies of other states. Like the IT/ITeS policy, the government intends to provide incentives to nurture manpower required for the industry. Meanwhile, the state agriculture department has prepared a draft for the new agri-business policy which has proposed to reduce investment criteria from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 35 lakh. It has also proposed reduction of interest subsidy from 7.5% to 7%. This decision has been taken to match the state’s industrial policy which offers cost benefits only up to Rs 35 lakh and 7% interest subsidy. “Although financial benefits have been reduced in the proposed policy, it is expected that considering higher demand, more applications will be admitted and more industries will be given benefits,” said sources. The energy & petrochemicals department is also working on three key policies namely wind power generation, waste to energy, and small hydel power generation to double power generation from these three sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vibrant-step-for-industry-demands/articleshow/87674253.cms||Kapil Dave

In addition to this, several gram panchayats have decided to display the names of all non-vaccinated villagers on walls to name and shame them. Currently, around 145 villages from Kolhapur district have completed 100% vaccination of the residents. Sanjaysinha Chavan, Kolhapur ZP CEO, said, “We have set a deadline of November 20 to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries. To ensure the target is achieved we have asked gram panchayats to read out names of non-vaccinated villagers so that others know who all are yet to get vaccinated and can encourage them to take the jab.” He added, “Some gram panchayats have also decided to display the names of non-vaccinated people on walls so that people would want to get jabbed and get their names removed .” So far, 85% of the eligible beneficiaries have received first dose and only 42% are fully vaccinated in Kolhapur district. Over 2 lakh beneficiaries have their second dose due. Meanwhile, activists, who are working for increasing vaccination figures, said fear of naming and shaming or incentives of any sort have limited outcome. Sanjay Ghatage, a vaccination activist, said, “Instead of forcing people, the authorities should adopt the route of mass counselling by conducting workshops to do away with the fear about vaccination. The counselling will help achieve significant turnout of beneficiaries. However, to ensure many come forward for getting jabbed, the vaccination process should be made more convenient and accessible.” No vaccination, no ration The gram panchayat of Pathurdi, a village of around 1,200 people in Karmala tehsil of Solapur district, has decided not to supply ration to the families that have non-vaccinated members. Shitalkumar Mote, head of Tanta Mukta Gaav forum, said, “In the last wave 15 people from our village succumbed to the infection. Currently, around 250 villagers have not taken a single jab yet. The families of these people will not be given monthly ration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-zp-adopts-name-shame-plan-to-boost-vaccination/articleshow/87672682.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi said undisputedly, the accused had no medical degree or certificate as midwife or nurse and as such she was not a qualified medical person. The court noted in its order on November 11 that earlier the accused was working as a midwife/assistant (auxiliary staff) with a maternity centre, which is also not registered with Medical Council India or any government agency. It added that the accused left the same in the year 2002 and since then was running her own clinic. “The material on record would indicate that the deceased, who was five months pregnant, was taken to the clinic of the accused on 22.05.2021. The woman also deposited an amount of Rs 16,000 for her treatment. However within 30 minutes of treatment, the deceased died with her foetus aborted. Cause of death in postmortem report is awaited, after ascertaining chemical analysis report of viscera,” it observed. The court noted that discrepancies pointed out by the accused’s counsel in the prosecution case during investigation, including the points of critical condition of deceased, cannot be gone into at the stage of consideration of bail as it cannot go into deep analysis of evidence appreciation or the reasons touching the merits of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-woman-who-opened-a-medical-clinic-without-degree/articleshow/87674286.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||AP: Niti Aayog hails health scheme for APL leg-up||AMARAVATI: In a major achievement, Niti Aayog has lauded the state government’s Aarogyasri scheme for covering people from Above the Poverty Line (APL) families with health insurance scheme. Niti Ayog has observed that majority of the families from APL bracket have been provided health coverage under Aarogyasri scheme. Interestingly, no other state government scheme has found place in the Niti Aayog’s noteworthy health insurance schemes’ list.  In fact, Niti Aayog strongly recommended the Centre to consider bringing middle class into the universal health insurance scheme ambit in order to achieve better economic results. Niti Aayog recently carried out a comprehensive study on the implementation of the health insurance schemes being implemented by the Centre as well as different states. The study found that about 30 per cent of the total population of the country particularly from the middle class were missing from health coverage. Niti Aayog also expressed serious anguish about the ‘Missing Middle Class’ in the health insurance bracket. “Expansion of health insurance / assurance coverage is a necessary step, and a pathway in India’s effort to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Low government expenditure on health has constrained the capacity and quality of healthcare services in the public sector. It diverts majority of individuals – about two thirds – to seek treatment in the costlier private sector. However, low financial protection leads to high out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE),” the report said. It further remarked that India’s population is vulnerable to catastrophic spending, and impoverishment from expensive trips to hospitals and other health facilities. The catastrophic effect of healthcare spending is not limited to the poor – but it impacts all segments of the population. “At least 30% of the population, or 40 crore individuals – called the missing middle– are devoid of any financial protection for health,” said Niti Aayog. It said that the Ayushman Bharat–Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) launched in September 2018, and expansion of state government extension schemes, provide comprehensive hospitalisation cover to the bottom 50% of the population, which is around 70 crore people. Around 20% of the population–25 crore people– are covered through social health insurance, and private voluntary health insurance.  “The remaining 30% of the population is devoid of health insurance. The actual uncovered population is higher due to existing coverage gaps in PMJAY and overlap between schemes. This uncovered population is termed as the missing middle,” said Niti Aayog. Interestingly, Niti Aayog noted that the revised and upgraded YSR Arogyasri scheme has taken care of the health needs of many of the middle class as it is providing healthcare to about 95 per cent of the state’s population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/niti-aayog-hails-health-scheme-for-apl-leg-up/articleshow/87673485.cms||Samdani MN
---||Jodhpur||Jodhpur: Case against Kangana for India’s independence comment||JODHPUR: Jodhpur Mahila Congress committee on Friday filed a police complaint against actor and Padma Shri recipient Kangana Ranaut for her comment that India got ‘real’ freedom in 2014 and not in 1947 when it got a bheek (alms). President of the committee and MLA Manisha Panwar reached the Shastri Nagar police station to file a complaint, in which she termed the statement of Ranaut about the country's Independence an insult to those thousands, who fought for the Independence and the people of India. “Entire World looks up to India’s freedom struggle and its fighters for this freedom in high esteem. It is also a fact that thousands laid their life for this freedom and by terming their sacrifice as ‘beekh’, she has committed an insult to both the martyrs and their descendants as well as each Indian citizen,” Panwar stated in the complaint. Demanding action against both the actress and the channel (owner and host), Panwar said that this statement shows that she has no respect at all for the constitution and historic and authentic evidence of the Independence of India. “Her statement was a deliberate move from a public platform, which has not only hurt the sentiments of Indians and also the glorious history of the country. Hence her statement came under the category of sedition”, she said. SHO (Shasri Nagar) Pankaj Raj Mathur said that the complaint has been taken for inquiry and further action would be taken after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/case-against-kangana-for-indias-independence-comment/articleshow/87674265.cms||---

All the seats for BEd courses got filled last year amid Covid-19 pandemic. This time, there seems to be a lack of interest among candidates to pursue BEd courses,” said sources in GU. In all, there are about 3,250 seats for BEd courses in colleges affiliated to GU. The admission process is presently underway and is scheduled to end on November 13. As per estimates, at least 5% of the seats will go empty this year, sources added. “The admission committee has already completed two rounds and the third is underway. Compared to other universities, GU began admission process quite late. At a time, when there is a rush of candidates for BEd courses at other universities in the state, it’s quite surprising to see that GU is having a tough time filling these seats,” said an education expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gu-bed-seats-vacant-for-first-time-in-4-years/articleshow/87674249.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Indian flag to unfurl for shipping sector at GIFT City||AHMEDABAD: After aircraft leasing and financing, Gujarat International Finance Tec-City is now exploring ways to make India, which has a huge export-import trade, a country of shipowners rather than only charterers. The authority at the country’s first and only International Finance Service Centre (IFSC) is aiming to turn the country into an international hub for ship acquisition, financing and leasing activities. The country spends about $75 billion annually chartering foreign flag vessels for India’s international trade. “It is heart-wrenching to find that on registering of ships, the industry finds it easier and more expedient to resort to Flags of Convenience (Panama, Marshall Islands, Liberia etc.) rather than flagging in India. Through the avenues of development of leasing which is suggested here, it is proposed to impart brand value to India flagged vessels,” according to a latest report of the committee on development of avenues for Ship Acquisition, Financing And Leasing (SAFAL) from IFSC in India.  The committee was constituted by IFSCA on June 24 to examine global best practices in financing and leasing of ships, identify opportunities and devise a roadmap to enable such activities from GIFT IFSC. Under the chairpersonship of Vandana Aggarwal, a former senior economic advisor of the government of India, along with representatives from the Centre, Gujarat Maritime Board, industry and finance experts, and academicians, the panel submitted its 208-page report to IFSCA on October 28. One of the key recommendations proposed in the report to D G Shipping is about ‘flagging’ where it has proposed to introduce a new category titled ‘Indian IFSC controlled tonnage’, offering certain relaxations. The report also suggests global benchmarking of regulations, tonnage tax and other tax and seafarer regimes, besides overcoming pricing and other limitations of the existing right of first refusal (ROFR) regime for import of bulk cargoes. Direct and indirect tax changes have been proposed based on the competitive gaps identified through the financial models developed for GIFT City. “After carefully examining the recommendations, the Centre is likely to announce some relaxations in the union budget in February. Once this is done, companies will start setting up their operations at GIFT City IFSC,” said a government official close to the development. In February this year, the IFSC Authority came out with a special framework for enabling aircraft leasing and ancillary services. As a result, several entities in this area who were earlier forced to search for options at overseas IFSCs, have now set up their operations at the Indian IFSC centre in GIFT City. “As IFSC authority, we are developing new avenues to bring international financial services to the country. Ship leasing and financing will play an important role in developing new business through IFSC in India,” said Dipesh Shah, Executive Director, IFSC Authority. Based on the current global order book of scheduled commercial vessels, over 3,000 vessels are on order at a value of about $200 billion (fair market value). Yet, there is serious room for growth, China has 340 million Dead Weight Tonnage (DWT) or 16% global market share while India has 25 million DWT tonnage or 1% global market share, according to the report. Among India’s strengths are its established common law system, world-class ports, proximity to major sources of and markets for goods, and a young, well-educated, creative and motivated workforce. India has the potential to build a base for commercial principals. “Many providers around the world continue to search for an Asian base of operations. At the same time, many Chinese vessel leasing companies, with all or part of their fleet based or registered outside China in low tax jurisdictions, are looking to house their offshore ownership operations in respectable jurisdictions with a stable tax and legal environment. All these activities present a real opportunity for India,” as per the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/indian-flag-to-unfurl-for-shipping-sector-at-gift-city/articleshow/87674276.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Pune||Pune: Shivneri & Shivshahi buses run by private players on roads||PUNE: In relief to commuters, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has started operations of Shivneri and Shivshahi buses in Pune. With the employees’ strike — resulting in the suspension of over 148 till now in Pune division alone — entering its fifth day, senior state transport officials said more than 10 Shivneri and Shivshahi buses were now running, with more to follow soon. “A part of the fleet of Shivneri and Shivshahi buses is owned by the MSRTC, while some are run by private operators. A few of the latter have started plying these buses from Pune to places like Mumbai, Nashik, Dhule, Satara and more,” Dyaneshwar Ranavare, the traffic manager of Pune MSRTC, said. While Shivneri buses mainly ply on Mumbai and Aurangabad routes, Shivshahi buses travel across districts. However, the higher fares remained a concern for many commuters. “The fares are at least two to three times higher than Lal Pari buses. Paying Rs450-500 for Kolhapur is too high for a lower middle-class traveller with a family, like me. To opt for trains instead, one needs a reservation. The state government should end this strike soon,” said Milind Sable, who was looking for options with his family of four at the Swargate depot on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shivneri-shivshahi-buses-run-by-pvt-players-on-roads/articleshow/87674289.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation may restart amnesty scheme for property tax||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is contemplating reintroducing an amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters. It introduced the scheme last year too and recovered around Rs500 crore from defaulters. “The previous scheme received a good response and high revenue was generated. The civic body hopes to replicate last year’s success by coming up with a similar scheme,” Hemant Rasane chairman of the standing committee, told TOI. He said while the terms and conditions of the amnesty scheme are likely to repeated, a final call on the exact discount has to be taken. A 75% discount on the penalty may be offered. According to Rasane, the civic body has around 4.5 lakh property tax defaulters, of which around 1.5 lakh have cleared their dues. Nearly 3 lakh defaulters can expect to avail the benefits of the scheme, if reintroduced. Dues amounting to Rs2,500 crore are pending. The civic areas have 11.26 lakh properties, which are liable to pay the tax. The number has gone from around 9.26 lakh to 11.26 lakh after the merger of 23 villages. Opposition parties had objected to a blanket waiver in the previous scheme. They had demanded a cap of Rs50 lakh so that habitual offenders don’t get undue benefit of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-may-restart-amnesty-scheme-for-property-tax/articleshow/87674261.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

As per an order issued by superintendent of police Nimit Goyal, Jadhav was attached to the police control room pending a departmental inquiry after a special squad busted an illegal biodiesel dispensing point at Jhalta phata in the Chikalthana police station limits in the early hours of Friday. Further, Goyal’s order also cited discrepancies found at the police station during a recent inspection. In the early hours of Friday, a team led by traffic police inspector Machindra Survase raided an open space and seized a tanker through which biodiesel was being dispensed to other heavy vehicles at the spot. The police arrested two men — Salim Shaikh (37) of Baijipura and Syed Yaser (45) of Qaisar colony — while a third suspect fled from the spot. “The raid was carried out between 12.30am and 1am. The suspects and the seized tanker have been handed over to the police station concerned for further action,” said Survase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/biodiesel-racket-police-stn-incharge-faces-action/articleshow/87675091.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: YSRC names candidates for MLC polls||AMARAVATI: The ruling YSRC on Friday declared its candidates for the upcoming MLC elections from local body constituencies. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, while sticking to the party’s social justice principle, has picked his long-time loyalists as candidates. YSRC general secretary and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy released the list of candidates at the party office. While the chief minister’s advisor (tour programme) Talasila Raghuram from Krishna has been named from the district, the party’s affairs in-charge in Kuppam KRJ Bharath has been named from Chittoor district. Kuppam constituency is represented by TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu. Former APCO (Andhra Pradesh handloom weavers cooperative society) chairman Murugudu Hanumantha Rao, who quit the TDP recently but is yet to join YSRC formally, has been gifted with the MLC ticket from Guntur district. Party sources said Jagan was keen to bring a weaver’s leader from Mangalagiri to the upper House. Mangalagiri constituency has a sizeable population of weavers, and was won by Alla Ramakrishna Reddy who defeated Naidu’s son and TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh in the 2019 assembly elections. The surprise selection of Rao has come as a shock to followers of former Chilakaluripet MLA Marri Rajasekhar, who was hoping to get the ticket. BC leaders Vamsi Krishna Yadav and V Kalyani have got tickets from Visakhapatnam. While V Kalyani could not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections due to the last-minute entry of Dr BV Satyavathi, Vamsi Krishna is the party’s Vizag city unit president, and missed the chance to become the GVMC mayor when the party picked a woman to head the civic body. Kshatriya leader Indukuri Raghuraju has been named from Vizianagaram district, while Kapu leaders Anantha Udaya Bhaskar and Ummareddi Venkateswarlu have been named from East Godavari and Guntur districts, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-names-candidates-for-mlc-polls/articleshow/87673523.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice over plea to transfer probe||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to the state government and the Banaskantha district SP in response to a petition filed by the de facto trustee of Lilavati Hospital demanding transfer of probe from Banaskantha police to a central agency in the alleged Rs 45 crore theft from a safe at the hospital building in Palanpur. In his petition, Prashant Mehta, the de facto trustee of Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust, has accused the SP and two inspectors for being hand-in-glove with other trustees, against whom Mehta has levelled allegations. On Thursday, Justice Hemant Prachchhak admitted his petition and sought response from the concerned respondents by November 25. Mehta moved the HC after the police filed a report saying that the loot of diamonds, jewellery, silverware and fancy diamonds from the collection of Maharaja of Baroda from a safe vault in the basement of Lilavati Hospital in Palanpur in 2019 was a dispute between family members regarding properties. The police also noted that no case for filing an FIR was made out. This report was filed after a court in Palanpur had directed the police to investigate Mehta’s complaint. Another court in Palanpur ordered the Palanpur City East Police Station to register an FIR. For seeking transfer of investigation, Mehta submitted before the HC that he had no faith in Banaskantha police, who are either not interested in investigating the case or they are hand-in-glove with the accused persons. The Banaskantha police have reluctantly filed the FIR under compulsion from court order. The police had earlier given save passage to the accused and many of them have fled India, he claimed. This is Mehta’s second petition in the high court. Earlier, he approached the court seeking registration of FIR on his complaint. But the high court had asked him to approach concerned magisterial court for the relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-over-plea-to-transfer-probe/articleshow/87674291.cms||---
---||Delhi||UP cops take action against officers after Delhi HC rap||Meerut: Days after the Delhi high court pulled up UP police for “illegally arresting” a Delhi-based man and his son without following protocol and for showing laxity during the probe of an elopement case, the station house officer (SHO) of Shamli, Pankaj Tyagi, and investigating officer (IO) Narendra Verma were suspended on Friday on the orders of SP (Shamli) Sukrit Madhav. On October 28, Justice Mukta Gupta had said: “Yeh UP mein chalta hoga, yahan nahi (This may work in UP, but not here)”. Uttar Pradesh Police had picked up two men from their Delhi residence – the father and brother of a man who, according to a complaint filed by his in-laws, had “kidnapped” their daughter from Shamli. The high courthad pointed out that according to the FIR, the woman was 21 years old and not a minor and yet her husband’s father and brother were arrested without informing her. The Shamli police, however, claimed that they were not aware of the woman's exact age. At the hearing, the young couple, who belong to the same caste, had said that they married with their "own free will" on July 1 this year. The man, works for an e-commerce platform in Delhi, and the woman is a final year nursing student. The woman's family owns farms in Shamli and are associated with ‘khaps’. According to police sources, the couple had eloped and the woman's brother and father approached police and filed a case of "kidnapping". A police team from Shamli then went to the man's house and arrested his father and brother whose whereabouts were not shared with the family for over a month. “The couple had approached the Delhi HC seeking protection and requested the man's father and brother be released. The HC came down heavily on the cops, saying that they had violated the law at every step and made the arrests without even informing local police,” said Avdhesh Kumar, the couple's lawyer. SP (Shamli) said, “An IPS officer is now investigating the case and the role of Shamli police. Prima facie, we found that there was laxity in the conduct of these cops which is why they were suspended. A report will be submitted soon.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/up-cops-take-action-against-officers-after-delhi-hc-rap/articleshow/87675559.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Woman attacked by stalker loses vision in both her eyes||NEW DELHI: The 26-year-old acid attack survivor undergoing treatment at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital has lost her vision in both the eyes. Doctors treating her said the next 5-6 days were crucial because she had suffered internal organ damage too. The survivor has 45% burns on her face and upper torso. Police have arrested the person who had provided the acid to her attacker, who is currently in jail. The woman’s husband, who has been in the hospital ever since the incident on November 3, said he was losing hope by the day. “She has neither eaten nor spoken in two days. Doctors are wondering if dialysis will be required. She will never be able to see her children now,” he told TOI over phone. Dr Manoj Jha, head, burns department, RML Hospital, said on Friday, “Her condition is extremely critical and she had lost vision in both her eyes. We have sought a nephrologist’s opinion on whether she needs dialysis. She suffered damage to her face, excretory organs and the upper torso plus blood loss.” The woman’s assailant, Montu, had been infuriated by the already-married woman turning down his marriage proposal and threw acid on her on November 3 in Bawana. He was arrested from Bihar on November 8. Police took him to outer north Delhi to recover a weapon he had fired at his police pursuers. He and his victim were both from Bihar and lived in the same neighbourhood in Samaypur Badli. The devastated husband told TOI, “My children are at my brother’s house but I need to work to earn money and feed them. My wife’s condition has deteriorated and I haven’t been able to leave the hospital. She cannot see any longer.” In related news, police arrested Shahjahpur native Ram Sewak, who had sold the acid to Montu and booked him under Section 285 of the IPC for endangering a human life with combustible material. Sewak claimed to have procured the acid from Nangloi and the cops are trying to trace the original source of the acid used in the ghastly incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-attacked-by-stalker-loses-vision-in-both-her-eyes/articleshow/87674344.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Ahmedabad||Fuel price rise: September VAT collection up 55% from last year||AHMEDABAD: Wondering why your monthly budgets have toppled over a year? You could attribute a significant chunk of this surge to the rise in fuel prices. In a year, as petrol became costlier by 26% and diesel by 28%, Gujarat’s mop-up through VAT on fuel went up by a whopping 55% in September this year, against last year. In October 2021, Gujarat government recorded revenues worth Rs 1,423 crore from VAT on petrol and diesel against Rs 915 crore in October last year, according to data compiled by state commercial tax department. Explaining this, Milind Torwane, state commercial tax commissioner, said, “VAT payments for a given month are paid by the 20th of the subsequent month. Therefore, the VAT collection figures of October reflect the consumption of fuel in September.  Against the previous month, the consumption has marginally gone down due to which the tax collection is less.” Noteworthily, the consumption of petrol and diesel has not undergone a significant change during the same period. While petrol consumption increased 1.6% during this time, diesel consumption went up only by 0.4%. Yet, tax collection was high as a clear function of increase in fuel prices. In September 2021, 45.1 crore litre diesel was sold against 44.9 litre in September 2020. Similarly, 24 crore litre petrol was sold against 23.6 crore litre. Industry sources said that due to flooding triggered by extended monsoon, the transport activity was marginally impacted in September. “During the monsoon season, the use of diesel in the agriculture segment usually drops as they do not need to use diesel to power pumps to draw irrigation water. That apart, even transport movement was hampered with flooding in certain parts of Saurashtra due to which the diesel consumption could have been impacted,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-price-rise-september-vat-collection-up-55-from-last-year/articleshow/87674332.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Vijayawada||AP, Telangana ministers spar over ‘financial crisis’ in states||HYDERABAD: After the fight over Krishna river water, two ministers from AP and Telangana engaged in unsavoury remarks over the ‘financial crisis’ in Telugu states, and accused each other’s government of being “bankrupt” and “begging for funds”. The ministers, Vemula Prashanth Reddy of Telangana and Perni Nani of AP, unwittingly entered into a war of words, each extolling his own government and criticising the other over alleged financial bankruptcy. It all began with Telengana roads and buildings minister Prashanth Reddy, during a dharna on paddy purchase issue in Nizamabad on Friday, alleging that Andhra people are now seeking alms. “AP had said if Telangana were to become a reality, then Telangana people would have to seek alms. But thanks to the efforts of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we (Telangana people) have utilised our revenue for our region and the revenue is not going to Andhra,” he said, while adding that “Andhra people are now seeking alms.” He further said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is also “seeking alms from the Centre”. “AP government cannot run without borrowings. Even for daily and routine expenditure, they are seeking help from the Centre. The government is fixing meters to agriculture borewells due to pressure from the Centre,” Prashant Reddy alleged. Strongly condemning the remarks, transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) wondered how Telangana government had made such huge debts since its formation if it was so rich. “TRS leaders are roaming in New Delhi seeking loans and grants with an assurance to join the NDA government at the Centre. Our chief minister (Jagan) would never speak with a double-tongue unlike TRS leaders,” Nani said. He further alleged that TRS leadership is trying for an alliance with the BJP at the Centre but posing as fighters for the cause of the poor back home. “Our party supremo’s stand is always clear and straight. AP has been making debts chiefly due to losing the ‘Kamadhenu-like’ Hyderabad and the blunders of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu,” Nani said.

However, no action has been taken so far. According to parents, the officer didn’t inquire or any further step wasn’t taken against the schools for not following rules laid down by the government amid pandemic for fee collection. Parents association has met the officer to inquire about the follow up and were given assurance for the same. Manish Vijayvargiya, conveyor of Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh, said, “Parents had given written complaint to the top officers of the education department, orders for investigation on these complaints were also issued by the officials, but even after months passed, no action was taken against the schools. We have met the DEO Ravindra Kumar, seeking action against our complaints or there is no point of complaining to the officials.” Complaints were filed by parents’ alleging that one private school had refused to give transfer certificate to a student because he was not able to pay fees. The parent of the child had written that due to pandemic, he was not able to pay full fees but the school did not consider it and refused to give TC. Another parent alleged that a fee committee was formed without consulting parents in any of the matter and without following the guidelines of Rajasthan School Fees Act. Replying to the parents’ allegations, Kumar said, “Around seven private schools were given notices. We are waiting for the report to arrive then we will send the complied report to Directorate of Education, Bikaner.” As government has allowed 100% capacity schools reopening, many private schools have shut down physical classes as well. This is against the norms of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-action-yet-against-schools-for-harassing-parents-over-school-fees/articleshow/87674342.cms||---

Not depending on any outsider, the authorities have roped in two teachers, who are currently lodged in the prison — one for a cheating case and another in a murder case — to educate about 90 inmates, who are unable to read or write any of language. As per the idea floated by SS Kosamkar, Latur’s principal district judge and chairman of DLSA, the educated and literate inmates should be tasked with educating their fellow illiterate inmates, so that there is an apt utilization of the skills of educated inmates. DLSA member secretary and civil judge senior division Swati Awasekar, who is spearheading the initiative, told TOI, “Our criminal justice system aims at reforming the inmates and our initiative is on the same lines. Teaching them to read, write and communicate in the languages of their choice, we thought it would be a great social contribution if we can make all these illiterate inmates literate.” The unique aspect of this program is that it encourages educated inmates to teach their fellow illiterate inmates, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/laturs-dlsa-starts-imparting-education-to-illiterate-inmates/articleshow/87675097.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Seeking his custody for three days, the ED said "certain facts have emerged" regarding Deshmukh's role in transfer and postings of police officials in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, adding they emerged while the agency was recording his statement and his continued custody and interrogation is "essential to unearth the truth". Need to confront Deshmukh with pvt individual who handled projects: EDThe ED, through its counsel Shreeram Shirsat, submitted before a special court on Friday that it needs to confront Deshmukh with a private individual who resides in Navi Mumbai and had “handled certain prestigious projects” in the NCP leader’s constituency and had been regularly visiting Deshmukh’s official residence. Deshmukh is a Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Nagpur. Shirsat said during the course of recording Deshmukh’s statement, certain new facts emerged, and hence ED has issued summons to the private person for his appearance on November 13. Shirsat said the person has received the summons. The ED also said “another accused Sachin Waze (dismissed assistant police inspector) has played a key role in collecting illegal gratification from the bar owners of Mumbai” on Deshmukh’s “direction”. On November 5, ED’s request to record Waze’s statement was denied by a local court, and now ED plans to file a fresh plea before the designated National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to record Waze’s statement, and based on what emerges, it wants to confront Deshmukh with facts that may arise. Deshmukh’s senior counsel Vikram Chaudhri, with advocate Aniket Nikam, said ED appears to be displaying “double standards.” Chaudhri asked, “Why is Sachin Waze being treated differently? Why has it not arrested Waze yet? Has ED issued summons to Param Bir Singh? He has three non-bailable warrants against him and is close to being declared an absconder.” He spoke of the “unfair” actions of the ED. Chaudhri said, “My client has always been in public space his entire adult life. He wanted to dispel any belief of his non-cooperation and has cooperated with the ED.” Chaudhri said Deshmukh used his legal remedy to file a quashing petition, which the Bombay high court dismissed. The HC had given him liberty to seek pre-arrest bail, and the additional solicitor general for ED had said Deshmukh was still a “suspect”, but when Deshmukh responded to the summons, on November 1, the agency took him in custody. Chaudhri said, “This is a ridiculous proceeding. The department thinks they are privileged and can do what they want. We have given more than fair cooperation. This (ED’s remand plea) amounts to over-reaching…today on what grounds can they take him in custody? Out of 14 accused, only two others have been arrested.” Chaudhri said, “The ends cannot justify the means,” adding, “All is not fair here.” Now saying that a private person is being summoned and Waze’s statement is being sought “is just a ruse to keep me (Deshmukh) in custody,” argued Chaudhri, seeking his judicial custody instead. In a rebuttal, Shirsat said, “Should the department turn a blind eye if new facts emerge?” and asked the court to “please see the statement of Waze dated November 10.” The special judge dictating his order then said ED’s effort shows its sincere attempt to investigate the offence and based on ED submissions, extended Deshmukh’s remand. By November 15, the entire legally permissible 14-day police custody would be over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-need-to-confront-deshmukh-with-pvt-individual-who-handled-projects-in-mumbai/articleshow/87674349.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Centre has already proposed seven major textile parks to be set up across the country this year. The state had placed a request for one park and had promised its support to establish it. Minister for industries, Mekapati Gautham Reddy, who concluded his two-day visit to the national capital on Friday, met several Union ministers during his visit and placed requests on behalf of the state government. The minister also made a strong request to the Centre for establishing solar power plants in the state. He told the Centre that Coal India Limited (CIL) had come forward to establish a solar wafer cell PV modular manufacturing unit at Kopparthy. This would come up at an investment of Rs 7,200 crore, for which CIL has already established a special purpose vehicle (SPV), he told the Union minister of power. Gautham Reddy also requested the Centre to allot a power equipment manufacturing zone to Andhra Pradesh. As the Centre had proposed establishing three power equipment manufacturing zones in the country, the minister wanted that one of these be set up in the state. He also offered land and other facilities at Mannavaram in Chittoor. He said Mannavaram is strategically located near the electronics and manufacturing cluster (EMC) in Satyavedu, and also close to Krishnapatnam Port. The two clusters would add value to planned heavy power equipment manufacturing operations, as resource mobilisation and logistics would be easier, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-lobbies-for-textile-park-in-kopparthy/articleshow/87673556.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Hubballi||Congress, BJP yet to finalise candidates for council polls||Hubballi: Both the national parties – the Congress and the BJP – appear to be dithering over announcing the names of their respective candidates for the forthcoming polls to the state’s legislative council. Uncertainty appears to have gripped both the parties, which appear to be confused as to best determine the credentials of a potential winner. The Congress is reportedly considering fielding a Muslim candidate in the wake of several functionaries, including senior leaders, having made a formal request to this effect. With aspirants from other communities also throwing their hat in the ring, the Congress appears to be facing a troublesome problem of plenty. Among those from the Muslim community vying for the ticket include Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president Saleem Ahmed, former minister AM Hindasgeri and Shakir Sanadi, the son of former MP IG Sanadi. However, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, along with former ministers Zameer Ahmed and Santosh Lad, is reportedly lobbying for Ismail Tamatgar. On the other hand, senior Congress leader and All India Congress Committee general secretary HK Patil is pitching hard to get the ticket for former minister Hindasgeri, who has twice represented the local bodies’ constituency in the legislative council. Anand Gaddadevarmath, yet another aspirant for the Congress ticket, may get the nod should the party decide against a Muslim face in the polls. There is no shortage of contestants for the BJP ticket either, with as many as 17 having thrown up their hand. Among the contenders is Pradeep Shettar, brother of former CM Jagadish Shettar. Karnataka BJP general secretary Mahesh Tenginkai said that the party would finalise the name of the candidate in a few days. The Karnataka unit of the party has reportedly submitted a shortlist of three names to the BJP central leadership. However, Tenginkai refused to disclose the names of the three aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/congress-bjp-yet-to-finalise-candidates-for-council-polls/articleshow/87673318.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The victim, Virendra Kumar, had filed an application before the court of additional district and sessions Judge (IV) Parul Verma, after he had approached the Apex court against him in 2017, who issued the bailable warrants against the duo and directed them to appear in the court on November 15. According to an order copy, Kumar, a scheduled caste, was elected at BDC in 2017. He had accused Upadhyay and his associates for allegedly kidnapping him to get his vote in 2017 MLC (member of Legislative Council) elections. He claimed that he had lodged a police complaint against the minister at Chandpa police station then but due to his influence, police closed the file after a biased probe. He had then approached the Apex court and the court directed CB-CID to investigate the matter in July 2017. Two years later, Upadhyay visited Bisana village with his convoy. After seeing the complainant, the former minister allegedly started passing casteist remarks and threatened him with dire consequences for approaching the court against him. When Kumar confronted him saying that he was doing his work, Upadhyay had asked his associates to put him in a vehicle. However, he failed to "kidnap" him as local people were present there. Kumar had tried to lodge a police complaint against him, but no FIR was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bailable-warrant-issued-against-ex-min-aide-in-kidnapping-case/articleshow/87673570.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Vadodara||Minister supports Rajkot, Vadodara municipal bodies||Vadodara: Action taken against street vendors selling non-vegetarian food in Rajkot and the directives to ensure that they cover their food in Vadodara, seem to have found support from state revenue minister Rajendra Trivedi. When asked about the developments, Trivedi said that footpaths were meant for pedestrians and nobody should do business there. Trivedi told media persons that the footpaths should not be encroached and using them for business was a type of land grabbing. “Any ‘laari’ — veg or non-veg cannot stand there,” he said in Vadodara. Trivedi said that the smoke from non-vegetarian and even vegetarian food troubled people and went in their eyes. He congratulated the mayors of Vadodara and Rajkot for taking action. In another media interaction, Trivedi said it was widely reported that omelette and non-vegetarian ‘laaris’ used to occupy footpaths and operate at timings when commuters faced problems. He added that the display of these food items in public was also not proper and could also lead to diseases. Trivedi said that he would urge the police commissioners that such ‘laaris’ and other things obstructing footpaths be removed. The Rajkot and Vadodara municipal corporations have issued oral directives, especially, ensuring that non-vegetarian street food carts stay ‘invisible’ in the public eye. The ruling BJP in Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) acted first with oral order to its officers to remove street vendors selling non-vegetarian food and egg dishes from the main roads. Officials, however, maintain that they are not specifically targeting non-veg food vendors but are taking action anywhere they receive a complaint of encroachment. Rajkot mayor Pradeep Dav himself started the drive after he got several complaints. He held meetings with some non-vegetarian food vendors before Diwali and instructed them to shift from the main roads. In Vadodara, chairman of the standing committee of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), Dr Hitendra Patel gave instructions in this regard to officials at a meeting on Wednesday evening. “We are asking the vendors to ensure that they do not hang or display non-vegetarian food. They will have to keep it covered,” said Patel. The chairman said that this was done to ensure that hygiene is maintained and sentiments are not hurt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/minister-supports-rajkot-vadodara-municipal-bodies/articleshow/87674616.cms||---

The CID had registered a case based on a complaint given by Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy under the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, AP Assigned Lands (prohibition of transfer) Act, and various sections of IPC. Reddy alleged that Naidu and Narayana along with others conspired to extend undue favours to their henchmen by changing the rules of Assigned Lands Act. He further claimed that they cheated poor Dalit farmers in the capital region and illegally purchased lands through their benamis from farmers at throwaway prices and later changed the rules in the Act. Naidu and Narayana moved the HC seeking to quash the case. After hearing the petitions, the court on March 19 stayed all further proceedings in the case through an interim direction. As the interim relief is about to expire, senior counsel Dammalapati Srinivas, on behalf of Naidu, sought relief from the court. Considering his request, the court extended the interim stay on further proceedings of the case by eight weeks and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.

According to officials, the budget this year is likely to be presented around 10 days earlier. The south corporation is likely to present its budget on November 23, while the north and east civic bodies will present their respective budgets two days later. The entire budget-making process is expected to be over by December, which earlier used to be February. This will be the last budget before the civic body polls slated to be held next year. In view of the polls, the budget is likely to cover people-friendly schemes and policies. According to an official, every year, the process starts around the third week of December when all the departments are asked to send in their proposals on new schemes and their achievements. The information and publicity department of all the three corporations are already working on compiling all the data. South Delhi Municipal Corporation will hold a special standing committee meeting where the commissioner of the corporation will present the budget. According to the rules, the budget has to be presented in the standing committees by December third week. After this, discussions take place among ward committees and standing committees on the proposals before the budget is finally approved by February. North and east corporations are likely to present their budget proposals by November 25 and 26, respectively. The civic elections, as per Municipal Act, have to be completed by the month of April as it is in the first week of April that the nomination of mayor and deputy mayor has to be completed. All the three corporations are facing a financial crunch. North and east corporations are even facing problems in giving salaries to their employees. In such a scenario, there could be proposals to increase the revenue of the civic bodies. One of the main sources of revenue for the corporations is property tax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-poll-yr-corpn-budgets-to-be-out-early/articleshow/87674365.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Cop lens on bus drivers for traffic rule violations||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police launched a drive against errant bus drivers on Friday and started prosecuting them for breaking several traffic and permit norms. The drive spearheaded by the Tiljala traffic Guard had kicked off initially with surprise raids on Monday and Tuesday on the EM Bypass. “We are keeping tabs on frequent overtaking of buses, rash driving, route permits and picking up passengers from the road other than designated stops,” said an officer. At least 45 to 60 bus drivers are being prosecuted for violations each day. “Cops have warned the owners and drivers that they will be slapped with Motor Vehicles Act 207 to get their buses seized if they flout the rules,” the officer added. Cops have also warned the bus owners against pending challans. “All the owners of the buses with a high number of pending cases and those, who have not renewed permits in the past two years, have been asked to pay up and renew the permits at the earliest. During raids, cops found that the buses are involved in two forms of traffic violations frequently — picking and dropping passengers on the road other than bus stops and overtaking. The raids started following the Highland park accident on the EM Bypass when a bus — that had 500 pending cases and plied on the route, for which it did not have a permit — mowed down a biker on the day of Bhai Phonta. However, cops said they have not yet come across any such bus that plies without a permit. “Almost all the buses have a permits. The problem lies in that the permits have not been renewed during the pandemic as RTO remained shut for a long time and the buses stayed off the road,” said an officer, adding that cops are ready to carry out joint raids with the transport department officials to find the buses plying with permits for different routes. Cops at the Beliaghata traffic guard said that they are fining the bus drivers for overtaking and rash driving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-lens-on-bus-drivers-for-traffic-rule-violations/articleshow/87674368.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

If family members of the deceased file a complaint, an FIR will be registered.” Altaf's Father Caahat Miyan being consoled by visitorsOn Friday, TOI accessed a video (recorded at 6:06 pm on Tuesday) which shows police taking out the body of Altaf from the hospital to transfer it to the postmortem house at the district hospital. The postmortem was started at about 11 pm that night. According to Altaf's family members, they got information regarding his death from local reporters at around 6 pm. But when they reached the hospital 30 minutes later, police did not allow them to see the body. "We have been saying that our son was murdered in police custody. Now we are being told that the FIR was filed after he had already died. This should be probed by the top police officers and court," an uncle of Altaf said. Family members of Altaf said police had picked him up from his house on Monday around 8 pm after he returned from work, saying he had kidnapped a girl. However, Kasganj superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod had claimed that Altaf was brought for questioning on Tuesday morning. The SP added that Altaf was "suffering from depression and attempted suicide in the washroom of the lock-up". Police had earlier said that Altaf “strangled himself using the drawstring of the hood of his jacket from a tap in the washroom." Later it was revealed that Altaf was about 5.6 ft tall and the tap barely 3 ft in height. According to the FIR filed by the girl’s father against Altaf and an anonymous “friend”, the girl ran away with the latter and headed for Delhi taking along her clothes and academic certificates. The FIR was registered at the Sadar Kotwali police station under sections 363 and 366 (kidnapping and abduction) of the IPC. This comes even as the girl hasn't been traced by police 72 hours after Altaf’s death. A special team has been formed to look for her. Her family, meanwhile, has locked their house in Kasganj and are at an undisclosed location. The dead boy's family asked, "Which girl during her abduction would remember to take her clothes and school certificates along, and which kidnapper would allow that?" Altaf's father Caahat Miyan said, Why would Altaf go to work and stay at home if he had indeed kidnapped someone?" Altaf’s mother said, “I have no trust in the local authorities. I want the death of my child to be investigated by the CBI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-lock-up-death-police-filed-fir-after-man-had-died-in-custody/articleshow/87673585.cms||Deepak Lavania

The state government employees’ Joint Action Committee comprising AP NGOs Association and Amaravati JAC alleged that the government is resorting to delaying tactics without releasing the pay revision commission’s (PRC) report. The JAC also questioned the absence of the chief secretary at the meeting. Speaking to the media, AP NGOs Association president Bandi Srinivasa Rao said the government is testing the patience of its employees. He said there would be no discussions with the government till it released the report. “We are unable to understand what the government intends. We are surprised at the deliberate delay in release of the report,” said Srinivasa Rao. He also questioned what senior officials could discuss with the associations without providing the details of the recommendations of the PRC. Stating that the government is committed to addressing the grievances of employees, principal finance secretary Shamsher Singh Rawat assured that everything would be streamlined by March 2022. Addressing the meeting, Rawat said the government had granted 27% interim relief soon after Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. He added the government could not deliberate on issues related to the PRC due to financial troubles imposed by Covid-19. “Since revenues are slowly limping back, the government is hopeful of setting all issues on track by March 2022,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/employee-unions-stage-walkout-over-delay-in-prc-report-release/articleshow/87673599.cms||Samdani MN

The BMC board of administrators member, Pranay Roy, who is heading the teams, held a meeting with the health workers to discuss how they will work and coordinate with each other. “Each of the six quick action teams comprises health and conservancy workers along with the respective ward coordinators and supervisors. One assistant engineer will supervise the work of each team. All the 41 wards will be inspected by these quick action teams regularly to check if there is any accumulation of water, where mosquitoes can breed. If found, immediate action will be taken to clean up the places along with spraying larvicides and fogging,” said Roy. The teams will work till the end of December. There has been a spike in dengue cases across BMC and the adjacent areas under South Dum Dum Municipality. Since October 1, over 150 dengue cases have been reported. Satabdi Saha (33), a resident of Baguiati’s Ashwininagar, died of dengue shock syndrome last Monday and this first dengue death in a BMC area this season brought back the memories of three years ago, when several people succumbed to the disease in Baguiati, Kestopur and Salt Lake. BMC officials said that heavy rain, which continued till September, triggered waterlogging in many places and this resulted in the spike in dengue cases. “We close our windows after lunch. We have been doing this for the last 30 years,” said Dipannita Bakshy, a resident of BL block close to the Eastern Drainage canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anti-dengue-drive-starts-in-bidhannagar/articleshow/87674374.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The authorities blocked traffic movement on a 200-metre stretch of the road between Baguiati Joramandir and Big Bazaar crossing on the Kolkata-bound flank as the PWD workers scraped the the top layer while preparing the road for a relaying. The officials said the work on the entire 8km road between Ultadanga and Jessore Road will be completed till early next year. “In the first phase we have started re-sectioning the most affected stretches of VIP Road that have completely lost elasticity and are prone to developing large craters and potholes after rain. We are removing the top layer as well as the inner portions of the road and then we will refill it with a bituminous layer. Once the inner layer is strengthened, we will apply the final coat of mechanised mastic asphalt that will prevent water seepage and make the road long lasting,” said a PWD executive engineer, who is in charge of the maintenance of the road. TOI had written on October 28 on how four major city roads were set to be repaired, using a technology that promised to make the process “pollution-free”. While the authorities began the work with VIP Road, they will take up the repairs of Red Road, Mayo Road and Hospital Road in the future. According to PWD engineers, the new technology is set to be a “game-changer” in road engineering. The “Gussasphalt machine” that is imported from Germany will also make the work five times faster than the existing methods, said an engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-tech-to-repave-battered-vip-road/articleshow/87674383.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||City remembers Dostoevsky in author’s bicentenary year||Kolkata: Even two centuries after his birth, Fyodor Dostoevsky remains relevant to the modern society and its complexities, said scholars at a seminar on Friday. The event was organised at Gorky Sadan to celebrate the bicentenary of the novelist. Apart from literary discussions, an exhibition of books and photographs by the Dostoevsky Museum of St Petersburg was inaugurated as part of a series of events. Dostoevsky’s writings offer a glimpse of the society in 19th century Russia. Though his writings were considered to be dark and sombre, but juxtaposition of that greyish-brown tone in writing with splashes of colour was a style that was uniquely his, said scholars at the seminar. The exhibition of paintings gave visitors a glimpse of the fashion of the times. Interestingly, Dostoevsky himself was a very fashionable man and this seeped into his characters, and the exhibition of pictures made that evident. “He reminded people that no one was born a criminal and there were several reasons why a person converts into one. We must not forget that he was one of the principal figures who brought about prison reforms in Russia,” said Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das. Alexey Idamkin, consul general of Russia, described Dostoevsky as one of the greatest novelists that Russia ever produced. “His writings were a combination of existentialism, theology and psychology,” Idamkin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-remembers-dostoevsky-in-authors-bicentenary-year/articleshow/87674403.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He held several state-level posts and was instrumental in attracting scores of students and youths to Congress. Terming his demise as a huge loss to the party, TNCC president K S Alagiri said he had launched National Students Tamil Development Committee to cultivate Tamil affinity among the student community. Thanjavur DCC treasurer Vayalur S Ramanathan said Ramamoorthy launched Tamil development committee after the Congress lost in the 1967 assembly election over anti-Hindi protests. “Instead of calling it Hindi opposition, he preferred to call it Tamil development as an optimistic approach. His efforts to rope in students to Congress paid off with chairmen in 154 of 168 colleges in the state hailing from the Congress party then,” he said. Ramamoorthy who pursued his law degree at government law college in Chennai developed close connections with former chief minister K Kamaraj and others. He also worked as a teacher in Karandhai Tamil Sangam in Thanjavur before his political entry. Ramamoothy quit Congress after the demise of Kamaraj and launched Kamaraj Congress. He was with Janata Dal for some time before returning to Congress. As a reputed lawyer, he was known for his powerful speeches and argumentative skill. Ramanathan said ‘Thanjaiyar’ kept the audience spellbound for a record 3.5 hours at a public meeting at Thilagar Thidal several years ago. As a writer, Ramamoorthy had authored books on Vallalar and Vivekanandar and one titled ‘Buddhan Enum Maanudan’ was released a month ago. He is survived by his wife Saraswathi, daughter Ammu and son Appu. AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran was among those who condoled the death. Ramamoorthy’s last rites will be held in Thanjavur on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veteran-congress-leader-thanjaiyar-passes-away/articleshow/87674399.cms||---

On his return from Delhi after receiving the recognition from President Ram Nath Kovind, the social worker said he would continue working for his cause and is open to sharing his expertise with the urban local body to improve the city’s hygiene and sanitation. A resident of Ramalinga Nagar, Subburaman constructed over 1.20 lakh toilets in various parts of the country. Environment-friendly and requiring less water, toilet models such as EcoSan were established in rural Trichy. He was also instrumental in establishing a sanitation park in the city where dozens of toilet models were displayed to promote awareness among children. Empanelled in the smart city advisory forum last year, Subburaman said basic amenities and sanitation needs must be addressed first before going for beautification. “We still need a lot of urinals in the city to overcome open urination threats. Covid-19 has implied the need for handwash centres and improved urban sanitation,” Subburaman said. Stating that he is willing to offer his expertise in rainwater harvesting, the social worker said that the ongoing monsoon can be utilised by the civic body to identify inundation-prone areas to establish roadside RWHs. Subburaman has a zero waste sustainable house that uses rainwater for domestic needs. He said authorities must hold discussions with experts to make a project successful, pointing to the Trichy corporation’s poor choice of locations for installing over 10 RWH pits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/padma-shri-awardee-build-more-toilets-in-trichy-city/articleshow/87674408.cms||---

The farming system, which facilitates recycling and reusing of nutrients in the culture medium, is benefited by the limited or zero water exchange. Most importantly, the system reduces the utilisation of protein-rich feed and the cost of standard feed. It is a technology adopted by aquaculture wherein turbid water in fish ponds is reused by filtering unwanted substances and metabolites and converting them into nutrients. “We have installed a unit of biofloc fish farming at Ela, Old Goa and have trained fish farmers in converting toxic materials such as fish excreta in the water into a single cell protein. This eliminates the need to give pelleted feed to the fish, thus saving cost on feed cost worth lakhs of rupees,” a fisheries officer told TOI. Preparing the floc in the fish farm requires a 20:1 ratio of carbon and nitrogen. Probiotics such as molasses, jaggery, sugar and wheat flour can be used as a carbon source. Good soil, urea or yeast can be used as a source of nitrogen. After 24 hours of good aeration, the floc is ready. To test it, the residue of 15-20 ml and precipitate is required to be checked. “The process only requires a tank of water, prawns that require to be fed till there is excreta in the tank, followed by floc which will convert the excreta into feed. Anyone who has space behind their house to carry out this procedure can do so,” the officer said. The system can be used for the culture of fish as well, besides shrimp. While shrimp can be harvested in 90 days, the harvest of fish will take five to six months. Besides converting the waste into nutrients, there is less water exchange in this system. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) scheme of the Central government, a subsidy of 40% has been announced for biofloc fish farming for large, medium and small categories. All the expenses from setting up tanks and other requirements for doing the biofloc fish farming, depositing the fish seeds, expenses of feeding them to until the time of harvesting of the fishes, are covered under the scheme. The directorate of fisheries in Goa has therefore started training fish farmers in this technology. A total of 40 candidates are currently being trained for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biofloc-fish-farming-gains-traction-training-sessions-begin/articleshow/87674426.cms||Nida Sayed

They stated that most of the villagers are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. The Pudhukanmoi, an irrigation tank that extends to 40 acres which is situated in the village, acts as a major water source for agricultural activities.The petitioners stated that the Centre in 2018 had issued a notification for laying Melur-Karaikudi national highway project which crosses through the centre of the Pudhukanmoi. This project would ruin the waterbody and would also affect agricultural activities.That apart, it would also affect 50 houses in the colony where people belonging to the scheduled caste community are residing. Hence, the petitioners moved the HC Madurai bench seeking not to lay the highways across the waterbody and sought to lay the highways in an alternative route. However, the NHAI in its counter submitted that the proposed alignment does not bisect the Pudhukanmoi. A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan gave the direction to the Sivaganga collector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-against-laying-road-over-sivaganga-waterbody/articleshow/87675144.cms||---

As on Friday, Mumbai had administered 92,35,708 first jabs, just 838 shy of the estimated adult population of 92,36,546. Statistically, a 100% single dose coverage, however, shouldn't make Mumbai complacent as there are still unvaccinated areas. An internal assessment by BMC has found that several wards may be far below the required coverage. Mumbai has administered a total 1,51,97,031 doses, fully immunising nearly 60 lakh people. However, a chunk of beneficiaries were residents of adjoining townships in MMR. Within the state, Pune and Sindhudurg are next in line to reach 100% first dose coverage. Mumbai has capacity to vaccinate 2 lakh daily, 2nd doses now main priorityAgainst Mumbai’s 100%, Delhi has administered first doses equal to 88.5% of its population, Bengaluru 88% and Chennai 82% respectively.On January 16, the vaccination drive started with merely 10 centres. On Day 1, 1,926 healthcare workers showed up to get vaccinated against the planned target of 4,000. Eleven months later, the city now has 462 vaccination centres, including 146 private centres. The city now has a capacity to vaccinate nearly 2lakh people in a day. In the age categories, 106% senior citizens have been covered with a single shot. In the 45-59 years too, 106% have been given a single dose, while more than 88% have got one dose in 18-44 category. “Mumbai’s well-organised vaccination centres were a big draw for people who flocked from the MMR and other districts,” said an official from the immunisation department. The civic officials believe that at least 20% of vaccinations done in the city could be for MMR citizens. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said Mumbai reaching the milestone before other cities was a testimony to the efforts that the health workers had put in. He said vaccination wouldn’t slow down, neither would immunisation centres be reduced drastically as more than 35lakh people are yet to take their second doses. Besides, at least 11 wards have immunisation coverage much lower than the city average as per a evaluation done on the basis of population estimates in wards. “We plan to cover whoever is left in the door-to-door vaccination that is being carried out,” the official said. “There could be hesitancy in 5-10% population,” said the official. Recalling the initial days of vaccination, Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC jumbo hospital said that the initial two months saw a lull before the scramble for vaccines began. “Over the months, the faith was built. Even healthcare and frontline workers who stayed away, wanted to get vaccinated,” he said. On its busiest days, BKC vaccinated more than 7,000 people in a single day. “It’s great news to have achieved 100% single dose coverage but the real milestone would be reached when we cover 100% people with both doses,” Dere said. Many centres have vaccinated more than 3-3.5lakh people. Dr Sachin Desai, Maharashtra’s immunisation in-charge, said every district should follow Mumbai’s example. “It’s the most populated district in the state, yet they managed to achieve the milestone before others,” he said. The civic official said that the private sector should be credited for the milestone as they have administered nearly 58 lakh doses in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-has-capacity-to-vaccinate-2-lakh-daily-2nd-doses-now-main-priority/articleshow/87674429.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||Now, you can adopt a Kolkata zoo animal for a month||KOLKATA: A recent tweak in the ‘adopt-an-animal’ policy by the Alipore zoo has led to a renewed interest by ‘foster parents’ in the scheme. The scheme, launched in August 2013, was available only in annual adoption fee format till a few months ago. But in September, the zoo officials decided to introduce a monthly scheme for adoption after queries from interested persons. “For instance, the annual adoption fee for a tiger is Rs 2,00,000. But recently, we introduced a monthly fee option of Rs 20,000. This way, anyone interested can adopt the animal even for a month,” said zoo director Asish Kumar Samanta. The recent adoptions happened through the monthly scheme include that of a zebra (September 6 to October 5 for Rs 3,000), a kangaroo (September 6 to October 5 for Rs 2,500), a cockatiel (September 12 to October 11 for Rs 200) and an iguana (October 25 to November 24 for Rs 500). And, the new scheme seems to be yielding results. Compared to 2020-21 and 2019-20, when only four and five adoptions, respectively, had taken place — as per data on zoo website — 19 animals have already been adopted this year, including four through monthly scheme. Eleven adoptions happened after the introduction of new scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-you-can-adopt-a-kol-zoo-animal-for-a-month/articleshow/87674427.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
---||Madurai||Prevent production of ganja to stop smuggling: Madras high court||MADURAI: The volume of ganja which is in circulation in a few districts is shocking and warrants serious consideration, the Madras high court has said and added that the main thing which could be done is that it should be nipped in the bud by preventing its production. Justice B Pugalendhi observed that narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances have several medical and scientific uses, however, the use of such substances are also being abused. In order to get a clear picture of the ground reality, this court clubbed the matters seeking bail and anticipatory bail in relation to offences under the NDPS Act, for the past two months. The judge observed that it appears that approximately 4,000kg of ganja was involved in these cases. This whopping quantity of ganja involved in the petitions filed in a couple of months exposes the volume of ganja that is in circulation within a few districts. The judge observed that there exists a perception that using drugs and alcohol can feel like the perfect way to escape life stressors and other difficult issues. When a person is drunk or high, he may experience positive and euphoric feelings and may feel ecstasy. At the same time, such substances can dull emotions and make painful feelings disappear temporarily. For this reason, many people end up using such substances to cope with emotional pain, bad memories, poor sleep, guilt, shame, anxiety, or terror. “Finances, relationships, and personal wellbeing all get sacrificed, while the underlying issues with which the person was struggling would only tend to worsen. The escape that the substances provide are temporary, but the costs are permanent. The ‘cure’ for the internal pain, actually creates a much worse problem. In other words, what seemed euphoric and like heaven, can quickly become a personal hell,” observed the judge. The judge observed that use of such substances result in a rise in crimes. “The drug-crime relationship is of three types - violation of drug laws, crimes motivated under the influence of drugs and crimes to rely on the drugs. We are also witnessing the emergence of juvenile crimes, such as chain snatching, sexual abuse and other offences, under the influence of such substances,” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ganja-circulation-huge-nip-its-production-in-bud-hc/articleshow/87675143.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Justice G Ilangovan passed the order while hearing the petition filed by Ranjith. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner participated in a meeting organised by Neelapuligal Movement on June 5, 2019, delivered a speech related to the land rights during the King Rajaraja Cholan period.

His speech was also about how the people in the delta region became landless. He stated that his intention was not to affect the sentiments of any particular community or religious group of people but was only to voice in favour of aggrieved persons. He stated his intention was to bring awareness among the people. Hence, he sought to quash the FIR against him. It maybe recalled that during the course of the earlier hearing, the court had stayed the filing of the chargesheet in this case. In 2019, the court had also granted anticipatory bail to Ranjith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-quashes-fir-against-director-pa-ranjith/articleshow/87675142.cms||---

The team led by cooperative minister I Periasamy on Friday said about 9,250 acres in Thanjavur and 42,500 acres in Tiruvarur have been affected. Periasamy told reporters after visiting Madhukur block in Thanjavur that about 9,250 acres of samba crop in 42 villages in the block has been submerged by rainwater. In the afternoon, the team visited Tiruvarur. After completing the assessment there, Periasamy said about 42,500 acres of paddy crop has been damaged in the district. Collector P Gayathri Krishnan and officials were present. “All the samba crop in Madukkur area is submerged and the roots have begun to rot. If the water recedes, the government will take steps to revive the crops. After completing our visit to the affected areas throughout the delta, we will submit a report to the chief minister. The government will take steps to sanction required compensation,” he said. The team also comprised ministers Thangam Thennarasu, S Regupathy, K R Periyakaruppan, R Sakkarapani, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, and CV Meyyanathan. Asked as to what steps that the government was taking to avert such damage, Periasamy said the CM had sanctioned crores of rupees to desilt important canals immediately after the government took charge. Necessary action would be taken to prevent rainwater from entering the fields, he assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/51000-acres-of-paddy-damaged-in-delta-dists-ministers-team/articleshow/87674423.cms||---

Workers under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) filled over 50 potholes on the highway that links central and western districts in the past two days. The highway which passes through Kambarasampettai, Jeeyapuram and Thirupparaithurai hamlets on the city’s suburbs had been in bad shape for months now. One portion of it is maintained by state highways and its widening is nearing completion while another is maintained by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). As the road abuts Cauvery river, the narrow stretch is prone to fatal accidents. In the recent rains, numerous potholes have surfaced near Jeeyapuram . A jurisdictional confusion between state and national highways departments over the road meant that requests for maintenance of the damaged road have fallen on deaf ears. With villagers using the road meeting with accidents, locals of Andhanallur involving MGNREGA workers filled the potholes without waiting for the officials. Soil excavated from other work sites were used for filling the potholes. “Around 80 workers filled and levelled the 50 plus potholes on the 2 km between Jeeyapuram and Thindukkarai. Even before the monsoon, the road was not motorable,” Andhanallur panchayat president Priyanka Anandhan told TOI. Highway patrol police also pitched in by streamlining vehicles passing through the stretch. Although a toll plaza is situated about 3 km away, the villagers said that no support had come from the toll collected for accessing the highway. Sources in Thirupparaithurai toll plaza said the road must be maintained by state highways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/villagers-fill-potholes-on-natl-highway-using-mgnrega-workers/articleshow/87674420.cms||Deepak Karthik

The government has instructed all e-Seva centres to be open on Saturday and Sunday to enable farmers to enrol their names. Officials of concerned departments have also been asked to extend all help to farmers to remit insurance premiums before the last date. Farmers have been expressing their inability to remit the premium as the revenue and agriculture departments are busy with rain-related relief works. In a statement, the agriculture production commissioner said the concerned officials have been constantly involved in the process of getting an extension of the last date from the Union government. Besides all e-Seva centres, authorities of all primary agriculture credit cooperative societies (PACCS) have been asked to transact business for farmers who need crop loans for samba cultivation. Village administrative officers (VAOs) have been instructed to provide required certificates to farmers for both crop insurance and crop loans, the statement added. District-level teams headed by district collectors will monitor the entire process, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-releases-steps-to-help-farmers-insure-crop-under-pm-scheme/articleshow/87674434.cms||---

On October 28, Justice Mukta Gupta had said: “Yeh UP mein chalta hoga, yahan nahi (This may work in UP, but not here)”. UP Police had picked up two men from their Delhi residence – the father and brother of a man who, according to a complaint filed by his in-laws, had “kidnapped” their daughter from Shamli. The HC had pointed out that according to the FIR, the woman was 21 years old and not a minor and yet her husband’s father and brother were arrested without informing her. The Shamli police, however, claimed that they were not aware of the woman's exact age. At the hearing, the young couple, who belong to the same caste, had said that they married with their "own free will" on July 1 this year. The man, works for an e-commerce platform in Delhi, and the woman is a final year nursing student. The woman's family owns farms in Shamli and are associated with ‘khaps’. According to police sources, the couple had eloped and the woman's brother and father approached police and filed a case of "kidnapping". A police team from Shamli then went to the man's house and arrested his father and brother whose whereabouts were not shared with the family for over a month. “The couple had approached the Delhi HC seeking protection and requested the man's father and brother be released. The HC came down heavily on the cops, saying that they had violated the law at every step and made the arrests without even informing local police,” said Avdhesh Kumar, the couple's lawyer. Speaking to TOI, SP (Shamli) said, "An IPS officer is now investigating the case and the role of Shamli police. Prima facie, we found that there was laxity in the conduct of these cops which is why they were suspended. A report will be submitted to the court and the government soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/shamli-sho-io-removed-after-del-hc-says-yeh-up-mein-chalta-hai/articleshow/87673656.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Four Mumbai wards show 1st dose coverage of only 40-55%: BMC||MUMBAI: Four Mumbai civic wards have low first dose coverage of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to an assessment carried out by the BMC. Wards found lagging were L from the eastern suburbs, R Central from western suburbs, and G North and B from south Mumbai.L (Kurla-Chunabhatti) is at the bottom with 40% first dose coverage and 24% second dose coverage. R Central (Borivli, Gorai) which has given the first shot to 44% and second dose to 37% is the second lowest. The first dose coverage of G north (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim and Shivaji Park), was 52% and that for the second dose was 35%. For the thinly populated B ward (Dongri and Umarkhadi), the first dose coverage was 55% and second dose 39%. To micro-analyse the actual coverage across 24 wards, BMC collated doses administered at vaccination centres in each ward and compared it with the ward’s estimated population. Findings are not fool-proof as CoWin doesn’t recognise geographical limits, said a civic official. But the exercise was carried out to get a rough idea about pockets where coverage is less. Mumbai has statistically achieved 100% first dose coverage on Friday. But there are wide variations. Several wards show 40-85% coverage while certain others have vaccinated more than 300% of their population, the data showed. D (Malabar Hill-Warden Road), for instance, has posted first dose coverage of 350%. Against an eligible population of 2.53lakh, 8.89lakh doses have been given. Similarly, A ward (Fort-Colaba-Churchgate) has registered single dose coverage of 192% and second dose coverage of 151%. At least 10 wards have more than 100% single dose coverage. An official said wards with more vaccination centres, or those that started early in the drive, have administered more doses. “It is, therefore, difficult to say, which ward has reached how much coverage accurately. People in Kurla, for instance, could have got vaccinated elsewhere,” the official said. Officials of L ward said their first dose coverage (74%) and second dose (42%) was higher than what was deduced from the assessment. “More than 75% of the population lives in slums. They cannot afford any mode of transport other than trains, and hence people have got vaccinated. They may have taken the shots in other wards and hence may not be reflecting in L ward figures,” said Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical officer of L ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-city-wards-show-1st-dose-coverage-of-only-40-55-in-mumbai-bmc/articleshow/87674446.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The court also slapped a fine of Rs 1.6 lakh on the convict. The convict is a native of Vengamedu in Karur district. The victims aged 10, 12 and 13 were residing in the same locality. As they lost their father, their mother has been taking care of them. The convict used to perform puja in his house and often invited the girls to provide ‘Pongal’ as prasadam. On one instance, he asked the girls to come one by one to get Pongal. During that time, he sexually harassed the three girls separately. When the mother came to know about this, she lodged a complaint with the Vengamedu police in 2019. Based on the compliant, police registered a case under various IPC section including Pocso Act and arrested him. As the hearing concluded, the mahila court judge pronounced the judgments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-gets-25-years-jail-for-sexually-harassing-3-minors/articleshow/87674435.cms||---

The observations came when the director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) said the forensic report in a bribery case was delayed due to shortage of staff. The court had sought an explanation for the delay. The court noted that the director had gone into the details about the workload on an officer of the level of SSOII (physics) and his involvement in many high-profile cases across India. The director also mentioned 302 cases had been pending with CFSL, some since 2015. “Shortage of staff is no justification for delay in giving the expert opinion reports, which has a direct bearing on the trial of serious and heinous offences. The agency is expected to take up the matter of shortage of staff with the authorities concerned and this cannot be taken as a ready-made excuse or justification..., whenever called upon by the courts to showcause for enormous delay on its part,” special judge Santosh Snehi Mann said on Monday. The judge further said the chargesheet was filed without the expert opinion and, hence, a lot of judicial time was wasted as cognisance could not be taken. The court allowed a week’s time to the investigating officer after being informed that CBI had received the report, but it had been pending administrative approval for filing before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/courts-concern-over-300-cases-pending-at-cfsl/articleshow/87674437.cms||Usha Das
---||Kolkata||90% students take NAS, happy to be back in school after 20 months||Kolkata: More than 90% students of classes III, V, VIII and X at various schools, which had enrolled for a nationwide examination to check the teaching-learning progress during the pandemic, took the test on Friday. The high turnout for National Achievement Survey (NAS), despite the apprehensions and misgivings of parents, was encouraging for schools, which are set to reopen their campuses in phases from Tuesday. Educationists viewed the exercise as a confidence-booster for resumption of physical classes. The students were the most delighted to be back to school. The masks did hide the smiles but could hardly veil the excitement and glee apparent on the children’s faces. Though initially unsure about sending their wards to school amid the pandemic, parents, too, seemed glad to allow their children to appear for the in-person NAS test. Nine out of 10 parents gave their consent, leading to an attendance of over 90% at most schools. Maximum 30 students were allocated to a class on an average. The CBSE conducted the exams nationwide, on instructions from the education ministry, to check how teaching-learning had progressed during the Covid pandemic, during which campuses were shut and studies shifted online. In Bengal, 3,165 schools affiliated to various boards were selected for the exercise. Children of classes III, V, VIII and X were tested for language, maths, social sciences and science, depending on the standards they are in. Classes III and V took their test from 10.30am to noon, while the exams for the higher classes ended at 12.30pm. All the children of chosen classes reached their schools between 8am and 8.30am for attendance, which was taken by CBSE-appointed observers. After this, a draw of lots selected 30 children from each class for the test. “I loved it. There was no syllabus and we just randomly prepared for the test. We didn’t even know whether we would get a chance to write the test or not because only a small number was to get selected by lottery, but we were happy preparing. The best bit was that we could once again sit in our classrooms and write a pen-and-paper test. It was a relief,” said Aratrika Das, a Class-X student at South Point School. “Before the survey, I was both nervous and excited. But the questions put me at ease as I knew the answers to most. It felt so unreal to be back in school with my friends after 20 months of staying away. We feel said that we won’t be coming to school from Tuesday as we are from junior classes,” said Ojaswee Thaldi, a student of Class V at Sushila Birla Girls’ School. Of the 119 students of Class V at this school, 108 entered the school before 8am. Teachers of host schools did not enter the survey rooms that were designated for the test since the entire affair was managed by teachers of other schools, appointed as observers. Field investigators were appointed by the state education department to ensure the test went off smoothly. In some schools, like St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, where children of Class III took part in the survey, special precautions were taken so that there was no crowding anywhere as masked kids walked in, sanitised their hands and went straight to the survey rooms for their attendance and training on how to use the OMR sheets. “We were taught in school on how to use the OMR sheet. I could write the test so well,” said little Sounavo Ghoshal. Parents wearing masks and maintaining social distancing waited patiently outside, after dropping their kids off at the school gates. Many had taken the day off to accompany their children to exam centres. They admitted they were initially apprehensive about sending their children to school before the formal reopening but later, they were glad that the gave the consent. “We debated a lot in the parents’ social media groups. Many said they would not send their kids even after physical reopening and so, there was no question of sending the children now. But later, many saw reason in the whole arrangement, especially after the school assured us of taking all safety measures. But now I am happy and relieved that we took the plunge,” said advocate Praloy Chowdhury, who spent the day outside South Point, as his child wrote the exam inside .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/90-students-take-nas-happy-to-be-back-in-school-after-20-months/articleshow/87674444.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

On Friday, Naik also filed a complaint with the state's vigilance department over the issue. In a press note, AAP pointed out that the CEO of ESG, Tariq Thomas wrote to PWD based on AAP’s complaint “to examine the issue urgently and take necessary action” while also calling for the original report from PWD. Naik has alleged that the exterior painting work that is being carried out in the ESG premises is being done by PWD without issuing a work order. “PWD had put a work order of exterior painting worth 70 lakh. The tenders should have been submitted by 3pm on November 9, and they were supposed to be opened on November 10. The tender was supposed to be awarded to the lowest bidder. But the work of exterior painting has been completed before the bid and that too without a work order,” Naik had earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-esg-has-written-to-pwd-after-our-plaint/articleshow/87674436.cms||---

One block of a residential society located in Motera in Chandkheda area was declared a micro-containment zone on Friday, a day after Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) resumed containment of buildings. In case of the Motera housing society, 20 houses with 76 residents were under quarantine. On Thursday, the civic body had micro-contained one block of a society in Isanpur — the first after a gap of six months. AMC had discontinued the practice of putting buildings in micro-containment in the last week of May. Elsewhere, in the state, daily Covid cases halved in the last 24 hours. The five Gujarat cities account for 71% cases. After the spike in daily cases to 42 and 40 in the past two days, the Covid-19 positive cases again dipped on Friday with the state recording 21 cases. Of these, 15 or 71% of the cases were from the five cities. The new Covid positive cases include 6 from Vadodara city, 3 each from Surat city and Valsad, 2 each from Ahmedabad, Jamnagar and Rajkot cities, and 1 each from Junagadh, Kutch and Surendranagar districts. Friday recorded cases from 5 cities and 4 districts. “We may need a few more days to ascertain whether the spike was a warning bell, or was due to the Diwali festivities and an one-off anomaly. But as we had experienced the first wave after Diwali last year, it’s always better to keep guards on,” said a city-based critical care specialist. With discharge of 35 patients, the active cases dropped by 14 to 220. Ahmedabad and Vadodara have the highest active cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/motera-society-put-in-containment-second-in-city-in-2-days/articleshow/87673669.cms||---
---||Pune||Two weeks on, PMC repairs pipeline & restores supply||PUNE: Two weeks after the raw water pipeline that supplies water to the Cantonment works burst, the Pune Municipal Corporation completed repair and restored supply at full capacity. The pipeline had burst in Sinhagad Road area before Diwali. Officials from the PMC’s water supply department said the repairs were completed at the beginning of the week after which the pipeline was inspected for the last few days. “No leakage was found during the inspection,” said an official. The civic administration is usually able to complete restoration work in two to three days after incidents of burst or leakages. Civic sources said it took more time to complete the repairs because some parts and material were not readily available. “The pipeline was laid 20 years ago and parts are not available in the market. We placed an order and procured the material which lead to some delay,” said an official. Administration sources said replacing the entire pipeline is under consideration. “Replacing the existing pipeline will be a major task as it is a big pipeline that covers a long distance up to the Cantonment water works. We will first check its status and based on that, a further call on replacing it can be taken,” said a source. The civic administration had been lifting about 50MLD water from the irrigation canal since the last two weeks due to the pipeline burst. With repairs complete, the optimum flow of water from the pipeline will ensure adequate supply to areas like Hadapsar, Kondhwa, Mundhwa, Kharadi. The damaged stretch of the road is yet to be restored completely. The pipeline burst caused major damage to a 50-metre stretch with two lanes being closed for traffic. The administration will open lanes for traffic after completion of resurfacing work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-weeks-on-pmc-repairs-pipeline-restores-supply/articleshow/87674438.cms||---

The deceased, Subhash Singh (62), had supported one Ramashankar Singh Chauhan in the panchayat election. Chauhan was elected as the mukhiya of Kharatia panchayat on October 27 after defeating Saheb Hussain, who had pressurised the trader on many occasions to campaign for him. Mirganj police station SHO Chhotan Kumar said Hussain was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. “He is the prime suspect in the murder case,” he said. Kumar said Hussain wanted Singh to campaign in his support due to his influence in the village. “They developed enmity over the issue and it escalated after Hussain lost the election,” the SHO said. “Singh was shot multiple times while he was asleep in front of his house. He died on the spot. His family members came out after hearing the gunshots,” the SHO said.

---||Madurai||As cases drop, Covid-19 block to be shifted to old GRH building||MADURAI: More than 19 months after the newly-built super speciality block (SSB) of the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was dedicated for Covid patients, the hospital on Friday announced that the Covid block will be shifted to the Old Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) block of the main GRH building from this weekend. The decision to shift the block to a relatively smaller facility has been taken as there is a drastic drop in the number of patients getting treated for Covid-19. Also, there is an increase in the number of cases requiring super speciality care in the urology, nephrology, medical gastroenterology, surgical gastroenterology, neurology and neuro surgery departments that functioned in the SSB. Resident Medical Officer (RMO) A Srilatha said that the 450 to 500 bed SSB was dedicated as a Covid block in April, 2020. “The number of beds was increased to 900 during the peak of the second wave earlier this year,” she said. The block was the key tertiary care facility for most southern districts.But the number of patients who were admitted came down below 100 by the end of June. “Since the beginning of July it has been below 80 patients and between 50 and 60 in August. It peaked to 70 in September when there were rumours of a third wave. It came below 50 in the next few days and has been well within that range. It even went down to 25 last week,” the RMO said. On Thursday, the block had only 39 patients. Under these circumstances the heads of the six super speciality departments made a representation to the dean to shift their facilities back to the SSB. Hospital dean A Rathinavel said that the shifting will be carried out in a phase manned on Saturday and Sunday. The Covid-19 testing facility, outpatient and inpatient wards will be shifted to the first and second floors of the old O&G block, starting with the shifting of stable patients on Saturday. The entire facility including sample collection for RT-PCR test will be done there from Sunday. The Covid block in the Old O&G building will have 150 beds including ICU and will be more than enough to cater to the requirements in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-cases-drop-covid-block-to-be-shifted-to-old-grh-building/articleshow/87675149.cms||---

Sardesai said that the construction of the Western Bypass by filling low-lying paddy fields would cause massive flooding in Mungul and Maddel. Stating that he has been fighting for the construction of the bypass on stilts in these flood-prone areas, Sardesai said his suggestion was upheld by the 10-member committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to study objections raised with regard to construction of the bypass in this area. Former Benaulim sarpanch Royla Fernandes had moved the NGT pointing out that the construction of the Western Bypass on earthen embankments through the villages Seraulim to Benaulim would lead to water stagnation resulting in flooding and inundation of houses located in the vicinity. The residents have been demanding that the road be constructed on stilts. Sardesai, on Friday, telephonically discussed the issue with PWD principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar, who is learnt to have promised to commence the work only after Sardesai is convinced that the present road work was just to create an access to facilitate the construction of the bypass on stilts. Sardesai, however, expressed doubts on the government’s intentions as a 15m road was not necessary as “access” and that “there existed past instances of the government going back on its word, including in an assurance given by the chief minister on the floor of the Goa Legislative Assembly” to him on this matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-halts-western-bypass-work-at-fatorda-says-build-it-on-stilts/articleshow/87674450.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Survey a dress rehearsal for Tuesday reopening’||Kolkata: Friday’s on-campus exams for the National Achievement Survey (NAS) was like a dress rehearsal for school re-opening, felt authorities. Schools in the state are scheduled to reopen their campuses from Tuesday after remaining closed since March 2020, though some did open for a brief period in February before they were again forced to shut down as Covid cases started rising. School heads said that as children as young as those in classes III and V walked in for the NAS test, it helped build confidence and paved the way for a surer re-opening on Tuesday. Sanitization of classrooms where the exams took place, placing hand-sanitizers at vantage points, thermal checking, distanced seating and ensuring that each child kept the mask on for the entire duration of the test gave school authorities the much-needed practice to once again bring children to school for physical classes. “It feels unreal after such a long time. But seeing children in uniform around me, happily making their way to the exam room, following every Covid-safety norm encouraged me,” said Meena Kak, director at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Echoing her, Sushila Birla Girls’ School principal Koeli Dey said, “Class V in our school participated in NAS. Those children are much younger than those who will come in from Tuesday. Since we could handle the younger ones successfully, we are sure about the older ones. Tuesday will be a big day for every school,” she said. NAS gave schools an added opportunity to connect with parents, who were initially apprehensive about sending their children to school. But now that the day has gone off so well, it will send a positive message to the parents, who are yet to give their consent for their wards to go to school on Tuesday, school heads felt. “The entire atmosphere of the school changed as the Class-III students entered. The ice seemed to have automatically melted and we will now follow the same regimen for our senior students who are coming back on Tuesday. Life will come back to school, God willing,” said Father Rodney Borneo, principal at St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar. At South Point School, 340 students of classes VIII and X came for the test. “We are happy Class X got a feel of the real exam hall before they come in for the offline board exams,” said Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharya, principal of the school. Most schools arranged for an isolation-cum-sick room with a doctor and a nurse ready during the exam hours. School heads said this would become a permanent feature now so that any child feeling unwell or even uncomfortable can be taken there for a check-up. After the NAS ended, children were given a questionnaire on how they were taught in online classes and how willing the teachers were to help them out. As the students spent additional time at school filling the form, some institutes arranged for dry food for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/survey-a-dress-rehearsal-for-tuesday-reopening/articleshow/87674451.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The move is as part of Central government-driven joint action plan for ‘Prevention of drug and substance abuse among the children and illicit trafficking’. The agency would also appeal to the chemist shops to install CCTV cameras, especially at those located near schools and colleges.In Maharashtra, the special drive would be concentrated in Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune and Nashik, cities the central government has labelled as ‘highly vulnerable’ as far as drug abuse and illicit trafficking is concerned.The action aims at curtailing drug sale and consumption in the vicinity of schools and child care institutions to prevent misuse of drugs and substance abuse by children, It has been planned and formulated with a time-bound goal by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights in collaboration with the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Following directions from its state head office, FDA, Nagpur, would soon address the chemists and pharmacy owners to create awareness regarding the sale of the scheduled drugs like Alprazolam. They would be directed to maintain proper records of sales of special drugs as per the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940, following the protocols of the ‘Management information system on record keeping of schedule drugs’.Asst commissioner of FDA PM Ballal, who would soon take up the programme under supervision of joint commissioner Viraj Paunikar, said there are instances of misuse of drugs like Alprazolam by youngsters for intoxication. “Chemists having shops near schools and colleges would be asked to practice caution and appeal them to install CCTV cameras to keep a watch on youngsters visiting their pharmacies,” he said.Meanwhile, city police had registered an unprecedented 216 cases related to narcotics till October this year and arrested 286 persons. Narcotics worth Rs2.50 crore were seized this year so far. “In a joint meeting attended by FDA officials, police asked pharmacies that any scheduled drug being sold without prescriptions and labels would draw legal action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngp-vulnerable-to-drugs-misuse-by-kids-fda-to-alert-pharmacies/articleshow/87673671.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||NAS test held smoothly in dist, say officials||Nagpur: The National Achievement Survey (NAS), wherein students are tested on their comprehension of core subjects, was held across the country on Friday. In Nagpur district, the exam was held in randomly chosen 232 schools for almost 7,000 students. The test, which was held all over the country, will help authorities get a better picture of learning gaps that lockdown may have resulted in, apart from the regular purpose of formulating academic policies. Milind Wankhede, chief of Vidarbha Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, had opposed holding the exam for at least the younger kids. “We had demanded that the date should have been pushed forward. There are two reasons for it, first is the safety point and second is academic. Due to the lockdown there has been a learning gap which we can cover once physical classes start. So, holding NAS now will show poor results which won’t be accurate due to the prevailing situation,” said Wankhede. According to education officials, the test went off smoothly. CBSE, which is administering the test, will also be deploying its special software to track either individuals or exam centres that indulge in unfair practices. NAS being a non-core exam has sometimes been susceptible to allegations that teachers prompt answers to students, just to boost the marks. While authorities don’t accept that such a thing may have happened, they are moving ahead with mechanisms which may ultimately negate any chance of such things happening. CBSE says its special software that will identify cheaters will help to strengthen the reliability of NAS. While CBSE is using technology to increase fairness in NAS, the Maharashtra government has formed an Education Technology Forum. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The forum will serve as an open platform for free exchange of ideas on the use of technology to enhance learning, assessment, planning and administration of schools.” She said that senior representatives from Google, Microsoft, Cognizant, Persistent, Dell, Amazon, C-DAC among others will be part of this forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nas-test-held-smoothly-in-dist-say-officials/articleshow/87674478.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

When appointed as a vaccinator at Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli, though, Nirgun recalls being a bundle of nerves herself. “It was a new vaccine. People were scared. They would ask us what if they died immediately after the shot. We allayed those fears, saying we have taken the vaccine too and we were alive and working,” she says. In the 10 months after vaccinating thousands safely, even the tiniest of apprehension has disappeared, she says.

Two of his friends have been arrested for murder while a hunt is on for the third one, police said. The killing was the result of a petty dispute over distribution of liquor among them, police said. A daily wager who made plaster of paris ceilings, Ravindra had been out with his friends -- Akash Singh, Manoj Chaudhary and Kala -- but never returned home. His friends, all in their early 20s, claimed that he had left them in the middle of the road and gone off on his own. Unable to locate him, Ravindra’s family filed a missing complaint with police. While interrogating the three friends, one of them admitted to killing Ravindra and burying his body in the sugarcane field. A fight had broken out over liquor distribution and Ravindra allegedly had abused two of his friends. “Angry, his friends killed him,” Ajay Kumar, SHO, Baghpat Kotwali. “Akash accepted that he had killed Ravindra with the help of Manoj and Kala.

Pouch is part of the evidence in the alleged encounter case investigated by additional DCP J Surender Reddy. The constable’s denial came following commission’s advocate showing him medical records submitted by Care Hospital superintendent Dr Charles which indicated that he had collected the belongings of constable Aravindh Goud and SI Venkateshwarulu from the hospital. While Srikanth admitted he did take Goud’s gold chain, ring and belt at the emergency room of the hospital, he claimed he did not remember receiving the SI’s shoes, watch, yellow colour ring, belt, purse and pistol pouch as mentioned in the hospital records. When commission’s advocate asked why he had signed if he had not taken the articles, Srikanth said, “They had told me to sign as I had brought them to the hospital. I was in tension. I did not take the articles of SI.” Srikanth also stated the SI’s articles were not removed at the Shadnagar community health centre where he was taken soon after the alleged encounter On whether the SI was conscious while being taken from Shadnagar to Care Hospital, the head constable initially said that he heard the former say ‘amma’ while being put in the ambulance. Probed further, the head constable, however, claimed that he was not sure if the SI was conscious because during the journey he was sitting with the driver and didn’t notice the SI after reaching Care hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cop-denies-he-received-injured-sis-pistol-pouch/articleshow/87674453.cms||Mahesh Buddi

He said Annamalai has only been a police officer and should remain calm on this issue as he does not know anything about Tamil Nadu. Vaiko said Kerala has been making false claims that the strong Periyar dam is weak so that it could get adequate water for Idukki dam. He said Periyar dam is strong enough to hold water till 152 feet but the Apex Court has given its verdict that water can be stored only till 142 feet. This being the case, Kerala government should put an end to its efforts to demolish Periyar dam. He said the neighbouring state could build 48 check dams from Periyar dam to Idukki dam at Pulmedu, Vallakadavu, Vandiperiyar, Maanjamalai, Pasumalai, Thenga Kal, Chengarai, Upputhurai, Sappari, Aaladi and Mariakulam to improve water storage. He added that water level in Idukki dam should be reduced and maintained at 444 feet – that is 111 feet from its full reservoir capacity – as monsoon preparedness. Efforts should be taken to strengthen baby dam and to mend the damaged Vallakadau - Mullaperiyar dam road. Reiterating that the Mullaiperiyar dam issue has already been resolved, he said the people of Tamil Nadu will not be mute spectators to any effort to demolish the dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/focus-on-idukki-dam-inflow-vaiko-to-kerala/articleshow/87675152.cms||---

The long-pending demand of city residents to have a statue of the saint will be fulfilled soon. The Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple committee took the initiative and completed the task of making a 12-ft tall statue at a cost of Rs 9 lakh. Now, committee members are waiting for the CM to unveil the statue. Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple is one of the oldest temples in the city. Saint Channabasaveshwar had arrived in Dharwad in the 12th century while on his way to Ulavi from Kalyana to create awareness about vachana literature. He stayed here for some time at UB hills, Dharwad. In his memory, Ulavi Channabasaveshwar temple was built at UB hills. Sources said the temple committee is building a pedestal at the junction on the way to the Dharwad railway station and head post office. The committee had requested HDMC to provide space for the statue and it was approved in 2004. Temple governing body chairman SR Ramanagoudar told TOI, “The installation of the statue of Channabasaveshwar is our long pending demand since 2004. Now the demand has been fulfilled. Work has been completed and the statue is ready to be unveiled. We are waiting for chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to inaugurate it officially.” Temple trustee TS Patil said the 12-ft tall bronze statue was designed and made by an artist from Kolhapur at a cost of Rs 9 lakh. The entire circle has been decorated with plants and the statue will be unveiled soon, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ulavi-channabasaveshwar-statue-in-dharwad-waiting-to-be-unveiled-by-cm-bommai/articleshow/87673390.cms||---

Khan, who hails from Telangana, and has served as Rajya Sabha member for two terms, on Friday extended support to Ghulam Nabi’s comment that the comparison is an exaggeration. “I personally do not support the kind of Hindutva the BJP has been promoting. But the Congress is a secular party and a majority of Hindus are secular. It is not appropriate to make such a comparison. I condemn it,” he told TOI over phone from New Delhi. Former Union minister Salman Khurshid in his book ‘Sunrise over Ayodhya’ which was released recently, compared Hindutva to ISIS and Boko Haram, triggering a controversy with BJP leaders burning his effigies at various places in the country.  Azad had criticised his party colleague Khurshid for his remarks. “In Mr. Salman Khurshid’s new book, we may not agree with Hindutva as a political ideology distinct from the composite culture of Hinduism, but comparing Hindutva with ISIS and Jihadist Islam is factually wrong and an exaggeration,” Azad had tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/khurshids-remark-not-appropriate-former-mp/articleshow/87674471.cms||Roushan Ali

The month-long period for filing objections and suggestions ends on November 30. The BLAs are tasked with assisting election officials in the revision of the electoral rolls by giving information about voters who have shifted or passed away during the pandemic. BLAs are also expected to guide the public to fill application forms for inclusion/deletion/correction/transposition of entries in the rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parties-urged-to-appoint-booth-agents/articleshow/87674469.cms||---

They are too expensive, unaffordable and there’s uncertainty about its outcome. It is the civil society that can be subverted, divided and manipulated to hurt the interest of the nation. You are there to see that this land is fully protected,” Doval said. Doval, a former Alumni of the Academy, was the chief guest at the ‘Dikshant Parade’ of 2020 batch on Friday which saw 132 IPS trainees and 17 foreign officer trainees participating. NSA Ajit Doval pays tribute to martyred cops at the police academy“People are most important. The new frontier of war, which is called the fourth generation of warfare, is civil society,” he said. He also emphasised the greater role of police in border management spanning over 15,000 km covering Pakistan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. He said managing the 32-lakh square km of India was the responsibility of police forces. “But it will extend. You will be responsible for border management of this country. 15,000 km of the border, most of it has got peculiar problems of its own,” he added. Doval said there were different types of security issues in each border. “There is a border in Pakistan with China or Myanmar or Bangladesh. We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organizations,” he added. Doval’s comments on greater policing comes a day after the Punjab assembly adopted a resolution against the Centre' for extending the jurisdiction of the BSF, which the Punjab assembly said was an insult. Emphasising on the individual ability of officers, Doval said: “Enforcement of law will depend on your efficiency, your commitment, your values, your attitude and your performance. There implementation becomes more important that legislation. No nation can be built where rule of law has failed. People cannot feel safe where law enforcers are weak, corrupt and partitioned. I found many of these values were enshrined in the oath which you have taken. Enforce the law in that spirit.” Turning the clock back 52 years when he had passed out, Doval stressed that the tag ‘IPS’ was their common identity which should bind them in gratitude for the training at the Academy as they march forward in their careers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nsa-to-ips-officers-protect-country-from-subversive-forces/articleshow/87674496.cms||---

Thousands of villagers from various cities, including Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Amroha, reached the pilgrimage centre on tractors, trollies and other vehicles. Leaving no stone unturned to woo the pilgrims, political parties put up large hoardings all across the ghats. Three prominent fairs of Ganga Snan take place in West UP, including Amroha's Tigri, Hapur's Garhmukteshwar and Bijnor's Vidurkuti, where lakhs of devotees congregate every year. The snan is followed by fairs lasting up to six days. At Vidur Kuti too, devotees have started gathering to celebrate the festival, with a large number of them setting up camps there. Making most of the occasion, political parties, too, have started camping at the fair venues. BJP's Bijnor district president, Subhash Valmiki, said, "Our party is putting up hoardings to apprise people of the welfare schemes sponsored by state and Union governments. Religious fairs are a way to reach out to masses.” BSP district president, Jitendra Sagar, too jumped in, saying, "People know everything. They know such fairs are informative.” While other parties talked about the fairs and their significance, RLD senior leader, Praveen Deshwal, took a swipe at his opponents, saying hoardings only scarred the ghats. "This time, when there are no rallies, hoardings are being put up to scar the venues,” he said. Speaking to TOI, SB Sharma, AMA, district panchayat, said, “The fair will be inaugurated next week. All preparations are in place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-lakh-devotees-expected-for-ganga-snan/articleshow/87673705.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Jaipur||Sachin Pilot meets Sonia Gandhi, says decision on Rajasthan cabinet reshuffle ‘very soon’||JAIPUR: Amid speculation over cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in Rajasthan, former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on Friday and expressed confidence that a decision on the expected rejig will be taken "very soon" keeping in mind factors such as credibility, performance, regional and caste balance. His near hour-long meeting came a day after Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met Gandhi. The two leaders are learnt to have discussed the political situation as well as the impending cabinet reshuffle in the state. Speaking to reporters after meeting Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence, Pilot said, “Whatever the Congress party wants me to do, I am more than happy to do. In the last 20 years, whatever job has been assigned, I have done it diligently and now also whatever the party decides, what role I should have... I am happy to do it.” “Extensive discussions took place about Rajasthan, the government, party organisation, and I put forward my points about the political situation in the state. I am happy that the Congress president is constantly taking interest in Rajasthan and is taking feedback about the work of the government and organisation,” Pilot said. He said the committee that Gandhi had formed to look into the issues raised by him about a year ago has also completed its work, and general secretary organisation KC Venugopal along with AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken have been submitting reports from time to time. “The party high command is also talking about taking action on the points we had put forward last year, and I think very soon decisions will be taken on it,” he said. Pilot has been demanding cabinet expansion and appointments to boards and corporations in the state for long. He has been insisting that Congress workers and leaders working closely with him for the party should be given their due.“I think whatever changes that need to be made in the government and organisation, the AICC and the chief minister will decide at an appropriate time. But now less than two years time is left for the next election and we want to fight the next election with full strength as the tradition of alternating Congress and BJP governments has to be broken,” he said. “This time we want to make the organisation very strong. The workers should get respect, everyone's participation is important, there should be balance in power, and we should move forward taking all sections of the society along,” he said. “The Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2024, so it is necessary to repeat the government in Rajasthan. I think that if the government and the organisation work strongly, then surely we will be able to do it,” he said. A major reshuffle is on cards in the state in the next few days and various modalities are being worked out, according to sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-meets-sonia-says-decision-on-cabinet-reshuffle-very-soon/articleshow/87675186.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Phase-II of dust drive begins, NBCC site fined Rs 5 lakh, says environment minister Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai said a fine of Rs 5 lakh had been imposed on NBCC for flouting anti-dust norms at its construction site in Karkardooma. Rai, who inspected the site to mark the beginning of the second phase of the anti-dust campaign on Friday, said, “To mark the commencement of the Kejriwal government’s Anti-Dust Campaign 2.0, we conducted a surprise inspection of the NBCC construction site in Karkardooma. While the ongoing project checks most of the regulation boxes, a few violations have been found. We have imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh on NBCC so that all rules and regulations are adhered to in future.” During phase 1, 2,500 construction sites were inspected by the teams of Delhi Pollution Control Committee and around 450 sites were found to be violating the rules and regulations. A total fine of Rs 1.3 crore was imposed on these sites for failing to prevent dust pollution. The Delhi government has issued a 14-point guideline for all construction and demolition sites. Rai said, “All our dedicated teams will work together to curb dust pollution, majorly coming from construction sites and increasing PM2.5 and PM10 levels. All agencies in Delhi consisting of 25 departments have been instructed to form their respective anti-dust cells. All construction sites in Delhi will be actively visited and inspected, and reported for violations.” Phase 1 of the campaign was run in October. On the sources of pollution in the city, Rai said, “The current levels of pollution are increasing due to the consistent increase in stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. A total of 45,000 such instances have been reported till now. The impact of this staggering number is being witnessed by the people of Delhi as the air is accumulating more impurities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/phase-ii-of-dust-drive-begins-nbcc-site-fined-rs-5-lakh-says-rai/articleshow/87674502.cms||---
---||Delhi||Unnerving Delhi: Bad air hits heart, lungs; hospitals report strike in admissions||NEW DELHI: Pollution has become a health emergency in Delhi-NCR. Hospitals reported patients rushing in with complaints of chest congestion, cough and difficulty in breathing — symptoms now synonymous with polluted winter days in Delhi. Many require admission, the hospitals claimed. “We are getting 12-14 patients daily in the emergency, mostly at night, when the symptoms cause disturbed sleep and panic,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals. According to Dr Manoj Goel, director of pulmonology at Fortis Gurugram, nearly 70% of the ICU beds are occupied by people with respiratory problems. “A majority of them have pre-existing respiratory problems but pollution aggravates them,” he said. “We also have patients with no history of respiratory illness but suffering from acute bronchitis, breathlessness and other complications that necessitate hospitalisation.” Safdarjung, AIIMS, Sir Ganga Ram, Max, Akash Super-specialty and Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital, among others, also disclosed a rise in hospitalisations due to respiratory complications. “My father is a heart patient and my wife has asthma. None of us are stepping out for the fear of respiratory setbacks,” said Nikhil Sharma of Malviya Nagar. “Yet we constantly worry that someone will fall seriously sick.” The 39-year-old added that he bought two air purifiers for home use recently despite being aware of the limited evidence available about their efficacy in reducing the impact of pollution. “Something is better than nothing,” Sharma said. The bad air is also affecting heart patients and people with neurological disorders. High levels of pollutants in the atmosphere, studies show, can trigger stroke in people with neurological disorders. Patients suffering from heart failure and coronary artery disease can also have their conditions worsened by poor air quality, research shows. Doctors advise such people to remain indoors and avoid morning walks until the air quality improved. “Every day six-seven patients come to the OPD complaining of burning and watery eyes and breathing issues caused by pollution,” said Dr (Col) Vijay Dutta of the internal medicine & respiratory medicine department at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre. “The numbers were lower in mid-October, but began rising at the beginning of November. Around 10 patients are currently admitted with such conditions,” Dutta said, adding that asthmatic people should stay indoors and if they need to go out, to wear masks to minimise the inhalation of toxic air. Dr Sunil Nakra, director of paediatrics at Madhukar Rainbow Hospital, warned that small children were also at high risk of developing complications on prolonged exposure to high levels of pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unnerving-delhi-bad-air-hits-heart-lungs-hosps-report-spike-in-admissions/articleshow/87675617.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Two-year-old Nitya was bidding adieu to the place that was her home for the last six months. The officials and also her friends at the children’s home, who all would surely miss the bubbly girl, were feeling a bit low. But the overwhelming emotion was that of joy, for Nitya got a new family and a new life on Friday. The Nimkar couple from Vadodara, who always wanted a girl child, completed the formality of adopting Nitya on Friday. With it being the first adoption from the city in 2021, district collector Aayush Oak was present on the occasion and handed over the custody of the child to her new parents. The Nimkars fell in love with Nitya at first sight. “After we saw Nitya for the first time we immediately decided to adopt her. We are very blessed to have her in our life,” said Umang Nimkar, an employee of an insurance company. Umang’s wife, Sapna, is a school teacher. “We first applied to adopt a child in 2011. Later, in 2014 we applied through child adoption portal CARA. Ours is a close family and what we were missing was a girl child. We always wanted a girl child,” Umang added. Hemant Gamit, manager, specialized child adoption agency, told TOI that the VR Popawala Children Home currently houses 11 children — seven boys and four girls — between the age of one month to five years. “Due to Covid-19 the adoption process was discontinued for some time. This is the first adoption from Surat after the pandemic. Officials are very happy as the child has got a family and her future is secured. Nitya was a handed over child. Umang had applied via CARA and after finishing all legal formalities his application was approved,” said Gamit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/2-yr-old-surat-girl-steals-vadodara-couples-hearts/articleshow/87674538.cms||---

Goa Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has failed in his promise to regularise contractual teachers working under the Goa Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. Mardolkar said that the BJP government has pushed these teachers towards a “dark fate” during Diwali, and forced them to launch an agitation. “It may be recalled that these teachers had temporarily withdrawn their strike on the eve of Diwali, but have now resumed their strike after claiming they were unhappy with the chief minister’s offer,” said Mardolkar. “When these teachers are doing good work to mould our students, they should be respected and their contribution should be acknowledged by regularising them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-failed-to-regularise-teachers/articleshow/87674505.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||AIIMS Nagpur to start conducting post-mortems||Nagpur: The medico-legal sector in Vidarbha is set to get a boost as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, is soon going to start conducting post-mortems at it’s upcoming state-of-the-art forensic facility. Phase one of the project is nearing completion with the AIIMS authorities gearing up to hold a meeting with the city police top brass for future collaborations on medico-legal aspects. Sources from AIIMS said the first phase would have a mortuary, cold storage, doctor’s chamber, police panchnama room and mourners’ hall to begin with. With the civil construction work of phase one in the final leg, the fine-tuning of the department is being monitored and supervised by an expert team led by prof and head of the forensic department Dr Manish Shrigiriwar under the supervision of AIIMS’ director and CEO major general Dr Vibha Dutta, SM. In phase II, AIIMS Nagpur is likely to have ‘virtual autopsy’ for dignified management of bodies on the lines of its Delhi counterparts where the post-mortem process can be completed using a CT scan and MRI and without having to wholly dissect the body. An autopsy auditorium is also among the facilities planned for the next stage with a 50-seat capacity. Yet another significant inclusion of phase II of the project, which would have a ground floor and another storey, is the toxicology department where a round-the-clock ‘poison information centre’ would be functional. Experts manning the centre would help interpret the effect of the poison and its antidote even to a remote enquiry. DNA analysis is also set to be part of the second phase. TOI has already reported about the institution’s unique forensic museum adding weightage to the credibility of the medico-legal department. Though AIIMS would initially start with post-mortems of the few police stations in the vicinity like Sonegaon, it’s learnt the institution would gradually start handling more complicated and sensitive cases in the coming days. With AIIMS foraying into the medical-legal practices, the institution would expectedly take much load off the government medical college and hospital (GMCH) dealing with crucial cases in Vidarbha where deeper expertise is sought in sensitive crimes. “There is an elaborative plan in place to make the forensic department at AIIMS Nagpur one of the best in Central India where most of the important cases would be dealt with in the near future,” said Prof Dr Manish Shrigiriwar, adding several modern facilities would made available along with the experts to interpret the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aiims-nagpur-to-start-conducting-post-mortems/articleshow/87674510.cms||Soumitra Bose

General secretary BT Srinivasan of the United Federation of RWAs (UFERWAS), an apex body of RWAs, told TOI that nearly 4,900 RWAs in Greater Hyderabad will give their feedback on the civic issues that remain unresolved. “The UFERWAS had earlier urged the GHMC to launch an initiative to resolve civic problems,” he said. The civic body has prepared a document consisting of 13 issues and distributed it to the RWAs concerned through the sanitation field assistants (SFAs) of GHMC circles concerned. “The president or secretary of the RWA concerned will visit their areas along with other members to note down the issues as per the format.

He cited personal reasons for not being able to appear before the police. “I am unable to travel out of Jaipur for one week as my father is not well and I have been advised not to leave him,” he said. In the meanwhile, the OSD had moved a petition in the Delhi high court seeking an early hearing on his petition seeking to quash the FIR against him. The counsel for Delhi police opposed the OSD's plea seeking early hearing, contending that there was “no urgency” as a June 3 order passed by the high court had clearly granted him protection from arrest. However, he can't stall the investigation in the garb of the order, the counsel said. In his reply, Sharma said, “If there is any urgency, I am available via video-conferencing at a suitable time. If any information is needed from my end, you are requested to provide me with a questionnaire,” he told police. In view of the Delhi police clarification concerning protection from coercive action, the court said it would hear the case on January 13, as fixed earlier, and also issued notice on the Rajasthan government's plea to place on record certain documents in a sealed cover. Sharma had received the notice for questioning in the case for the third time. The fresh notice had stated that failure to attend or comply with the terms of the notice can render him liable for arrest under sections 41 A(3) and (4) of the CrPC. The investigating officer (IO) said in the notice that there exists reasonable suspicion that Sharma has committed a cognisable offence and directed him to appear before him on November 12. He had also laid down 10 conditions, including Sharma's assurance that he would not commit any offence in future, tamper with evidence or make any threats, sources said. The Delhi police had registered the FIR in March this year against Sharma on charges of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and unlawfully intercepting telegraphic signals (telephonic conversation) on a complaint by Shekhawat, who is also a BJP MP from Jodhpur. The phone-tapping controversy erupted in July last year in Rajasthan after audio clips of alleged telephonic conversations between Shekhawat and Congress leaders surfaced amid a rebellion against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot by his then deputy Sachin Pilot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phone-tapping-cms-osd-fails-toappear-before-delhi-police-again/articleshow/87675193.cms||---

On October 9, GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar had reviewed the progress of acquisition of properties with all its wings. “In view of the increased compensation value, the GHMC has initiated TDR Policy in acquiring the properties with minimum burden on the exchequer. Moreover, the property owners are also willing to part with their land while obtaining TDR certificates in lieu of cash compensation, since the demand for issue and utilisation of TDR has increased rapidly,” read an official release issued by the GHMC on Friday. Regarding land acquired in the last five years, the civic body officials said that a total of 89 roads have been taken up for road widening, out of which 55 roads have been constructed and 1,805 properties have been acquired. Under SRDP category, the GHMC acquired 1,100 properties and 192 properties under missing/slip roads category, and remaining 511 properties under general road widening category. A few major road widening/link roads, where acquisition of properties has been completed include Bio-Diversity Flyover, Shilparamam RUB, Rajiv Gandhi Flyover at JNTU, Road No.45, Stay Cable Bridge (Durgam Cheruvu), RUB at Hitech City, Underpass at Bairamalguda to Chintalkunta checkpost and flyovers in different areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-issues-864-tdrs-to-acquire-350-acres/articleshow/87674514.cms||---

The party went on to say that chief minister Pramod Sawant heads the “worst and most incompetent government” in Goa’s entire history. The party’s president, Swapnesh Sherlekar, said that PWD minister Deepak Pauskar’s acknowledgement, that Goa faces an acute water shortage, proves that the BJP government lied about water supply to every household. “Sawant is now brazenly promising 16,000 litres of free water to every household without even bothering to address the acute and chronic water shortage problems faced by Bardez, Pernem, Bicholim and a host of other villages,” said Sherlekar. Goencho Avaaz has demanded that the state government put together a plan to ensure adequate water supply, while also repairing the breach in the Tillari canal. “Never has any other government in Goa, apart from BJP, forced so many different groups of people to come out on the streets to protest for their basic rights. At the time of Manohar Parrikar’s tenure, it was announced in the assembly that the Assonora plant capacity would be increased. Five years later, there is barely any progress. The people of Goa have a right to know why the work order took so long to be issued and when their misery is going to end,” said the party’s convener Viriato Fernandes. Its vice-president, Roshan Mathias, said people must come together to vote out the BJP government. Meanwhile, Fernandes met former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, who has been appointed as Congress’ senior election observer and strategist for Goa's elections. “Our suggestion was that for the greater good of the state, for the time being, MGP and Congress must come together. We are willing to facilitate this. BJP is the primary destroyer of Goa. They are the bigger evil,” Fernandes said after the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-lied-about-water-supply-to-all-houses-goencho-avaaz/articleshow/87674518.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Sub-inspector suspended after protest over Athmakur tribal’s ‘torture’||HYDERABAD: A day after villagers protested the alleged torture of a suspect in a theft case at Athmakur (S) police station in Suryapet, the sub-inspector (SI) has been suspended. Senior Suryapet district police officials said that SI M Lingaiah was suspended based on the report submitted by DSP (Suryapet division) to SP Rajendra Prasad. The probe against constable Mahesh for also allegedly beating the suspect, Dharawath Veerasekhar (25), was pending. “In preliminary oral enquiry, it was found that suspect Veerasekhar was beaten. But medical report to ascertain if he suffered any injuries is awaited,” the district police said. On Friday, DGP M Mahendar Reddy also took stock of the incident. Veerasekhar, a tribal, was called to the police station on Wednesday evening by Athmakur (S) police station as a suspect in its probe into theft of motor pumps from a farmer’s fields. Cops had earlier taken two others in custody and subsequently came to know that Veeraskehar was also with the duo. Veerasekhar was allowed to leave around 12 am on the condition that he would return on Thursday morning. He was handed over to his relatives who later found that he had become unconscious. Villagers alleged that he was tortured and held a protest on Thursday. “One constable took me away and I was beaten on my legs and hands with a belt. Three policemen are involved,” Veerasekhar had earlier told media. A few days ago, the Telangana High Court, while hearing a case of alleged police torture of a woman, Mariamma, who was found dead in Addaguduru police station a few months ago, had said that it was contemplating to order a CBI probe into it. SI has history of similar behaviour:The suspended sub-inspector of Athmakur (S) police station of Suryapet distirct, allegedly had a previous history of beating up a farmer. An year ago, while M Lingaiah was posted at Nagaram police station a farmer was called for investigation and he was beaten up. When the farmer approached district senior police officials, the subinspector was transferred and kept under Vaccany Reserve (VR). Few months later, he was posted at Athmakur (S), where is now facing the allegations of beating of a Veerasekhar after calling him for investigation as a suspect in a theft case. In the past too, similar incidents of police excesses were witnessed in Hyderabad and other parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/si-suspended-after-protest-over-athmakur-tribals-torture/articleshow/87674528.cms||---

A senior AMC official said the corporation is closely monitoring the situation and will further increase testing if the need arises. “We have already scaled up testing at entry points such as bus stands and railway stations. We are prepared to start setting up testing tents at various locations if the need arises.” He said the focus of the civic body is on fast coverage of second doses of vaccines. “In five days including today, we administered as many as 60,000 vaccine doses. We are concerned as 9.3 lakh eligible people have not yet taken their second dose and some of them are overdue by over six weeks,” he said. An official said that on Friday, the civic body administered a total of 21,787 vaccine doses of which 18,554 were second doses. He said that the civic body is taking all possible measures to avert a third wave of cases. “AMC has made its ‘no vaccine-no entry’ rule stricter on Friday. We have also started calling people who are overdue on their second dose. We are also tracing contacts of people who test positive. If despite all this we have to deal with another surge in the positivity rate, our hospitals are now better equipped to deal with such a situation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-ramps-up-testing-to-4500-a-day/articleshow/87673740.cms||---

---||Kochi||KIIDC invites tender for renovation of broken seawall||KOCHI: Amid protests by residents and allegations of delay in implementing a comprehensive solution to the sea erosion issues in Chellanam coastal village, the tender for the renovation of the broken seawall has been invited. Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) has floated the tenders for the reformation of the damaged sunken seawall using tetrapods. The plan is to restore the broken seawall using tetrapods and rubble for 10km along the coast in between CP stone 976 and 1,052 in Chellanam under the Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) project. In the first phase, the construction of seawall will be held at a length of around7km in between CP stones 986 and CP 1,026 at a cost of Rs 252 crore. The stipulated period of completion of the works is 16 months . According to the tender, the contractor must construct the seawall using granite stones, weighing 10kg to 700kg, and tetrapods weighing 2 tonne to 3 tonne, as per approved design on top of non-woven geo-textile mat as specified. Also, the contractor should have their own casting and stacking yard for stones and tetrapods and must establish weigh bridges. They also have to ensure necessary software and internet connection for the weigh bridge and the yard. The tender also states that the cement used should be suitable for marine environment and stipulates the minimum grade of concrete to make the tetrapods. All details regarding the experience of the contractor, rules, conditions and work nature have been published in the tender document. “The technical committee for the project was constituted last week. We hope to get some good bidders before the deadline so that the work could be started at the earliest. The plan is to complete at least a major portion of the work before the monsoons in next year as the coast is likely to see huge sea erosion at that time. But everything depends on several reasons, including the availability of rock,” said a KIIDC source. According to residents, processes including tendering are lagging behind the schedule promised by the government and the works should be started at the earliest. “Several projects were announced by the government and the tendering and inaugurations too have happened in the past but most of them are still incomplete. The seawall project is the last hope for residents and it must be completed as per the schedule,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, a resident and coordinator of Care Chellanam, a people’s collective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kiidc-invites-tender-for-renovation-of-broken-seawall/articleshow/87673733.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

But we got support from NGOs and elected representatives. Another challenge at one point was not enough vaccines.” Swapna Mhatre (42), first-time corporator from Khar, said they reached out to housing societies via active resident groups.

---||Goa||Goa: Local bodies, PWD, waste corporation can grant nod for government projects||PANAJI: Simplifying the process for construction of solid waste management facilities and government projects, the town and country planning department has brought in amendments that empower panchayats, municipal corporations, PWD and the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC). The amended Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations permitted PWD to issue development permissions as well as completion orders for government projects, while GWMC, panchayat department and municipal bodies can grant similar permissions for material recovery facilities and solid waste management structures that are coming up in their jurisdiction. This, TCP officials said, will enable faster clearances for time-bound public projects. “In case of government buildings designed by the office of chief architect - PWD, the chief architect shall grant the technical clearance, development permission as the case may be and the completion order,” chief town planner James Mathew said. He said that in the case of material recovery facilities and solid waste management structures, an engineer from the municipal council or engineer of the directorate of panchayats or an assistant manager of the Goa Waste Management Corporation can grant the technical clearance, development permissions and completion order. “These officers are qualified to certify the plans. Right now they send the files to us, we have to inspect and clear them and all this takes time. The government may notify any other officer to grant the permissions for public projects too,” Mathew said. The government has also relaxed the conditions for subdivision of large farm plots by introducing various slabs. The TCP department had noticed that farm land was being rapidly sub-divided into small plots for creation of farmhouses, which were subsequently being sold to non-Goans. Subdivision of farm plots was halted till 2018, but was resumed with certain conditions that the plot size cannot be smaller than 20,000 sqm. “Over the last three years, the government realised that if an owner had a 10,000 sqm plot, he cannot subdivide it for his heirs. So the government has introduced various slabs based on the land holding size. The TCP department had notified the draft Goa Land Development and Building Construction (Amendment) Regulations and had also appointed a steering committee to consider the objections and make its own recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/local-bodies-pwd-waste-corp-can-grant-nod-for-govt-projects/articleshow/87674530.cms||---

Soon after the fight, Jayanti Devi, 35, locked herself and her kids -- 2-year-old son and a 5-month-old daughter – inside a room since her husband, Bantu, was asking her to leave the house. Upset over being nagged to leave, the woman, in a fit of rage, strangled her children to death. The incident came to light on Friday when Bantu, a labourer, went to police and got his wife arrested. Speaking to TOI, ASP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “At first, the man didn’t tell us that his wife had killed his children, Balkrishna and Komal. It was only after our forensic team collected evidence and was informed by locals about the quarrel between the couple that Bantu revealed the truth. We have charged Jayanti under section 302 (murder) and sent her to jail. The bodies were handed over to the father after an autopsy.” During questioning, she confessed to killing her kids, saying she regretted her act. Officials are now considering giving her counselling. Jayanti Devi married Bantu, who uses his first name only, nearly 12 years ago and gave birth to their first child, a son, nine years after the wedlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-kills-two-kids-after-tiff-with-husband/articleshow/87673752.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab government trying to implicate Sukhbir Singh Badal in false case, claims Akali Dal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday alleged that the Congress government in Punjab, in a criminal conspiracy, is trying to implicate SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal in a false case related to the sacrilege issue by holding a meeting on October 22 in the annexe of Punjab Raj Bhawan. The SAD leaders demanded that the entire investigation be monitored by a sitting judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court. Addressing a press conference, SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra, Daljit Singh Cheema and Maheshinder Singh Grewal said chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi and home minister Sukhjinder Randhawa were responsible for hatching this conspiracy by holding a secret meeting in the Raj Bhawan annexe between 11.30 am to 1.30 pm on October 22. They claimed that the meeting was attended by officiating DGP I P S Sahota, home secretary Anurag Verma, advocate general A P S Deol, SIT chairman S P S Parmar, AIG R S Sohal, SSP Mukhwinder Bhullar, DSP Lakhbir Singh, and inspector Dalbir Singh, retired police officers R S Khattra and Sulakhan Singh and Congress MLAs Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon and Kulbir Singh Zira. Grewal claimed that the purpose of the meeting was to neutralize the anti-incumbency being faced by the Congress government by diverting the attention of people by fixing the political opposition, especially the Badal family. by implicating it in false cases. He said former DIG R S Khattra had been entrusted with the responsibility of creating deposition through false witnesses against the Badal family. Grewal claimed that Khattra had agreed to do this after home minister Randhawa brokered the deal between Khattra, who was very close to Randhawa, and the chief minister. “Khattra has been promised a constitutional post and his son has been promised a Congress ticket from Patiala or Malwa region,” claimed Grewal. Grewal alleged as part of this deal, Khatra has prepared a Congress worker, Rajinder Kaur Meemsa, to get a false case filed against the SAD president. “The conspiracy is that Rajinder will hold a press conference and ring up the DGP to ask why her complaint is not being registered. The cooked up complaint is that the Congress worker, who had temporarily even joined the SAD, had visited Sukhbir’s residence in Badal village before the 2017 elections where she had witnessed the SAD president in the company of three dera (Sirsa) workers (now absconding),” claimed Grewal. The SAD leader claimed, “Subsequently, Rajinder would claim she had seen the same leaders in Sukhbir’s residence after the 2017 elections and had heard Sukhbir telling that the new government is ours and I will not let anything wrong happen to you.” The SAD leaders also asked retired DIG R S Khattra to explain his conduct as he had earlier headed the SIT during the course of which he had claimed that the previous SADBJP government did not interfere in the functioning of the probe. ‘PHONES OF PARTY CHIEF TAPPED’The SAD leaders said Channi government had gone to the extent of tapping the phones of the SAD president and that they would also move a privilege motion in this regard in the forthcoming parliamentary session. They also requested the Punjab governor, whom they will meet shortly, to take appropriate action in the matter and also provide the CCTV footage of the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-trying-to-implicate-sukhbir-in-false-case-claims-akali-dal/articleshow/87674544.cms||---

After two narrow losses against Amman Club (1-2) and Shahrdari Sirjan (0-1), Gokulam Kerala were determined to grab full points in the concluding clash and they did just that with a convincing win against the Uzbekistan side. Elshaddai Acheampong opened the scoring for Gokulam Kerala, while goals from Manisha and Karen Zea ensured a smooth ride for the winning side. Umida Zoirova scored the only goal for Bunyodkor. The Indian champions finished with three points, the same as Bunyodkor, but occupied the third spot due to their better head-to-head record. Amman Club defeated Shahrdari Sirjan 2-1 later on Saturday night to emerge champions on a better head-to-head result. Both teams were out of title contention, but Bunyodkor came into this game on the back of a last-minute win against Amman Club. Gokulam Kerala had nothing to show for their previous efforts and had a point to prove. They were under pressure at the start with goalkeeper Shreya forced into action twice. The misses proved costly for Bunyodkor as Gokulam Kerala opened their account just after the half an hour mark. It was Manisha – wonderful all through the tournament – who made it happen from the left. Her cross to Soumya Guguloth was headed towards goal and Elshaddai did the rest from close range. In the second half, Gokulam Kerala continued to press for the insurance goal and won a penalty in the 55th minute when Bunyodkor captain Luiza Sadirova received a red card for pushing Elshaddai inside the danger zone. The referee took almost six minutes to confirm the penalty, and Manisha kept her cool to make it 2-0. Bunyodkor responded immediately after the restart when Dildora Nozimova played a nice one-two with Zoirova, who beat the rival defence before slotting home to reduce the deficit. Substitute Karen should have scored with her first touch, but the goalkeeper made a save from a one-on-one situation. The Colombian, however, made amends in the 68th minute when she scored from handshaking distance after Elshaddai’s shot rebounded off the post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-womens-club-championship-gokulam-kerala-edge-out-fc-bunyodkor-to-finish-third/articleshow/87690919.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Sikh groups to CM: Reopen 2007 case against sect head||Jalandhar: Sikh groups have urged Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to reopen the 2007 blasphemy case against Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and also order a time bound inquiry to ascertain how the sect head was allowed to go scot free as police did not even file a chargesheet against him in the court and the latter discharged him in 2014. They have also asked the CM to issue a white paper on the case. In a joint letter to the CM, prominent Sikh preacher Harjinder Singh Majhi, who heads Darbar e Khalsa and Alliance of Sikh Organisations (a conglomerate of around 35 Sikh groups) spokesperson Sukhdev Singh have mentioned that they had earlier written to then CM Amarinder Singh on January 29, 2019, and July 16, 2020, but he did not take any interest in the case. They have also mentioned that on December 22, 2019, they had staged a dharna outside his (Channi’s) house but he did not come before the sangat to give his reply. “Now, when you mentioned in Punjab assembly yesterday that you were very much worried as justice was not being delivered in the sacrilege cases and while visiting Darbar Sahib Amritsar you reiterated your commitment to deliver justice, now by delivering justice in this case you can deliver your promise at Darbar Sahib and in the assembly,” they wrote in the letter which was mailed to the CM on Friday. They have requested Channi that a high level probe be completed in 15 days and to issue a white paper on who blocked the dera chief’s prosecution in a highly sensitive case even when he was already facing rape and murder cases. They mentioned that in place of filing chargesheet in the case registered under sections 295 A and 153 A of the IPC, Bathinda police had filed cancellation report just five days before the 2012 assembly polls. The Sikh activists have also argued that the dera chief and his followers dared to execute the sacrileges in 2015 only because they were emboldened after the then Badal government had brazenly helped him (Gurmeet) get off the hook in blasphemy case, which was registered in May 2007 after he imitated Guru Gobind Singh. “The probe should bring out the directions given by the political bosses, especially the then CM and home minister. The police officers who worked against the law and helped an accused so brazenly should be identified and action be taken against them,” the letter states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikh-groups-to-cm-reopen-2007-case-against-sect-head/articleshow/87675115.cms||---

The Goa Vision Document 2035 prepared by a committee headed by top scientist Raghunath Mashelkar remains unimplemented since 2012. In February 2020, Sawant had even met with Mashelkar and the Vibrant Goa Foundation to discuss the implementation of the report’s recommendations. Sawant had said that a task force will be constituted to review the vision document and provide inputs for a phase-wise implementation of the report in the state. The report, prepared by the Goa Golden Jubilee Development Council constituted on July 26, 2010, and submitted to then chief minister Manohar Parrikar in July 2012, was never implemented. Sawant said that the state government has prepared a vision document for panchayats through the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development and directorate of higher education. Speaking at the inaugural function of the National Panchayat Parliament, the chief minister asked zilla panchayat and panchayat members to contest the next assembly elections which are scheduled early next year. He said that once zilla panchayat members and panchayat members get elected, action plans and vision documents should be prepared for implementation in their respective jurisdictions. “Politicians should dream and if we don’t dream, then it cannot turn into reality. In February 2022, aspiring candidates should contest assembly elections. Many parties have come to Goa and there are opportunities to contest upcoming assembly elections, but only 40 will get elected as MLAs,” he said. Sawant said that most of the time panchayat members don’t know what development they should take up in their respective wards and they should reach out to the people with various government schemes. He said that this government is committed to developing human resources in the state. Sawant said that this government is a “double engine” administration and that is the reason Goa has witnessed development across the state. He asked the panchayat and zilla panchayat members to support the state government in achieving a “new India”, and fulfil the dream of Parrikar and vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-preparing-vision-document-for-state-cm/articleshow/87674546.cms||---

He said he would soon preside over a review meeting with all the collectors to understand the plans they had prepared to ensure every beneficiary was administered at least one dose by November 30. “We want community participation to speed up the drive,” said Tope. The statement assumes significance considering that some, including the Aurangabad collector, have made at least one vaccine jab mandatory for residents to purchase fuel and ration. Tope told TOI that weekly review meetings would be held with the collectors and they would be directed to include NGOs, housing society federations and local leaders to get their help in reaching out to the beneficiaries. The state is working towards giving at least one dose to the 9.1 crore eligible population by November 30. Of them, around 2 crore have not received a single dose. Nearly 5.9 crore beneficiaries are yet to get their second dose. During an interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, Tope again demanded that the 84-day gap between administering the two Covishield doses be reduced to speed up the vaccination drive. “We have again demanded that the Centre reduce the gap between the Covishield doses, to which they have only replied ‘Noted’,” said Tope. The minister also apprised the Centre about the ongoing programmes in the state like Mission Kavach Kundal and Mission Yuva Swastha to boost the inoculation drive. “We have assured the Centre that the state’s vaccination programmes will be further scaled up,” he told the TOI. “The Mission Yuva Swastha has received a good response,” the minister said, adding that the state would strive to ensure that all the eligible beneficiaries receive at least one dose by November-end. He said public awareness was being created through several communication models to allay the citizens’ doubts on vaccination. The state is also making efforts to seek the help of religious leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/use-persuasion-not-coercion-to-boost-vaccination-in-mumbai-tope/articleshow/87674554.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Civic chief Kailas Jadhav took this decision after the Rajasthan-based firm that was roped in by the civic body for the project was no longer interested in doing so. Jadhav has directed the officials concerned to prepare a report about the project, including cost per station along with all other details, and locations where the stations would be set up. A civic official said although a final decision is yet to be taken there would be at least 20 EV charging stations in the city and they can be further increased depending on the response from the citizens. The charging stations are to be set up for the both two and four-wheelers. The official said they are already in the process to get more details about charging stations. A project report will be prepared shortly and submitted to the municipal commissioner. The civic body has received a total of Rs 41 crore from the Centre to deal with the air pollution. The funds have been received in two instalments under the National Clean Air programme. The NMC is already in the process of utilising Rs 20.5 crore received in the first phase for various projects like electric crematorium, purchase of mechanical sweeping machines, recycling and management for construction waste in the city. The second instalment of Rs 20.5 crore was received by the civic body last month. The NMC is already in the process of preparing plans to spend the funds for various projects to reduce air pollution and improve city’s air quality. “Parts of funds will be used for setting up the charging stations for EVs,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-set-up-ev-charging-points/articleshow/87672913.cms||Tushar Pawar

What is happening? Why two, three, four and five constituencies?” Reacting to Lobo’s statement that he hasn’t done anything in Mapusa, D’Souza said, “A lot of people talk like that, but we and the people of Mapusa know what work has been done and completed. The people of Mapusa are smart”. He added that “outside people” can’t tell the people of Mapusa what they have to do. “The people of Mapusa will decide who to vote for and whom to elect,” he said. Asked if Lobo would support him, D’Souza said that even the last time (for the byelection), “Lobo had interfered”, and Congress candidate Sudhir Kandolkar had said that Lobo had helped him. “This time, based on our work, the people will be with us,” D’Souza said. “My father worked for the last 20 years for the people of Mapusa.” The Mapusa constituency has been represented by BJP for over two decades now. Former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza had joined BJP in 2000, and after his death in 2019, Joshua was elected as the party’s MLA there. “We have started work from the Mapusa boundary,” Lobo had said. “We have inaugurated projects in Verla-Canca and we have come to Parra. People of the three constituencies (Calangute, Siolim and Mapusa) and our well-wishers will elect our MLAs. All the three candidates vying to contest are sitting here itself. Kandolkar is from Mapusa, and I think the people of Mapusa will 100% get him elected. Delilah (Lobo’s wife) will contest from Siolim constituency with the blessings of the people.” Kandolkar, a one-time close aide of Francis D’Souza, was a frontrunner for the BJP ticket in the 2019 by-election, after the death of D’Souza. After Kandolkar was denied the BJP ticket, he switched over to Congress and was defeated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/joshua-slams-michael-for-vested-interest-in-mapusa/articleshow/87674557.cms||---

After examining the report, the health secretary said, “Both the lives of mother and child were exposed to serious risk with or without fault of the health department. Hence there is a need to go deeper into details of the issue to bring out the truth. If it is established that the pregnant lady was not properly attended to by the staff on duty during a visit to GMSH-16 on 31st October, then strict action will be taken against the concerned staff,” he said. He added, “There seems to be something more than what meets the eye here and the possibility of some foul play due to vested interest with ulterior motives to defame the health department cannot be ruled out.” A video clip of the couple alleging that they were denied treatment at GMSH-16 due to which the woman had to deliver the baby at home was circulated. An inquiry was marked to the director, health services by the UT health secretary and it was conducted by the GMSH medical superintendent. The report said, “neither of the staff on duty during the night of 30- 31st October was aware about the visit of the pregnant lady at the hospital.” The inquiry could not find out who provided the unsigned prescription on the woman’s OPD card. It was also found that the baby was delivered at home on October 31 at 10:50am with the assistance of neighbours and a ‘dai’. A health department team was sent to the residence of the couple to check for the immunisation of the new-born and the mother. “On November 6, a health worker and a middle aged person visited the house of the lady and recorded a video clip about the issue. The said health worker tried to instigate the patient against the health authorities for reasons not known and requested not to disclose about their visits to anyone,” mentioned the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/home-delivery-preliminary-inquiry-report-absolves-gmsh-16/articleshow/87673775.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Officials from both hospitals confirmed that they were low on blood stocks. Both facilities witness heavy patient rush as they are the biggest government-run tertiary care medical facilities in the district. According to Somnath Khedkar, blood bank in-charge at Sassoon hospital, they have around 150 units of blood that could last for the next three days. Shankar Mosalgi, blood bank in-charge at YCMH, said they had only 120 units of blood available with them. Both said increasing the number of blood donation camps immediately was the only solution to avert any blood-related crisis. Khedkar told TOI, “The Diwali holidays have resulted in low response to blood donation drives. Every day, we get a few donors who come voluntarily to the hospital for donation, but it needs to be increased. The holidays also resulted in a drop in the number of camps that we conduct in the colleges and in the IT companies. Earlier this week, we conducted a camp with an NGO which resulted in the additional bloodstock of at least 150 units. We have a daily demand of at least 60 units.” He added that only individuals having an infection or uncontrolled sugar are discouraged from blood donation. Citizens who have yet to complete at least two weeks after the first or second dose of their Covid vaccination too are told to let the waiting period of two weeks pass. Mosalgi said that the 120 units are quite low and they need to be restock at the earliest. Both the officials appealed to citizens to contact their respective blood banks for the donation from 9am to 9pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sos-for-blood-from-sassoon-ycm-hospitals-left-with-three-days-stock/articleshow/87674558.cms||Piyush Bhusari

I have directed the officials to figure out a plan to start issuing licenses after following due paperwork. This should be done at the earliest,” said SDMC’s standing committee chairman BK Oberoi. SDMC recently sealed a restaurant, which was running without proper license. The eatery had allegedly denied entrance to a woman earlier, objecting to her traditional Indian attire of a saree. After that, many other restaurants were sealed by the corporation that were running with licence. A discussion in the standing committee was held where BJP councilors raised the matter. According to Oberoi, these guesthouse owners will submit a demand draft and an affidavit to the corporation, after which the officials should start the process of de-sealing. As per an SDMC official, these guesthouses were operating in ‘non-conforming’ or residential areas, said the official; hence, they were sealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/guesthouses-sealed-by-sdmc-may-get-relief-soon/articleshow/87675618.cms||---

The observation was made by a division bench comprising Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice C Jayachandran in the judgment overturning the conviction of a father accused of molesting his seven-year-old daughter when his second wife was in the kitchen attached to his home. His first wife had died earlier and the complaint alleging penetrative assault was lodged at the instigation of the second wife, the accused had contended. In the judgment delivered on Wednesday, the court said, “Forensic and semantics apart, child molestation is a shame on society; but if the allegations are false, it is lethal to the life of the accused, more so if the accused is a parent; even if he is eventually acquitted. Here we have the case of a child raising such accusation against her father with the active support of the stepmother; sheer instigation by the latter, pleads the accused.” After noting the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the accusation and the testimonies, the court observed that the evidence from medical examination also showed no proof of any penetrative assault. The court ordered for setting the father at liberty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-will-destroy-dads-life-even-if-acquitted/articleshow/87654150.cms||---

Most government school students were confused as the questions were from the next term syllabus of Mathematics instead of the November syllabus. Schools across the country will be ranked on the basis of the examination. The test was conducted for students of classes III, V, VIII and X. Earlier, the CBSE had stated that students would be prepared for board classes on the basis of this examination. Class X board examination term-1 is to be held by the end of November.

---||Delhi||No second draw of lots under EWS category for school entry||New Delhi: There will be no second draw of lot for the Economically Weaker Section/Disadvantaged (EWS/DG) category for admissions in schools, as per a senior Directorate of Education official. This year, the draw of lots was not held for all the seats in the entry-level classes of private schools. Out of the total 50,000 seats in the entry-level classes (nursery/KG/I), the draw of lots was held for 33,000 seats. As per the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 25% of the seats are reserved for the EWS/DG category in private schools. “Private school association and a few other NGOs have moved Delhi High Court and the matter is now sub judice. So there will be no draw of lots this year. In some time, the admission process for the EWS/DG category for the 2022-23 academic session will start,” said the official on condition of anonymity. Of the 33,000, too, not all seats have been filled. On questioning if the empty seats will be carried over next year, the official added that it would not happen. The matter is sub judice as private schools challenged the education department’s order, asking them to admit EWS students irrespective of the general admissions in the school. According to the private schools, due to Covid, they have not had enough general category admissions this academic year. “As per a high Court order in 2013, for every three general category admission, one EWS student is admitted. But as the department issued an order against it, it was challenged in the court,” said an official of the action committee. Earlier, when a member of the budget private school association had placed a grievance on the matter, the department had said the matter on the second draw of lots was under consideration and would be notified. Chandrakant Singh, general secretary of Private Land Public School Trust, said, “In August, I had raised the matter, as it is unfair for the students who have been waiting to get admission. Most budget private schools have admitted the allotted students. But this practice of not drawing all the seats is not right.” Earlier, a senior official had explained that draw of lots was only held for these many seats based on last year’s reference on how many could be admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-second-draw-of-lots-under-ews-category-for-school-entry/articleshow/87674580.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Slow response to stricter ‘no vaccine, no entry’ rule on Day 1||AHMEDABAD: Implementation of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) stricter ‘No vaccine, No entry’ rule was slack. While at many places such as Flower Garden at Sabarmati Riverfront and at Law Garden people were asked to show certificates which led to confrontation between officials and citizens, there was hardly any checking done at other AMC-run public facilities like BRTS and AMTS buses. Starting from Friday, the civic body started restricting access to those who have not taken both the doses of Covid vaccine to public facilities, like civic transport service and from entering public spaces. Earlier in September, AMC had announced that only those with at least one dose of vaccine will be able to avail relevant municipal services. “Our teams carried out random checking in gardens this morning. We asked the people for certificates and allowed entry to those who could produce certificates of the second dose of vaccine. However, we had to face arguments from many citizens who could not furbish certificates. People were asked to leave the park but they argued that they were not aware of the rule,” an official of AMC’s parks and garden department said. However, at many BRTS and AMTS stands people were seen getting tickets without being asked for the vaccine certificates. At AMC headquarters at Danilimda all visitors were asked for a certificate ofsecond dose before letting them in. A civic body official said that the move of restricting people from entering public places is to give impetus to the ongoing drive to fully vaccinate the city's population. “Not only do they pose a danger to themselves but they also can be harmful to others,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/slow-response-to-stricter-no-vaccine-no-entry-rule-on-day-1/articleshow/87673810.cms||---

After purchasing explosives and precursor chemicals in bomb-making from various licensed companies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the accused, under the guise of forest department vehicles, transported the explosives to Hidma and other Maoists on Telangana-Chhattisgarh border, the NIA alleged. Top Maoists like Hidma, Koyyada Sambaiah and Madakam Kosi hatched a criminal conspiracy to wage a war against the government by resorting to attacks on security personnel, the NIA said in its chargesheet.

The PLGA is the armed wing of the outlawed outfit.Hidma and his cadres were providing huge amounts of money to overground workers to procure the explosives, the NIA alleged. “Investigation has revealed that these workers procured explosive materials, including 500 kg of boosters, 400 gelatine sticks, 400 electric detonators, 5,500 non-electric detonators and 5,490 metres of safety fuse in February this year fraudulently from licensed firms in AP and Telangana,” the NIA said.

Addressing Congress workers at a meeting of the Calangute Congress block committee at Candolim, he said, “Let me apologise for what happened in 2017. You and the people of Goa voted to form the Congress government. Unfortunately, our MLAs betrayed the party.” “Workers were loyal, MLAs were disloyal. Workers were honest, MLAs were dishonest. Workers stood for the party, MLAs went in search of greener pastures. That the Congress leadership could not avert the situation in 2017, is a matter of deep regret. I assure you that such a situation will not occur in 2022,” Chidambaram said. With workers at the meeting raising queries about the selection of the Congress candidate for Calangute, Chidambaram said, “the candidate will only be decided in consultation with the block committee”. “The selection will be based on loyalty, integrity, acceptability to workers and winnability among the larger electorate,” he said. Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar, general secretary and former Calangute MLA Agnelo Fernandes, opposition leader Digambar Kamat, working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and other Congress functionaries were also present at the largely attended meeting.

I only know Congress functionaries. Ask me about Congress,” he said, responding to media queries about Lobo. Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar, responding to a query about Lobo fraternising with aspiring Congress candidates, said, “Michael Lobo is in BJP. He’s a BJP minister.

---||Mumbai||Make physical class a must after Diwali, say schools||MUMBAI: With the nationwide survey of students’ learning outcome in the online mode getting a good response by way of students attendance on Friday, schools want the state to make physical presence in classrooms mandatory when educational institutes reopen after Diwali. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) to assess competencies of students of class 3,5,8 and 10 saw students flocking to their respective schools in large numbers. The ministry of education had given the mandate to schools to ensure 100% attendance depending on class selected for the survey. Of total students, a random chit was drawn to get a strength of 30. These children then the survey in the form of a 90 to 120 minutes test. “As attendance was mandatory, all class 3 and 10 students, barring those outside the city, attended school,” said the principal of a private school in Mahim. When schools reopened for classes 8-10 last month, the response was poor as parental consent was mandatory. “The state should make attendance in physical schools compulsory. The hybrid mode ---online and offline—is not working and children are losing out on learning,” said the principal. Five sets of question-answer booklets were provided to schools. Each student had to answer questions from two subjects (Maths, Science, Social Science, Language). Students moved around in masks. Principals said that class 3 and 5 students were the happiest to be back to school. “Those who were not selected for the test and had to return were sad-faced. They kept asking when physical school will reopen,” said the principal of a school in Bandra. Over 38 lakh students in 733 districts in the country took the survey. In Maharashtra, 7,330 schools and 2.35 lakh students participated in the survey. Across MMR, over 30,000 students of 950 schools were part of the survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-make-physical-class-a-must-after-diwali-say-schools/articleshow/87674588.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||2 sr officials of SECR booked for sexual harassment of dalit woman||Nagpur: Two senior officials of South East Central Railway (SECR) have been booked for alleged sexual harassment on a complaint by 57-year-old dalit woman employee at Sadar police station on Friday. The cops have also invoked sections of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocity) Act against the two officials after she alleged mental torture by the officials as she was from backward class. Senior divisional commercial manager (Sr DCM) Vikas Kumar Kashyap and assistant divisional commercial manager (Asst DCM) Avinash Kumar Anand were charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) section 354A for sexual harassment and section 294 for using abusive language, among other charges. The dalit woman had first lodged a complaint against the officials in September after meeting CP Amitesh Kumar. In September, TOI had published the dalit woman’s complaint to the police. The dalit woman has claimed in her complaint that she was repeatedly summoned to the chamber by Kashyap and Anand. She claimed Kashyap misbehaved with her on June 15 while Anand had called up on her cellphone in August, and used derogatory words for being admitted at the hospital. As per the FIR, officials would try to summon her close to them on the pretext of work, and sneakily attempt to establish bodily contact. She mentioned that the officials would fling papers on the ground and ask her to pick them up. Senior inspector of Sadar police station Vinod Choudhury said the offence was registered after the railways inconclusively ended the Vishakha committee inquiry, without informing the cops of any decision reached by the probe. Initially, Zonal DCP Vinita S had also summoned the concerned railway officials to record a statement after the complaint by the dalit woman, who was also admitted at a hospital due to mental trauma. She had also released a video clip stating senior officials would be responsible if she takes any drastic steps due to overwhelming mental agony. In her FIR too she had mentioned about her intention to end life due to incessant torture. In September, TOI had approached Kashyap for his version, and he had refuted all the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-sr-officials-of-secr-booked-for-sexual-harassment-of-dalit-woman/articleshow/87674604.cms||Soumitra Bose

The Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s national body consolidated its stand on the booster dose soon after top Union government officials made it clear that a policy document on booster dose was being worked out. Senior surgeon and IMA national president J A Jayalal said, “Now, that the production has been augmented and availability of vaccine has increased, IMA demands the Union government to prioritise vulnerable population, including healthcare workers and immunocompromised citizens, and permit them to take the third dose. The booster dose for healthcare workers was initially desirable but we were not demanding it. Now, we demand that healthcare workers should be given a booster dose as ample vaccine stock is available.” Jayalal said, “On one hand, many people across the world do not have access to single dose, while on the other, a large population is demanding the third dose. Now that the production has been augmented, vulnerable population and healthcare workers should be given a booster dose on priority.” In September, doctors attached with the IMA’s Pune branch had unanimously upheld the need for a booster dose for healthcare workers. It was the first unit of the medical body in India to officially make such a recommendation. The members had also expressed readiness to undergo the trial to assess the need for a booster dose among the healthcare workers in India if there were trial plans. Senior paediatrician Dilip Sarda, the chairman of the Pune IMA’s core committee on Covid vaccination, said, “Various studies have proven that vaccine-mediated protective antibodies wane considerably after six to eight months. Healthcare workers are the most exposed and high-risk segment. Hence, they should get the third booster dose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-booster-dose-to-healthcare-workers-high-risk-individuals-grows/articleshow/87674599.cms||Umesh Isalkar

People have been advised to limit outdoor activities. States have been asked to remain ready for implementation of “emergency” measures as per GRAP. The sub-committee, during a meeting, observed that in view of unfavourable meteorology, stubble burning and poor dispersion resulting in accumulation of pollutants, the coming week is critical with regard to air quality in Delhi-NCR. Poor air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, especially when the AQI is in ‘Severe’ category, officials said. “Government and private offices and other establishments are advised to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent by working from home, car-pooling and optimising their field activities, etc. People are advised to limit outdoor activities and minimise their exposure. Implementing agencies, at appropriate level, must closely monitor actions taken and submit daily report,” said minutes of the meeting. The sub-committee said all actions under ‘Severe’ category, including intensifying public transport and introducing differential rate to encourage off-peak travel and closing brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers, would be continued stringently with more rigour. When the PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels remain above 500 and 300 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, for over 48 hours, ‘emergency’ category measures of GRAP are implemented. Prashant Gargava, chairperson of the sub-committee, said, “The AQI is above 450 and we are closely monitoring the situation. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cut-vehicle-usage-by-30-govt-pvt-offices-advised/articleshow/87674620.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Court orders payment of Covid patient’s rejected claim||Ahmedabad: During this pandemic it has been common for Covid-19 patients to see their medical insurance claims either rejected or get heavy deductions from insurers on various pretexts. Ashish Dave, a resident of Nadiad, saw his insurance claim rejected even after he got himself medical insurance specially meant for Covid-19. It was only after Dave knocked at the doors of a consumer court that he received the money spent on his Covid treatment. After the onset of the pandemic, Dave (37) opted for insurance coverage of Rs 2.5 lakh for Covid-19 and bought a policy named Corona Rakshak from Future Generali India Insurance Co Ltd. When his policy was in force, between July 23, 2020 and May 3, 2021, he got infected by the virus and was taken to the Nadiad Civil Hospital on December 1, 2020. Since Covid cases were surging after last Diwali’s festivities, many hospitals were overcrowded. The Nadiad Civil Hospital also did not have a vacant bed and Dave was refused admission. He was transferred to another Covid facility, Mahagujarat Hospital, where he was treated till December 5. On being discharged, Dave claimed his insurance payout, but to his utter shock, the company rejected his claim. The ground for the rejection was Clause 3.7 of the policy, which defined hospitalization for a Covid patient, “Hospitalization means admission to a hospital designated for Covid-19 treatment by the government for a minimum period of 72 consecutive in-patient care hours”. Dave sued the insurer at the Kheda District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, before which the insurer justified its rejection by submitting that Dave needed to be hospitalized for at least three days at a government-designated Covid facility and he had not got treatment at the government facility. The company also cited another policy clause and stressed that three-day hospitalisation was required after testing positive for Covid for payout of 100% of the sum insured. After hearing the case, the commission came to the conclusion that Dave had supplied all proof of his disease and since there was no space at the government hospital, he was transferred to another facility. He was hospitalised for five days and was therefore entitled to his full claim. It ordered the payment of Rs 2.5 lakh with 7% interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-orders-payment-of-covid-patients-rejected-claim/articleshow/87673847.cms||---

Touching upon the chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s promises made to the Muslims before the formation of separate state to provide judicial power and reclaiming Waqf properties in the state, Telangana Pardesh Congress Committee (TPCC) and Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) here on Friday sought Central Waqf Council to intervene immediately into the alleged failure of TSWB towards protecting lands in the state. “Let me remind the CM, who had promised to reclaim Dargah Hazrath Hussain Shah Wali (RA) waqf land soon after the formation of separate state. Apart from, Toli Masjid and Jiyagyarda graveyard lands, which is not being taken into consideration by TSWB as if Board authorities fear to take any step to throw out illegal occupants from the Waqf lands. where encroachments have taken place permanently and no serious steps are being taken by the STWB. Thus, dual policy is being adopted by Telangana Government with regard to safeguarding Waqf lands in the State,’’ said, Osman Bin Mohamme Al Hajri, president Deccan Waqf protection Society and Congress Leader.TTDP took exception against the apathy of the TSWB towards encroachments on graveyards and inaction against land grabbers in the old city of Hyderabad.

With the flattening of the Covid-19 curve, the two municipal corporations have started transferring life-saving medical equipment to the Kamla Nehru hospital, Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital and Jijamata hospital, officials said. Both the jumbo centres, closed since the past few weeks, had treated over 10,000 patients in the two Covid-19 waves in Pune district. Both the facilities have around 1,600 beds, of which over 1,000 are oxygen-supported and around 300 are ventilator-supported. There are a few dialysis-supported beds as well. Ravindra Binwade, additional commissioner, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We are monitoring the post-Diwali Covid situation but so far there is nothing of concern. The decision to transfer the equipment was to ensure better infrastructure availability at other civic hospitals in the periphery.” According to Binwade, the CoEP jumbo unit has been given green signal till January 2022 after its structural audit. “We will decide how to proceed with the infrastructure depending on the Covid situation in the coming days,” he said. Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “Shifting of equipment is already underway. We are replacing the old beds at the YCM hospital with the Annasaheb Magar stadium jumbo unit’s beds. Other life-saving equipment are being moved to other civic hospitals.” The decision on retention of jumbo unit infrastructure is likely to be taken at the state level meeting in the coming days, said the additional commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/equipment-from-jumbo-units-shifted-to-civic-hosps/articleshow/87674614.cms||Piyush Bhusari

It is Kochi circle which witnessed a major jump in registrations (1,496) this year. There were 1,155 active registrations, including those who renewed the registration and who entered the food industry for the first time in 2019 in Ernakulam constituency. It went up to 1,488 in 2020 and jumped again to 1,717 in 2021 so far in Ernakulam. Other constituencies are also making huge jumps in registration of small-scale food industrial units comprising . Food safety department officials say most of the home bakers are women who got time to experiment with their cuisine or baking skills during the lockdown . The registration with the food safety department is done for the food units with turnover less than Rs 12 lakh. If the turnover is above Rs 12 lakh, they should take licence. But the number of those taking licences is very less, said officials adding most of the units are now renewing the licence to start business after remaining closed for more than one-and-a-half years. “We had conducted a door-to-door survey in Kochi corporation limits after the first lockdown restrictions were lifted and found that many are engaged in food unit business by running it in houses. They were given strict warning to register with us, otherwise action would be initiated. This resulted in a rise in registrations,” said a senior food safety official in the district. A senior official said they conduct regular checking in units and take action if any violation of rules is noticed. “Most of the food items prepared in houses are related to cake making and their sales are mostly among relatives, friends and neighbours. But they have not entered into the sweet making sector which needs more involvement and need to prepare the products in bulk to ensure profit,” said Johnson Mathew, office manager of Bakers’ Association. “With Christmas and New year around the corner, the food industry will pick up again. Many customers purchase raw materials for making cakes,” says Kunjachan who runs ‘Bakers Traders’, which sells raw materials of bakery items. “Many returned to the industry after rechristening their hotels and re- registration. The problem we currently face is rising LPG price and shortage in the availability of skilled hotel workers,” says Jayapal of Kerala hotel and restaurant association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rise-seen-in-registration-of-small-scale-food-units/articleshow/87673837.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly directed for issuing notices to Wayfarer Films and M Star Entertainments, which are the producers of the movie based on the life of fugitive Sukumara Kurup. The court’s directive came after considering a public interest litigation filed by Sebin Thomas during admission hearing on Wednesday. Besides the producers, the court has also sought the views of the central and state governments on the matter. Initially scheduled to be released in May this year, the movie came out on Friday and is being screened in over 1,500 screens in multiple languages, including Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi. Through the petition, it is contended that Kurup, who was proclaimed as an offender and who was not convicted by a court, has the rights of an accused person until he is convicted. The movie is an exploitation of Kurup’s right to privacy as he has not consented to the publication of details of his life through a movie and he is not able to approach the court to safeguard his right, the petition said. Further, the petitioner claims that proclaimed offenders could be considered an underprivileged section of the society and that the government has the duty to protect their life and liberty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-notice-to-makers-of-dulquer-starrer-kurup/articleshow/87673858.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Para-athlete in need of professional and financial aid||Hubballi: A talented para-athlete in the district, having proven herself among her peers in the country, is hoping for support from the government that will enable her to participate in global events, and hopefully make the country proud by earning a medal. Nilofar Dharwad, the daughter of a porter, bagged the third place in the ‘Javelin Throw’ event at the National Para Athletics Championship 2021 event that was recently organised by the National Paralympic Committee (NPC). She hurled the javelin 19.82m far, an accomplishment that has earned her praise from feted para-athlete Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda, who believes that Nilofar may achieve much if her talents were honed and encouraged. Nilofar is, with assistance from the government, hoping to enlist the assistance of a professional coach. The recent demise of her loss of her father to cancer, who toiled and trudged to pour the much-needed financial fuel to drive his daughter’s dreams, has left her devastated in more ways than one. Nilofar lost her left hand in 2008, besides sustaining severe injuries on her stomach, and right leg when she was electrocuted. A natural southpaw, the loss of her left hand translated also into the loss of her natural athletic talent. Refusing to accept her fate, Nilofar battled on, continuing her education, and obtaining a degree from Nehru College. It was the feats of her sisters in the arena of sports – Nilofar’s siblings have achieved much in school- and college-level tournaments – that spurred her to take the plunge into athletics. Last year, she participated in the 30th edition of Karnataka State Para Games in the F-46 category, securing the gold in the shot put event, and silver in javelin throw. Her achievements at the state-level event earned her a shot at national fame, and participating in the 19th National Para Athletic Championship 2021, she brought home the bronze medal in the javelin throw event. Nilofar is one of her parents’ six children. Her brother decided to shoulder the family’s burden by turning a porter, like his father, in the wake of the latter’s death. “It’s very difficult for my brother to make ends meet, leave alone provide funds for me to train for javelin throw,” lamented Nilofar. Notwithstanding the seemingly insurmountable problems, Nilofar refuses to accept defeat. She said that she was eager to supplement the family’s income, to which end, she was ready to join any government organisation or a private company. “While I want to take care of my siblings and my mother, I am also determined to make India proud by winning a gold medal at an international event,” she added. ‘She can achieve more with right guidance’ There is much scope for women athletes, but they need professional assistance. If Nilofar can throw the javelin nearly 20m far, I am certain she can achieve a lot more, if provided the necessary guidance. Her talents need to be acknowledged, and local authorities, sports enthusiasts and even the private sector must lend her financial assistance. I will take up her cause with the Karnataka Sports Association for The Physically Handicapped, and do what I can to encourage her. - Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda | Silver Medallist at the 2012 London Paralympics||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/para-athlete-in-need-of-professional-and-financial-aid/articleshow/87673428.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The civic body has finalized 52 wards in new three-member ward system. An official from NMC told TOI the SEC letter setting the deadline arrived a couple of days ago. “This is the first time since announcement of delimitation of wards that the SEC gave a deadline,” he said.

The NMC house also comprises of five co-opt corporators. Notification regarding number of co-opted corporators is likely to be issued in coming days. NMC has finalized number of corporators as per 2011 population census. The 2021 census has been delayed due to Covid-19, therefore, number of corporators will not be as per existing population of the city. Also, NMC is preparing fresh boundaries of all wards as per 2011 population census. Due to this, some wards are likely to have more voters compared to others. On August 25, the SEC had directed starting the process of ward delimitation. At that time, one-member ward system was in existence. NMC started the process but stopped after government revised it to three-member ward system on September 22. The process again got a jolt with the decision of the government to increase number of corporators on October 27. For 2017 municipal elections, the process was started in August and completed by November 25. Delimitation of wards followed by reservations etc had been finalized by November 25. Senior corporator Sunil Agrawal said municipal elections can be conducted by the SEC on time if it wishes to do so. “Earlier, SEC used to give 45 days for MLC elections. Now, SEC has reduced time period to 24 days. SEC can conduct elections on time if it reduce days for suggestions and objections, and expedites the process,” he said. As per normal schedule, code of conduct should come into effect in first week of January followed by polls in second or third week of February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/submit-draft-of-ward-delimitation-by-nov-30-sec-tells-nmc/articleshow/87674637.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Mohd Abdul Azeem, Secretary to Government, referred to the educational emergency being talked about these days. “It requires SOPs to ensure a safe and secure environment for reopening of schools. According to the UN report 2020, nearly 1.7 lakh learners across 190 countries were affected by the pandemic. What it meant was 94% of the world student population was impacted by Covid,” he said. He called for front line educational catalysts on the lines of Covid front line warriors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/focus-on-dropouts-better-schools/articleshow/87674641.cms||Omar bin Taher

Of the seven markets observed by Anarock — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad — Pune was also the only city to record a vacancy rate in single-digit percentage in H1 of the current financial year. It was also accompanied by a push in average rents for office spaces. An average rate of Rs 70/sqft prevailed in the first half of the ongoing fiscal as against Rs 68/sqft in the same period of the last fiscal. “The cost advantage of co-working spaces clearly outstrip the possible risk factors. Data indicates that of the net office absorption of 10.76 million sqft in H1 FY22 across top seven cities, the share of co-working has risen to 8%. In H1 FY21, of net office absorption of 8.31 million sqft, the share of co-working stood at 3%,” the Anarock report said. Pune has also been a beneficiary of the flexible space churn. Real estate consultants Knight Frank said ticket sizes and spaces were varying across requirements and firms, with most deals in the 200-500 seat range. “This helps large companies with smaller strengths to be present in Grade-A properties, while having the flexibility to scale up in the future. The advent of these workspaces is definitely keeping vacancies in check, but the vacancy levels in Pune are fairly comfortable by industry standards,” said P Vilas, Pune director of office transactions and capital markets for Knight Frank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/office-vacancies-dip-flexi-spaces-take-up-market/articleshow/87674661.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Lucknow||Dusty roads spike pollution in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Continuous drives by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) to sprinkle water on broken roads to control dust and check air pollution is not providing desired results. A reality check by the TOI in nearly two dozen localities found that the number of damaged and dusty roads is far more than what the civic body covers daily. As a result, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city continues to be in poor category. According to a survey conducted by the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), broken and dust-laden roads contribute around 87.1% of total air pollution in the city. TimesViewAll civic and development agencies must cooperate with the district administration in checking air pollution caused by dust laden roads. However, a permanent solution of the problem would be to repair pothole ridden roads because they are the ones which cause most air pollution. Besides, there should be more greenery on footpaths/roadside as grass also prevents air pollution caused by dust.The dust raised by moving vehicles remains suspended in the air for long and combines with mist/fog during winter to create smog, comprising aerosols which are responsible for the continued haze being witnessed these days. LMC has eight trucks for sprinkling of water on roads and five for anti-smog spray. These vehicles cover around 80-85km of road networks daily. However, LMC has 236km of road network in the city, of which many stretches are in a bad shape. Though repair work is underway, the pace is slow. Some roads under LDA, PWD, State and National Highways Authorities are also damaged. TOI reality check found dust-laden and damaged roads in Mahanagar, Jankipuram, Jankipuram Extension, Aliganj, Gomtinagar, Alambagh, Aashiana, Hazratganj, Nishatganj, Lajpatnagar, SGPGI road, LDA Colony and Kanpur Road, among others. Residents complain that bad roads not only lead to accidents but the air pollution caused by it leads to itching and redness in eyes and shortness of breath. Residents of Alambagh said dust was causing respiratory problems for adults as well as their kids. “My child is allergic to dust. I also suffer from silicosis and our doctor has strongly advised us to wear mask even inside the house,” said a resident, Kartar Singh. “I feel irritation and itching in my eyes and can’t even sleep properly because of the dust entering our house. Repeated requests to our corporator for repairing of the stretch have gone unheard,” said Abhijeet Singh of Nishatganj. Shalini Tripathi of Telibagh colony said, “Almost all the roads in our locality are broken and riddled with potholes. A thin layer of haze envelops the area during the day. As a precaution, we have to keep windows closed all the time. We have bought an air purifier because air pollution aggravates the condition of my asthamatic mother-in-law.” In an official statement, municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said LMC had deputed five anti-smog trucks and several water sprinkling trucks in all eight zones of the city to settle the dust. Patch work on damaged roads is also being conducted, it said.

---||Rajkot||Record 112 Bhavai artists play bhungal||PALANPUR: Globally renowned Tana-Riri Music Festival of Vadnagar coincided with the 75th year of Independence this year. It was organized recently where a world record was set with 112 artists played the bhungal — a trumpet-like musical instrument made of copper or brass — non-stop for five minutes. Bharat Joshi an organizer stated that Bhavai performers belonging to the Turi-Barot and Nayak community, achieved this melodious feat. To facilitate ease of transportation, the six-feet-long Bhungal is made up of three parts and is later assembled. One of the key musical instruments, besides the tabla for Bhavai performances, the Bhungal gives performers the pitch and dance rhythm. This annual music festival started by then chief minister Narendra Modi is in honour of two sisters Tana and Riri, of Vadnagar, who were Nagar sisters and is celebrated on the 9th day of Kartik (the first month after Diwali). Famous classical singers from India along with accomplished Gujarati classical singers are invited to give a treat for music lovers. Legend has it that Tansen, the famous court musician of Emperor Akbar, sang Raag Deepak so fervently that even lamps lit up magically and the singer too suffered from high fever. To get relief, Tansen knew he had to hear the soothing rendition of of Raag Megh Malhar – an antidote to the heat — and thus, headed for Vadnagar where Tana and Riri sang for him and nursed him back to health. Akbar then summoned the two sisters to his court, but owing to the conservative societal norms of the community, Tana and Riri preferred to immolate themselves in Vadnagar than refuse or disobey the emperor’s summons. A samadhi was created in Vadnagar called the Tana Riri Samadhi and the annual classical music festival is held near this Samadhi. Those present at the function this year were Sangeet Natak Academy’s Pankaj Bhatt, chief of Genius Foundation, Pawan Solanki among many others. The organiser of the festival was Bharat Vyas of Himmatnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/record-112-bhavai-artists-play-bhungal/articleshow/87674419.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covid vax: NMC reaches out to beggars, destitute, transgenders||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which is planning to push Covid vaccination through door-to-door drive, has reached out to over 1,500 underprivileged persons who don’t have any identification proof. “These were beggars, destitute, transgenders and religious monks who do not have any identification papers but needed to be vaccinated,” said officials. Deputy NMC commissioner Ram Joshi said it can happen through special camps — a facility available in the Co-Win app itself. Dr Gowardhan Nawghare, immunization officer of the NMC, said, “Inmates in jails and mental hospitals have been covered under such drives apart from those living in destitute like the missionaries of charity’s shelter at Katol Road.” Vaccination of transgenders was done through NGO Sarthi trust. Another NGO Beti Bachao also took part in the drive. The homeless found near Cotton Market have also been vaccinated in a similar manner. “If a person does not have any document as ID proof, there is a special provision in the Co-Win app. Such persons’ names can be registered against the credentials of any other person who refers them. Even a single ID proof is enough with which an entire group can be vaccinated on the basis of a single ID document,” said Nawghare. Even the NMC officials are providing their ID documents for the purpose, added an official. “The NMC has taken up the cases through NGOs. However, such persons would also be covered the door-to-door campaign planned by the civic body,” said Nawghare. Elderly who do not have any papers or even the underprivileged can be covered under the door-to-door drive. Such persons are expected to be working in shops or taking up similar callings in the unorganized sector. TOI went around the city looking for such persons. A few also inquired about the procedure of getting jabbed if they did not have Aadhaar or any other paper. A group of homeless persons living near Kasturchand Park said they had already got themselves vaccinated back in their home state of Rajashtan. However, they did not show their Aadhaar card or the certificate when requested. A group of workers at Metro rail site on the Central Avenue quipped their vaccination cards. “I got both the doses back in Bihar,” said Sujit Kumar, a worker at the site. Mahadev Marandi, another worker, said he had his first dose at his home state in Jharkhand and the second is yet to be due. A little ahead, transgender Durga found seeking alms said she got the first dose in Odisha where she come from, and was waiting for the next. Mallaram Parmar, a nomadic shepherd now camping near Paratwada, was worried about his second dose. “I have got the first dose in Rajasthan but have left my papers back there. I am not sure if I will be able to get the second dose here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-vax-nmc-reaches-out-to-beggars-destitute-transgenders/articleshow/87673876.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Political party workers should follow restraint: Gadkari||Nagpur: Union transportation minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday called on party activists to follow restraint and do “smart work” while working for any organisation. He was speaking during a book launch function of MLC Girish Vyas. The book depicts various works done by him in six years of his tenure. A Diwali get together was also arranged on the occasion by BJP workers at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh. Former MPs — Datta Meghe and Ajay Sancheti, former minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, city president Praveen Datke and former MLC Anil Sole shared the stage. Bawankule and other leaders also addressed the gathering while leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis interacted in a virtual manner. Vyas’ term would end on January 1 next year and the book launch was his effort to stake his claim to retain the seat, as per BJP activists. Earlier, the city MP rekindled old memories while working with Vyas for the party. He recollected that at one time, BJP did not have strength in the city. “There was not even a single MLA that time. But all party workers worked hard to achieve the success and bring good days for the party. Rambhau Mhalgi started the tradition of reporting on development works. Vyas’ book is a medium to convey the work done as a representative of the people. He and I are old activists. It is said that when one gets old, the friendship breaks down. However, this is not the case in BJP,” he said. He added that Vyas and he also worked during the days of emergency and then both started working for Yuva Morcha. Speaking on the worker’s role, the senior BJP minister said the party was expanded due to their hard work and efforts. “A person who works with restraint is a true worker and he is a real strength of the party. The party often gets to top due to them and even gets down, if they don’t work. It is necessary that the workers should be smart, they may not be very wise.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/political-party-workers-should-follow-restraint-gadkari/articleshow/87674651.cms||---

---||Goa||Rainfall activity over Goa may increase from tomorrow||PANAJI: An increase in rainfall activity is likely over Goa in the coming days, said the India meteorological department (IMD) in its forecast on Friday. The weather change is following a depression near Tamil Nadu coast which is weakened into a low-pressure area. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over the south Andaman Sea and the neighbourhood by Saturday. “The weather was dry over the state on Thursday and Friday but there is a significant change in the sky conditions going from clear skies to cloudy. There are easterly winds over Goa causing the clouding and there is a possibility of light to moderate rain in the coming days,” the IMD forecast states. The IMD said the weather condition will continue for five to six days over Goa. Along with which, there is a likelihood of some increase in rainfall activity from November 14 or 15 onwards. There are chances of lightning and thundershowers over one or two places in the state as well. The IMD has also warned against working in open areas or even taking shelter under tall trees during the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rainfall-activity-over-state-may-increase-from-tomorrow/articleshow/87674672.cms||---

The six—Mahesh Visani alias Varchand who married the woman forcibly and sexually assaulted her, his brother Visan, the woman’s father Tejabhai Ahir and brother Rajesh, village sarpanch Veljibhai Jaga Patel alias Dilla and Pachabhai Patel alias Dilla—are in the custody of the Powai police. The woman had filed a first information report (FIR) against them on Thursday. The six have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections, including wrongful confinement, kidnapping a woman with the intent to get her married, criminal intimidation and conspiracy, and under the Information Technology Act for transmitting sexually explicit material in an electronic form. On Thursday, the Bombay high court had summoned Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale in the case, who appeared through videoconferencing and assured of an inquiry into lapses by the Powai police. On November 6, Powai police had provided security to the woman and her husband’s family on an HC order, fearing a threat from the man with whom she was forcibly married by her parents and the sarpanch. The couple’s advocate Pranav Badheka said the accused had thought they were above law and could subvert the system. “They were emboldened when every illegal and unlawful action of theirs was taken lightly by police,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-lodged-in-inter-caste-marriage-case-6-held/articleshow/87674659.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court unhappy with tardy pace of investigation against MLAs, MPs||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has expressed “dissatisfaction” over the speed of investigation in cases against sitting or former MPs and MLAs. The HC made these observations after the IGP (Administration, Law and Order), Haryana, submitted an affidavit informing that out of 44 cases under investigation, final reports have been submitted in 30 after completion of investigation, challan has been submitted before the trial court in seven cases, cancellation reports submitted in seven cases and in 16 cases, untraced reports have been written and the final report will be submitted to the competent court of law. It has further been pointed out that there are 17 more cases of sitting or former MPs/ MLAs, in which investigation is still in progress. Hearing this, a division bench headed by Justice A G Masih observed, “A perusal of the said affidavit would indicate that the speed, at which the progress of investigation is going on, is not satisfactory.” The Haryana government counsel informed that the IGP is personally monitoring these investigations and sincere endeavour would be made to conclude the investigations within six weeks and submit the report in this regard. In case of Punjab, an affidavit of the IGP, Crime-3, Bureau of Investigation, was filed, informing the HC that 42 cases are under investigation, 32 cases are under trial and that out of 10 cases, cancellation/untraced reports have also been presented in eight. It was further pointed out that fresh reports received indicate that 53 cases are pending at various stages before the trial court, out of which, in 14 cases cancellation/untraced reports have been submitted. The IGP’s affidavit suggested that in most of the cases, either cancellation/untraced reports have been prepared but not submitted to the courts and in some cases, the said reports have been presented to the courts. On this, the HC observed that the impression gathered is that effort is being made to push through things without really looking into the true aspect of investigation and conclusions thereof. “To dispel this opinion of the court, we direct the IGP (crime) to personally look into the reports and, if satisfied, proceed to submit the same in courts,” the HC has ordered. CBI counsel Sumeet Goel said that in some of the matters pending against the MPs/MLAs (former or sitting), stay has been granted by courts, wherein appropriate applications have been moved for vacation of the stay. Efforts are being made to expedite the trial. It was pointed out that the further investigations in cases where challans had already been presented are in progress and efforts are being made to expedite the same. The UT Chandigarh administration informed that only one case against a public representative in which the investigation was going on earlier, stands concluded and challan has been presented in the court on October 13 and no further case is pending for investigation as of now. The matter has now been adjourned for January 10 for submissions of further reports indicating the progress in various cases. THE ISSUE:The matter is pending before the HC in a suo motu petition where the court had sought details from Punjab, Haryana and the UT Chandigarh about the pendency of cases against the leaders in their respective states. The HC had taken cognisance of the matter in following the directions of the SC and appointed senior advocate Rupinder Khosla as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-unhappy-with-pace-of-probe-against-mlas-mps/articleshow/87674664.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Women are victims in overhalf of blazes in the Maharashtra state||Mumbai: More than half of all fire-related casualties in Maharashtra last year were women. Data with the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) also shows that 60% of the 762 fires in the state, that resulted either in fatalities or injuries, were reported in residential buildings. Maharashtra ranked fourth in the country in terms of maximum major blazes, after Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Of the 767 fire related casualties in Maharashtra, 442 were women. “Women are typically the first to enter the kitchen and the last to leave, making them more vulnerable where it comes to domestic fires," says forensic fire investigator Nilesh Ukunde. About 28% of all fires in the state were caused from stove burst or cooking gas cylinder explosions last year. "During festivals, women tend to sit on the floor in close proximity to the stove and the LPG cylinder for making snacks. As cylinder pressure increases, gas could leak from the joint where the rubber tube is attached to the stove. Being heavier, LPG stays back in the room and mere friction could cause it to ignite," said Ukunde, adding that people rarely bother to change the rubber tube. One of the reasons why fires in residential premises are higher than those in commercial establishments is that compliance is taken very seriously in the latter. "In several residential premises, firefighting equipment may be installed but does not function when required. Also commercial establishments are not occupied round the clock like most residential structures," said Prakash Devdas, president, Mumbai Fire Brigade Officers Association. He said the fire department does not have adequate staff to inspect multiple fully-occupied premises in the city. Recently the Mumbai Fire Brigade was unable to start a mini fire station at Santacruz owing to a lack of staff. The fire brigade currently has 750 vacant posts and hasn't been able to recruit more personnel due to the pandemic. Typically, in prominent commercial spaces, there is a housekeeping agency which monitors encroachments in common areas or refuge floors. "But in residential areas, there have been several instances of refuge areas and common spaces being encroached, sometimes to the extent of househelps using it for staying or cooking. Buildings should be designed very carefully with toilets not located above meter boxes as in case of a leakages from the toilet, sparks erupt from the meter box and no one may realize till things get serious," said Shirish Sukhatme, former president of Practicing Engineers Architects and Town Planners Association. But awareness about fire safety is low. Building managements often skip maintenance of fire equipment and mock drills are almost never carried out. "A life-saving apparatus like a fire extinguisher could turn into a ‘life-taking apparatus’ if not maintained properly," said Ukunde, adding that when a fire breaks out, the first few seconds are crucial. Whether it was the Ahmednagar blaze involving children or the one in Pune where victims were so badly charred that DNA tests were required for identification, those who escaped or were pulled out soon were the ones that survived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/women-are-victims-in-overhalf-of-blazes-in-the-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87674692.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Experts caution against laxity as cases low even after festive rush||Nagpur: The last two weeks saw people travelling a lot, mixing up and shopping during the festive period, something which hadn’t happened in the 19 months of the pandemic. Yet, Vidarbha has not reported any fresh surge in Covid-19 cases. According to experts, little or no surge in new cases despite the festive rush is a good indicator that the virus is currently not multiplying. At the same time, they said it would be too early to say that the pandemic is turning endemic. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said it’s a good sign that cases are still at the baseline. “But, we need to see whether new cases increase in the next two weeks. If they remain low like they are now, it’s a big good news,” he said. According to Dr Shinde, February 2022 would be the deadline to decisively announce whether it’s an endemic. “The second wave had started in February 2021. If the same trend of low cases continues till February, we can conclude that the pandemic has turned into endemic,” he said. Member of Covid task force Dr Prashant Joshi cautioned that Covid is not going away in a hurry. “Why is Europe now epicentre despite high vaccination coverage? Look at the history of Covid in countries like China and Russia,” he said. Stressing that it is not the time to let our guard down, Dr Joshi said the current trend gives us hope that it would become endemic one day, “but not so early”. As far as Vidarbha is concerned, the number of daily new cases which was in single digit pre-Diwali has reached double digits from November 10. There have been four deaths in the last six days. “However, this small surge cannot be linked only to festivity,” said a senior official from health department. The number of tests had reduced during pre-Diwali time due to back-to-back holidays. “But, we have resumed the tests post-Diwali. With more tests, many asymptomatic patients are getting detected randomly,” said the official. General physician Dr Vinit Patil said that there is massive surge in cases of viral infections, cough, cold, and fever in the last 10 days. “But this is not Covid-19. Most of the patients to whom I referred Covid-19 tests returned negative. These are general infections due to weather change. With confusion still high, it’s always better to get tested,” he said. # Figures can be illusionary - Pre-Diwali downfall in new cases was due to less testing during holidays- Post-Diwali, as average number of tests has increased, new cases are up - So, pre-festivity or post-festivity connection cannot be established so early- At least next two weeks are crucial, but we must be careful even after that- New cases, smaller surges are expected now; vaccination only protection||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-caution-against-laxity-as-cases-low-even-after-festive-rush/articleshow/87673903.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Haryana OPD services hit as govt docs protest direct recruitment of medical officers||Chandigarh: Routine OPD services and clinical diagnostics were hit and patients harried in Haryana on Friday, as doctors across the state observed a two-hour strike in the government hospitals. The strike was held on a call by the Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA), to protest against the state government’s move to directly recruit senior medical officers (SMOs), delay in the creation of a sub-cadre of specialists and to press their demand for a quota of HCMS doctors for master degrees. Biochemistry, pathology and radio diagnostic services came to a complete stop for OPD patients. In some hospitals, even urgent ultrasound and X-rays were not held during the two-hour strike. Medicos in all district hospitals raised slogans against state authorities and demanded the immediate withdrawal of recruitment process of SMOs. They said the recruitments will jeopardise the growth of existing HCMS doctors. HCMSA office-bearers denied that emergency services were hit. They insisted that even patients cooperated with them. “First, we cannot affort to disturb emergency services. We are doctors first; hence, this is not possible at all. Only routine OPDs were not held for two hours. Else, emergency OPDs, emergency surgical procedures and diagnoses were held as routine, without any problem to patients,’’ said Dr Jasbir Singh Panwar, the president of HCMSA. Panwar said the agitation will continue till the government doesn’t withdraw the move of SMO recruitment as well as resume the quota system of HCMS doctors for master’s degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-opd-services-hit-as-govt-docs-protest-direct-recruitment-of-medical-officers/articleshow/87674679.cms||---

The sighting has been reported by citizens near gate number 3, and the animal was seen going in the direction of the post office. Honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate said camera traps were being set up and officials will keep a watch there, but it’s a “known fact” that the leopard is present in the Ordnance Factory and Ambazari belt. Ordnance Factory has told residents and workers in the area to be vigilant and not confront the animal if it is sighted. In the city, officials are being kept busy with the elusive crocodile in Nag River. Hate said, “On Friday we put up signages there, informing people to be careful and not enter in the embankment. We had set up a camera trap but there is no sighting of the crocodile yet.” The officials will continue to monitor the area at least for a few days because if the crocodile is sighted again, they will need to move ahead with the plan of capturing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-sighting-reported-in-ordance-factory/articleshow/87673890.cms||---

In the first phase, a 1.1 km cycle track has been developed between Trimbak Naka and Veer Savarkar swimming pool. NMC is already in the process of appointing an agency to develop the cycle track and work for which is expected to begin within a couple of months. NMC officials said the proposed cycle track is the part of 1.8 km barrier-free road between Trimbak Naka and Sharanpur junction. “We have already called for bids to construct the second phase of barrier-free road, including a cycle track project. The tender process is to be completed by first half of December. The work order to be given by December-end. We are expecting the work will begin from January next year,” said an NMC official. The financial provision has already been made in the budget for the current financial year.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Glossopteris leaf to adorn BSIP new building architecture||LUCKNOW: A new building at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) will have a blend of Indo-Saracenic styled architecture representing ‘Lakhnavi tehzeeb’ and design inspired from the Glossopteris leaf—the subject of the famed palaeobotanist’s research. The leaf, which looks like a tongue fern, will symbolise the contribution of renowned palaeobotanist Prof Birbal Sahni to the field of Palaeosciences. The foundation stone of the building will be laid shortly to mark the platinum jubilee anniversary of the scientific institute. The building will come up on the premises at a cost of around Rs 90 crore. One of the two old buildings which are not in a very good shape will be demolished. Former secretary of the department of science and technology Ashutosh Sharma said, “The institute is old and required a new building that will do justice to modern science with hi-tech and modern laboratories. The importance of palaeosciences is increasing day by day.” BSIP director Vandana Prasad said, “After going through designs of around 20 architects from across the country, the scientific institute has selected a design which is a tribute to our founding father Birbal Sahni and the architectural beauty of our city.” She said the government had already sanctioned funds and the foundation stone of the building will be laid shortly. The new building, to come up on a sprawling area of 14,000 square feet, is expected to be completed in two years. “Due to space constraints, we couldn’t set up our astrobiology and molecular biology laboratories. This new seven-storey building will make it all possible,” she said. What is the Glossopteris leaf?The leaf is easy to recognize because of its distinctive design. Glossopteris means ‘tongue fern’ in Greek, because of its shape. Fossil evidence suggests that the plant probably grew in diverse habitats and came in different forms. Prof Sahni had described Glossopteris in detail and identified differences between the flora of India and Australia with that of China and Sumatra. BSIP film to showcase 75 year journey on founder’s day:The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences will celebrate its founder’s day on Sunday. The scientific institute will release a documentary featuring the 75 year-journey of BSIP to celebrate its platinum jubilee. Secretary, ministry of earth sciences and department of science and technology (additional charge), M Ravichandran will be the chief guest, while secretary, science and engineering research board, DST, Prof Sandeep Verma will deliver the 51st Birbal Sahni memorial lecture titled ‘STIP 2020: Policy and processes’ on the occasion. “We feel privileged to have two great scientists joining us on our founders’ day celebration. It would be a learning experience for everyone to hear M Ravichandran, who is a legendary scientist and has served as director, National Centre for Ocean and Polar Research in Goa and is credited for leading the coordination of several scientific missions in India to Antarctica and the Arctic,” said BSIP director, Vandana Prasad. She said another giant from the field of bioorganic chemist, renowned chemical biologist and a professor in the department of chemistry at IIT Kanpur Sandeep Verma, who is also an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences will be joining the celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/glossopteris-leaf-to-adorn-bsip-new-bldg-architecture/articleshow/87675290.cms||Mohita Tewari

Addressing the mediapersons, Rathi, who is working as director of youth welfare in Maharshi Dayanand University, said the film deals with the struggle a young girl during her college days. “There had been several instances where young girls had to quit their studies due to issues of financial constraints and mindless chasing by fellow college mates, affecting their studies and personal lives,” Jagbir said, adding that such instances moved him to make a movie on it. For the reason that this film was made on the core theme to spread awareness about young college girls, the income of this movie would be dedicated to the disabled girls in need of financial assistance. “To begin with, we have adopted a visually challenged girl studying in a local college wherein we would take care of her diet, fee, tuition and other expenses which her family finds it challenging to meet,” he added.

Chairperson of Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) Shantaram Kolvenkar said the system has been lying unused as it was not maintained by authorities. However, a source from the South Goa collectorate said that it was decided that the PMC would maintain the system. “The collectorate had even paid Rs 8.12 lakh from February 2017 to January 2019 for maintenance and upkeep of the system after the expiry of the one-year guarantee period,” the source added. The sophisticated surveillance system was procured in 2015 with an aim to prevent untoward incidents by monitoring real time activities, including traffic discipline and crimes. Altogether 22 CCTV cameras had been installed at 16 locations across the town. Nupur Electronics, a Panaji-based company, had provided the surveillance system at a cost of Rs 32.9 lakh in 2015. The surveillance system had a recording unit, video display units and CCTV cameras including night vision fixed cameras and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras. The cameras are connected to a DVR at the main monitoring unit installed at the National Informatics Center (NIC) control room at the South Goa Collectorate, Margao to record captured videos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/even-after-ponda-gets-maintenance-funds-cctv-system-lies-abandoned-for-4-years/articleshow/87674751.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Lucknow||UP ex-minister Gayatri Prajapati gets life imprisonment in gang-rape case||LUCKNOW: A special (MP/MLA) court awarded life imprisonment on Friday to former UP minister Gayatri Prajapati and two of his accomplices — Ashok Tiwari and Ashish Shukla — in a gang-rape case. It also fined them Rs 2 lakh each. Special judge PK Rai declined their plea to punish them with the minimum quantum of sentence. The three were present in court and were taken to jail to serve their life terms. They now have the option of moving the high court against the judgment and order passed by the special court, which had pronounced them guilty on Wednesday. The prosecution had opposed the convicts’ plea for leniency in sentencing. “If a man in such a responsible post commits this kind of offence, misusing his power and position, the court should deal with him sternly in order to give a message to society,” the prosecution argued. Prajapati, who was the mining department minister in the then Akhilesh Yadav government, was arrested and sent to jail on March 15, 2017 on charges of raping a woman and attempting to rape her minor daughter. He has been in prison since then. Prajapati also faces multiple probes in the alleged mining scam in the state during his tenure as minister. He was granted bail once but it was cancelled by the high court immediately, before he could walk out of jail. The HC had noted that there had been foul play in granting bail. Declaring Gayatri and the two others guilty two days ago, the special judge had said on Wednesday that the prosecution had succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court had found all three guilty under IPC Sections 376 (D) and 5 (g) read with Section 6 of the Pocso Act. The court, however, acquitted Vikas Verma, Roopeshwar, Amrendra Singh, alias Pintu, and Chandrapal for lack of evidence. The prosecution had produced 17 witnesses in the case. A senior police officer said that Ashish Shukla was the former minister’s aide, that he looked after his work in the state capital and was also an important link with his constituency in Amethi. On the other hand, Ashok Tiwari was a government officer posted as “lekhpal” in Amethi tehsil. He was suspended on March 5, 2017. The officer also said Tiwari kept all the mining records of the former minister. According to the police, the survivor was introduced to the minister in 2013 at his official residence by Ashok Tewari. Thereafter, during her meetings with the minister, Prajapati offered to allot her a license for sand mining. At one of the meetings, she was allegedly served tea laced with sedatives and raped while objectionable photographs were taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-ex-minister-gayatri-prajapati-gets-life-imprisonment-in-gang-rape-case/articleshow/87676152.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Now, they will have to collect at least Rs1.48 crore daily, confirmed deputy municipal commissioner Milind Meshram. The monthly target for November is Rs 53.49 crore.The standing committee headed by Prakash Bhoyar had set a target of Rs332.49 crore for the current financial year, but property tax recovery till October end was Rs96.46 crore.Though NMC is focusing on recovering current tax, it will simultaneously target defaulters. According to data compiled by the NMC’s tax department, there are over 3.86 lakh property owners who have defaulted on tax to the tune of Rs651.75 crore.The department has compiled data of defaulters classifying them into five categories — 643 who have dues of over Rs5 lakh and above each. Their cumulative outstanding dues stand at Rs269 crore. Similarly, property owners who have defaulted between Rs1 lakh and Rs4.99 lakh (2,326), their outstanding tax is Rs45.05 crore. Total 5,058 owners owe between Rs50,000 and Rs99,999 to NMC and the total dues are estimated at Rs33.86 crore. Over 20,713 property owners have defaulted on tax between Rs25,000 and Rs49,999 and the dues are Rs68.88 crore.Likewise, 1,72,285 property owners have dues between Rs5,000 and Rs24,999 and they owe Rs191.94 crore. Total 1,85,772 property owners owe between Re1 and Rs5,000 tax. Their total outstanding dues are over Rs42.91 crore.Independent corporator Abha Pande said the civic administration needs to strengthen property tax collection as it is the main source of revenue.With the deteriorating financial situation of NMC, Pande said the reason for such high outstanding revenue needs to be addressed urgently and stringent efforts should be made to reverse the trend.Though NMC had launched amnesty scheme in December last year, it evoked poor response.

According to them, this is affecting the realty business and also causing huge problems for the property owners. Deepak Badyal, general secretary of Punjab Property Dealers and Colonisers Association, said, “According to government norms, any person having plot in unapproved colony can get his property regularised by paying the required fee. But even after payment of fee and getting NOC from authorities like GLADA, power connections are being refused to them by PSPCL on the pretext that the colony in which their plot is located is not approved. This is clear violation of the rules and due to this the plot holders are facing huge trauma as how they will build their homes without power. Moreover, this is also having affect on the realty business as why would people buy the properties and pay regularisation fee when they are not going to get power connection” According to Ritin Dhir, a resident who is facing such problem, “It has been almost seven months since I got NOC from GLADA for my plot after which I applied for power connection with PSPCL. But after months of sitting on my application, it has been refused by the department on the protext that the colony in which my plot is located is unauthorised.

Two Zika positive patients were diagnosed on Thursday. All three patients are unrelated to one another and have no travel history prior to contracting the disease. The two patients diagnosed on Thursday include a 24-year-old woman from LDA colony Kanpur road and a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh in Hussainganj. The 48-year-old woman’s sample was also taken as part of the district health department’s random sampling drive for Zika virus after a surge in cases were reported from Kanpur. Complaining of mild fever, she had visited Dr SPM Civil hospital on November 10 after which she had become asymptomatic with medication. “The woman had no travel history, but she had put up a temporary stall outside her home during Diwali which could have exposed her to the infected mosquito. She is asymptomatic and at her home,” said district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. Meanwhile the health department collected samples of 106 people who lived near or worked with the first two Zika patients. These samples were sent for testing. While the female patient was said to be doing well, the male patient who had gone to Ambedkarnagar because he was asymptomatic and was not aware of his report status till about Thursday, returned to Lucknow on Friday. “The Ambedkarnagar chief medical officer’s (CMO) office had been informed about the patient’s presence and that he should be contained in the district itself. But he returned to Lucknow on Friday. It is important that a Zika patient’s movement is restricted,” said Dr Vardhan. Updates of all three patients are now being taken by the district health team both on ground and through telephonic communication. “The virus travels from one place to another. Since there are frequent visitors between Lucknow and Kanpur, the latter of which is currently most affected by Zika in the state, it is possible that the virus travelled from Kanpur itself through one or the other source. It is a human to human contagious virus caused by a vector which is the mosquito,” Dr Vardhan explained when asked if the virus is present in Lucknow’s atmosphere irrespective of contact with Kanpur.

As per the norms, the properties should obtain the completion certificate after the construction is completed. The NMC then levies property tax on such properties. But in many cases, properties are utilised without getting the certificate. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Friday informed the general body that the civic administration has started the painstaking task of identifying such properties and levying provisional property tax. So far, the civic body has collected over Rs 25 crore from 21,000 such properties in the last three months. There are an estimated 60,000-70,000 such properties in the city. Jadhav said that the administration has set a target of collecting approximately Rs 100 crore from such properties by the end of this fiscal. “We are also conducting survey to know about how many properties were given commencement certificates and how many of them obtained the completion certificates. We will collect the data from 2001,” he said. During the general body meeting held on Friday, city mayor Satish Kulkarni for the second time turned down a proposal of the civic administration to levy a penalty on such properties. Kulkarni also said that a special meeting of the general body is to be called next week to recruit manpower on a temporary basis. Recruitment has not taken place in the last 15-20 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-takes-up-spl-drive-to-collect-property-tax/articleshow/87673032.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 3D turns surgeries 360°||AHMEDABAD: Recently, a 14-year-old boy came under the care of the onco-orthopaedic surgeons at Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI). His lower leg’s bone (tibia) needed to be operated on to remove a tumour. “In the conventional method, we study X-ray and MRI scans of the area, plan a surgery, and cut the infected bone to ensure that the tumour doesn’t spread further,” said Dr Abhijeet Salunke, an onco-orthopaedic surgeon at GCRI. “That would have made the boy live with a prosthetic limb all his life.” Dr Salunke added: “But the new techniques help us preserve the original bone. We cut the specific part of the bone, remove the tumour, disinfect the bone, and re-attach it with a customized 3D printed metal plate.” The conventional methods don’t give the precision that’s required for the process — a bone cut the wrong way by just a millimetre may not have helped save the boy’s leg. Moreover, such a cut might prevent the bone from adapting as he grows up. Thus, in this case, the doctors first created a 3D model of the boy’s knee joint and tibia. Based on the model, a cutting jig (an instrument that helps doctors cut the bone with precision) and a metal plate were made specifically for the case. “The surgery took half the time of the conventional procedure and was successful,” Dr Salunke said. “The boy will have to follow up with us for the next couple of years, but he will walk with his own leg.” 3D printing involves planning of a case with the help of CT and MRI scans and it has its learning curve. As the surgeon performs more cases with this method, the duration of the planning period reduces from a week to a day, said Dr Salunke. 3D printing usually evokes models of toys, renderings of architectural plans, or at best some practical applications such as resin jewellery. But the advancement in the technology is also helping medical science. At GCRI alone, about 25 surgeries are done with the help of 3D models, whereas in private settings, the number could be much higher, said experts. The 3D printing method has been a “medical boon” for complex bone tumour surgeries involving the knee joint and the pelvic area. This process is helping surgeons devise patient-specific surgical instruments and implants. “Cost is a determining factor along with the complexity of a case,” said Dr Suresh Ludhwani, a city-based radiologist who makes medical 3D models for surgeons. “In the past couple of years, I have made models for bones, soft tissues, and internal organs,” said Dr Ludhwani. “Earlier, the printing quality was not good, but now the models are life-like with colour differentiation.” Dr Ludhwani added: “The process not only helps in surgery but also makes it easy to explain the procedure to the patients and their relatives.” Dr Vikas Warikoo, a GI cancer surgeon, said that doctors have used a 3D printed model of tumour involving the liver and have performed a complex liver surgery. Dr Keval Patel, a uro-oncosurgeon, said that 3D printed model of kidney and blood vessels helped his team perform partial nephrectomy and save the remaining kidney. Post-mucormycosis regenerationA patient in the late sixties had come to the clinic of a maxillofacial surgeon. The patient had mucormycosis, resulting in severe facial deformation due to the removal of the upper jaw and parts of facial tissues. The person had difficulty in speaking and eating. In this case, the conventional mapping of the oral cavity was not possible to make the partial denture. The experts got an MRI scan of the intact jaws and created a mirror image to make the denture for the other side of the face. It worked well — the patient could eat and speak normally after two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3d-turns-surgeries-360/articleshow/87674156.cms||Parth Shastri

The sub-committee is likely to discuss issue of Devadula, Thorrigadda, Chagalanad lift project and Kakatiya canal cross regulator issues in the meeting. The Telangana government expressed its strong objection a couple of weeks ago as the GRMB was not forwarding its projects DPRs to the Central Water Commission and instead asked information from them. Meanwhile, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has asked both Telangana and AP governments to submit details like outlets, water flow, gates, flood hydrograph, reservoir routing study, etc., of Srisailam, Jurala and Pulichintala projects on Krishna river immediately. It also asked details of next 30 years’ water demand of both states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/grmb-panel-to-discuss-devadula/articleshow/87674728.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||MC yet to give breakup of rs 212cr spent on maintenance of roads: RTI activist||Ludhiana: RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal on Friday staged a silent protest for two hours at zone D office against bridges and road department for not supplying detailed information about spending Rs 212 crore despite reminders by vigilance department for conducting inquiry. He also sent his memorandum to principal secretary complaining against the civic officials. He claimed that he had given ultimatum to civic authorities several times, but no action was taken in this regard. However, the MC officials claimed they were preparing the report and it would be put up shortly. Sabharwal, a few months ago, had taken information under RTI from MC about total expenses on construction and maintenance of city roads in the last few years. The officials under RTI revealed Rs 212 crore was spent in only five financial years on maintenance of existing roads and Rs 177 crore approximately was spent on construction of new roads, but could not provide the details on which road how much was spent. He complained with central vigilance officer about this issue and even after seven reminders, the officials are yet to file their reply. Recently, MC officials issued a press note in which they clarified that they paid only Rs 11.58 crore from 2015-16 to 2019-20 to the hot mix plant for repair work while rest amount was spent on the construction of central verges, recondition of roads and widening of old roads. Sabharwal alleged the officials are delaying information intentionally as it does not take nine months to provide the information if is available in records. However, when contacted, additional MC commissioner Aadityanath Dacchalwal said, “We are getting the detailed report ready as it will go to vigilance for their inquiry. Only Rs 12 crore is spent on patch work not Rs 212 crore, as more works are included in this total expenditure amount.” He said they will soon share the detail with everybody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-yet-to-give-breakup-of-rs-212cr-spent-on-maintenance-of-roads-rti-activist/articleshow/87674724.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nashik||Driver injured as protesters throw stone at Pune-bound Shivshahi bus||NASHIK: A stone was pelted on a Shivshahi bus headed towards Pune from Nashik on Friday afternoon, leaving its windshield shattered and the driver with injuries to his hand. Divisional transport officer K S Patil said the incident took place near Sinnar, about 30 km from Nashik city, around 2.30 pm on Friday. There were 47 passengers in the bus at the time of the incident, luckily none of them sustained any injuries. Patil said that soon after the incident, the bus was halted on the spot. An additional Shivshahi bus was sent to Sinnar to pick up the passengers and take them towards Pune. The bus completed the journey an hour late. The Sinnar police are in the process of registering an offence against the unidentified persons for the stone pelting. This is the second incident of stone pelting on Shivshahi bus. On Thursday, two buses stationed at Mumbai Naka bus stand were targeted and their glass panes were damaged. There were no passengers in the buses at the time. The buses are leaving the depots under a police escort vehicle, but the cover ends after the buses reach the highway, officials said. Patil said they had increased the number of buses plying towards Pune and Dhule. The buses are leaving from the Thakkar Bus Stand as soon as they are filled with passengers. From 10am to 7pm on Friday, four buses were sent to Pune and another four to Dhule. He added that the buses would continue to ply despite the Friday afternoon incident. The police are already escorting the buses till the outskirts of the city since Thursday, said Patil. MSRTC operates 36 buses as strike continues The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) managed to operate 36 buses in the state on Friday amid the ongoing strike by the employees. MSRTC officials had claimed earlier in the day that some employees resumed work at its workshops. The agitation, for demands including merger of the corporation with the Maharashtra government, began on October 28. Shekhar Channe, vice-chairman and managing director of the MSRTC, told PTI that 36 buses were operated from 17 locations during the day. —With inputs from PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/driver-injured-as-protesters-throw-stone-at-pune-bound-shivshahi-bus/articleshow/87673041.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolhapur||Approval for intake of 100 students at GMC in Satara||Kolhapur: National medical council, the apex body governing medical education in the country, has approved an intake of 100 students for the first year MBBS course at the proposed Government Medical College (GMC) in Satara. The state government has allocated 64 acres of land located on the outskirts of Satara for setting up the medical college and a 500-bed hospital. For the current year, the MBBS course will be conducted on the premises of Satara civil hospital. Balasaheb Patil, Satara guardian minister said, “With the approval of intake of 100 students for the first year, we will be able to start the classes from June after the admission process ends. The design of the medical college and hospital is ready and the work will start soon. Within a year, the MBBS course will be conducted at the new building.” The demand of the government medical college at Satara was pending for the past 18 years. Patil said that the finance minister Ajit Pawar approved the first GMC in Satara in his budget speech last year. The minister said, “The issue was pending due to lack of space. After an intervention by the finance minister, the 64-acre land owned by Krishna Valley Development Corporation has been handed over to the government for the college.” In the region, only Satara district lacked a government medical college. Now, every district- Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur will have its own government medical college. Patil further said, “With the college, comes the hospital, which will provide quality healthcare services to people from the district. The hospital will have the capacity to accommodate patients for the next 100 years.” The government has assured Rs 420 crore for the construction of the college and the hospital. Patil said more funds will be made available if required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/approval-for-intake-of-100-students-at-gmc-in-satara/articleshow/87673059.cms||---

---||Delhi||Ending rice-wheat monopoly can ease Delhi woes||LUDHIANA/PATIALA: Most of the fields along the road to Jalaldiwal village, 42km from Ludhiana, are ashen black, some still smoking. Amid such sombre scenes of farm fires, one runs into a hillock of sunny bales of straw. Tractors loaded with this paddy stubble line up before busy men who unload, pull, push and sort the bales. Dr Harminder Singh Sidhu, a 54-year-old farmer who also runs an agri help centre, inspects the quality of straw and shouts out instructions to his workers. “We are collecting hay bales from over a thousand acres in 33 villages. It will be processed into fodder,” smiles Sidhu. “We have been doing this for five years and encouraging farmers in Punjab not to burn the harvest remains. It has been slow, but there is progress.” Sidhu is among the few farmers who are trying to veer away from the annual practice of burning the remnants of the rice plants for the pollution this causes. Apart from processing it into fodder, he is also trying to get plywood factories to use stubble as raw material. However, eradicating a decades-old practice will take time and given that Punjab is one of the biggest rice producing states of India, merely managing the stubble will not be enough to address the issue of air pollution caused by farm fires. Alongside mechanical and chemical innovations, like the IARI decomposer, experts are also working on ways to reduce the creation of stubble. A solution earlier attempted now appears both promising and challenging: breaking the rice-wheat monopoly through crop diversification. Agriculture scientists in Punjab are trying to push maize as a substation for rice in the belief that lesser rice means lesser stubble. The package comes with major economic and climatic benefits, the prime reasons why the diversification is being talked about. International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), the state agriculture department and others are experimenting with this at 116 farms in Pathankot, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar and Rupnagar. “Diversification is one of the two futuristic ways to reduce the emissions, the other being carbon credits,” said Dr M L Jat, principal scientist, CIMMYT. “For this, the rice-to-wheat-to-rice cycle has to be broken.” Scientists have discovered that wheat yields an extra two quintals per acre if sown after maize. As a bonus, the farmers can grow moong bean in the interregnum of 60-65 days between wheat harvesting and maize sowing. The challenge however is to persuade and convince the sceptic farmers. “A major problem for the farmers is an assured market for maize like rice has,” revealed Jat. “Last year, the support price for maize was Rs 2,000 per quintal but what farmers actually got was around Rs 1,200. We need to guarantee a price for farmers to take to crop diversification.” Describing any further investment in Punjab’s rice sector as ‘digging your own grave’, Jat pointed out the twin disadvantages of rice cultivation. While stubble burning makes air unbreathable in the National Capital Region, the water table in Punjab is being fast depleted. Rice is so water intensive that producing a kilo of it consumes as much as 75 times the water that a kilo of maize requires. And yet, Punjab has around three million hectares under rice cultivation and just 109,000 hectares under maize. However, improving Delhi’s air quality is not the ultimate objective of crop diversification. Agri officials insist it is an economic need for the monetary burden it imposes on the state and central governments. B S Sidhu, Punjab’s director of agriculture, said, “For the cultivation of one hectare of paddy, the central government spends Rs 72,000 and the state government Rs 8,000 to maintain the power and irrigation infrastructure. An equivalent amount is invested by the farmers.” He said rice cultivation had to be trimmed to two million hectares for sustenance and 1.6 million hectares ideally. “This is doable, but it tough due to several policy issue. We need the Centre to do more at the policy level,” Sidhu told TOI. However, despite the desirability for crop diversification, capping rice production can be tricky. “Experimenting with paddy is risky because of periodical droughts and the central government has regularly advised us not to fiddle with rice,” said Sidhu. “We actually thought of diversification in 1987, a drought year. There were dry years also in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2014, and at such times, the country needs food grains like rice.” Carbon credit is the other possible solution to farm fires. In a first attempt of the type, Grown Indigo, a company based on sustainable agriculture, the state agriculture department and CIMMYT are engaged in giving around a thousand farmers in four Punjab district carbon credits, a market-linked unit with a value of Rs 700-1,200. Explaining the concept, Dr Usha Barwale, executive director and chairperson, Grow Indigo, said, “There are certain agriculture practices that a farmer must undertake, such as converting from planting seedlings to direct rice seed in the paddies or using machines like Happy Seeders or shifting from rice to maize. After an audit, the credit is calculated in terms of tapping of CO2 equivalent and the farmer will be incentivised.” While direct seed planting instead of seedlings reduce methane emissions, the Happy Seeder mixes carbon in the soil and the rice-to-maize shift opens up window for a third, nitrogen-fixing crops like legumes. Such quantifications are equated in carbon credits and charged in monetary terms from major carbon-producing industries like oil to be passed on to the farmers. Mechanical management of stubble has proved difficult to implement. “We have given cooperatives and farmers’ societies 15,000 Happy Seeders, 18,000 Super Seeders and 504 balers since 2018,” claimed M Kalia, joint director and nodal officer for stubble management, Punjab government. Yet, this is not enough for 12 lakh farmers and 4.2 million hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ending-rice-wheat-monopoly-can-ease-delhi-woes/articleshow/87674744.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Lucknow||UP now robust state under Yogi: Rajnath||Lucknow: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the Centre was working on a centrally sponsored scheme under which investments in the two defence corridors, one in Tamil Nadu and the other in UP, would be incentivised. Speaking after an interaction with chief minister Yogi Adityanath and representatives of the defence manufacturing industry in Lucknow, Singh said that while the government was mindful of the potential of the private sector, it also understood its requirements and was taking all steps to ensure that industries could be anchored in the country. “We are confident that we will be able to develop a strong defence manufacturing ecosystem in UP. For this, I have to credit CM Yogi Adityanath for the work he has done. If this was the UP of earlier years, I would not have seen this glow on your faces,” he told the industry representatives, adding that the CM had provided an environment conducive to investments and a robust law and order situation. “If you tell the CM something, then there is no delay in implementation. He will do whatever is possible. To promote investments, his government has issued various sectoral policies and has already signed 58 MoUs. The defence corridor will bring about an industrial revolution in the state,” Singh said. The Lucknow MP added that for the first time, the Centre had given private industry a share in domestic defence manufacturing. Since 2014, the Centre has issued 350 licences while the previous government had issued about 200 licenses between 2004 and 2014. To further strengthen the role of the private sector in the defence industry, the government was bringing in policy provisions in the design and development sector. Schemes were also being made to encourage industries to act as anchors. “Foreign direct investment through the direct route is 74% while if it is through the government, it is 100%. The Centre has also made a provision of Rs 1,000 crore to make purchases under the innovation for defence excellence scheme, floated to promote invention in the defence sector and in coming months, this provision will be increased. An additional Rs 500 crore has been allocated for promoting start-ups,” the minister said. Inviting investments in the UP defence corridor, Yogi spoke about the incentives being provided by his government, emphasising on the law and order situation in the state and Nivesh Mitra, the single window portal through which clearances are being provided. “UP promises the best security and if the private sector is interested in taking up this offer, UP can become an export hub in the defence sector and help in realising PM Narendra Modi’s dream of Atma Nirbhar Bharat. I will request the defence minister that if the Centre can implement the defence production policy, it will help boost investments in the corridor,” the CM said. Yogi said the Defence Expo organised by UP was hailed even by the experts. He said UP has become a sought-after investment destination under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi and the efforts of the state government are bringing dividends. The CM highlighted the robust infrastructure developed in the past 4 years such as expressways, international airports and connectivity corridors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-now-robust-state-under-yogi-rajnath/articleshow/87675327.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Pune||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope bats for persuasion, not coercion to boost vax rate||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has told collectors across the state to opt for measures aimed at persuasion and not coercion to boost vaccination. He said he would soon preside over a review meeting with all the collectors to understand the plans they had prepared to ensure every beneficiary was administered at least one dose by November 30. “We want community participation to speed up the drive,” Tope said. The statement assumes significance considering that some collectors, including the Aurangabad collector, have made at least one vaccine jab mandatory for residents to purchase fuel and ration. Tope told TOI that weekly review meetings would be held with the collectors, and they would be directed to include NGOs, housing society federations and local leaders to get their help in reaching out to the beneficiaries. The state is working towards administering at least one dose to the 9.14 crore eligible population by November 30. Of them, around 2 crore beneficiaries have not received a single dose. Nearly 5.93 crore beneficiaries are yet to receive their second dose. During his interaction with Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday, Tope again put forth his demand to reduce the 84-day gap between administering the two Covishield doses to speed up the vaccination drive. “We have again demanded the Centre to reduce the gap between the Covishield doses to which they have only replied ‘Noted’,” Tope said. The minister also apprised the Centre about the programmes in the state to boost the inoculation drive. “We have assured the Centre that the state’s vaccination programmes will pick up and will be further scaled up,” he told the TOI. “The Mission Yuva Swastha has received a good response,” the minister said, adding that the state would strive to ensure that all the eligible beneficiaries receive at least one dose of the vaccine by November 30. He said public awareness was being created through various communication models to allay the citizens’ doubts on vaccination. A senior government official told TOI that they would have to review how the collectors would reach the target directing the machinery to take up special drives for the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-bats-for-persuasion-not-coercion-to-boost-vax-rate/articleshow/87674748.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Stubble burning: Why Delhi may have to wait for respite a little longer this November||NEW DELHI: An analysis of the past five years’ data from Nasa’s satellite imagery of stubble burning reveals that the daily farm fires come down drastically by mid-November. However, as farm fires have picked up late this year, experts said unlike past years, high incidents of stubble burning might continue for the next few days. The data shows 4,454 farm fires were recorded in Punjab on November 11 this year, but on the same day, it was only 2,434 in 2020, 672 in 2019, 1,365 in 2018 and 104 in 2017. It reveals that the paddy residue burning cases dropped further by mid-November as the fire counts on November 15 stood at just 69 in 2020, 77 in 2019, 1,482 in 2018, five in 2017 and 743 in 2016. Pawan Gupta, senior scientist, earth sciences at Universities Space Research Association in Nasa, said, “By November 15, most of the stubble was burnt in the previous years. However, as the stubble burning started late this year due to frequent rain in October, farm fires witnessed peak in the last one week. If the burning continues at the same rate for the next few days, the cumulative data of stubble burning can exceed last year’s.” L S Kurinji, programme associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “On Thursday alone, Punjab and Haryana witnessed over 4,662 farm fires. The daily counts have been in the range of 3,000-6,000 for the past eight days.” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “If high-intensity stubble burning continues for few more days and its contribution to Delhi’s air quality remains high, it can prolong the current smog episode.” Kurinji added, “Delhi has been experiencing severe air quality levels since 9pm, November 10. Additional emission load from stubble burning in the nearby states and unfavourable meteorologies — such as slow surface winds and northwest winds — are driving the pollution levels in Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhi-may-have-to-wait-for-respite-a-little-longer-this-nov/articleshow/87674773.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Telangana, Andhra Pradesh ministers spar over who’s bankrupt||HYDERABAD: After the fight over the Krishna river water, two ministers from AP and Telangana on Friday engaged in unsavoury remarks over the “financial crisis” in Telugu states, and accused each other’s state government of being “bankrupt” and “begging for funds”. The ministers, Vemula Prashanth Reddy of Telangana and Perni Nani of Andhra Pradesh, unwittingly entered into a war of words, each extolling his own government and criticising the other over financial bankruptcy. It all began with roads and buildings minister Prashanth Reddy during a dharna on the paddy purchase issue in Nizamabad alleging that Andhra people are now seeking alms. “AP people said if Telangana were to become a reality, then Telangana people would have to seek alms. But thanks to the efforts of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, we (Telangana people) have utilized our revenue for our region and the revenue is not going to Andhra”. He then added that “Andhra people are now seeking alms.” Prashanth Reddy further said that AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is also “seeking alms from the Centre”. Now AP government cannot be run without borrowings. “Even for daily and routine expenditure, they are seeking help from the Centre. The AP government is fixing meters to agriculture borewells due to pressures from the BJP government at the Centre," Prashant Reddy alleged. Strongly condemning the remarks of Prashanth Reddy, AP transport minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) wondered how Telangana government had made such huge debts since its formation if it were so rich. “TRS leaders have been roaming around New Delhi seeking loans and grants with an assurance to join the NDA government at the Centre. Jagan Mohan Reddy would never speak with a double-tongue unlike TRS leaders,” Nani alleged. Nani further alleged that the TRS leadership is trying for an alliance with the BJP in New Delhi but posing as fighters for the cause of the poor back home in Hyderabad. “Our party supremo’s stand is always clear and straight,” said Nani, adding that AP has been making debts chiefly due to losing “Kamadhenu” like Hyderabad and the “blunders” of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. He said that bankers would tell Prashanth Reddy as to how Telangana’s debts grew in the past seven years after the TRS took over. On the other hand, Prashanth Reddy recalled that during the recent TRS plenary, KCR had said that there were thousands of requests from AP to launch the TRS in AP. “They even said they want schemes like Dalit Bandhu in AP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-ministers-sparover-whos-bankrupt/articleshow/87674780.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Graft of Rs 3 lakh crore in BMC in 25 years, says BJP||MUMBAI: The Mumbai BJP’s executive committee on Friday alleged that corruption in BMC was the biggest scam in independent India. The committee, in a resolution passed on Friday, said there was corruption of over Rs 3 lakh crore in BMC over the last 25 years. “There were scams like the 2G, 3G, coal scam, and CommonWealth Games (CWG) scam and many others in this country. But since Independence, the scam in BMC is the biggest in the country. It is to the tune of over Rs 3 lakh crore in the last 25 years,” the resolution moved by BJP MLA Ameet Satam read. Mumbai BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha, MLAs Mihir Kotecha, Atul Bhatkhalkar and MPs Manoj Kotak and Gopal Shetty were present among others including BMC corporators. The BJP also said that in the last two years of the MVA government, Mhada and SRA had become hubs of corruption. BJP alleged that MVA has become Maha Vasooli Aghadi. With this resolution, BJP leaders said that corruption in BMC would be the party’s main plank in the upcoming elections. “Before this, Maharashtra had not seen such an incompetent government. So the Mumbai BJP is resolving that in the upcoming BMC elections, it will not be a fight to come to power or to appoint the mayor from our party but it will be a struggle to fight for the rights and justice of the people of Mumbai and the city. BJP will stand with the people in the upcoming poll and fight for development and will ensure that Mumbai gets its glory and fame back. We resolve to fight and win this battle,” the resolution stated. BJP currently has 82 corporators in the 227-member BMC. In 2017, in a dramatic rise in its performance, BJP’s corporators grew from 32 to 82 and the party emerged as the second largest — just two corporators lesser than Sena. The Sena and BJP contested the polls alone. Before 2017, BJP was part of the ruling alliance in BMC with Shiv Sena for almost two decades. However, BJP had refused the opposition leader’s post in 2017 since it was in an alliance with Shiv Sena in the state then. Congress then laid claim to the opposition leader’s post in BMC. With the Sena-BJP alliance breaking in the state and Shiv Sena forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government with Congress and NCP in the state, BJP began playing opposition in the BMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-graft-of-rs-3-lakh-crore-in-bmc-in-25-yrs-says-bjp/articleshow/87674758.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Plea for Covid-19 vaccine at home for elderly: Delhi HC seeks reply||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday granted time to the Centre and AAP government to respond to a plea seeking formulation of a policy on urgent door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination for bedridden or senior citizens in the capital.  Delhi government submitted before a bench of chief justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh that the Centre has already introduced a policy on door-to-door vaccination, and it has to be followed by all states. However, the counsel for the petitioner highlighted before the bench that the Centre and Delhi government have not filed their affidavits on the petition till date and no official statement has been made by the Delhi government on the issue, even while it is claiming that the Centre has granted it the mandate. "You file your affidavits. Keep in mind the argument of the counsel (for petitioner). You mention one paragraph about Delhi,” the bench told the counsel for the government, seeking a reply.

The district health officials claimed that the awareness about inoculation was growing among the unvaccinated people with the “Har Ghar Dastak” initiative. Rajesh Patil, commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), told TOI, “We have vaccinated a sizeable number of beneficiaries from the twin towns, but there could be still over a lakh of people who have not come forward for vaccination.” According to Patil, there are around 17 lakh eligible beneficiaries in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits. Of them, around 15 lakh have received their first shot, while around eight lakh have received both the doses. An official from the public health services said they had two lakh vaccine doses comprising Covishield and Covaxin — good enough for conducting a smooth vaccination drive for the next few days. “We have clear instructions from the state government to exhaust the available vaccine stock and get the new one. The number of second dose beneficiaries will increase in the coming days. Naturally, the number of daily vaccination numbers will go up with each passing day,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/highest-nov-shots-in-district-on-friday/articleshow/87674772.cms||---

The woman, 30-year-old Neema Devi, was produced before the court later in the day and was sent to 14 days of judicial remand. On October 17, police had received information that Kundan Singh Dhami (35) had died after falling from his house roof at village Chhinpatta. However, a postmortem report raised suspicion over his death and pointed towards possible foul play. Soon after, the victim's brother, Dhan Singh Dhami, approached the police with a complaint against her sister-in-law. He alleged that the couple shared strained relations and would often engage in heated arguments. Based on the complaint, a case was lodged against Neema Devi under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Himanshu Pant, station house officer, Didihat, told TOI, “During interrogation, the woman confessed her crime. After an argument with her husband on October 17, the accused slit his throat. Later, she carried the body to the terrace in a jute bag and dumped it from there.” The officer added that the jute bag, the knife used by the accused and blood-stained clothes have also been recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/30-year-old-woman-sent-to-14-day-judicial-remand-for-husbands-murder/articleshow/87673121.cms||Prem Punetha

Calling the Haat a platform where traditional arts and crafts were being given recognition, Mandaviya said: “It is necessary to promote, encourage and respect the art and crafts of indigenous artisans and craftsmen.” Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the slogan of ‘vocal for local’ to fulfill the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat and that vision was being realised through the Hunar Haats being organised across the country. “To increase the income of artisans and craftsmen of the country, there is a need to provide national and international markets for their products. Hunar Haats have proved to be an important platform in this direction, ” he said. A government spokesperson said that more than 600 artisans from over 30 states and union territories are participating in the Hunar Haat, which will continue till November 21. Along with stalls selling handicraft and local products, cultural and musical performances of artists like Annu Kapoor, Pankaj Udhas, Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik will also be held. Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that more than 6.75 lakh artisans, craftsmen and people associated with them have been provided employment and employment opportunities through Hunar Haats in the past six years. Last time, the fair was held at Avadh Shilpgram, where a temporary Covid hospital has come up now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hunar-haat-fulfils-vocal-for-local-vision-for-artisans/articleshow/87675351.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||BJP to protest three-fold hike in Gunthewari charges||Nagpur: All BJP MLAs and corporators from the city will stage a protest against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for steeply hiking Gunthewari charges. The protests would commence with a big morcha at Yeshwant Stadium on November 15, which will be headed by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. On November 18, the BJP leaders would meet NIT chairman Manoj Suryawanshi and submit a representation to him requesting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government to provide some solace to about five lakh residents from the city. If the government fails to act, the saffron party will stage a big agitation in front of NIT office on November 22. “The Urban Development Department (UDD) had suddenly hiked Gunthewari charges from Rs56/sqft to Rs168, which is a three-fold jump. It floated a government resolution (GR) on October 18 without consulting with the public representatives or the department officials concerned. About five lakh residents would be adversely affected by this development, which is being implemented amid the Covid-19 pandemic,” MLA Krishna Khopde told the media. Flanked by other leaders, including MLA Vikas Kumbhare, ruling party leader in NMC Avinash Thakre, former MLA Milind Mane, BJP general secretary Sanjay Bangale, NMC legal committee chairman Dharampal Meshram, and BJP spokesperson Chandan Goswami, the MLA said the government’s decision shocked all these five lakh common households as many of them had either lost jobs due to the pandemic or suffered losses in their businesses. “When the Gunthewari Act was implemented in 2001, the then Congress-NCP government had fixed Rs48/sqft charges for the residents. However, the decision was strongly opposed by then senior corporator Prabhakar Datke, Union minister Nitin Gadkari and Fadnavis, both outside and inside the assembly. Due to them, the then government was forced to reduce the charges to Rs16/ sq ft,” he said. Khopde said the Congress-NCP government again hiked the charges to Rs56/ sq ft over the years. “Under Fadnavis, the layouts coming under Gunthewari were developed by the government by providing basic facilities like cement roads, drainage, and water pipelines. Now for what reason have they hiked these charges? We will intensify the protest but in a democratic way and knock on the high court’s doors as a last resort,” he said. Expressing surprise over the silence of MVA ministers and leaders in the city, the MLA said “government’s parrots” like Congress state president Nana Patole and guardian minister (Nitin Raut) should have come forward to raise their voices against such big injustice to the common citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-to-protest-three-fold-hike-in-gunthewari-charges/articleshow/87674778.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Liquor to be cheaper by 20% from next week in West Bengal||KOLKATA: Come November 16 and the tipplers in the state may have something to cheer about. The prices of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) are likely to drop by 20% across the board while the prices of beer may change marginally. The excise department would announce a new duty structure for IMFL and beer on Tuesday, when top excise officials will meet liquor retailers to discuss a new distribution structure. However, some retailers said that it may take two more days to get stocks at new prices. The excise department had a series of meetings with leading liquor and beer companies over the last few months following representations from various bodies related to liquor trade. The consumption of IMFL in the state was in decline since the upward price revision in April 2020. The prices of IMFL have increased by almost 40%-50% in two phases since the pandemic set in. In the last quarter of 2020-21 and first two quarters of 2021-22, liquor consumption dipped by 30%-35% compared to the same period of 2019-20. The trend continued in the third quarter of this fiscal in October, when sale was down by 20%, despite it being a festive month. The excise department has verbally conveyed the information of change in duty structure on ex-distillery price for IMFL and ex-brewery price (EBP) for beer from next week. “A detailed circular may be issued on Monday night or on Tuesday,” an executive of an IMFL company said. While there has been a massive dip in IMFL demand, the demand for beer witnessed a jump. The prices of beer was slashed in October 2020 by 20%-30%. An executive of a top beer company pointed out that there had been a robust growth in demand since the fall in prices. “We are getting very encouraging response,” the executive added. West Bengal is a market of 14.1 million (1.4 crore) cases of hard IMFL that includes whisky, rum, vodka and 8 million (80 lakh cases) of beer annually. The total consumption of IMFL in 2020-21 was a little over 10 million cases. In the first four months of 2021, beer consumption has crossed 50 lakh cases, which is almost 60% of annual consumption of beer in the state. Beer consumption is expected to cross 1 crore cases mark in Bengal this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/liquor-to-be-cheaper-by-20-from-next-wk/articleshow/87673985.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar to invite open bid for sand ghats after district survey report||PATNA: Mining department minister Janak Ram on Friday said the state government would invite open tender for the authorised sand ghats after completion of the district survey report (DSR) in the wake of the Supreme Court’s directive recently. Talking to this newspaper, the minister said the DSR has to be prepared within six months. “Open tender will be invited after the process is complete. The companies at the national level may take part in the bidding process for legal sand mining in Bihar,” he said. He said the open bidding would generate more revenue to the state. “The department is going to hold a meeting soon to discuss the modalities for preparing the district survey report,” the minister said, adding that sand mining was stalled in October following the intervention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The mining department had started the process of auction of authorised sand ghats in eight districts from October 1, but it was stopped on the order of the NGT, causing huge loss to the state exchequer. The state government then moved the Supreme Court against the NGT’s order. The NGT had directed the state government to undertake further exercise for preparation of a fresh DSR for Banka. This led to stalling the process of auction of the sand ghats in other districts as well. The NGT, in its order issued on October 14, 2020, had said the DSR must be prepared through consultants accredited by the National Accreditation Board of Education and Training/Quality Control Council of India. The Supreme Court, however, observed that a total ban on legal mining, apart from giving rise to illegal mining activities, also caused huge losses to the public exchequer. Besides, illegal mining resulted in clashes between sand mafias, criminalisation and, at times, loss of human lives. A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao observed, “A balanced approach of sustainable development ensuring environmental safeguards needs to be resorted to while dealing with the issue of sand mining.” The court, in the meantime, allowed the state government to carry on mining activities through the Bihar State Mining Corporation (BSMC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-to-invite-open-bid-for-sand-ghats-after-district-survey-report/articleshow/87673715.cms||Ramashankar

They also complained that the demand for the flight has gone up due after the easing of the Covid situation and the ongoing MSRTC strike. However, travelers also have to shell out more money for the one-stopover flights to Mumbai. TOI tried calling the assigned person from the flight operator but the call was not responded till the time of going to the press. Sanjay Shete, head of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce, said, “The count of passengers travelling to Mumbai is high from Kolhapur. People travel quiet frequently to Mumbai for work, business and industrial purposes. The frequent cancellation of the flight is inconvenient. The service should be resumed properly at the earliest.” Travelers said that the flight service remained shut in September and even now, the flight service is shut till next week. Sameer Sheth, who is a frequent flyer to Mumbai, said, “This has become a routine now. The flight to Mumbai gets cancelled at the last moment; creating much inconvenience and panic situation. The flight service should be implemented properly.” Recently, when the Pune airport was shut, the travellers from western Maharashta used Kolhapur airport for their travel. A meeting was also held recently with district guardian minister Satej Patil regarding the acquisition of 64-acre land for the Kolhapur airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/travellers-rue-irregular-schedule-of-kolhapur-mumbai-flights/articleshow/87673128.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: App cab driver molests woman after dangerous driving protest||KOLKATA: The Behala police have arrested an app cab driver for allegedly trying to assault and molesting a 23-year-old media professional and her male friend after they objected to the driver driving dangerously — with one hand on the steering wheel and another responding to a phone call — and blocking the right of passage. The cops said the incident took place around 8.15pm on Thursday in front of the Sree Sangha club on James Long Sarani in Behala. The accused — identified as Bubai Samanta — was arrested from his Behala residence on Friday morning and charged under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertaining to wrongful restraint, voluntarily causing hurt, molestation, criminal intimidation and insulting the modesty of a woman. “It started after an altercation between a woman scooterette rider — a reporter with a Bengali news channel — and the driver of an app cab (WB 04H 8378) after the cab driver tried to pass the two-wheeler coming from the opposite direction in a dangerous manner on James Long Sarani. The accused reportedly misbehaved with the victim and manhandled her friend who was riding pillion. We registered a case and nabbed the accused based on the complaint. We will get the woman to record her statement before a magistrate at the earliest,” said DC (Behala) Swati Bhangalia who has instructed the local police to ensure that the charge sheet is filed at the earliest. According to the woman, the app cab was coming from the opposite direction with the driver on the phone, and the car was blocking the narrow alley. “My friend stopped him and suggested he take the phone off his ear and drive. This infuriated the driver and he came out of the car and kicked the two-wheeler. He held my friend by his throat and kept punching him in the nose and face. When I protested, the driver pushed me away. He then threatened me, saying he will see me when my friend is not around,” the woman told cops. Fortunately for the police, the braveheart noted down the number of the cab before the driver fled. “We traced the cab through the app cab platform and the RTO details. The woman had also dialled 100 and our men attended to the initial call, picking up some clues,” said an officer. The misbehaviour by the app-cab driver is not the first in the city this festive season. Last month, a man lodged a complaint on Kolkata Police’s Bondhu app, alleging an app-cab driver had beaten him up and tried to molest his wife when they were getting out of the vehicle after reaching their destination in south Kolkata. A day earlier, a couple who work as software developers alleged an app-cab driver had beaten up the man and tried to snatch his wife’s phone. The man suffered injuries in his head. App cabs cancelling bookings at the drop of a hat has also spiralled during this festive season — the problem assumed alarming proportions after the massive hike in petrol and diesel prices. Last week, the Kolkata traffic police requested all such harassed passengers to take a screenshot of their booking and report the refusal to them along with the date, time, location and other basic details. The top brass have asked the public grievance cell of the traffic unit to look into each allegation and take “appropriate measures”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/app-cab-driver-molests-woman-after-dangerous-driving-protest/articleshow/87673982.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On the other hand, Dawood, the underworld, the drug mafia are all being discussed. It is the misfortune of the state but the question to ask is who brings this to Maharashtra. It is up to the ruling party and administration to curb this,” she said. “The politics of the state has hit a new low. The ruling parties are accusing us. In all this chaos, the development of the state has lagged behind and unwanted issues are coming up. It would be better for rival parties to focus on development than to accuse us,” the BJP politician from Marathwada said. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane called minister Nawab Malik a traitor. “One who supports terrorists is a traitor.

As a key religious day, Kartiki Ekadashi, is nearing and the bus service remains affected; the Central railway authority has decided to send extra trains for Pandharpur. The reservation office at the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Terminus is witnessing heavy crowd. Shivnath Biyani, member of advisory committee with Pune Railway division, said, “On the occasion of Kartiki Ekadashi, the Central Railway has decided to run special extra trains between Pandharpur - Miraj, Latur - Miraj and Latur- Pandharpur. The trains will have sleeper and second class compartments.” He added that the railway authorities were thinking about starting the passenger trains between Kolhapur and Pune again and a decision regarding the same is expected soon. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers’ association, said, “The state government cannot turn a blind eye to our demands. One lakh workers across the state are participating in the strike and if our demand to merge the MSRTC into the state government is not approved, then the intensity of the strike will further escalate.” He added that the MSRTC staff continued to work even during Covid lockdowns in the minimum salaries of around 8,000 to 10,000. “Now, our major demand of merger into state government should be fulfilled and only thereafter the strike will be called off,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/citizens-turn-to-railways-amid-stir-by-st-employees/articleshow/87673139.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||Pvt hosps expect rise in Covaxin demand||Kolkata: With the Centre set to announce a policy for third booster dose, city private hospitals — many of which are saddled with stocks of Covaxin that have had few takers so far — now plan to procure more Covaxin, expecting a rise in demand as the number of recipients swell. At least one hospital is set to place fresh orders this week after having run out of Covaxin more than a month ago. Another, which is now struggling to get rid of its existing stock, foresee a sharp rise in demand by January and believe it will soon need to order afresh. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), which exhausted its Covaxin stock more than a month ago, is set to procure a new consignment. “We will place orders for fresh stock very soon, may be by this week,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that a rise in Covaxin demand was now imminent. “We definitely foresee a rise in demand due to the expected third dose. Also, with vaccination for children likely to come up soon, there may be a further increase in demand,” added Venkatesh. Earlier this week, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) extended the shelf life of Covaxin from six months to a year, which came as a big relief for most private vaccination centres in Kolkata that were left with stocks set to expire soon. It didn’t, however, lead to spurt in demand. Nor did the WHO nod to the vaccine last week. AMRI Hospitals, which holds a stock of 4,500 Covaxin doses, sees a spurt immediately after the third dose is declared. “We are getting ready to deal with an overall increase in demand for vaccines since it will be a repeat of the first dose. Covaxin, too, will see a spurt and our existing stocks will be quickly used up. We are now assessing the situation and will place an order for Covaxin,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Woodlands Hospital administered 16,000 doses of Covaxin in May when the vaccine was introduced. “Depending on the government approval, this group would be eligible for their booster dose in December. Those who took Covishield could also go for cross-vaccination and take Covaxin as booster. So, demand is expected to rise in the next two months. We have sufficient stock of Covaxin and would be assessing the demand before placing orders for more stock,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. Peerless Hospital is following a wait-and-watch policy for Covaxin. “It is being given to those who are listing their names. We are getting very few takers yet but the third dose will scale up the demand. Hopefully, we will be able to use up our stock once the dose begins,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-expect-rise-in-covaxin-demand/articleshow/87673989.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Delhi||Delhi govt asks departments for plans to raise non-tax revenue||NEW DELHI: With the Covid pandemic stretching Delhi government’s finances, all departments have been asked to generate more non-tax revenue. Every department would have to submit an action plan within two weeks on the same. The pandemic has dealt a body blow to the state government’s financial health. The second wave of Covid this year and the lockdown to curb its exponential growth have resulted in Delhi government’s collection declining, while its expenditure has gone up massively due to the implementation of relief and other measures. In a circular issued on Thursday, the finance department has informed all departments that the “Covid crisis has stretched state finances by impacting both tax and non-tax collections. In this context, a need has arisen to augment non-tax revenue, which is currently at 2.7% and 2.9% of state’s total revenue collection in 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively”. The finance department has stated that the major components of non-tax revenue are interest charged on loans or advances, and dividends and profits from investment, apart from user charges or fees against services provided by the government. Keeping this in mind, it has said that non-tax revenue can be augmented by reviewing the outstanding loans that are recoverable from PSUs, local bodies and autonomous bodies under their administrative control and ensuring that interest on loan is received by the government. The department has said that Delhi government has circulated a dividend policy, which states that a minimum annual dividend of 30% of profit after tax or 5% of the net worth, whichever is higher, is to be paid by a PSU. The finance department has directed the administrative department to take stock of the financial results of the PSUs and enforce the discipline laid down in the dividend policy. The department has also said that the user charges and fees for various services being provided shall be reviewed by examining the trend of non-tax collection and identifying the factors responsible for the lack of its growth. All the departments have been requested that an action plan for augmentation of non-tax revenue in respect to their department be sent to the finance department by November 25 as per a format provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-asks-depts-for-plans-to-raise-non-tax-revenue/articleshow/87675716.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Those who love Jinnah should go to Pakistan, says Naresh Agarwal||LUCKNOW: BJP leader Naresh Agarwal on Friday waded into the controversy over SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s “Jinnah remark”, saying people who loved Jinnah should leave India and “go to Pakistan”. Speaking to reporters ahead of a BJP backed state level ‘Vaishya Sammelan’, scheduled to be organised in Lucknow on November 14, he said the country belonged to the followers of “Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi) and Patel (Vallabh Bhai Patel)”. He was reacting to Akhilesh’s recent remark comparing Pakistan founder Jinnah with Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. Agarwal has been keeping a low profile since 2018 when he joined the BJP after being denied a ticket to Rajya Sabha by the SP. Cine star turned politician Jaya Bachchan was chosen over Agarwal by the SP leadership, a move that left the former RS MP and seven time MLA from Hardoi riled. Agarwal’s jibe at Akhilesh marked his aggressive emergence from a relatively dormant political stage to woo the ‘Vaishya’ (trader) community in favour of the BJP ahead of the UP assembly elections. His son, Nitin Agarwal, who represents Hardoi constituency, was recently propped by the BJP as a candidate for the post of deputy speaker in the UP assembly, a move which was seen as the saffron party’s attempt to bewilder the opposition ranks, mainly the SP, which had fielded its senior lawmaker Narendra Singh Verma, a Kurmi. The BJP has traditionally been banking on the upper caste votes, including Vaishya (trader community). Agarwal said that the BJP has been organising conventions for various communities. “The Vaishya sammelan is also part of the BJP campaign,” he said. He claimed no political party will be able to stand against the BJP which will have full support of the Vaishya community and win more than 300 seats. Earlier on November 7, Agarwal had made a scathing attack on the opposition parties in Hardoi, saying that those who did not believe in Lord Rama and considered Jinnah as their leader have been taught to go to temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-who-love-jinnah-should-go-to-pak-agarwal/articleshow/87675362.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rain-led damage affects functioning of e-court vans||By Sonali MishraNAINITAL: The acting chief justice of Uttarakhand high court (HC), Sanjay Mishra, on Friday said that the initiative of e-court vans, aimed at serving justice to the furthest corners of the hill state, has not yielded desired results due to the rain-triggered flash floods in October. The e-vans could not reach areas that became inaccessible due to rain-related incidents across Uttarakhand on October 18 and 19, he pointed out. In view of this, the acting chief justice said that HC will seek two more weeks from the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), a statutory body that provides free legal services to the weaker sections of the society, for the awareness campaign concerning e-court vans. The court will soon send out a letter to NALSA chairman in this regard. Justice Mishra added that the e-court van initiative is not a magic wand solution to provide legal aid to those in remote areas and the drive will become a success only with the cooperation of all stakeholders. On Independence Day this year, e-court vans — equipped with WiFi and computers for videoconferencing — were flagged off in Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Champawat, Tehri and Pithoragarh districts. Later, the facility was provided in other districts as well. The district judge and the court coordinator were tasked with maintaining and stationing these vans in their districts. Significantly, people could also seek deployment of the vans in their areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/e-court-vans-couldnt-yield-desired-results-due-to-recent-natural-disaster-awareness-campaign-to-be-extended-for-two-more-weeks-says-hc/articleshow/87673137.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Complaints of unmasked citizens, littering spike as clean-up marshals term out||MUMBAI: The BMC’s clean-up marshal scheme expired this year June, and with the BMC yet to appoint a full-time central agency, unmasked citizens and those spitting and littering in public are going unchecked. For the last four months, ad hoc monthly contracts have been issued at the ward level. As a result, several wards don’t have enough clean-up marshals and action against violators has slowed down. TimesViewThe BMC’s clean-up marshals scheme is very important to ensure citizens wear masks as lockdowns have been fully relaxed. The fact that the central clean-up marshals contract ended in June and now ad hoc extensions are being given at the ward level, shows that the BMC is not serious about this. The BMC should have awarded a new contract well before the old one expired. The BMC must appoint a new agency with a strong complaint redressal mechanism.The opposition has alleged that with no central contract, there is no accountability and the number of complaints against clean-up marshals for extorting money from citizens has gone up. Clean-up marshals are appointed across the city by the BMC’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) department. “The central agency SWM tender for clean-up marshals expired in June 2021. As a temporary measure, extension is being given at ward level right now. SWM has invited Expression of Interest and received responses from parties. A committee will meet for scrutiny and new agencies will be appointed thereafter,” said a senior civic official. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said the BMC had failed to get a new agency in place on time. “This shows that the scheme has failed and the BCM is not even serious about unmasked citizens. Having no central agency and only ward-level ad hoc contracts is the reason why there is no accountability. The ward doesn’t blacklist any clean-up marshals for extortion and there is no system of addressing complaints against them,” Shaikh said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said a list of agencies has been sent to the wards and the ward officers were appointing clean up marshals as per their local requirement. “Marshals are being deployed across the city,” Kakani said. Around 720 marshals are deployed across the city as part of the SWM contract. After a video of clean-up marshals misbehaving with citizens not wearing masks had gone viral in February, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar had taken clean-up marshals to task and told them not to misbehave. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “The BMC has turned clean-up marshals into extortion agents. In the new contracts, there should be more stringent conditions and the BMC should make companies liable for their marshals’ actions. Penalty clauses should be introduced with a Rs 10,000 fine a day if there is any complaint against marshals. All companies flouting norms should be blacklisted,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plaints-of-unmasked-citizens-littering-spike-as-clean-up-marshals-term-out/articleshow/87673995.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The department had appointed officer-rank employees recently and many senior officials, it is alleged, were not kept in the loop. Pandey has ordered the education secretary to conduct an inquiry in this regard. Responding to the allegations, some education department officials, requesting anonymity, told TOI that the appointments were made to speed up the implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, in Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, it has also been alleged that some of the government school teachers were given transfers of their choice despite the current academic year being a 'zero transfer' year for all education department employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/edu-min-orders-probe-on-appointments-done-secretly-by-dept/articleshow/87673155.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Patna||Bizmen set to meet Union min at Hajipur tomorrow||PATNA: Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai and state industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain are slated to meet with industrialists and entrepreneurs at Hajipur on Sunday to find ways to put the industrial production there on the national map, sources said. While the initiative in this regard had been taken by Rai when he held detailed discussions on the related issues with Husain in Delhi in June this year, the Sunday meeting will also focus on the revival of industries in the Samastipur industrial area, they said. Besides the industrialists and prospective entrepreneurs, the officials of the industries department and Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority (BIADA) will also participate in the meeting. For the last several decades, the Hajipur industrial area has been home to several production units, but it has also remained plagued by various kinds of problems, including the lack of adequate land availability for new units, waterlogging, insecurity and lack of good quality roads. However, as a follow-up to the discussions between Rai and Hussain in June, a team of BIADA officials, along with representatives from the National Highways Authority of India, visited Hajipur in mid-June to identify the problems. During the legwork, the BIADA and other officials concerned zeroed in on the problems, which needed to be handled on priority basis to create improved working atmosphere, so that the existing production units deliver while the new units are also opened. The solutions found included construction of drainage system, fresh acquisition of land, construction of quality roads, provision of high-mast and street lights. During the first phase following the Sunday meeting, schemes would begin to be implemented from the end of the current fiscal. It is felt that Hussain will also announce the quantum of money to undertake the work to provide basic infrastructural facilities. By one estimate, it might require an investment worth around Rs100 crore. On Sunday, Hussain will also inaugurate a couple of new units which have come up for production in the Hajipur industrial area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bizmen-set-to-meet-union-min-at-hajipur-tomorrow/articleshow/87673905.cms||Abhay Singh

Prompt police action ensured the situation was restored to normalcy soon. A community had called a one-day bandh. They pulled down shutters of their business establishments on Friday. Some agitators also took out a morcha in the city. When it reached Shivaji Chowk, they saw a shopkeeper who had not closed his shop. The agitators asked him to close the shop, but he refused. The mob then took objection to his non-cooperation and pulled down the shutters and threw stones at it. Some people also looted the shop, which triggered a group clash, leaving some persons injured.

---||Patna||One more ‘hooch’ death in Bihar's Samastipur||PATNA: In a fresh incident of suspected hooch death, spurious liquor allegedly claimed the life of a 19-year-old youth at Narghoghi Khairwan village under the Sarairanjan police station area of Samastipur district on Friday morning. Earlier, six persons had died after consuming poisonous liquor in different villages under the Patori police station area in the district this month. The deceased, Chandan Kumar, used to work in Mumbai and had reached home to celebrate Chhath with his family. Police denied anything related to spurious liquor consumption but followed all the SOPs laid down for cases of deaths related to hooch poisoning. At least 63 persons have reportedly died from hooch poisoning in Gopalganj, West Champaran, Samastipur and Muzaffarpur since Diwali eve. Overall 116 persons have died in the ‘dry’ state after consuming poisonous liquor this year. The series of hooch deaths followed by statewide crackdown against liquor smuggling were the main issue at the weekly review meeting held by senior police officers at the state police headquarters on Friday. Sarairanjan police station SHO Raja Kumar said the postmortem of Chandan’s body was conducted at the Sadar hospital. “The viscera samples have been preserved for further forensic analysis to know if poisonous hooch consumption was the reason behind his death,” he said. The SHO said police recorded his family’s statement in which they denied that Chandan had consumed any bad thing. “However, there were murmurings in the village over his death due to which a postmortem was conducted,” he said. He said the family members had rushed him to the Dalsinghsarai sub-divisional hospital on Thursday after he fell ill but brought him back home on Friday morning, after which he died. When asked, the SHO could not tell what kind of health complications Chandan developed all of a sudden due to which he was rushed to the hospital. However, sources said Chandan’s family members had initially told the villagers that he had gone somewhere with his friends for a party and fell ill on his return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-more-hooch-death-in-samastipur/articleshow/87673602.cms||Debashish Karmakar

However, if vaccines for kids under 17 do not come in by the time the fair starts on January 31, they will be allowed in said authorities of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild on Friday while announcing the 45th edition of the fair. If all goes well, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina might attend the fair since her country is the theme country of the fair this time. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee was about to invite her to the fair this year when it got cancelled because of Covid. The fair will celebrate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the golden jubilee year of the independence of Bangladesh. TimesViewThis is one event that millions in Kolkata and Bengal look forward to every year. Plans to bring it back is an index of the city’s yearning to return to normality. It is difficult to predict the pandemic’s status two months later but one can assume that Covid will not be gone. So the focus should be as much on maintaining Covid-safety protocols as on having a grand book fair. Organisers can look at increasing the size of stalls, maybe at the cost of the number of stalls, if the fairground area cannot be increased; limiting the number of visitors at any given time is another option.The fair will be held at Salt Lake’s Central Park. Many alterations are being worked out by the Guild so that the fair, which will continue till February 13, can be safely held in these Covid times. “We will have open stalls as far as possible and their size will be reduced to allow space for visitors to move around with social distancing in place,” said Tridib Chatterjee, general secretary of the Guild. E-passes will be distributed to facilitate entry, automatically reducing crowding at the gates, it was said. These e-passes will be given from different online portals. “It is likely there will be a special entry channel for pass holders and it will stagger the crowd,” Chatterjee said, adding that it will take several more meetings with architects and members before finalising the fair design. Masks will be mandatory and hand sanitiser will be placed at vantage points. For those who cannot physically attend the fair, the Guild will start a virtual fairground visit. A click of the mouse will allow them to “walk around” the fair and they might even be able to browse and order. “We will reveal this gradually. There’s a huge book fair fan population abroad who will be able to enjoy it on the virtual mode,” said Guild president Sudhangshu Dey. In separate events, tributes will be paid to Pranab Mukherjee, Soumitra Chattopadhyay, Shankha Ghosh, Buddhadeb Guha, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and other noted personalities who have departed in the recent past. The number of stalls is likely to remain 600 and the Guild has decided not to increase the fees this time. There is yet to be a decision on whether the number of food stalls will be reduced and whether only dry packets will be sold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-entry-to-kolkata-book-fair-without-double-vax-cert-but-kids-may-be-allowed/articleshow/87673993.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Bihar: 19,000 farmers in Bhojpur apply online for selling paddy||ARA: Around 19,000 farmers of Bhojpur have already applied online at the agriculture department portal for selling their paddy yield through PACS and vyapar mandals. The number of applicants has increased by about 3,000 compared to the last year with three more days (till November 15) still left for the farmers to apply online. “Around 16,000 farmers had applied online at the Bhojpur district agriculture department portal last year for selling their paddy harvest. Their number this year has already increased to 19,000. The paddy procurement in Bhojpur will start from November 15 and continue till February 15 next year,” Bhojpur district cooperative officer (DCO) Vijay Kumar Singh told this newspaper on Friday. “The custom milled rice (CMR) will be procured till July 31 next year. The last date for the online application for selling paddy has been extended from October 31 to November 15. All arrangements for the paddy procurement have been made by the department,” he added. Agriculture scientist and head of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Bhojpur, Pravin Kumar Dwivedi said: “The reason for more farmers applying online for selling their paddy harvest is that they will now get their land possession certificates (LPCs) as per the government norms. Earlier, the land documents used to be in the name of ancestors, but now farmers are getting individual ownership, so it has become easier for them to apply online for selling their produce. The increased level of awareness among the farmers is also contributing to it.” He said more than 5 lakh farmers have got themselves registered on the portal of Bhojpur district agriculture department. “So, the number of farmers applying online for selling their produce to the government agencies will increase further in future,” Dwivedi said. According to the data available till Thursday, 18,806 farmers applied online for selling their paddy harvest, out of which 13,782 are ‘gair raiyats’ while 5024 are raiyat farmers. Among them, the maximum farmers are from Piro block (3,123), followed by Barhara (176). While 18,054 farmers have applied for selling their paddy through the PACS , 752 have applied for vyaapar mandal. A total of 223 purchase committees have been selected for the paddy procurement in Bhojpur district. They include 211 PACS and 12 Vyaapar Mandals. While the minimum support price for general quality paddy is Rs1,940 per quintal, it is Rs1,960 per quintal for Grade 'A' paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/19000-farmers-in-bhojpur-apply-online-for-selling-paddy/articleshow/87673747.cms||---

According to the transport officials, the proposal is in drafting stage and fares for different stages of travel will be fixed once civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade gives his nod to the proposal. Last time the bus fares were increased in 2018. Covid pandemic has led to heavy losses to the transport undertaking. Also, more buses have been added to the operational fleet given the rise in passenger count. Currently, around 50 buses — 50% of the total fleet available with the KMT — are operational. The officials claimed that it will take at least a month to get the operations back to normal. A senior KMT official said, “The final proposal with fare hike rates will be tabled before the regional transport authority headed by district collector in the next couple of weeks for approval. Even if the passengers count increases back to normal, then also losses will continue due to higher fuel prices. Maximum number of passengers are school students, women and elderly people. Since the schools and colleges are opening and markets are resuming slowly, we expect the entire fleet of over 100 buses will be on roads by month-end.” In normal situation when all the buses are on road, then around 4,000 litre of diesel is required for operations. Around 80,000 passengers board the buses on a daily basis. The revenue from passenger tickets is the major source of revenue for the KMT and pre-pandemic, the transport undertaking was facing a loss of around Rs 2 lakh every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmt-plans-to-raise-bus-fares-by-25-to-tide-over-loss/articleshow/87673146.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi HC questions move to book those who housed Tablighis||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday questioned the city police’s move to book Indian citizens for housing foreigners who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event last year amid the Covid-19 lockdown. “Suddenly, when a lockdown is imposed, where does one go after that? What is the offence committed? Is there any bar on Madhya Pradesh residents on staying in Delhi in any mosque, temple or gurdwara? They can stay wherever they want. Was there a notice that everybody will throw out whosoever was staying (with them) ?” Justice Gupta said, pointing out that the government had not imposed a ban on people from staying at any particular place. HC was hearing a batch of petitions to quash the FIRs against the hosts. It said the Jamaat attendees sought refuge before the lockdown was imposed and there were no allegations of them violating the orders restricting movement. “I have brought out the point...you will tell me where is the violation when there is no question of changing places at that time? I can understand they went out, that they violated the (lockdown) notification. When lockdown was imposed, there was no bar on anyone residing (sic),” the court said and gave time to Delhi Police to file its response to the petitions. The police's lawyer sought time to file a status report, and said that at the relevant time, there was a bar on any type of religious events. The petitioners' lawyer said that since the Jamaat attendees began staying on the premises in question before the lockdown was imposed and none tested positive for Covid, no case was made out against her clients. While some of the petitions for cancelling the FIRs are by individuals who had provided shelter to the foreigners and could not travel due to the subsequent lockdown, others are by people like managing committee members or caretakers of mosques who have been accused of providing housing facilities to the foreigners at mosques under the jurisdiction of the Chandni Mahal police station. Earlier, the court had told Delhi Police to file a status report, indicating the role of each accused and as well as the duration of their stay, and whether the housing facility was given after or before lockdown orders were issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-questions-move-to-book-those-who-housed-tablighis/articleshow/87675719.cms||---

Garbage bins overflow every day because of ineffective door-to-door garbage collection,” she said. “Pack of stray dogs can be seen near the piles, instilling fear in the minds of residents. Dogs thrive in the area because of the poor waste collection system. The dogs run after two-wheeler users, causing accidents.”An official at the corporation’s north zone office promised to address the issues. “Garbage and stray dog menace would be addressed immediately.

JD(U) and BJP are allies in Bihar as well as at the Centre. Jhanjharpur MP and JD(U) national secretary Ramprit Mandal, who is the party’s in-charge in Manipur, will visit the northeast state on November 13 to review the present political scenario and the party’s preparations for the forthcoming polls. “Mandal, during his four-day stay, would review the ongoing preparations for the party’s proposed mega rally at Imphal on December 11,” JD(U) Manipur state president and former minister Hangkhanpao Taithul told TOI over phone on Friday. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh will lead the rally. The JD(U) wants to show its strength in Manipur through its proposed rally to be addressed by several top party leaders. “We have already got formidable candidates for at least 15 seats. More candidates, including some sitting and former MLAs, are to join the party at its rally….We are girding up loins to contest around 20 seats,” Taithul said in a response to a query. He, however, said the final decision regarding the number of seats would be taken by the JD(U) national leadership. The importance of Manipur polls for the JD(U) can be gauged from the fact that Lalan himself led a four-member team of senior party leaders to Imphal on October 8. The visiting team, comprising K C Tyagi, Afaque Ahmad Khan and R P Mandal, stayed in Manipur for four days to assess the party’s strength in different constituencies in the assembly polls. In the last assembly polls held in 2017, the Congress had won 28 seats to emerge as the single largest party. Later, in a dramatic turn of events, the BJP, which won 21 seats, formed the government with the support of three regional parties — the Naga People’s Front (NPF), National People’s Party (NPP) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), and the support of another MLA. The lone LJP MLA, Karam Shyam, joined the BJP on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-likely-to-contest-20-of-60-assembly-seats-in-manipur/articleshow/87673925.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Dehradun||SC stays felling of trees on Delhi-Dehradun expressway till November 16||DEHRADUN: The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday directed the Centre to put a stay on proposed felling of around 11,000 trees for expansion of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, till the next hearing on November 16. The court’s order came in response to a petition filed by a Doon-based NGO, Citizens for Green Doon. The NGO had initially approached the top court in early September and been told to go to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) instead. The NGO found the tribunal’s response unsatisfactory and moved back to the SC. The court also pulled up the NGT during Thursday’s hearing for “failing to deal with the issue in a satisfactory manner.” The matter pertains to a 19.5-km-long four-lane elevated stretch on NH-72A, from Ganeshpur (Uttar Pradesh) to Asharori (Uttarakhand), for which around 8,800 trees would need to be felled in UP and 2,200 in Uttarakhand. The trees on the chopping block include 1,600 British-era Sal trees, which was first reported by TOI in August last year. Himanshu Arora, secretary, Citizens for Green Doon, said that they had approached the Supreme Court in the matter on September 7. “The court refused to entertain our PIL, saying the NGT should resolve the matter, as it pertains to wildlife and forest clearances. However, when we went to NGT, we were told that this was not an environmental emergency. This was unacceptable to us. Cutting down so much green cover definitely qualifies as an emergency. So, we went back to the Supreme Court.” He added that the court thereafter assured them that it will listen to the case. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath, while hearing the matter, said, “The NGT should apply its mind. It has original jurisdiction over matters related to the environment. The way orders are passed by the NGT nowadays is totally unsatisfactory. The tribunal has to work in a different way and not this way. It cannot just pass any order and shift its burden to the Supreme Court.” Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said all clearances were in place for the project and no additional ones were needed for tree felling. Senior advocate Anita Shenoy, appearing for the NGO, cited an RTI reply to show that only stage-one clearances had been secured for the project. No orders had been issued by either the UP or the Uttarakhand government, giving a go-ahead to the project, which she said made tree felling illegal. She argued that tree felling and construction should immediately be stopped. In reply, Venugopal said the petitioner lacked “complete know-how of things” and that stage-two clearances had been granted, which could be checked at the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) website. The bench asked Venugopal to file all relevant details in the matter when the case is heard next Tuesday.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Inauguration of Purvanchal expressway a ‘tamasha’, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Taking a jibe at the BJP leadership visiting Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said the saffron brigade is jittery as they can see defeat staring them in their face. He described the government's plan to inaugurate Purvanchal Expressway as a ‘tamasha’ (concert). SP chief ’s comment came on a day when BJP’s poll planner Union minister Amit Shah was in Varanasi to fine tune party’s election strategy, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi may visit the state four times this month with his Sultanpur visit on November 16 to inaugurate the state’s longest Purvanchal Expressway at a three-km long airstrip built on it. Describing Purvanchal Expressway as a project that was conceived by Samajwadi Party government and land procured for the project between Lucknow and Ballia, the former UP CM said the BJP is planning to put up a ‘theatrical adaptation’ of what the SP government had done when the Agra Expressway conceived and executed by the SP government: touch down of fighter planes on the e-way. “People know that fighter planes ‘touched-down’ on an expressway for the first time during the Samajwadi Party government. Now the BJP is only copying it,” he said. “The only difference is that SP completed the entire expressway within 22 months and the Purvanchal Expressway is not even close to completion,” the SP chief said. Akhilesh said the fact that the government has planned to inaugurate incomplete projects explains that the BJP knows it will be defeated in the polls. “The CM and PM can put out foundation stones to claim credit for such halfcomplete projects, but people will not be misled now. They can see through such gimmicks. In fact, there is anger among the people over the deteriorating law and order and crime scene in the state. The condition of the health and education sectors is equally bad. Unemployment is on the rise and trade and businesses are passing through a lull. In such a situation, the government wants to indulge in chest thumping by inaugurating incomplete projects,” Akhilesh said.

---||Lucknow||BJP poll publicity blitz with art & performances||Lucknow: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has begun a publicity blitz in the state by roping in local artists from different genres, targeting rural areas for the Assembly polls due in Uttar Pradesh early next year. From songs, jingles, poetry, paintings, street plays, sculptures, drama, and bhajans to publicise the Modi and Yogi government’s achievements, BJP’s cultural wing is inviting artists to perform through its two-month-long publicity campaign. For instance, a poet in a recently held competition in Meerut sang, “Saare jag me mere desh ka maan badhaya…Modi-Yogi ki Jodi ne geet Bharat ka gaya.” In another example, a painter drew a portrait of PM Narendra Modi showcasing his stand on criminalisation of triple talaq. The idea, said party functionaries, is to target every booth by means of artwork. The party has given themes such as construction of historic Ram temple, abrogation of Article 370, formation of anti-Romeo squad, bringing an end to ‘goonda raj’, triple talaq, Ujjawala scheme, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and many others. State convener of BJP’s cultural wing Ravi Satija said, “The campaign focuses on schemes and achievements of the double-engine government. It sends a strong message of PM Modi emerging as a strong leader for solving mass problems. We want artistes to woo voters through their own ideas and take the massive work done by BJP government to public.” Satija’s latest song applauding the PM’s work goes like, “Har har me dikhte hain Modi, ghar-ghar me dikhte hain Modi… Bharat nav nirman karenge Modiji, shaktishali rastra banaye Modiji.” In charge of events across the state, co-convener of BJP’s cultural wing Gaurav Awasthi said the top three winners of six regions will compete at state level. “These artists will take selfies with common people and post it on social media to connect with them,” Awasthi said. On Article 370, Ruchi Chaturvedi, a poetess, wrote, “Chhaya tha ghangor andhera, ek suraj ne chata diya...Jinko ank (numbers) nahi bhaaye, un anko ko hata diya...Wo dhara 370 thi jisne apno se door rakha, Bharat maa ke beton ne us dhara ko hi hata diya.” “The campaign is serving dual purposes of giving a platform to artists to present their thoughts on the government’s schemes and also helping us promote the party’s agenda in each constituency,” Chaturvedi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-poll-publicity-blitz-with-art-performances/articleshow/87675401.cms||Isha Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Jaipur man’s kids & dad to appear in HC today’||Mumbai: The Bombay high court was on Friday informed by the lawyers for a Jaipur man and his parents that the grandfather would appear before it with the two minor children on Saturday. The vacation court bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja had on Wednesday directed the Jaipur-based man to appear on Friday with his two minor children, failing which orders to ensure their presence would be passed and may include issuance of arrest warrants against him and his parents. The interim order was on an urgent plea by his ex-wife, who resides in Kemps Corner in South Mumbai now after her remarriage in September. Her case was that her husband, who is a businessman, had divorced her by pronouncing talaq three times while they lived in the US in 2017. She had moved the HC with an urgent plea for directions to produce her children, who she alleged were illegally detained by her ex-husband after Jaipur police came to Mumbai and took her and them along with their passport and documents on September 30, allegedly on the basis of a ‘false FIR’ against her of jewelry theft. Her counsel Rizwan Merchant, at the hearing kept at 10.30am, said despite the HC order, the father and children remained absent. Merchant said he had also spoken to the Jaipur police chief. The HC was on the verge of directing that the grandfather be produced along with the children on Saturday at 3pm, when advocates Rafiq Gori and Karan Singh appearing for the Jaipur family submitted that the children will be brought by their grandfather himself along with a list of documents, including the green cards of the minor children and their permanent resident cards of Hong Kong, their passports and re-entry permit of US as well as the green card of the petitioner — their mother. The mother had expressed her apprehension that the children may be taken to Hong Kong against their wish as the ex-husband has business there and in the US. The HC had on Wednesday restrained the kids from being taken abroad till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jaipur-mans-kids-dad-to-appear-in-hc-today/articleshow/87674834.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCB records statement of Aryan Khan at Kharghar||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) vigilance team on Friday recorded the statement of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan at its temporary office in Kharghar as part of its probe into allegations of pay-off to its zonal chief, Sameer Wankhede. After he reached the NCB office at Ballard Pier to record his attendance as per the bail condition, he was taken to Kharghar. NCB deputy director Gyaneshwar Singh told the media at its CISF camp at Bandra that in the last 10 days they had recorded statements of 14-15 persons connected with the case, and they are yet to examine few more. Singh said the team recorded statements of Gosavi’s bodyguard Prabhakar Sail twice and if needed they may call him again. “We met Mumbai Police officials and collected CCTV footage of few places, digital, oral as well documentary evidence, and are yet to analyze the data collected. I will not disclose anything on the probe, not even the preliminary inquiry report, which may hamper our inquiry,” he said.' He said that they have not reached any conclusion yet as they still have to examine some key witnesses, including Shah Rukh Khan’s manager, Pooja Dadlani, and the witness Kiran Gosavi. Singh said his team moved an application before a court in Pune to seek permission to interrogate Gosavi, who is in Pune police’s custody in a cheating case. “We have moved court to record Gosavi’s statement and the court is likely to hear the matter on Monday,” he said. If the court grants permission, the NCB team will next week record Gosavi’s statement in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-records-statement-of-aryan-at-kharghar/articleshow/87674041.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Patna||Bihar seeks central funds for Kosi-Mechi project||PATNA: State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Friday sought financial support from the Centre under the 90:10 ratio formula for the Kosi-Mechi intra-linking river project in north Bihar. Jha was addressing the 19th meeting of the special committee on the interlinking of rivers in the country held at Delhi. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat chaired the meeting. The Kosi-Mechi project has already got Centre’s clearance, but the resolution of its financial aspects was in the process. While it is an ambitious project of the Bihar government, the WRD has also identified three other intra-river linking projects, including for south Bihar, to address the flood and drought mitigation concerns. Pointing out that the state was “happy” with the detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) in connection with the Kosi-Mechi project, Jha said, “This will contribute significantly in mitigating the double whammy of flood and drought, which the state faces every year.” The project is purported to mitigate flood problem and also provide water for irrigation purposes to four eastern Bihar districts. Stating that CM Nitish Kumar has been working on a broad vision pegged to the flood-drought mitigation, Jha also thanked the Centre for considering three other intra-linking of Bagmati-Ganga, Budhi Gandak-Noon-Baya and Bagmati-Budhi Gandak rivers projects in north Bihar. Jha also said the state’s mathematical modelling centre (MMC) has undertaken the study for the intra-linking of the rivers concerned. One such study with regard to the Bagmati-Ganga linking had shown “positive results”, he said. “If the scheme is implemented, it will help free Kusheshwar Asthan from the flood menace caused by Bagmati, Kamla and Kosi rivers,” he added. Jha argued for the interlinking of Bagmati, Kosi and Kamla rivers in north Bihar and Punpun with Harohar in south Bihar. He also requested the Centre to deploy more officials at the NWDA regional office at Patna to facilitate better coordination between the state WRD and the agency. Referring to the visionary plan envisaged by CM Nitish with regard to greening of the state through the Jal Jeevan Hariyali (JJH) campaign, Jha said the UN had recognized him as the Global Climate Leader, and Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates has also appreciated his efforts. Jha referred to the efforts being made for the plantation drive to increase the green cover, stress on using solar energy, rainwater harvesting and reviving dead water bodies. He said all this was in sync with the COP26 agenda concerns. Besides, as many as 29,952 schemes had been identified to provide irrigation water to every plot of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-seeks-central-funds-for-kosi-mechi-project/articleshow/87673637.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore Medical College Hospital surgeons remove metal object from 53-year-old woman’s chest||COIMBATORE: Surgeons of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) proved their mettle again by removing a sharp metal object that pierced the chest of a 53-year-old Pollachi resident. The patient had stabbed herself in a fit of anger during an altercation with her family, a doctor said. “She was brought to the hospital on October 20 by her relatives, with the object lodged in her diaphragm and a portion of it protruding out. It had narrowly missed the heart, leaving the muscles around the pericardial chamber that accommodates the heart injured.” The patient underwent sternotomy – a procedure that allows doctors to reach out to the heart and nearby blood vessels, within a couple of hours. “As the patient had suffered internal bleeding, blood was getting deposited in the pericardial chamber. Usually, it will have 30ml of pericardial fluid for lubrication of the heart, which expands and contracts. Accumulation of blood was harming the heart, requiring immediate surgery,” the doctor added. “We immediately performed sternotomy on her and 300ml of blood deposited in the pericardial chamber was removed along with the metal object, and the injured muscles were repaired,” said cardiothoracic surgery associate professor A Shivanraj. Four weeks after the surgery, the patient is out of danger. CMCH dean A Nirmala said that timely intervention saved the life of the patient, who was operated free of cost under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-surgeons-remove-metal-object-from-53-year-old-womans-chest/articleshow/87674832.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp’s sewer connectivity dream a challenge for KWA||Thiruvananthapuram: While the corporation plans to attain sewerage connection in 80% of city wards in six years, Kerala water authority (KWA) has had to deal with tender excess, technical difficulties, contractual issues and local protests while undertaking sewerage schemes in the last five years under AMRUT-1. Recently poor performance of contractors coupled with mounting pressure to expedite the work forced the KWA to terminate the work on laying transmission main and sewer network in Karimanal (Block J), collection and conveyance system phase 1, trunk main from Arasumoodu to Karimanal pumping station. In November 2020, the chief engineer sent a letter to the executive engineer saying that the work shall be completed by February 2021. The latest project status of the work shows that due to poor performance, the original work is cancelled and the balance work is arranged at the risk and cost of the contractor. Work has been tendered again and two offers were received and a tender process is underway. The unexpected hurdle in the implementation of the work is likely to slow down the progress. It had taken nearly two years for all major works under AMRUT since the date of obtaining technical sanction to get into the implementation stage. Between this time period the KWA had a horrid time finding experienced firms with the required expertise to get the work done. Often the KWA was forced to present an excess amount for works as serious on-field issues were cited by the contractors which called for additional cost. In January, the city corporation decided to go ahead with four sewerage works for which excess tender was quoted. About 40% tender excess was approved for three sub works. These included providing sewerage facility to eastern side of Amayizhanjan canal between Vanchiyoor junction and Samad hospital road junction, rehabilitation of sewer line, including cleaning, replacing damaged lines etc at Kaithamukku, Thengappara area and rehabilitation of damaged sewer network at Palkulangara. The corporation also executed a work agreement on 27% tender excess for the work that involves laying transmission main and sewer networks in Karamanal collection and conveyance system. The corporation had also agreed to bear 40% tender excess for laying sewer network from Murinjapalam to Kannamoola. Another work was approved at 45% tender excess. The work involves laying of pipe and construction of new manholes at Chengalloor and Vattavila of Punnakamugal ward. The high powered committee approved the tender excess citing that the state faces an acute shortage of experienced contractors in the sewerage sector and high risks are involved in executing the work. The administrative sanction for sewerage pump house at Edathara was fixed at Rs 5.87 crores and the amount had to be revised later. The contractor had cited that the site for construction was slushy and there was high risk for tilting of the well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corps-sewer-connectivity-dream-a-challenge-for-kwa/articleshow/87654393.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Single-day Covid tally at over 3-month high||NEW DELHI: The capital on Friday recorded 62 cases of Covid in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day tally in more than three months. The state health department, in its latest bulletin, also confirmed two fresh fatalities due to the viral infection — the spread of which is on the rise again, though it is nowhere near the alarming levels witnessed in the runup to the second wave of the pandemic in April and May. Back then, there was an acute shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs at hospitals in Delhi. With the new cases, the Covid infection tally in the city reached 14,40,332. Of this, over 14.1 lakh patients have recovered from the disease. A total of 49,874 tests were conducted a day ago, including 38,408 RTPCR/CBNAAT/True Nat tests, while the rest were rapid antigen tests. The toll stands at 25,093, including the two reported on Friday. Before this, the city did not report any death due to Covid in November. Last month, Delhi recorded four deaths due to the infection while five people had succumbed to the viral disease in September. The number of active cases in the city is 371. Of these, 152 patients are being treated in various city hospitals and 156 are in home isolation. There are 111 containment zones in the capital. Delhi reported 25 Covid cases on Monday, 33 on Tuesday, 54 on Wednesday and 40 on Thursday. Doctors say there is an urgent need to step up measures to prevent the disease spread, which includes increased testing, stricter enforcement of mask rules and speeding up of the vaccination drive. “The increase in cases as well as the positivity rate is marginal. However, that should not make us complacent. We need to increase testing to be able to identify potential areas where disease is spreading and enforce strict measures to prevent overcrowding. Mask rules have to be enforced strictly,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital. The hospital has 470 Covid beds, of which only six were occupied on Friday. Other hospitals, too, have very low occupancy of Covid beds, data shows. “We cannot afford another spike in Covid cases as we are struggling with a rise in OPD and IPD visits due to mosquito-borne illnesses and respiratory problems caused by air pollution,” Dr Arun Gupta, the president of Delhi Medical Council, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/single-day-covid-tally-at-over-3-month-high/articleshow/87675746.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Patna||‘Many in Purnia forced to sell paddy much below MSP’||PURNIA: The state government had announced paddy procurement on November 1 through PACS (primary agriculture cooperative societies) at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1940-Rs1960 per quintal, but the farmers are forced to sell their produce at a throwaway price in several blocks of the district. “Before the Chhath holiday, two PACS centres were opened under Banmankhi and Dhamdaha subdivisions of the district for the procurement of paddy at the MSP fixed by the state government. But, it remained a formality as procurement has not started at the two centres yet,” said Nyaz Ahmad, the coordinator of Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti as well as Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, Purnia unit. “The delay has forced the farmers in the district to sell their produce at Rs1,100-1,200 per quintal to the middlemen and arhatiyas as small and marginal farmers don’t have storage facilities. Traders and middlemen are making money by selling the same produce (obtained from farmers) to PACS at MSP. We urge the state government to check hoarding and ask the PACS to procure paddy,” Nyaz added. Shaukat, a farmer from Jhunni Estambrar village under K-Nagar block of the district, said the PACS will start obtaining paddy from mandis when the distress sale by farmers is over. “I had paddy in seven acres of land, out of which crops in three acres were destroyed due to heavy rainfall in the district in October. The BB11 variety, in the remaining portion of the land, has been processed and will be sold at the market price,” he said. Yamuna Murmu from Pathraha panchayat under B-Kothi block said, “The announcement was made on November 1, but the procurement through PACS has not started yet. We will be happy if the process starts in our panchayat.” Varun Kumar Mehta, a farmer from Jhunni Kala panchayat under Srinagar block of the district, said, “The paddy procurement at the MSP is just on paper. We are selling our produce at Rs1100-1200 per quintal. Zamini hakikat kuch aur hai (the ground reality is something different).” When asked about the delay in paddy procurement by the PACS, president of all the 252 PACS in Purnia district, Amin Akhter, said, “It has begun at Touli under Dagrua block, Jhowwari (Amour), Jagni (K-Nagar), Rupaspur Khagha under Dhamdaha subdivision as well as under Harda block. Though, the process was to start on November 1, it didn’t happen due to high moisture content in the paddy due to heavy rainfall in October. From November 20, the procurement process will be fast-tracked at all the PACS.” Akhter said the MSP for grade A paddy is Rs1960 per quintal whereas it is Rs1940 per quintal for grade B produce.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-in-purnia-forced-to-sell-paddy-much-below-msp/articleshow/87673800.cms||---

Those acquited by the special judge, VY Jadhav, included two workers, a farmer, a grocery shop owner, an auto-rickshaw driver and a carpenter. According to the prosecution, the accused armed with a knife and other weapons entered the premises of Trimurti Petrol Pump around 2 am on July 6, 2011, assaulted the staff and robbed Rs 20,100 in cash. The counsel for the accused, Punit Mahimkar, told the court that his clients were not involved in the alleged incident of armed dacoity. He argued that the test identification parade conducted in the jail was not at all reliable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcoca-court-acquits-7-in-dacoity-case/articleshow/87674844.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Five men held for killing wall painter||COIMBATORE: The Madukkarai police arrested five men on Friday for murdering a 23-year-old wall painter. Police identified the victim as M Vijayan, of Palathurai at Madukkarai. Vijayan was killed by S Shabir, 24, of Malumichampatti and A Binas, 26, of Atlantic Nagar at Madukkarai with the help of S Dhanush, 25, of Madukkarai and S Hariharan, 21, of Ganeshapuram at Podanur who worked as wall painters and R Paruthi Vinayagam, 22, a Sundarapuram-based college student, a police officer said. “Shabir and Binas were rearing dogs and roosters for sales. Dhanush, Hariharan and Vinayagam, who were regular buyers, had struck up a friendship with them. After roosters were stolen from Binas’s place at Madukkarai, he found that one Sasikumar was behind the thefts. Sasikumar used to hand over the stolen roosters to his friend Vijayan, a wall painter. Recently, Vijayan sold a stolen rooster to one Gowtham. When Binas and Shabir apprehended him, Vijayan returned the rooster,” the officer said. Binas accused Vijayan of stealing several roosters in the last two months and demanded compensation. “On Thursday night, Shabir, Binas, Dhanush, Hariharan and Vinayagam took Vijayan to an isolated place at Madukkarai to sort out the issue. When a quarrel broke out, Binas and Shabir stabbed Vijayan with a knife. The other three men helped them. Vijayan died on the spot,” the officer added. Madukkarai police inspector Vairam and team arrested the five men on Friday and remanded them in judicial custody. They were booked under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 342 (wrongful restraint), 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/five-men-held-for-killing-wall-painter/articleshow/87674835.cms||---

He visited the IAF hospital in Kanpur Cantonment for treatment as he was not just suffering from fever. He even had rashes on his body and pain in joints and muscles. Doctors prescribed the primary line of treatment comprising antibiotics, anti-allergic and anti-pyretics. A week went by but there was little relief. On the contrary, the patient grew weaker. His sample was then sent to the microbiology lab at SGPGI Lucknow and National Institute of Virology, Pune, for assessment. On October 23, the patient was declared UP’s first case of Zika virus infection. Since then the state’s Zika tally has swelled to 125 with 121 cases in Kanpur alone. Other cases are in Lucknow (3) and Kannauj (1). Among the affected are three pregnant women, 18 children under 12 years of age and 11 IAF personnel. Two cases were detected in Lucknow on Thursday. State on high alert On October 23 itself the UP government issued an advisory on Zika virus. Marked to district and health chiefs, the order issued by director general medical and health Dr Ved Vrat Singh apprised officials about the vector-borne disease and directed them to keep vigil on suspected cases, draw a detailed micro-plan of action, organize training of health staff, assess availability and requirement of logistics, undertake fresh entomological survey and alert hospitals to notify any suspected cases. Officials at the integrated diseases surveillance programme rolled out a separate strategy for Kanpur. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, said aggressive contact tracing, surveillance and monitoring activities have been launched in the district. Two days later, on October 25, the Union health ministry sent a multidisciplinary team comprising an entomologist, public health specialists and gynaecologist to take stock of the situation in Kanpur and extend help to state authorities in containment. Two other teams from the Centre and four teams from the state have visited Kanpur and Kannauj. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is keeping an eye on the situation daily. On Wednesday, he also paid a visit to the affected areas in Kanpur. Health minister Jai Pratap Singh, who accompanied the CM, claimed that all efforts were being taken to contain Zika and urged people to cooperate with the health staff. “The role of people is crucial here. While the government is doing its bit, adherence to prevention protocol and flagging the system in case of any complication lies in their hands,” he said. Surveillance underway State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agarwal said: “Of the total cases in Kanpur, 17 have recovered which leaves the district with 88 active cases. The surveillance area has been expanded to a radius of 3km from the first case.” About the entomological survey, he said that 246 mosquitoes isolated from the affected area have been sent to National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) in Delhi. “Vector control activities have been launched even as the report from NIMR is awaited,” he said, adding that nearly 5,000 samples of suspected patients from Kanpur, Kannauj and half a dozen neighbouring districts have been sent for analysis. Locals on the guard While the containment strategy is on, locals remain concerned. “The disease has been reported in Kanpur for the first time. This is bound to create panic,” said Sonu Jaiswal, a resident of Pokharpurwa. Businessman in Shyamnagar Farea, araz Ansari, said: “Some of my relatives are also under scanner. Fever seems scary now. The biggest challenge is to differentiate between normal fever and what is something else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/is-up-zikas-new-home-in-india/articleshow/87675416.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||HC dismisses DUSU plea over admission criterion for Kerala aspirants||Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea by the Delhi University Students Union (DUSU), challenging the varsity’s decision to consider only Class XII marks for the admission of students from the Kerala state board, which determines the grades by combining marks of classes XI and XII. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the petition was “highly belated” and lacked merits. The court said it cannot pass any order on presumptions and will see if some student from Kerala files a petition with a grievance. “They have changed it so changed it, how can anyone grutch about it If you don't want to read the clear writing on the wall, then that is your choice,” the bench said while perusing the June admission bulletin issued by DU which said that if a candidate mark sheet contains both class XI and XII marks, he or she shall enter only class XII marks. DUSU, in its plea, said it was approaching the high court against the “arbitrary, irrational and unfair conduct” of authorities that have violated the fundamental and legal rights of innumerable students. It said that in terms of the consistent policy, certain state boards including the Directorate of General Education (Higher Secondary Wing), Government of Kerala, gives combined marks of both XI and XII standard on the mark sheets. The policy explicitly states that to determine grades of students, combined marks of both XI and XII shall be considered, it said. Advocate Ashish Dixit, representing DUSU, said the Delhi University for several years correspondingly incorporated provision in admission bulletin stating that in cases where state boards publish marks of both XI and XII standard, the merit of students shall be determined based on such consolidated mark sheets. However, the Delhi University has unilaterally and arbitrarily decided in its admission process of 2021-2022 that students would only be required to fill marks of XII standard, he said adding that when the admissions began for the sessions 2021-2022, the colleges raised and conveyed objections concerning mark sheets containing marks of both XI and XII. The plea was opposed by Delhi University's counsel M Rupal who raised objection over DUSU's locus standi to file the petition since the association only represents students of Delhi University and not those who have not yet taken admission here. He further said the admission bulletin was issued by the varsity in June and the petitioner has approached the court in October which is highly belated. However, Dixit said the issue was first highlighted on October 4 then they have a representation to the vice-chancellor on October 9 but to date, no decision has been taken. The plea said initially, the university directed that such cases be kept on hold, however, within a few hours, the admissions office of DU circulated an email to colleges asserting that the Admission Advisory Committee has decided that only marks of XII standard shall be considered. It said the state boards declared results following a long-standing policy which was notified for the examinations conducted for the academic session 2020-2021. It said the union gave a representation to the authorities and met the highest officers of the university but they have not acted in any manner for the welfare of students after which the petition was filed. Earlier, the high court had dismissed a petition which alleged a “disproportionate” number of admissions of students from Kerala state board in Delhi University, saying fixing of cut-offs was a matter of the varsity's admission policy. The earlier petition was filed by a DU-aspirant seeking a “scaling mechanism” for marks scored by students from different boards in order to provide a level playing field.

---||Nagpur||Police protecting ‘real murderers’ of MBBS student, say agitators||Yavatmal: All students, junior and senior residents and interns in government medical college (GMC), Yavatmal, have joined the indefinite strike to press demand for arresting the assailants responsible for murder of final year MBBS student Ashok Pal on Wednesday night. The police had arrested two suspects on Wednesday midnight. SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal had constituted four teams to nab the assailants. “Two youths, Akash Dilip Gapane (21) and Tushar Shankar Nagdive (24), both residents of Waghapur, have been arrested. The court has granted them PCR till November 17,” said the SP. Resident doctors from GMCH Nagpur, IGGMCH Nagpur and GMCH Akola and those agitating in Yavatmal GMC alleged that the police are working under political pressure and protecting the “real murderers”. Residents from GMCH Nagpur, IGGMCH Nagpur and GMCH Akola have threatened to go on strike from Saturday morning. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) committees of the three GMCs served the strike notice to their deans on Friday afternoon. Dr Sajal Bansal, president of MARD at GMCH Nagpur alleged that the arrested criminals are enjoying political protection from those in power. According to doctors in Yavatmal, a Shiv Sena leader, who was seen in a video threatening them during their protest on Thursday, is protecting the assailants as they are from his locality. SP Bhujbal said that a complaint was lodged in the city police station by Dr Surendra Bhuyar. “We have registered a criminal offence under sections 302 and 34 of IPC and section 4/25 of Arms Act,” said Bhujbal. “We will go on strike from tomorrow morning. A doctor’s murder on college campus is a very serious issue and no one is paying heed to it. It’s about the life of life saviours. Such neglect and ignorance by police, administration and political leadership is unacceptable,” he said. Pal hailed from a poor family and is survived by his mother, a younger brother and sister. He had lost his father, an auto driver in Thane, to Covid. Pal was never involved in any squabbles, as per his classmates. On Friday, senior Shiv Sena leader and former minister Sanjay Rathod visited the agitating doctors but they turned down his appeal to call off the strike. The agitators have even refused to meet the SP and district collector. They want an open dialogue in their pandal and written assurances from the authorities. While addressing a press conference at GMC Yavatmal, general secretary of Central Committee of MARD, Dr Swapnil Kajale from Solapur, declared that they won’t join the duty unless the assailants are arrested. General secretary of the students union, Dr Kartik Kunapwar, said that all UG students, interns, MARD members (both junior and senior residents) and Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra Nurses Union and others are supporting the agitation. Besides arrest of all the assailants, their demands include adequate compensation to the next of kin of the deceased, foolproof security arrangements, street lights and CCTVs, construction of compound walls, immediate appointment of regular dean and others. Dr Aniket Gaurkhede said that they are attending to emergency cases. “Only the main gate was locked,” he said. The agitators also condemned the medical education minister Amit Deshmukh who has so far not visited the college after the incident. “The minister should have heard our grievances,” said Dr Swapnil Kajale. District collector Amol Yedge, who was in Pune on Friday, told TOI over phone that he has ordered heads of departments concerned to update the security arrangements and install street lights and CCTVs on the entire campus. Yegde also said that he has given instructions for cleaning the campus, construction of broken compound wall and the removal of encroachments around the GMC campus. Political parties have so far stayed away from the agitation. “Politicians who used to call us ‘Covid warriors’ are now not even visiting us,” said Sagar Dole, an agitating student. The police sources said that they nabbed the duo on the basis of the complaint of the RMO of the GMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-protecting-real-murderers-of-mbbs-student-say-agitators/articleshow/87674855.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Thane||Maharashtra: HSC, SSC students to get part of their board exam fee back||MUMBAI: The state education board has decided to refund 14-18 per cent of the fees collected for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School (HSC) exams that got cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Schools and junior colleges have been directed to upload details of students who had registered for the SSC and HSC 2021 exams. The amount to be refunded will be transferred to each school’s bank account. It will then be the responsibility of the school to return the refunded fees to students. More than 16 lakh class 10 and 14 lakh class 12 students had registered for the board exams. The results, based on internal assessments, were declared by the board in July-August. After a retired principal from Miraj in Sangli district filed a PIL seeking refund of exams fees, the Bombay high court had asked the board to consider the plea. The petitioner had pointed out that the board had collected over Rs 150 crore from students, and not returning it after cancellation of exams would amounted to profiteering. On Thursday, the board decided to partially refund the collected money. Class 10 students who paid Rs 415 for the SSC exam will get a refund of Rs 59 or 14%. Class 12 students who had paid Rs 520 will get a refund of Rs 94 (18%). Students who appeared for the supplementary exams in October will not be entitled for the refund.

In one of the incidents, a woman resident of Nageshwar road was trying to place order for an apparel online. Before confirming the delivery, a fraudster contacted her and asked her to confirm the order. He asked her to pay Rs 5 as a test payment. However, the fraudster later siphoned off Rs 65,000 from her account. An FIR has been filed at the Cantt police station. In another incident, an imposter called up a Dehradun-based family planning to hold a puja. The fraudster, pretending to be their family priest, asked for Rs 1 lakh. After making the payment, the family visited the priest only to find out that they were duped. A probe is underway into the case. In the third incident, a 72-year-old Race Course resident was duped of Rs 16 lakh by a man running a fake kitty fund.

---||Chandigarh||Employee cannot be demoted without chance to be heard, says Punjab and Haryana high court||CHANDIGARH: Even if an employee of the state (Haryana) government has been wrongly promoted, the person cannot be demoted without giving him an opportunity of being heard. The Punjab and Haryana high court made this observation while deciding the petition against reversion of an employee of Board of School Education Haryana in Bhiwani and pointed out that "the rules of natural justice and procedural rules cannot be given go by in such a light and casual manner”. “Merely by saying that petitioner had managed to get an order with regard to his promotion does not shield the respondents from explaining as to why allegedly wrong promotion was granted to the petitioner. The officers and other authorities of respondents were not expected to be so ignorant, naïve and novice so as to pass an order granting promotion to the petitioner without due application of mind…” the HC has ordered. Justice H S Madaan of the HC has passed these orders while allowing a petition filed by Devender Kumar Bansal, an employee of the Haryana board of school education, who was ordered to be demoted from the post of senior system executive to senior computer operator. The petitioner was appointed as a computer operator with the education board in February 1987, promoted as senior computer operator in1989, and as senior system executive on December 19, 2016. The board, which is the competent authority to modify the regulations, had taken a decision on October 7, 2017, that for promotion to the post of senior system executive, three years’ experience as system executive/ senior computer operator is required because system executive/senior computer operator is the same post. The decision was duly approved by the additional chief secretary, school education department, Haryana. The petitioner argued that although decision of board of directors approved by additional chief secretary, school education department, Haryana, could not be upset by director general, school education, Haryana, even then, on the basis of a letter dated February 11, 2020, issued by the latter, a reversion order dated February 25, 2020, was passed. The petitioner had approached the HC contending that before passing of the order neither any show-cause notice was issued to him nor any opportunity of being heard was given. The state authorities responded that the petitioner had managed to get the promotion in that way an accusing finger was being pointed out towards the authorities that had granted promotion to the petitioner. While setting aside the demotion orders, the HC observed, “Even if, the respondents felt that the promotion granted to the petitioner has not been so done legally and validly and it deserved to be withdrawn, then rules of natural justice required that at least an opportunity of being heard should have been afforded to the petitioner getting his version...” The HC also made it clear that the board would be at liberty to serve a show-cause notice upon the petitioner as to why he should not be reverted to the post before promotion, get his response and then proceed to pass appropriate order in accordance with law. NO SHIELD:“M erely by saying that petitioner had managed to get an order with regard to his promotion does not shield the respondents from explaining as to why allegedly wrong promotion was granted to the petitioner....” the HC observed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/employee-cant-be-demoted-without-being-given-chance-to-be-heard-hc/articleshow/87674842.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM Chalai unit’s queer poster is a head turner||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Bare-chested men stretch their hands gripping the hammer and sickle; their arms intertwined and pressed against one’s belly in the backdrop of gay pride flag. On the corner sits another couple. The endorsement poster prepared by CPM Chalai area committee as part of the CPM Chalai area conference proclaiming solidarity for the LGBT community has struck a chord with many. It symbolizes homosexuality which aims at giving a message to the society that all the categories, including LGBTQ must be treated equal.  The poster carries a tagline “ee lokam ellavarudeyum” (this world is for everyone). The poster was published on the Facebook page of Chalai local committee. The poster portrays a lesbian couple and a gay couple. The decision of designing a poster like this was made in the local committee meeting. The poster also gives awareness among the people who are not ready to accept the LGBTQ community. They are also planning to launch another poster which will portray the transgender community.  “Our party aims at providing equal importance to all categories of people; this poster was driven by this objective,” said S A Sundar of CPM Chalai area committee.  “The Communist Party of India aims at providing equal rights to all categories of humans; thus, we also support LGBTQ. It is important for society to accept one’s personal interest. I have taken reference from an old painting and a statue to depict the couples,” said Unni D S, the designer. LGBT community has welcomed the gesture.  “It is encouraging to see the CPM taking a welcome gesture. The government has not informed the High Court of its assent to homosexual marriages. I believe that if the government can expedite those procedures, it will be a significant victory for people’s lives,” said Prijith P K, a queer activist.  The conference will be held on December 5, 6 and 7 at Mudavanmugal. Sports and arts competitions will also be held as part of the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-chalai-units-queer-poster-is-a-head-turner/articleshow/87654416.cms||---

It was not possible due to Covid-19 protocols,” he said. Amit said the aim of organising the reunion programme is to pay back to the society and give a positive message to everyone that parties and functions can be organised without liquor, too. “That’s why this reunion has been organised especially in ‘dry’ Bihar,” he said.

---||Coimbatore||Prolonged rain pushes up veggie prices||Coimbatore: The recent showers have shot up the prices of locally grown vegetables, be it tomatoes, ladies' fingers, lima beans, brinjal, cluster beans and all gourd varieties.Tomato, which is extensively grown at Thondamuthur, Nasiyapuram, Thenkarai, Nachipalayam and Theethipatti, has seen the highest increase of Rs 50 and is now priced at Rs 80 per kg, compared to Rs 30 earlier.Traders said the recent spell of rain had damaged most of the vegetable crops, the flowers of which had fallen off. They attributed the price rise to short supply. “While vegetables from other districts and states used to reach the district, supply is affected because of the widespread rain.”P Kanthasamy, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association, said while the locally grown vegetables were fetching good prices, most farmers were not benefitting from the same. “Only a few farmers, whose farms were not affected by the rain, are benefitting presently. While brinjal varieties are being sold up to Rs 60 per kg in the wholesale market, many farmers don’t have the produce to sell. Ladies' fingers are also in short supply.”M Sivaranjini, a resident of Nallampalayam, said the price of most vegetables had doubled, compared to two weeks ago. “I go for vegetables like potato, cabbage, snake gourd, elephant foot yam and banana, which are comparatively cheaper. While tomatoes are expensive, they are an indispensable item.”R Velmurgan, a trader from Gandhipuram market, said it might take at least another couple of weeks for the vegetable prices to come down. “The prices will drop when vegetables from the district and neighbouring areas reach the city markets. By mid-January, prices of most vegetables will take a downward dive.” He said his regular customers had cut down on the quantity of vegetables being purchased because of the price hike. “Sale of carrots and beans is good, although the prices are on the higher side. Many customers feel the price of vegetables grown in hilly areas is better, compared to that of the locally grown ones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/prolonged-rain-pushes-up-veggie-prices/articleshow/87674859.cms||V Devanathan

---||Coimbatore||‘Encourage faculty to work on outcome-based research’||Coimbatore: Bharathiar University Vice-Chancellor P Kaliraj suggested more weightage for outcome-based research while deciding on promotions of faculty members in higher education institutions.The vice-chancellor participated in the 5th edition of the national higher education conclave – 2021 organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Coimbatore on Friday. He said that many teachers will be interested to collaborate with industries to translate their research work into a product if the product development index is considered while assessing their promotion.Most research activities in the institutions are largely limited to receiving grants, publishing research papers before moving on to the next project. There is less focus on technology transfer and licensing.He said, “Institutions need to be an interface to make the education system take care of the industry needs. This will help the industry to have faith in the faculty members.”Saying that manufacturing processes are changing in the industry, he said the type of jobs that exist may not continue after three years with the fast-emerging disruptive technology. So, the focus of higher education institutions should be to facilitate faster adaptability to changing trends.“We will have more jobs in the coming years, but it would require different skills. It is the responsibility of the educational institutions to prepare students with the skills that are required for jobs that will emerge in the next two to three years,” he said.Having this in mind, Bharathiar University introduced industry 4.0 components like data Internet of Things, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, and data analytics into their curriculum before the pandemic, the VC said.While we are motivating institutions to start new innovative programs, parents should encourage students to opt for such courses and job-oriented certificate courses to make themselves fit for various components of new opportunities.“By making affiliated colleges give equal weightage to both internal and external assessment, we can offer a level playing field for these colleges on par with autonomous colleges. Students were preferring autonomous colleges during admission as they were offering more weightage for internal assessment unlike in affiliated colleges where internals had 25% weightage,” he said.Highlighting the challenges in the implementation of new education policy 2020, S P Thyagarajan, chancellor of Avinashilingam University said that its implementation in a flexible manner is essential for uplifting the standards of higher education to global levels. Association of Indian Universities is taking up the task of collecting feedback on the issues faced during the implementation of the NEP from institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encourage-faculty-to-work-on-outcome-based-research/articleshow/87674867.cms||---
---||Delhi||Liquor prices in Delhi may rise by 8-10% despite VAT cut||NEW DELHI: With a new excise regime becoming operational from November 17, Delhi government notified reduced value added tax on liquor on Friday. Industry experts, however, expect retail prices to go up 8-10%. Delhi government’s finance department notified some amendments in the Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004, which now mandates a fixed 1% VAT on alcohol sold by a wholesaler to a retailer from November 10. The on foreign liquor and Indian made foreign liquor consumed off premises from the retailer has been reduced to 1% from November 17. However, for consumption on the premises of hotels, clubs and restaurants, VAT will remain 25%. “While VAT used to be 25% and has been reduced to 1%, this will have no real impact on prices because the entire pricing structure has been changed,” explained Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies. He said that instead of a nominal rate charged for a retail license plus excise duty and VAT, the government has factored these into the base price for the auction. License holders who bid more than the base price, Rs 225 crore for most locations, will want to recover the amount and some licensees, Giri said, had demanded a hike of 30-35% on the maximum retail price. Such a hike would have meant Delhiites buying cheaper liquor in the neighbouring states. “Going by the pattern, you are realistically looking at the new prices being 8-10% higher than earlier,” Giri said. With VAT and excise subsumed in the license fee, a Delhi government official said the price would now depend on the competitive forces. “The new policy allows discounts too, so we could actually expect the prices to go down,” the official added. The excise department has asked all current liquor licence holders, from guest houses to restaurants and hotels, to migrate to the new excise system by November 16. They will also have to pay the difference in the previous and new license fees for a period from November 17 to March 31, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/liquor-prices-may-rise-by-8-10-despite-vat-cut/articleshow/87675750.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Her husband, who is missing ever since Thursday morning, is the prime suspect in the case. Nasila, daughter of Abdul Manas and Jameela Biwi of Navaz Manzil, Parankimamvila under Palode police station limits is the deceased. Her husband Abdul Rahim, a government employee who works as a clerk at Industrial Training Institute at Chackai, is missing. The police said that Nasila was found dead by her parents around 6 am on Thursday in her bedroom. Normally, Nasila wakes up early before the other family members. Abdul Manas and Jameela Biwi went inside the bedroom to check on her as she failed to respond to their calls. The body was lying in a sleeping position, covered by a blanket. There were two lacerated wounds on her neck and chest, apparently made using a sharp weapon. Though Nasila's 12-year-old daughter was also sleeping in the same room, she had not woken up then. Her elder son slept in a separate room. Rahim was nowhere to be found. “From prima facie evidence collected, we suspect that Rahim committed the crime over suspicion of infidelity. We have recovered a handwritten note from the room, apparently written by Rahim, in which it was mentioned that he was doubtful of his wife's fidelity,” said Palode station house officer inspector C K Manoj. He also said that it has been learned that Rahim was ailing from mental illness for which he was undergoing treatment. Nasila's parents told the police that they were not aware of any marital dispute that existed between the couple. Rahim returned home relatively late on Wednesday night as he had gone to attend a party with friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-found-dead-in-bedroom-with-stab-injuries/articleshow/87654424.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Despite 3 extensions, UP Board gets lowest registrations||Lucknow: Even after three extensions, only 51.2 lakh candidates registered for the UP board class 10 and 12 examinations scheduled in first quarter of 2022, which is lowest in a decade. Conducted by the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Board (UPSEB), the registrations increased by merely 10,000 in the last lap of the registrations, which ended on November 8. Before the UPSEB closed the online window for filling online forms on November 8, 51.2 lakh candidates confirmed registrations by paying the fee. The figures are 5 lakh less than last year (academic year 2020-21) when 56.1 lakh candidates registered for the exam. In 2019-20 stood at 57.9 lakh, while in 2017-18, 66 lakh candidates had registered for the exams. In 2011, UP board saw 57.2 lakh candidates registering for the exam. In past one decade, 2014 saw highest of 69.9 lakh registrations. Though officials, neither from UPSEB nor the secondary education, were available for comment, departmental officials reasoned out prolonged school closure due to Covid-19 pandemic and lack of online teaching as major reasons for UP witnessing the lowest registrations in 10 years. “Over the past one and half years, schools are just like any other building. The government has hardly made attempts to continue teaching-learning, leaving students in the lurch. The end result is that students are turning their backs to UP board,” said RP Mishra, state president, UP Secondary Teachers’ Association. He added that even when the UPSEB extended the date thrice — the last one from October 22 to November 8 — there were hardly 10,000 more students, that too in class 12, who registered. In all, 27.7 lakh candidates have applied for class 10, while 23.5 lakh have registered for class 12 for the examinations to be held in early 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/despite-3-extensions-up-board-gets-lowest-registrations/articleshow/87675433.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||No achievement by Cong in special assembly session: AAP||Chandigarh: The AAP on Friday questioned the achievement of the Congress during the two-day special session of Punjab assembly. Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said the Charahnjit Singh Channi-led government had only staged a drama in the name of special assembly session and wasted crores of rupees in the exercise. “In over four years of the Congress rule, it has only politicised issues of sacrilege, power purchase agreements (PPAs), unemployment along with drug, cable sand and transport mafia. But no concrete decision has been taken in the interest of Punjab,” he said. All Congress leaders, be it former chief minister Amarinder Singh to party state president Navjot Singh Sidhu and current chief minister Channi, have been talking about the cancellation of PPAs but done nothing, he alleged. During the session, the opposition MLAs were encouraged to change their party, he said. Cheema also questioned the purpose served by introducing draft of bills regarding Punjabi language in English language. How can major issues of Punjab could be resolved in the session with a 2-4 minute debate amid commotion, he added. The AAP leader demanded that the assembly session should have been convened for at least 15 days to discuss the problems of Punjab with an open mind and the session telecast live on channels. Box AAP to gherao CM’s residence on Nov 13 Cheema said AAP will gherao the official residence of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh on November 13, because the Channi government has ignored the future issues of the state, including giving government job to deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s son-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-achievement-by-cong-in-special-assembly-session-aap/articleshow/87674885.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC transfers murder case to CID after wife alleges police inaction||Nagpur: After a woman moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court complaining about Mouda police’s inaction in investigating the murder of her husband, the HC transferred the probe to State Criminal Investigation Department (CID). “In our considered opinion, there should have been a fair investigation in this matter. We are of the view that whatever investigation is done, is not at all satisfactory. It is not made with the intention to find out the truth, but obviously to dilute the gravity of the accused’s act. Thus, we are inclined to hand over the entire case for fresh investigation to CID,” a division bench comprising justices MS Sonak and Pushpa Ganediwala said. While directing the Mouda police to hand over the case papers to CID, the bench said having regard to the chronology of the events, as are discernible from the case diary and from the petitioner’s contentions, there should be a fair and impartial investigation into the suspicious death of the deceased. “The police case diary shows statements of many witnesses that the accused went to the deceased’s house with sticks in his search. In clear words, they gave threats to the petitioner to kill the deceased. There were injuries on the dead body of the deceased,” the HC said. After petitioner Rajni Wakde’s husband’s body was found in the river near their home at Dhanla village in Mouda, she lodged a police complaint against accused persons – Rajendra and Pranay Rajgire, and Harshad Bawne, accusing them of killing him. However, after the Mouda police failed to register an offence against accused for murder under Section 302, she approached the judiciary’s doors through counsel Firdos Mirza and Akash Moon. She contended that the police were diverting the investigations in wrong direction to defeat the ends of justice. She also blamed them for fabricating her statements and failed to arrest main accused Rajendra. The HC noted that the petitioner’s husband had been missing since September 7 and his body was found the next day in suspicious circumstances. Moreover, his vehicle was found in a substantially damaged condition. “There is absolutely nothing in the case diary about the investigation about the damaged vehicle. The petitioner noticed several injuries on husband’s dead body. It appears that the investigation officer did not find it necessary to investigate the cause for such injuries. The statements of alleged eyewitnesses, as per the petitioner, appear to have not been recorded deliberately,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-transfers-murder-case-to-cid-after-wife-alleges-police-inaction/articleshow/87674883.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sitaram Kunte may not get extension as chief secretary||MUMBAI: With less than a fortnight left for retirement of chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, hectic lobbying is on. Kunte may not get an extension as his predecessor Sanjay Kumar did not ask for one, but immediately after retirement, he was appointed to lead Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. In Kunte’s case, immediate appointment on a state-run corporation or board appears difficult as there is no vacancy. Kunte will have to wait till February-end for the retirement of chief services commissioner Swadheen Kahsatriya. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should do away with granting extensions to chief secretaries as it does not serve any purpose and results in injustice for others,’’ a senior bureaucrat said. The bureaucrat said in view of bitter relations between state government and NDA government, it may not approve the proposal for Kunte’s extension. Kunte is followed by Shyamlal Goyal, who is on central deputation, additional chief secretary (school education) Vandana Krishna (planning) and ACS Devashish Chakrabarty, belonging to 1985 batch, additional chief secretary (home) Manukumar Srivastava, ACS Jayashree Mukherjee, both 1986 batch, ACS (services) Sujata Saunik, ACS Ashwani Kumar and ACS Manoj Saunik, all 1987 batch. The bureaucrat said Saunik is emerging as the front-runner. If chosen, she will be the first woman officer to lead the bureaucracy. After the retirement of Sumit Mullick, there was an opportunity for the appointment of Medha Gadgil, an IAS officer of the 1983 batch, as CS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sitaram-kunte-may-not-get-extension-as-chief-secy/articleshow/87674059.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Vadodara||Price difference lures MP, Raj vehicles to fill fuel in Gujarat||Vadodara: With significant difference in fuel prices between Gujarat and neighbouring states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, many people have started fuelling their vehicles at petrol pumps located on the state borders. Differences in prices of petrol, diesel and CNG have been evident for quite sometime now, but the significant difference witnessed after the recent revision has led vehicle owners to make a beeline at fuel stations in Dahod. Besides prices of diesel sold in large quantities on highways, prices of petrol and CNG differ significantly. Transporters have been filling diesel in their trucks regularly in petrol pumps on the state borders in Dahod, but now even passenger vehicles and two-wheelers too are following suit. Ketan Patel, who owns a petrol pump in Jhalod located close to Rajasthan border, said that around 100 to 150 vehicles from Rajasthan fill petrol at his petrol pump. “The difference in prices is significant. Many visit Jhalod regularly to buy fuel here,” said Ketan. Zulfikar Tena, who owns a petrol pump on the Ahmedabad-Indore highway in Dahod said, that the sale of CNG has jumped significantly at his establishment. “The rise in sales is of around 1,000kg. The price of CNG is around Rs 65 per kg in Dahod and around 76 per kg in MP. Several vehicles prefer filling in Gujarat due to this,” he said. Owners point out that since long commercial vehicles that have to cross the Gujarat border prefer getting diesel in Gujarat. “Our diesel prices have been on the lower side. A significant percentage of our sales is in vehicles from Rajasthan. Now, some rise is seen in petrol and CNG,” said Jyoti Patel who has a petrol pump on the Jhalod bypass. In the past when difference in diesel prices was significant between MP and Gujarat, petrol pumps on the Gujarat-MP border in Chhota Udepur had put up boards and banners asking vehicles to get fuelled there as rates were cheaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/price-difference-lures-mp-raj-vehicles-to-fill-fuel-in-gujarat/articleshow/87674657.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Top Maoist leader carrying Rs 1 crore bounty arrested||RANCHI: In one of its biggest achievements in the fight against the Maoists, the Jharkhand Police arrested CPI (Maoist) politburo member Kisan da alias Prashant Bose, who carries a reward of Rs 1 crore, on Friday from Seraikela district. Bose, now in his mid-70s, has been a key Maoist ideologue and was a signatory to the merger of the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI), which was operating in north India, and the CPIML (People’s War), active in south India, in September 2004, leading to the formation of CPI (Maoist). It was after this merger that the ultra Leftist movement grew stronger and fiercer, creating a Red corridor running from north to south through the central parts of the country. DGP Niraj Sinha, however, said a few people have been detained on suspicion, but their identity is being verified. “We can confirm only when the identity is established,” he said. According to highly placed sources in the police, Bose along with his wife Sheela Marandi and two others were intercepted along with the vehicle they were travelling in and taken into custody near Kandra in Saraikela-Kharsawan district. The sources said the arrest was made at a check post in the Kandra area while Bose and the group were reportedly returning from the Parasnath Hills in a Scorpio vehicle. The district police along with the intelligence bureau personnel were involved in the operation. It is learnt that police are interrogating Bose and his wife in Ranchi at present. Bose, who went by several aliases, was considered the second man in the present-day hierarchy of the CPI (Maoist) and headed the eastern regional bureau of the outfit. His wife, Sheela Marandi, commonly known as Sheela Didi, was recently elevated as a central committee member in the organization. She, however, did not carry any bounty as she was arrested and was out on bail recently. It may be stated that Bose is one among the four Maoists of Jharkhand who carry a reward of Rs 1 crore. The others are PBM Misir Besra and central committee members (of CPI-Maoist) Asim Mandal and Anal Da. Bose has been active in Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. He is said to be the key accused in around 100 extremist-related violent acts in different states. Several other states have also announced rewards on him. Police have been looking for Bose for the last several decades. He was reported to be present at Jhumra, Parasnath, Saranda forest and Burha Pahar at different periods. Even though police conducted operations, he had managed to escape the police net. Bose is a native of Jadavpur in 24 Paragana district of West Bengal. He has become disabled after suffering a heart attack. Police sources confirmed that he was not keeping well and was physically incapacitated. “He was senior to Sudhakar, another Maoist politburo member who surrendered in Telangana in 2019,” said one of the police officers, admitting that his arrest is a blow to the ideology and morale of the banned outfit. The sources also said he went to jail for the last time in the late 1970s during the emergency and came out in 1978. Thereafter, he has been involved in the ultra-leftist movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cpi-maoist-leader-kishan-da-wife-held/articleshow/87673846.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

After the amendments, pension will be available universally to all eligible people with two exclusion categories. A person of 60 years of age, any specially-abled person or widow above the age of 18 years and those entitled to pension under any other category will now be excluded only if the beneficiary or an immediate family member is an income tax payee or if the beneficiary or family member is a permanent employee of the state, Centre or public-sector undertaking. The amendments have been introduced in centrally sponsored pension schemes under the National Social Assistance Programme and social security pension schemes operated under the state plan. In another decision, the council of ministers sanctioned Rs 636 crore for bolstering health infrastructure to combat Covid-19. The ministerial council’s approval will pave the way for commissioning new Covid-19 testing centres and state-of-the-art Covid-19 paediatric wards in rural areas. The 11-member cabinet also approved a new Mukhyamantri Swasthya Sahayata Yojana. The scheme will provide one-time financial grant to people from SC, ST and OBC communities if they lose their capabilities to earn their livelihood due to ailments. Senior citizens will get one-time benefit up to Rs 10,000 while those below 60 years will get benefits up to Rs 5,000. The cabinet also gave its approval to the state department of school education and literacy’s proposal to provide free textbooks to students of class 9 and 10 in all government schools. It also approved a proposal to provide bicycles to all government school students. Earlier, the money for cycles were provided to schoolchildren through direct-benefit transfers. In another decisions, the cabinet approved a proposal to extend the contract of all contractual teachers in government schools till July 7, 2022 and extended the service period of the doctors in state health services who are superannuating by March next year by another six months. The cabinet also approved a proposal to hike the dearness allowances of state government employees by 7% and sanctioned the inclusion of 64 lakh beneficiaries in the state-sponsored Sona Sobhran Dhoti Saree Scheme. It also gave its nod to the amending of 14 regulations of different departments, including department of industries, personnel, department of animal husbandry and dairy development, commercial taxes and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-govt-introduces-universal-pension-scheme/articleshow/87673969.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The Congress legislative party on Friday met under its leader Alamgir Alam and state chief Rajesh Thakur in Dhurwa. Several lawmakers used the platform to point out that the poll promises made in the party’s 2019 election manifesto were yet to be fulfilled. Mahgama MLA Deepika Pandey Singh submitted a charter of demands to Alam where she demanded that the government must slash VAT to 17% from 22%. “The government’s stand on 27% reservation for OBC is still not clear. It is also unjust to omit Bhojpuri, Maghi and Angika from the recruitment examinations,” Singh wrote in her demand charter. The lawmakers also demanded that the government must formulate a clear regulation for sand mining and fulfill its promise of providing 50% reservation to women in all government vacancies.

---||Ranchi||PUCL seeks inquiry into custodial death||RANCHI: The People Union for Civil Liberties has demanded a judicial probe into the custodial death of one Dhaneshwar Mehta, who was arrested, allegedly without any warrant, on August 19 and was not provided with medical care after his condition deteriorated. The state unit of PUCL, that conducted a fact-finding mission over the last two months by speaking to the aggrieved family, eyewitnesses, police and excise department officials, expressed surprise that the family members of Mehta were compelled to foot the medical bills of the hospital, despite the fact that excise department admitted to have taken him into custody. According to the five-member fact-finding team, Mehta was taken into custody by excise officials, a few in plainclothes at 7.30am on August 19 while he was returning from the dairy with his wife Gita Devi. His wife told PUCL that no warrant was shown, nor did the officials say why he was being taken into custody. “Claiming to be excise department officials they later said Mehta is involved in illegal liquor trade,” Gita told the team. “There’s something fishy in the matter. The family members have claimed that the excise department officials did not produce any warrant while taking Mehta into custody, indicating that it could be illegal detention. Moreover, they did not pay the bills at the hospital indicating that they were not in a mood to convert the detention into arrest. But once the video of policemen carrying an unconscious Mehta went viral, they had to admit that he had been arrested” said Arwind Avinash, a member of the PUCL fact-finding team. Mehta complained of ill health, but was locked up in a room of the excise department till he fell unconscious around 4pm. He was then taken to Sadar hospital around 5pm. It was then when Kundan Kumar, his neighbour, shot a video of Mehta being carried out of the room for hospital. At Sadar hospital, doctors referred Mehta to Rims from where the doctors diagnosed him with cardiac arrest but refused to admit him citing non-availability of beds. On the insistence of his family, he was taken to Medica Hospital around 9pm where the hospital asked for an advance payment of Rs 20,000. “It was finally arranged by the family members and treatment began but he died the next day at 11am,” the report said. Ultimately to receive the body, the family had to clear the entire amount Rs 73,759 on August 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pucl-seeks-inquiry-into-custodial-death/articleshow/87673641.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The AISSF served the notice to Ranaut through its counsel Diwakar Upadhyay. The president of the unit, Satnam Singh Gambhir, said, “Either Kangana tenders an unconditional apology to the country within 15 days or we would file a complaint in the Jharkhand high court, seeking penal action against her.” Notably, the Padma Shri award-winning actor had said that the Freedom gained in 1947 was a “bheekh” while real Independence was attained in 2014. “Her statement is an insult to millions of freedom struggle heroes who made the supreme sacrifice for the liberation of the country from British colonial rule,” Gambhir added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/students-assn-serves-notice-to-kangana/articleshow/87673896.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Gaurav Diwas aimed only at BJP’s electoral gains: JMM||RANCHI: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Friday criticised the decision to observe Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas and claimed that the Centre’s announcement was aimed only at the BJP’s electoral gains and quell the growing dissent in the SC, ST and OBC communities. “Ironically, the Centre is observing Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas to honour the tribal freedom fighters while it is destroying their villages in Jharkhand in the name of development,” JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya’s reference was to Chemo and Saliya villages in Latehar which may get submerged once the Mandal Dam’s construction is complete. The villages were home to tribal freedom fighters Nilamber and Pitamber. Mandal Dam’s construction was kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019. “If the Centre is truly concerned about the honour of the tribal communities, then it must pass Sarna Code. The Centre should also acknowledge the tea tribes of Assam as members of the ST community and give IIT status to Sindri’s Birsa Institute of Technology,” Bhattacharya added. JMM also alleged that the erstwhile BJP-led government under former chief minister Raghubar Das had diverted the funds received from the Centre under the Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) to organise the Momentum Jharkhand Global Investors’ Summit in 2017 and spend lavishly on the state government’s advertisement blitz. “The BJP suddenly became concerned about the honour and dignity of the tribal people as election season started approaching. But will it clarify why the Centre did not implement the PESA law and provisions of the fifth and sixth schedule of the Constitution in letter and spirit?” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gaurav-diwas-aimed-only-at-bjps-electoral-gains-jmm/articleshow/87673884.cms||---

As winter progresses, the number of migratory birds will increase in coming weeks, bird experts said. Koderma-based Satya Prakash, state coordinator of the Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN), said, “The temperature has already dipped drastically post Durga Puja in most parts of the state as a result of which migratory birds are landing in the wetlands. As of now, some regular migratory species such as rudy shelduck, grey wag tail, whitewag tail have been spotted in Koderma and a few other districts. By November end and early December, there will be massive surge in their numbers,” he said. SSGoswami, an avid bird watcher, based in Hazaribag, agreed, “Besides the routine migratory birds which come every year, it will be interesting to see if the number of new species or any endangered ones resurface this time.” From next week, they will formally begin tracing and tracking to evaluate the trend, he added. According to the last formal Asian waterbird census in 2018 jointly by the state forest department and IBCN, close to 52,000 birds had visited Jharkhand during the winter months. It included 73 species of wetlands, 59 species of water bird, 28 species of resident bird, 12 endangered species among others. Thereafter, no formal survey could be done. Prakash, however, said with Covid-19 on the wane, they will coordinate with the forest department this year for a formal survey. “Some of the threatened bird species that we could spot then included Black-bellied Tern, Oriental White Ibis, Ferruginous Pochard, River Lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii), Black-necked Stork, Western Marsh Harrier among others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/with-dip-in-temp-winged-guests-fly-down-to-state-more-likely-to-arrive-in-coming-weeks/articleshow/87673999.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Using a pencil to sketch, the young boy brings out sceneries live on paper. Like Sameer, his friend Anil (name changed), aged 17, also etches out beautiful landscapes. Pictures drawn by Sameer and Anil were put on display in an art exhibition organised by the State Legal Services Authority under the aegis of Jharkhand Legal Services Authority (JHALSA) here on Friday. Both Sameer and Anil are not children trained in art, but are lodged in the Child Observation Home in Khunti. Several other paintings by observation home inmates have been put up on display at the exhibition organised in the White Hall of the Jharkhand High Court. The exhibition was inaugurated by High Court Legal Services Committee chairman Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad. The exhibition is part of the programme launched by the National Legal Services Authority nationwide on October 2 by President Ramnath Kovind. The programme will conclude on November 14 and has been designed to spread legal awareness across the country, said JHALSA member secretary Muhammad Shakir. The painting drawn by Anil depicts a village scene with small thatched huts with a chopper flying over it. The pencil sketch with light and dark shades makes one wonder how a child can express so much on paper, Shakir added. Khunti probation officer Ashish Ranjan told the TOI that the boys are involved in a case of kidnapping and murder and are in detention since January 2020. Both the boys paint in their free time and have not received any formal training, Ranjan said. The White Hall of the High Court was lined up with stalls put up by the welfare department, UNICEF, Child Helpline, Association for Advocacy And Legal Initiatives Trust, an NGO working for the right of individuals who wish to marry against the norms prefixed by caste, religion and society at large. The stall put up by the Child Observation Home at Dumardagga in the capital had also laid out paper packets and small diyas made by inmates of the observation home. Diyas with mandala designs and colourful patterns were put up for sale in the exhibition. High Court advocate Satish Kesri visiting the exhibition applauded the efforts of the children in the observation homes. “There is so much of unharnessed talent in these children. It is very unfortunate that they have crossed the line set by law. I hope they come back on track and do something productive in their lives,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sketches-by-observation-home-inmates-adorn-walls-of-hc-hall/articleshow/87673915.cms||---

Ministries on same page||NEW DELHI: As part of the ongoing review of provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985, a consensus has emerged among key departments of the ministries concerned on decriminalising personal consumption involving users and dependents who are caught with small quantities of drugs. In such cases, it was felt, the suggestions under study call for a focus on putting compulsory de-addiction and rehabilitation programmes as a solution rather than stronger penalties. Sources said discussions at a meeting held earlier in the week saw representatives from various departments dwell on changes required in the law to deal with drug-dependent users caught with small quantities of drugs. The consensus on taking the decriminalisation approach towards such users and the proposed changes in the existing law are expected to take a formal shape in the coming days. The department of revenue of the finance ministry is examining amendments to the stringent law which governs the illegal drugs trade and seizures, with provisions that impose non-negotiable jail sentences and heavy fines. As part of the exercise, the finance ministry, which governs NDPS Act, had recently sought the opinion of individual ministries that are stakeholders in the debate. The ministries of social justice and empowerment, home and health are involved in battling the drug menace. Emphasising that users and dependents caught with small quantities of drugs and their families should be treated as “victims” and not culprits of substance abuse, the ministry of social justice in its recommendations for modifications to the NDPS Act had called for compulsory treatment and rehabilitation instead of jail terms and penalties for such users. The social justice ministry had suggested modifications that such users should be referred to a mandatory de-addiction and rehabilitation facility for a period of 30 days after which they may also be made to provide mandatory community service for one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/decriminalising-personal-drug-use-ministries-on-same-page/articleshow/87676272.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Namaz sites come down by nearly 50%, but protests continue||GURUGRAM: Namaz sites in the city were down by almost half as Friday prayers were read at only 20 of the 37 originally designated spots. However, the protests, which have been organised every Friday over the last few weeks, continued as usual. This time, a group of locals landed up at a prayer site at Sirhaul village in Sector 18 on the Gurugram-Delhi border and demanded a stop to namaz being conducted there. In the 19 other places, namaz passed off peacefully. No prayers were offered at the disputed sites in sectors 47 and 12A, where a Govardhan Puja was organised by some groups last Friday. Sirhaul Mod was one of the 20 public places that were recently identified by a committee where namaz would be held. However, due to unavailability of space at the intersection, the namaz site was shifted to a park, which was opposed by some residents, who assembled in the area with the tricolour and shouted slogans. “We are not opposed to namaz but it should not be offered at a public place. They (members of the Muslim community) should go to the mosque. The park is a public space and people from nearby areas, including those working in companies located close by, visit it all day. Religious activities should not be organised in such public places,” said Sudhir Yadav, a resident of Sirhaul. He added that people in the village, including many Muslims, were living in harmony. Rajiv Mittal of Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti said though the outfit had given a call to oppose namaz in public places, locals were coming out to protest on their own. “Namaz should be offered at mosques and idgahs. They (Muslims) should apply for land if there aren’t enough mosques,” he added. Altaf Ahmad, co-founder of Gurugram Muslim Council and Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, said, “Right-wing groups had installed RSS wing Muslim Rashtriya Manch as so-called representatives of Muslims in Gurugram and conveniently reduced the number of places for Friday prayers.” Ahmad added that unless the government allocated land for mosques so that the community could offer prayers “with dignity”, the disruptions would continue. Khurshid Rajaka, chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch and member of Haryana Waqf Board, said the imams, in consultation with authorities, had identified the places for namaz. “Establishing peace, not politics, should be the priority,” he said, adding that if land is needed for construction of mosques, people should approach the waqf board. A district administration official said if locals are opposed to namaz at a particular site, then it will be changed. “Namaz will be offered at places where residents have no objection. Maintaining law and order is our priority,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/namaz-sites-come-down-by-nearly-50-but-protests-continue/articleshow/87675088.cms||Bagish Jha
---||India||Members object to tweaks, JPC data bill report stalled||NEW DELHI: The joint parliamentary committee on Personal Data Protection Bill was unable to adopt its draft report on Friday as panel chair P P Chaudhary sought to insert last-minute amendments that did away with the clauses on social media platforms on grounds that they were covered under the new IT rules. The move ran into vehement protests by opposition members, including BJD’s Bhartruhari Mahtab and Amar Patnaik, Congress’ Manish Tewari, Jairam Ramesh and Gaurav Gogoi, and even BJP’s Satya Pal Singh, who said there is an urgent need for a law on the subject. Key objections raised by MPs pertained to a bid to “dilute” the penalty clause that fixes 2% and 4% of global incomes of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, if they are found in violation of privacy laws. The last-minute amendments, sources said, sought to bring this down to a standard sum of Rs 10-15 crore, which led to heated exchanges between some members who alleged that the government was attempting to dilute the penalty clause following pressure from the Big Tech. They said the social media firms pressured the government to tone down the applicable penalties. The JPC has seen discussion on whether social media can be merely termed as a platform or aggregator or is in fact a "publisher" with the same responsibilities as a publication. Chaudhary did argue that the IT guidelines were not formulated when the panel had taken up the matter but MPs felt there is a need for a specific law and the data bill presents an excellent opportunity given that there was unanimity in the panel over the need for Big Tech to be more accountable. After considerable discussion during which Chaudhary said the penalty clause was not very practical, it was decided that a fresh draft of the committee’s report will be circulated by November 18 and the committee will meet again on November 22 to consider the bill afresh. Sources said MPs also demanded that the issue of the IT rules covering accountability of social media platforms should be specifically written into the JPC’s report if this was the argument Chaudhary wanted the committee to consider. Deliberations also saw members oppose the contentious clause 35 of the draft data protection bill, which grants blanket exemption to the government and its agencies from complying with any and all provisions of the PDP bill. Members argued that government should only be exempted under a "just, fair, reasonable and proportionate procedure", and that exemption should only be exercised in "exceptional" cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/members-object-to-tweaks-jpc-data-bill-report-stalled/articleshow/87676333.cms||Swati Mathur

Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Friday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 4.5%, slightly higher than the 4.4% in the previous month and below the 7.6% recorded in October 2020. Urban inflation was at 5% while rural inflation slowed to a 10-month low of 4.1%. Core inflation (which is minus food and fuel) remained sticky at 6.1% in October, above the 5.9% in the previous month. Prices of vegetables fell 19.4% during the month while oils and fats rose 33.5% during the month. “Measures such as cut in excise duty on fuel, imposition of stock limits and waiver of basic import duty on edible oils are expected to restrict domestic inflation despite soaring prices of fuel and edible oils in the global markets. The inflation in the services sector is likely to remain elevated as momentum in vaccination continues and mobility rebounds to the pre-pandemic level,” Care Ratings said in a note. Separate data released by the NSO showed the index of industrial production (IIP) rose an annual 3.1% in September, lower than the 11.9% in the previous month and above the 1% recorded in September 2020. The manufacturing sector grew 2.7% in September compared to 0.4% in the year earlier month while mining grew 8.6%. The electricity sector rose 0.9% in September, lower than the 4.9% recorded in September 2020. The capital goods sector, seen as a barometer of industrial activity, rose 1.3% compared to a contraction of 1.2% in the year earlier month. “India’s IIP growth slipped to a 7-month low of 3.1% in September 21 with an adverse base and sequential contraction in activity both at play. The month was a testimony to supply side disruptions weighing on production, with the downside thankfully getting capped by ahead of festive season led ramp up in consumer durables sector,” according research firm QuantEco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-inflation-up-at-4-5-in-october-iip-slows-in-september/articleshow/87676352.cms||---

Goyal, who was detained on the basis of a look out notice pending against him, and IREO are facing a multi-agency probe for foreign direct investments (FDIs) worth Rs 7,300 crore that came to at least two dozen companies from a suspicious address located at Port Louis in Mauritius. 15 of these companies, registered at two identical addresses in New Delhi, were found linked to IREO. The probe against suspicious FDI inflows into IREO began in early 2010 during the UPA-2 regime. The income tax department conducted a series of searches on related entities on October 19, 2010. Goyal, a close relative of BJP’s Sudhanshu Mittal, had then claimed that IREO is a private equity fund with investors based in different continents. Mittal had distanced himself from IREO and told TOI that neither he nor Goyal had any equity in any of the IREO group companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-continues-quizzing-ireo-promoter-in-laundering-case/articleshow/87676390.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Good diagnostics, healthcare prompting better reportage of cancer, say experts||PANAJI: While the incidence of cancers in Goa appears to be high over the past few years, the jury is out on whether the numbers are in fact alarming. Experts handling cancer patients say the feared disease might be highlighted because Goa has better reportage than other states even as it lacks specific studies and data collection. “Goa’s numbers will have to be seen in the light of age standardisation and population. We are not witnessing an increased incidence of cancer, but the population is small. This is unlike Maharashtra or Karnataka because both those states are large,” gastroenterologist Dr Harish Peshwe, said. “Goa has much better healthcare facilities than other states and doctors are also able to pick up cases of cancer.” The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers has been more prevalent among elderly people, who comprise a significant portion of the state’s population. As per Census 2011, 11.2 % of Goa’s population was 60 years of age and above. While breast cancer tops the overall list, cancers of the colon, liver and stomach region — which are common in Goa — are mostly found in people who are 50 or 60 years and above. “Goa is a highly literate state and people have better access to healthcare facilities, so cases do get reported. I really do not know if the incidence of cancer is rising or if diagnostic facilities are getting better. But if one goes back 30-40 years and if somebody had died of lung cancer, people would probably say he died of a heart attack. Apart from his family or friends, nobody would know the real cause of his death. This, however, is no more the case,” Dr Eugune Rent, an oncologist, said. Senior gastroenterologist and endoscopist Dr Jose Alvares contended that the ‘westernised’ diet of the people of Goa has prompted the advent of western diseases as well. “The commonest cancer I see is that of the colon. Increased fat in the food, whether you are a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian, is a risk factor. People who work long night shifts for a prolonged period are also exposed to the risk of developing colon or breast cancer.” The problem for India’s smallest state is that it does not have comprehensive data on the incidence of cancers. “Data has not been collected at the central source. A trend can be gauged when we exchange notes with other doctors but this cannot be a reliable method as some biases would factor in,” head and neck surgical oncologist Dr Pawan Rane, said. While Rent said besides better diagnostic facilities and awareness among people about the disease is high, partly due to information dissemination on social media platforms, Rane said he has been seeing more cancers of the mouth and tongue because of tobacco consumption or smoking among the youth. “At the end of the day, cancers are the manifestation of the mutation process, and as mutation builds up, the incidence of cancers will also rise. Certain cancers like those of the pancreas, liver, colon and oesophagus are diseases of advancing age. Goa has a significant population that is 60-plus,” Peshwe said. He added that while doctors operate even on 70- and 80-year-old cancer patients in Goa, individuals above 60-70 years in other states are unlikely to withstand a surgical procedure “as they are not as well nourished as their counterparts in Goa”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/experts-good-diagnostics-healthcare-prompting-better-reportage-of-cancer/articleshow/87674721.cms||---

The revamped startup policy, which has been in the works since early 2020, aims to have at least 500 startups in Goa over the next three years and provide employment to at least 6,000 Goans. Interestingly, rather than pursue the creation of new startups in Goa, the department of information and technology hopes to convince existing startups and entrepreneurs from other parts of the country to shift their operations to Goa. “All startups registered under the Startup Policy 2017 shall continue to be registered under the Startup Policy 2021. All incentive applications submitted on or before September 30 shall be processed,” said director of information and technology Ankita Anand. She also said that all registered startups will be allowed to operate round the clock. “An intimation from the startup promotion cell (SPC) will be issued to the panchayats and local bodies intimating them on the startups certified to operate 24x7,” Anand said. The new policy hopes that the state’s cosmopolitan culture, quality manpower, clean environment and qualify of life will convince entrepreneurs to make it their base. “It is towards this objective that this new Goa Startup Policy has been drafted. While the government is committed to promoting entrepreneurs from Goa and generating employment for Goans, it is equally committed to inviting the best entrepreneurial talent, the brightest innovative minds, and startup ecosystem enablers like incubators, accelerators and investors from outside Goa in order to build a robust startup ecosystem within the state,” the IT director said. The state is also offering exemptions beyond the scope of the policy on a case-to-case basis for startups operating in the domains of smart cities, urban management, mining, tourism and hospitality, gaming, waste management, renewable energy, education, healthcare, communication, and entertainment. The earlier startup policy lapsed in 2020 and was extended two times for six months each till September 30. Stakeholders and beneficiaries of the policy incentives have urged the department to implement the Goa Startup Policy 2021 in a time-bound manner with clear guidelines and clarity on the rollout of the incentives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-works-since-2020-govt-notifies-new-startup-policy/articleshow/87674767.cms||---

While the physics paper will be held in the morning half on May 11, the chemistry paper will be conducted in the second half of the same day. The mathematics test will be held on the morning of May 12. The GCET is conducted based on the Class XII state board syllabus. For the 2021-22 session, due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, GCET was conducted only in the second week of July, much later than its usual schedule in May. This delayed the entire admission process for the current academic year, with only one round of admissions for engineering and pharmacy completed so far. With the 2021-22 academic cycle delayed, there are likely to be changes in the next academic cycle as well. Around 3,000 students appear for GCET each year for entry to engineering and pharmacy degree seats. Admissions to medicine, dentistry, homeopathy, ayurveda, nursing and five allied health programme degree seats in Goa are held based on the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) (UG). Similarly, admissions to the architecture programme are held through the National Aptitude Test in Architecture. The GCET consists of an objective type question paper of 75 marks each, with no negative marking. It is conducted by the state directorate of technical education with the help of a team from IIT Bombay.

Khurshid’s book is in controversy for comparing Hindutva forces to Islamic terrorist outfits in a chapter titled ‘The Saffron Sky’. “Congress leaders know nothing else but to slur Hindutva. They don’t let go of any opportunity to divide Hindus into castes, and to divide our country. Wasn’t Rahul Gandhi the first to go to those who said ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’? Salman Khurshid is promoting the same agenda through his book,” Mishra said. Police to probe complaints against Khurshid’s remark: Complaints lodged by advocate Vivek Garg and Naveen Jindal against Salman Khurshid for allegedly comparing Hindutva with ISIS and terrorism have been transferred to the crime branch for further inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mp-mantri-says-khurshid-book-to-be-banned-for-divisive-agenda/articleshow/87676460.cms||---

Work had started in the morning and debris, plastic and other waste was being dumped for road expansion, encroaching into a water body on the north-eastern side of the highway, causing blockage of the inlet that takes tidal water from the Mandovi to the vast khazan land in Merces and Santa Cruz on the highway’s western side, including the periphery of KTC terminus. Noticing the haphazard work, some villagers questioned the site supervisor and workers, but work continued for a few hours. By 3pm, some villagers from Merces and nearby areas gathered at the spot. Santa Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes too arrived and grilled the company officials and demanded stoppage of the work. PWD officials also arrived on the scene and finally, officials of the company relented and stopped the work. “If the inlet had been reclaimed, and the flow of water across the highway stopped, it would have caused massive flooding of the road and vast areas on either side,” a senior resident of Merces Jose Carmino Joao said. “It is senseless to reclaim the area without ascertaining the consequences as it would have submerged the highway and stopped flow of traffic itself,” Merces biodiversity management committee member Michael Dias said. Earth moving machinery was later moved to the site and clearing of debris. to restore it to its earlier state was in progress till late Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/merces-santa-cruz-locals-stop-land-filling-of-inlet/articleshow/87674829.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: TRS ups the ante on paddy row, K T Rama Rao takes aim at Centre||HYDERABAD: Stepping up its attack on the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, the ruling TRS on Friday held protests across Telangana against the Centre's alleged refusal to procure paddy from the state during the 'yasangi' (summer) crop. TRS working president and municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao, other ministers and scores of party functionaries participated in the protests demanding that the Centre procure the paddy. KTR who led the dharna in his assembly constituency Sircilla, trained his guns on Telangana BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar calling him 'thondi Sanjay' (unfair Sanjay) and a mad man. Rama Rao said: "On one hand, the Centre is discouraging farmers to cultivate paddy in the coming rabi season and on the other, Sanjay is asking farmers to go for paddy cutivation in the state. He alleged that the NDA government at the Centre was adopting double standards on the paddy issue. Centre is buying paddy from Punjab while denying the same to Telangana. "Agriculture is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The Centre has to procure paddy from states. The NDA government is creating problems after the Telangana government started creating records in paddy production for the past six years," KTR said. Along with KTR, several ministers, MPs, MLA, MLCs took part in protest in respective districts and assembly constituencies. At some places, TRS leaders even resorted to road blockades. KTR urged the farmers to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi en masse to purchase raw paddy from Telangana. He said TRS will expose the BJP on this issue. "TRS means Telangana Rashtra Samithi, but it is also Telangana Rythu Samithi too. We won't leave the saffron party till it announces procurement of paddy from farmers," the minister said. KTR said Telangana has become a role model for many states. He said as many as 11 states and the Centre were implementing schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Mission Bhagiratha. Health minister T Harish Rao, who took part in the dharna in Siddipet, said TRS was staging dharnas for protecting the interests of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-trs-ups-the-ante-on-paddy-row-k-t-rama-rao-takes-aim-at-centre/articleshow/87676463.cms||Koride Mahesh

The regulatory commission has also asked all the local bodies and government departments to clear their dues within two weeks to avoid disconnection of services. In a letter to the energy secretary and the CMDs of discoms, the APERC said that the commission has examined the data submitted by the discoms with regard to the pending dues towards tariff subsidy from the government, and consumption charges from the local bodies and government departments. "It is observed that though there is a reduction of due amounts from Rs 16,568.21 crore to Rs 15474.43 crore in respect of tariff subsidy, the consumption dues from local bodies and government departments have increased from Rs 8391.45 crore to Rs 9783.37 crore as of September 30, 2021 since March 2021. The situation looks alarming, to say the least, and the very survival of the discoms is at stake which, if not addressed, will also adversely impact the consumers in the state," said the ERC. It further said that it was really unfortunate that discoms have not realised the seriousness of the situation and were not making their best efforts to collect the dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/clear-all-discom-dues-aperc-tells-andhra-pradesh-govt/articleshow/87676474.cms||Samdani MN

This also means that all the trains will halt at all the designated stations as it was before the pandemic. The normal train operations were discontinued from March 25 after the lockdown was imposed. Though the railway operations were restored partially, all trains were operated as “special” trains.

Congress wants the government to withdraw the condition that Konkani and Marathi films will be screened at the forthcoming 52nd edition only if more than four entries are received. Congress also alleged that BJP is using Iffi as a “grazing ground” for karyakartas who are involved in massive scams. Congress media cell chairman Amarnath Panjikar said that Congress is keeping a close watch on the tendering process of Iffi-2021, and already has “preliminary information that there is a huge scam of almost Rs 25 crores” pertaining to the organisation of Iffi-2021. Panjikar accused the BJP government of “converting” the International Film Festival of India into an International Fraud Festival of India. Reacting to the conditions imposed by the Entertainment Society of Goa (ESG), Congress said that even if a single entry comes in for the special Goan category, ESG must screen the film during the official section of Iffi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-have-strong-protests-if-goan-films-not-shown-at-iffi-congress/articleshow/87674893.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal plans resolution to oppose BSF ambit order||Kolkata: Raising the ante against increasing BSF’s operation area from 15km to 50km within the India-Bangladesh border, the Bengal government is likely to move a resolution against the Centre’s order in the state assembly on Tuesday. The Punjab assembly had moved a similar resolution on Thursday. Trinamool will protest in Parliament’s winter session against the Centre’s decision to enhance BSF’s operation area, which it says encroaches on the state’s jurisdiction. The BJP-led Centre had amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50km stretch, instead of 15km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. Bengal parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said the resolution on Tuesday will oppose the Centre’s move because it infringes on the state’s rights, as law and order is a state subject. He felt the Centre was trying to grab the state government’s powers. Sources said several Trinamool MLAs from bordering districts expressed willingness to party chief whip Nirmal Ghosh to take part in the one-hour discussion on Tuesday. MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Trinamool’s leader in Lok Sabha, said the issue would be raised in Parliament as the Narendra Modi government was trying to bulldoze federal structure and increase BSF’s jurisdiction without consulting the states. The party’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, had flagged the issue in the parliamentary committee for home affairs. The matter will be taken up by the committee. Bengal Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury backed the resolution move. He said the state government should make it clear to the Centre that it was unwilling to accept the MHA decision and for this, an assembly resolution was needed. People of bordering districts would not feel safe with BSF’s powers enhanced, he added. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had already opposed the move and written to PM Modi on October 24. “BSF was effectively entering into non-border areas within the state’s territory and thus was violating the BSF Act,” she had written. “The entire territory of West Bengal comprises 88,752 sq km, of which 32,400 sq km will come under the jurisdiction of BSF. It will interfere with the executive power of the state. 37 per cent of the state’s territory will be affected due to the order,” the letter further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-plans-resolution-to-oppose-bsf-ambit-order/articleshow/87675093.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BSF fires at cattle smugglers,2 Bangla men, 1 Indian killed||Cooch Behar/Kolkata: Three persons, including two suspected Bangladeshi nationals and a 35-year-old Indian citizen, died after BSF personnel fired at cattle smugglers on the India-Bangladesh border in Cooch Behar district’s Sitai early on Friday morning. Officials said a jawan too was injured in the incident, which occurred after BSF personnel fired in “self-defence”. The BSF initially said jawans had found two bodies of unknown miscreants between the border fence and the international boundary. State police officials, however, insisted from the morning that a third person — an Indian citizen (Prakash Barman) — had died. BSF officials confirmed the death of an “Indian citizen” several hours later. A few hours after the incident, state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said the government would introduce a resolution in the assembly next Tuesday against the Centre’s move to increase the BSF’s area of operation to 50km within the border from the current 15km. The party would raise the issue in the Lok Sabha’s winter session, Trinamool MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said. Friday’s incident took place at 3am, a few hours before Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla met senior state government officials, including the chief secretary, the home secretary and the director-general of police, in Kolkata, 730km south from the point of the skirmish. Miscreants from Bangladesh were spotted around 2.30am near the fenced border at Sitai’s Satbhandari, BSF officials said. They had set up two devices made of bamboo at two different locations to hoist cattle across the border. Jawans patrolling the area first ordered them to back down and, when this did not work, the jawans used “non-lethal ammunition” to stop them. This enraged the cattle smugglers, who attacked the jawans using sickles, rods and sticks, officials said. The BSF party “fired in the air towards the miscreants... sensing imminent threat to their life”, the spokesperson said. Bodies of two unknown miscreants were found between the border fence and international boundary,” the BSF version added. It was only later on Friday afternoon that the BSF confirmed the third death of an “Indian citizen”. Cooch Behar police officials identified the Indian citizen as the 35-year-old Barman, a resident of Chamta (a village about nine kilometres from Sitai). Some local residents, however, questioned the BSF version. “Why did the BSF not say right at the start that an Indian villager, too, had died?” one of them asked. Dinhata Trinamool MLA Udayan Guha had one more question: “Why was the Indian citizen Barman shot in the head?” The centre must rein in the BSF or there would be bigger tragedies, he added. “No one has the right to gun down Indian citizens. Why is cattle-smuggling continuing unabated despite BSF claims of increased vigil? How can cattle-smuggling take place over a prolonged period without help from a section of BSF officers? Did any deal go wrong, prompting the BSF to open fire today?” MLA Guha, who won a recent bypoll by a record margin of 1.6 lakh votes, asked. Bengal BJP president and Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar, however, went along with the BSF version. “The cattle were not para-dropped in the area. They were being smuggled with the help of local political leaders and a section of administration and police. The BSF has been trying to prevent cross-border smuggling,” Majumdar said. Cooch Behar additional superintendent of police Kumar Sunny Raj said the BSF informed cops that six cattle were recovered. Nearly 40 people were trying to smuggle cattle from India to Bangladesh, according to the BSF complaint.

---||Kolkata||Border issues: Bhalla meets state officials||Kolkata: Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Friday held a meeting with senior state officials to speed up 100% fencing along the Indo-Bangla border, held up in places mostly due to problems of land acquisition. Saying that the work was essential for the country’s security, Bhalla took stock of the fencing work and the related problems at the meeting at Hidco Bhawan, where chief secretary H K Dwivedi, home secretary B P Gopalika and director general police Manoj Malviya were present. According to sources, senior BSF officials also attended it. Bengal shares the longest border with Bangladesh spread over 2,216.7 km, of which 1,638 km is fenced. State officials missed the 2019 deadline of fencing the remaining 579.7 km due to several reasons — difficult terrain, riverine and marshy land, short working season, land acquisition problems, public protests and objections by the Border Guard Bangladesh. Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura have a total 973 km of unfenced border with Bangladesh. The state government assured help to the Centre over land acquisition. Officials said the state was regularly monitoring the progress of work and had sorted out problems across the 107-km stretch of the 289-km stretch having land acquisition glitches. During talks on managing the riverine stretches, Bengal officials were informed that BSF had deployed personnel along with floating Border Outposts and boats were posted in the riverine areas. The issues of infiltration, cross-border terror, cattle smuggling and smuggling of contraband were also discussed at Friday’s meeting. Bhalla sought better management of the integrated check posts and also took feedback on the problems. The powerpoint presentation by the MHA was not seamless though. State officials pointed out that many border areas were wrongly named. The Union home secretary also emphasized beefing up management of integrated check posts at Petrapole, coming just a fortnight after the MHA issued a notification to make this major Indo-Bangla bilateral trade port operational round the clock. Bhalla also talked about the MHA’s plans to set up seven land ports along borders India shares with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The extended jurisdiction of the BSF also came up at the meeting, albeit informally. Bhalla held that the issue should be addressed at the ministerial platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/border-issues-bhalla-meets-state-officials/articleshow/87675117.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pandemic isolation stunting speech skills in kids||KOLKATA: Three-and-half-year-old Akshay had been a bright and happy child, until his parents noticed something amiss last year, six months into the pandemic. The child, a playschool student aged two-and-half then, could not yet speak. His distraught parents sought help from a mental health institute in the city, where it was revealed that sudden isolation from peers and elders in the family, because of the lockdown, had stunted his speech- and language-development skills. With months of speech therapy, play and group therapy, the boy can talk fluently, like others of his age, and has a large group of friends with whom he regularly interacts. Akshay’s case is not an isolated one. Experts across the city said they have seen hundreds of similar cases since the pandemic caused a significant drop in social interaction. “Due to Covid restrictions, there has been a complete lack of interaction with children of the same age and older individuals,” said Minu Budhia, psychotherapist and founder of Caring Minds, where Akshay underwent therapy. “Akshay, like many others, was cut off from play groups, pre-school and playgrounds, where he could have experienced ‘normal’ activities. This resulted in him using only gestures to communicate. He would point at objects or pull his parents’ clothes to get their attention.” Children’s social and language skills develop through interaction with peers and adults, pointed out psychiatrist J Ram. “This has been seriously jeopardized since the onset of the pandemic. Stuck at home, very young children have been forced into online classes, where the interaction is virtual and doesn’t help develop either speech or language skills, leave alone social skills. Parents, too, have been busy working from home and their interaction with children have reduced. As a result, basic skill development has been hindered,” Ram said. Delayed speech is now common among two-to-three-year-old children, said paediatrician Santanu Ray. “Almost a fourth of such children I have treated since last year started talking late or needed speech therapy. Also, disorders like autism and hyperactivity (lack of focus and concentration on tasks) are being detected late, since children are no longer being observed continuously. These would earlier be detected in school,” Ray added. The best — and the only — way of developing speaking and language skills is to talk to peers, which has been denied to children since March 2020, Ram said. “We call it the ‘serve-and-volley’ mechanism, where you talk to a child and the child talks back to you.” Children need to return to group activities soon, felt Budhia. “In Akshay’s case, group therapy sessions provided the essential social environment with children of his age, while speech therapy sessions gave him individualized help. The play therapy sessions used toys, games, action stories, role-playing and interaction with a mental health expert to create a safe space to explore and express his emotions non-verbally,” she said. In normal circumstances, these would have happened naturally without assistance. Experts saw some light at the end of the tunnel, with schools set to reopen on November 16. “But it will be for classes IX to XII. Those aged between three and six need to attend school not only for studies but perhaps more to acquire language and social skills. Children need a stimulating environment to learn social, language and adaptive skills. This lost time can’t be recovered,” said Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-isolation-stunting-speech-skills-in-kids/articleshow/87675391.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Our (Left Front) government had acquired Singur acres under the Land Acquisition Act. Is the state government going to follow those rules?” Chakraborty said here on Friday. The leader wants the government to publish a white paper with project and rehabilitation plan details. A CPM delegation led by Chakraborty later met the bereaved family of local party leader Badal Sheikh, who was allegedly beaten to death on Monday. The leaders claimed Badal was murdered because he hoisted the party flag to mark the November Revolution in Russia. They offered financial aid to his widow. While police have lodged a suo motu murder case over Badal’s death, his family had not filed a complaint till Friday evening. CPM’s Birbhum acting secretary Goutam Ghosh said: “We fear the family is under pressure and is not being able to speak out on the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-demands-white-paper-on-deocha-pachami-coal-project/articleshow/87675203.cms||---

Cherry on the cake was that the vehicle was delivered just around the auspicious period of Navratri! "I could not and did not want to wait for 2.5 months to get the vehicle of my choice. The agent from MP helped me buy the vehicle from the neighbouring state at a small premium amount to cover the transportation cost involved," said Kaneriya. As the semiconductor shortage has intensified, adding to the waiting period for new cars, street-smart Gujaratis who need cars on an urgent basis are not shying from paying a marginal premium to procure the vehicles from other states such as Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, among others. Sunny Moradia, partner in a ceramic manufacturing company, bought a car from Chhattisgarh recently. "I wanted a black coloured car of a certain model which was not readily available and the local dealer quoted a minimum waiting period of three months. I needed the new car in an emergency and decided to check for it outside Gujarat," he said. Similarly, Jayesh Thakor, who works in Gandhinagar and wanted to buy a car for office purposes was surprised to be told he will have to wait for 9-12 months due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. "As I needed the car urgently for work, I contacted a dealer in Chandigarh and got the paperwork done to get the car back to Ahmedabad," said Thakor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-getting-car-fast-from-1000-km-away/articleshow/87676615.cms||Niyati Parikh

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya kant and Hima Kohli had expressed dissatisfaction over pace and quality of SIT probe and told the UP government on November 8 that there was an urgent need to appoint a retired HC judge from outside the state to supervise the probe so as not to mix up evidence in three distinct incidents which took place within a short span of time on October 3. The court had suggested names of former Punjab and Haryana HC judges — Ranjit Singh and Rakesh Kumar Jain — and asked the state to appoint one of them to supervise the probe. When the court gave the option to the state to either make the appointment on its own or under court direction, senior advocate Harish Salve had said UP would do so on its own and that a court direction would not be needed. On Friday, Salve informed the court that he had been able to convince the state government to appoint a retired judge for the task of supervision. “I have convinced them and the appointment will be made by Monday,” he said. The bench adjourned the hearing of the case till Monday. Asked which of the two former judges has been chosen for appointment for supervision of the SIT probe, Salve told TOI that “the decision would be made by Monday and duly informed to the court”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-to-appoint-ex-judge-for-kheri-probe-by-monday/articleshow/87676618.cms||---
