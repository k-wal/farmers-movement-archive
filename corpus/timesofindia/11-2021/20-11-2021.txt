---||Bengaluru||LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2021 attends a health camp organised by Smile Train||Smile Train, the world’s largest cleft care NGO, has amplified its partnership with Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital by investing in a state of the art Operation Theatre (OT) and 3D cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipment with an aim to support safe and best in class cleft treatment for underprivileged patients. The inauguration at India’s first Cleft Leadership Centre was graced by Harnaaz Sandhu, LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2021. Harnaaz said, “Miss Diva Organisation has been associated with Smile Train for a long time and it is my time to take that forward. I believe that it is important for us to spread the awareness that cleft is curable and along with it is important to make the patients feel comfortable. Smile Train has treated more than 6 lakh people with cleft. It is time for people to talk about this, especially those who have been through this and cured, as they need to know it is safe. I believe every smile matters, and their smile is transformed with the cure. Let us spread smiles and awareness together.” The trip for the inauguration also had Harnaaz excited. “This is my first trip to Bengaluru and I was looking forward to it. It is a beautiful city and the people are warm and kind. The city is famous as the Garden City as well as the Silicon Valley of India and I am eager to try out local specialities like masala dosa, idli and vada,” she added. Harnaaz is soon going to represent India at the Miss Universe pageant. “My training for the Miss Universe pageant is going on full fledged. And I am staying calm at the same time as that is the key to success, to stay happy mentally and physically. I am undergoing training sessions for hair, makeup, communication and many other things. I will be flying to Israel soon and I am super excited to make our country proud,” she signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/liva-miss-diva-universe-2021-attends-a-health-camp-organised-by-smile-train/articleshow/87800963.cms||Sunayana Suresh
---||Kolkata||Fried grasshoppers are tasty, but rattlesnakes are boring, says Abhijit Banerjee||In his new avatar as a gourmet cook, Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee has been the flavour of the season. Those used to his work as an economist slicing and dicing data have been treated to delightful visuals of him slicing and dicing onions instead on camera and gracing magazine pages, while holding forth on topics as diverse as Karl Marx and kalonji. Quizzed on how he managed to make it all look so effortless, Abhijit said, “While not exactly on camera, I do this all the time — talking on the phone and chopping onions, without much of a thought.” In a freewheeling chat with CT from Boston, Abhijit was joined by Cheyenne Olivier from France, his family’s au pair for three years who tried out and perfected the recipes that had fuelled Abhijit’s “unlikely ambition of being a cookbook writer”. Cheyenne, who counts Bengali vegetarian cuisine as one of her favourites, has added colour to the Nobel Laureate’s book in the form of illustrations as well. From carrots to crocodile meat, appeasing children to exploring local markets, it was a conversation about all things food. Excerpts: The two of you have been doing a lot of cooking on TV of late. From dal to meat and more. How are you enjoying this stint as celebrity TV chefs?Abhijit Banerjee: This is actually not the first time I am cooking on TV. Some time back I was asked to cook at the JNU canteen and I must admit it was not a great success. CO: Cooking this time was not only fun but extremely easy. Because most of the preparations were done and measurements did not have to be precise. AB: Normal cooking is much more work than what we did on this trip. There are no children under your feet... literally! No other distractions. I didn’t have to think of what to say in my talk tomorrow… Cheyenne also was not busy minding the kids while cooking… you know those are the usual circumstances for us. Abhijit, as someone who has travelled and lived in various parts of the world, how good is your cultural palate tolerance? AB: In America, there is this obsession with eating weird animals. Like rattlesnake or crocodile. All this stuff is boring and not interesting to eat. I have tried it because people say you should eat these in Southern Arizona or Northern Florida. It does nothing for me. I tried fried grasshoppers in China and I liked it very much very much — it was like eating chips, spicy and salt — and the fact that it has protein, I was all for it. It would be great if people would have a lot more insects. There are a lot of insects and they are a great source of protein. In India, people do not get enough protein. There has been a long tradition of eating insects on drier parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra. But it has been suppressed because it is somehow perceived as unclean. I also don’t like tripe. Covid and the lockdown impacted our food choices and changed the way we sourced and cooked food at home. Suddenly everyone was obsessed with food, cooking and sharing on social media and talking about sustainability etc. How did those months affect your relationship with food? AB: When the pandemic first hit us, I was in the US where we don’t really eat out as much. But I was often up at 2 am to find a delivery slot online. You see, there was an obsession with getting things and one would order whatever was available. That imposed a constraint on us while opening up the possibility of making a four-course meal for lunch or a five-course meal for dinner. For the first few months in fact I cooked more than I ever did and better that I ever did as well. And what I have learned was this: cooking with what you have is key. Let me share an example... Once I ended up with nearly 12 kilos of carrots because I paid a hundred dollars to a restaurant supplier for it. I had ordered whatever I could get and ended up with a big bag of carrots. So for the next few days cooking with carrots became critical or else they would go bad. So that was part of the story that other people also had, working with whatever you had, with more time in your hands and less ingredients. It changes the way we think about food. It also exposes you to the fact that there is an enormous supply chain behind what you eat and if that supply chain is disrupted, you end up with 25 pounds of carrots and nothing else. Illustrator Cheyenne Olivier was an au pair for Abhijit Banerjee’s family for three years, during which she tried out his recipes CO: Precisely. At a time when everything crumbled, people held on to food as something that is not only essential but also gives you a lot of pleasure and maybe sensitises you to how food is linked to the environment, economy and even political issues. It showed how much food is embedded in our lives — something intimate that brings pleasure to your everyday life. Did any of the carrot recipes eventually make it to your book Cooking To Save Your Life?AB: Yes it did! Abhijit, you have cooked for a diverse set of people. Who has been the toughest to please?AB: Children! They are candid and not super open-minded about food! The story behind the abstract and geomteric illustrations by Cheyenne CO: I wanted to move away from the over realistic photographs you find in most cookbooks because they are intimidating. When you start cooking and the end result does not look like the photograph you think you may have gone wrong, but it is only because you have perhaps different kinds of material to work with. Every recipe in Cooking To Save Your Life sets up a scene with a particular character and you can almost have a whole story with the character. I used graphic ingredients — square circles, triangles — I chopped them, minced them, cut them to create visual dishes to illustrate the scenes that Abhijhit describes. What Abhijit Banerjee likes to pick up on his trips to Kolkata AB: It may not be entirely legal but I love the Kolai daler bodi (vadi made with urad dal) that you do not get in the US. It is something that you get only in Bengal. It is plain, has a subtle nutty flavour and goes beautifully to a ghonto and is very different from the rich and spicy Punjabi vadis that you get everywhere. And it is part of Bengali vegetarian cuisine which I love. Abhijit’s favourite dishes from IndiaThe Bohra meat soup from western India which also has a Marathi equivalent. Almost like a meat stock that is thickened and spiced up. A masterpiece! From the south of India, I like all the vegetables and stir-fired dishes. And our Brussels sprout recipe is one of them From Bengal, it is the moong dal with cauliflower, which is rich and full of subtle flavours From the north it is the potatoes with seasame seeds that is pure indulgence as it’s an instant pick-me-up with a wonderful combination of sour and bitter with all the earthiness of aloo that is wonderful. But one should not try it too often Abhijeet, in Kolkata, where do you like to shop for fresh ingredients? Abhijit Banerjee: It depends on what I am cooking. Sometimes it’s New Market and Gariahat Market. As a kid, I visited Gariahat often with my grandfather early in the morning. New Market would be more for the exotic stuff and I go there often. l love markets. Even this time, I went to Lake Market just for the experience — the colours are a riot, there is so much richness there! It’s a pity if you have to buy things online when you can go to markets. In fact, a great source of entertainment for us during the pandemic in Paris was to go to a market as often as we could and just stare at the vegetables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fried-grasshoppers-are-tasty-but-rattlesnakes-are-boring-says-abhijit-banerjee/articleshow/87804261.cms||Chandrima Pal
---||Kolkata||Many consider being a recurrent, commissioned composer by multiple orchestras a miracle, says Upamanyu Kar||“The journey of music is breathtaking, adventurous, and is enriched with both lovely and dreadful experiences, as “impossible” is no longer an option to consider”, says Upamanyu Kar, after being invited for his Fifth Orchestral Commission from around the globe. In an exclusive interview with CT, he speaks about his life, inspirations and music. You just got invited for Fifth Orchestral Commission amid the pandemic. How did you go for it?Well, although people might consider it as a “miracle”, I never thought it to be. In fact, in my opinion, nothing is really impossible in life as long as you don’t think it to be “impossible.” For me, it came very naturally, just as I wake up every morning and take a cup of tea, while gazing at the sunrise from my balcony at my rented house in Santiniketan, Birbhum. How does it feel like to be a commissioned composer, that too by orchestras? Isn’t it a very rare opportunity which most composers are able to get?Yes, it is. Everywhere in the world, most composer’s biggest dream is to get their works performed by large ensembles, such as orchestras. And, in most cases, their wishes remain largely unfulfilled because of the composers’ inability to hire musicians and to organise an orchestral concert. When an organisation, an ensemble or an orchestra commissions a composer, they also pay them an honorarium apart from taking all monetary responsibilities for organising the concert. It usually occurs to felicitate a specific occasion, a specialised event or a purpose, and composers who are exceptionally skilled in their art are invited to be commissioned to write music for the said occasion or the purpose. Between 2016 to 2019, I was commissioned by The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra, The Kolkata Youth Orchestra, The Pioneer High School Orchestras (for the first time) and the Indo-European Orchestra (Budapest). This is only my fifth orchestral commission internationally, and at the age of 33, I can say that many more is yet to come. I would repeat, people might consider being a recurrent commissioned composer by multiple orchestras a miracle, that too from India, but I don’t really consider my musical identity any different at all. What are your inspirations? How do you get the energy to be consistent with musical innovation?My inspiration is life itself. I’ve learned to challenge myself to bring out the best version of myself in whatever I do. Most people in our society just survive. But if we wish to live an adventurous life, we must be ready to face the greatest challenges in order to explore ourselves. Once we can fully accept this truth, and learn to take responsibility for every massive failure in life, we can enjoy massive successes, too. We can’t deny the possibilities of being knocked down in life every now and then. For this, I believe that we’ll need to keep the judgement only to ourselves to decide anything which becomes good for our own lives. If we let the judgement be laid down in the hands of an authority, then the biggest problem arrives. In this way, my journey of music has become breathtaking, adventurous, and is enriched with both lovely and dreadful experiences, as “impossible” is no longer an option to consider as long as I want it. How did you feel after being invited for your Fifth Orchestral Commission? Do you consider it an achievement?Honestly, I don’t prefer to call it a very big achievement. Till now, I’ve been developing myself, and as I’m moving towards pursuing my goal and living my life to the fullest, I let my emotions flow very often as I look back for a short while after each success to measure my growth. The musical journey is breathtaking, sometimes as difficult as life-threatening, similar to climbing a mountain with lots of disasters and dangers coming along the way. In the past, I’ve been cheated by my “own” people, who once encouraged me in the journey, tried to later prevent me from achieving the same. Unfortunately, this includes my parents, family members and subsequently, my wife as well. All these betrayals have helped me to become even more confident and determined to take this journey forward; and as I moved on, I found that being emotionally indifferent is the best way to deal with such problems. When I received the invitation, I found myself to be one of the luckiest people once again, to have been able to pave my way through success amid all challenges. The email read, “Over the past month, our orchestra students explored the music of 52 composers, and have now narrowed down our list to those with whom we would like to work. Congratulations, you are one of those composers!” As I went through the mail, I stood in front of the mirror once again, observing every minute detail of the scars, which were just parts of my existence. In my hands, I firmly held the official invitation letter from The Pioneer High School Orchestras, Michigan, to work as a commissioned composer for all four orchestras for their first concert in 2022; I was the only composer to have been chosen from India; as I closed my eyes for a short while, I could recall the memories of my dreams of studying composition abroad getting shattered almost nine years ago, thanks to the betrayal of my parents and family members. I felt the tears that came through, and accepted their existence once again. Then, as I opened my eyes, I found myself standing face-to-face with my inner-self and destiny; firmly, this is just the beginning of my journey of executing the lessons given by my once “parents”, in the highest manner. As I realized that despite each and every betrayal, I have managed to pave my way through success, I recalled my father’s past words, “If you excel in doing music so high, I’ll reward you.” Remembering all the incidents that have happened to my life in the last few years, I smiled indifferently; and thought, am I just flowing like the waters of a river, worshiping all the sounds that come along? Should we still have expectations in life if we wish to make more such ‘miracles’ happen?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-consider-being-a-recurrent-commissioned-composer-by-multiple-orchestras-a-miracle-says-upamanyu-kar/articleshow/87803431.cms||---
---||World||Judge throws out two Malcolm X murder convictions||NEW YORK: A New York judge on Thursday threw out the convictions of two men imprisoned for decades over the 1965 assassination of civil rights leader Malcolm X, acknowledging a gross miscarriage of justice in one of the most high-profile murders in American history.  Judge Ellen Biben granted the exonerations of Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam to a burst of applause from the courtroom, a historic move that amends the narrative behind one of the US civil rights movement's deepest wounds.  "I regret that this court cannot fully undo the serious miscarriages of justice in this case and give you back the many years that were lost," the judge told Aziz and the family of Islam, who died in 2009.  For more than half a century the official record has held that three members of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam -- which Malcolm X had recently renounced -- shot the iconic leader when he arrived to speak at the podium of a Harlem ballroom.  Aziz, Islam and a third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, were convicted in 1966 -- but historians have long cast doubt on that thesis.  Halim -- now 80 and released from prison in 2010 -- confessed to the murder but maintained the innocence of the other two.  And in 2020, the case was reopened following the release of a Netflix docuseries "Who Killed Malcolm X?"  The 22-month investigation conducted jointly by the Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for the two men found that prosecutors, the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld evidence that would likely have led to their acquittal.  Aziz, 83, was sentenced to life in prison in 1966 but was released in 1985. Also sentenced to life, Islam was released in 1987 and died in 2009.  Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said the probe made "clear these men did not receive a fair trial" and apologized on behalf of the law enforcement community for the "decades-long injustice."  "We can't restore what was taken from these men and their families, but by correcting the record, perhaps we can begin to restore that faith," Vance said. After Malcolm X was shot dead on February 21, 1965, Halim was taken into custody at the scene with a bullet wound to the leg.  Aziz and Islam were arrested several days later. Both denied involvement in the assassination and provided alibis for where they were at the time of the shooting.  "The events that brought us here should never have occurred; those events were and are the result of a process that was corrupt to its core -- one that is all too familiar to Black people in 2021," Aziz told the court.  "While I do not need this court, these prosecutors, or a piece of paper to tell me I am innocent, I am very glad that my family, my friends, and the attorneys who have worked and supported me all these years are finally seeing the truth that we have all known officially recognized," he added.  Saying the convictions "deceived and cheated" the public, civil rights attorney David Shanies told the court the two men became "victims of the same racism and injustice" that Malcolm X had battled.  Shanies and the Innocence Project, a nonprofit which has secured the exoneration of hundreds of wrongfully convicted prisoners in the United States, collaborated with Vance's office in re-investigating the case.  - Lingering questions - The wrongful convictions mean the true perpetrators -- who are believed to be dead -- may never be held accountable for killing a towering figure whose teachings still underpin today's struggles for Black rights in America.  The lengthy investigation did not identify the assassins or offer an alternative explanation for the murder.  And key questions remain, namely how did US intelligence, which had long surveilled Malcolm X, not know the leader was under threat or do anything about it?  Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm X became one of the most influential African Americans of the 20th century along with Martin Luther King Jr.  As a young man he fell into petty crime and while in prison became a devout follower of the Nation of Islam, a religious and political organization that advocates Black nationalism.  Upon his release, he changed his surname to "X," symbolic of the original name of his family lost under slavery.  He rose to prominence as a minister and spokesman for the NOI, advocating Black self-dependence and esteem. He also did not shy away from the use of violence for self-protection.  Becoming disillusioned with the group, Malcolm X broke away in 1964, forming the short-lived Organization of Afro-American Unity to continue advocacy for Black rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-throws-out-two-malcolm-x-murder-convictions/articleshow/87807605.cms||---

"We also continue to have serious concerns about Russian military activities and harsh rhetoric towards Ukraine and call on Moscow to de-escalate tensions," White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.  President Vladimir Putin has issued his own warnings. On Thursday, he said the West was taking Russia's directives not to cross its "red lines" too lightly.  On Friday, the Kremlin said those remarks were a response to provocative actions by NATO including the arming of Ukraine. Ukraine objects to increasing Russian military activity near the 1208 mile (1944 km) border it shares with Russia.  Despite a growing list of disputes, the Kremlin has maintained high-level contacts with Washington and spoken repeatedly of a possible summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden to follow up their initial meeting in Geneva in June, which Putin said had opened up room for an improvement in ties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-and-world/white-house-calls-on-russia-to-de-escalate-tensions-with-ukraine/articleshow/87808330.cms||---

It was the first complete shutdown after the revocation of the erstwhile state’s special status and its downgrading to a Union Territory in August 2019. People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) president Farooq Abdullah, meanwhile, wrote to the President of India demanding a "time-bound judicial probe" into the killing of three civilians in the Hyderpora encounter. "Needless to state that such unfortunate incidents widen the gulf between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the government of India and, therefore, are to be avoided at any cost," Abdullah wrote. The J&K police has denied allegations that it had killed civilians, admitting only that one civilian, Altaf Ahmad Bhat, was killed in the crossfire, while Dr Mudasir Gul, slain in the encounter, was an overground worker (for terrorists) connected to Pakistani terrorist Haidar Bahai of TRF who also was gunned down in Hyderpora. The police claimed that one Amir Ahmad of Banihal /Goolgarh, in Ramban, was also an associate of the Pakistan terrorist who was killed in the encounter on the bypass near Classic Hospital, in Srinagar’s Hyderpora, on Monday evening. Reports from various districts said all shops were shut for the day and private vehicles and public transport remained off the roads. The busy market at Lal Chowk, in Srinagar, was deserted. Hurriyat leader Mirwiaz Umar Farooq issued another statement calling upon the authorities to "return the body of Amir Ahmad Magray", the third civilian killed in the Hyderpora encounter, without delay. Abdullah wrote to the President saying the incident had caused enormous pubic anger. "In this unfortunate incident three civilians got killed in suspicious circumstances," Abdullah said, adding that a judicial probe was necessary "so that true facts are unraveled and brought into the public domain". "We would remind Your Excellency that the administration of Jammu and Kashmir is being run in the name of Your Excellency by the Lt Governor acting as an agent and, therefore, an onerous responsibility is placed on Your Excellency to ensure that the rule of law prevails and the involved erring officials are brought to book and punished under law," Abdullah said in his letter, adding that the body of the third civilian should also be returned to his family for burial. CPM politician Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, too, urged the government to return the body of Amir Ahmad Magray, the third "civilian" killed in Hyderpora, without further delay. Tarigami said it has been proven beyond doubt that Magray was a civilian. "His father Abdul Latief Magray is a state bravery award winner and now his son has been killed and falsely labelled as a militant, which is highly unfortunate," he said. "The least the J&K administration can do is to return the body of Magray so that his family can perform his last rites," Tarigami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shutdown-over-hyderpora-encounter-civilian-killings-cripples-normal-life-across-kashmir/articleshow/87808480.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The three who have resigned are state school education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, health minister and AICC in-charge for Gujarat Raghu Sharma and revenue minister and AICC in-charge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary. Dotasra is a junior minister, while Sharma and Chaudhary are state cabinet ministers. The three resignations increase the vacancies in the Gehlot cabinet to 12. The maximum strength allowed in the state cabinet is 30, going by the 15% cap for a 200-member state assembly. Maken's unannounced visit to Jaipur indicated that the cabinet reshuffle was likely to be held in the next few days. Governor Kalraj Mishra is at present in his home state of Uttar Pradesh and scheduled to return on Saturday afternoon. Maken said after meeting Congress MLAs one-on-one on July 30, some ministers had expressed a desire to work in the organisation instead of the government. Maken said the three ministers had accordingly tendered their resignations to the Congress president, who had accepted the same. Law says the resignations ought to have been tendered to the governor directly or through the Chief Minister. Gehlot had given enough indications in the recent past about Dotasra leaving the ministry. At a teachers' felicitation function held the other day, the CM had said that the education minister's speech at the function seemed like a farewell speech. He said that Dotasra had been requesting the party high command to divest him of one responsibility in keeping with the principle of "one man, one post".

After the payout, the total disbursement will reach Rs 25,114 crore, amounting to 99.6 per cent of assets under management (AUM) as on April 23, 2020, when the fund house announced to shut the schemes, a Franklin Templeton MF spokesperson said on Friday. Under the first disbursement in February, investors received Rs 9,122 crore, while Rs 2,962 crore were paid to investors in April, Rs 2,489 crore in May, Rs 3,205 crore in June, Rs 3,303 crore in July and Rs 2,918 crore in September. "SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd (SBI MF) would be distributing the next tranche of Rs 1,115.55 crore to unitholders across all six schemes," the spokesperson said. The payment to all investors whose accounts are KYC compliant with all details available will commence from November 22, he said. The amount to be distributed to unitholders will be paid by extinguishing proportionate units at the net asset value dated November 18 this year, he added. The payment will be made electronically to all eligible unitholders by SBI MF, which has been appointed as the liquidator for the schemes under winding up by the Supreme Court. In case the unitholders' bank account is not eligible for an electronic payment, a cheque or demand draft will be issued and sent to their registered address by SBI MF. In March, the Supreme Court accepted the standard operating procedure (SOP) finalised by SBI MF to monetise assets and distribute the proceeds to unitholders of the six debt schemes of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund. The fund house shut its six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, 2020, citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market. The schemes -- Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund -- together had an estimated over Rs 25,000 crore as AUM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/franklin-templeton-mf-unitholders-to-get-rs-1115-crore-in-7th-tranche/articleshow/87805156.cms||---
---||World||Pak U-turn on chemical castration for habitual rapists||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has removed a clause from the criminal law bill providing for “chemical castration” as punishment for habitual rapists. Last year, Pakistan president Arif Alvi had approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 and the Criminal Law (amendment) Ordinance, to provide mechanisms for curbing sexual abuse crimes against women, transgenders and children. The two ordinances had introduced harsher punishments for sex offenders, including chemical castration. On Wednesday, prime minister Imran Khan-led coalition government had hurriedly passed nearly three dozen laws in a joint session of the parliament, including the anti-rape criminal law, from which the penalty of chemical castration was omitted. Parliamentary secretary for law and justice, Maleeha Bokhari, revealed on Friday that the clause was removed due to objections raised by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Pakistan’s constitutional body responsible for legal advice to the government and parliament on religious matters. Article 227 of Pakistan’s constitution guarantees that all laws in the country should be in accordance with the Shariah and the Holy Quran. “The omission of chemical castration clause was made after detailed deliberation by a government committee in the light of CII objections under the guidance of the law minister. We cannot pass any law that goes against these (Islamic) values,” Bokhari said. About the anti-rape bill, Bokhari said the previous law had flaws that hampered the provision of justice to victims, hence a new law had been introduced to ensure swift dispensation of justice. She explained that an anti-rape crisis cell would be set up in every district hospital for rapid medical examination of cases. The punishment of chemical castration for rapists was introduced in last year’s presidential ordinance amid a national outcry over increasing offences and the specific case of a mother of two driving along a major Lahore-Sialkot highway who was dragged out of her car and raped by two men at gunpoint in front of her children. The new anti-rape law, meanwhile, has declared rape and gang rape as non-compoundable offences, where no compromise or settlement is allowed between the parties and a court must give the final decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-u-turn-on-chemical-castration-for-habitual-rapists/articleshow/87808598.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Those who labelled protesters who stood with the Indian farmers as ‘terrorists and separatists’ should apologise: UK MP||LONDON: British Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi has called on "sections of the media and the establishment" who were "busy labelling farmers and those standing in solidarity with them as terrorists and separatists" to apologise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday he would repeal the three central farm laws that have provoked huge protests for the past year. Dhesi was among several Labour MPs, in addition to councillors, British Sikhs and activists, who were thrilled with the unexpected decision, declaring it as a "huge victory" and a "huge U turn". Wolverhampton South East MP Pat McFadden said: "This decision will mean a lot to many in the UK who felt deep solidarity with the farmers protesting in India." "The farmers didn’t deserve to be so mistreated. They have made enormous sacrifices to preserve their way of life and their overwhelmingly peaceful, determined campaign has borne fruit," added Dhesi. British-born Daljit Singh (29), who has organised four kisan sleep-outs outside the Indian high commission in London, at which activists slept in the open air, said his protests would continue and the next one would go ahead in a gurdwara car park in Letchworth on November 27. "We are going to keep protesting until it’s gone through the parliamentary process. There isn’t much trust in the Indian government — they have allowed the farmers to stay there for a year in the cold and spread propaganda against them and we have seen them face water cannon and tear gas. Some people in America have had their OCIs revoked just for protesting and we have all been labelled as anti-nationals. Once it has gone through the parliamentary process, people will go home." British-born Punjabi councillor, Gurch Singh, who started the petition calling on the British government to urge India to ensure the safety of farmer protesters and journalists, which garnered 116,000 signatures and led to a debate in the House of Commons, told TOI he was "speechless". "Friday is the birthday of Guru Nanak, so a huge day and really auspicious — this is the biggest gift we could receive as a community." "Some people are a bit sceptical about the timing but on the whole the community is overwhelmingly pleased," he said, adding that the "government now needs to rebuild India’s reputation, which has been damaged by these protests".

"This is a victory for everyone who stands up for justice. Politics is about change and social movements are a great indicator and should inspire us all that change can be effective.

---||India||Those who labelled protesters who stood with the Indian farmers as ‘terrorists and separatists’ should apologise: UK MP||LONDON: British Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi has called on "sections of the media and the establishment" who were "busy labelling farmers and those standing in solidarity with them as terrorists and separatists" to apologise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday he would repeal the three central farm laws that have provoked huge protests for the past year. Dhesi was among several Labour MPs, in addition to councillors, British Sikhs and activists, who were thrilled with the unexpected decision, declaring it as a "huge victory" and a "huge U turn". Wolverhampton South East MP Pat McFadden said: "This decision will mean a lot to many in the UK who felt deep solidarity with the farmers protesting in India." "The farmers didn’t deserve to be so mistreated. They have made enormous sacrifices to preserve their way of life and their overwhelmingly peaceful, determined campaign has borne fruit," added Dhesi. British-born Daljit Singh (29), who has organised four kisan sleep-outs outside the Indian high commission in London, at which activists slept in the open air, said his protests would continue and the next one would go ahead in a gurdwara car park in Letchworth on November 27. "We are going to keep protesting until it’s gone through the parliamentary process. There isn’t much trust in the Indian government — they have allowed the farmers to stay there for a year in the cold and spread propaganda against them and we have seen them face water cannon and tear gas. Some people in America have had their OCIs revoked just for protesting and we have all been labelled as anti-nationals. Once it has gone through the parliamentary process, people will go home." British-born Punjabi councillor, Gurch Singh, who started the petition calling on the British government to urge India to ensure the safety of farmer protesters and journalists, which garnered 116,000 signatures and led to a debate in the House of Commons, told TOI he was "speechless". "Friday is the birthday of Guru Nanak, so a huge day and really auspicious — this is the biggest gift we could receive as a community." "Some people are a bit sceptical about the timing but on the whole the community is overwhelmingly pleased," he said, adding that the "government now needs to rebuild India’s reputation, which has been damaged by these protests". "It is a huge welcome that Narendra Modi is now accepting that these laws were not right," said Britain’s first female Sikh MP, Preet Kaur Gill. "This is a victory for everyone who stands up for justice. Politics is about change and social movements are a great indicator and should inspire us all that change can be effective. There has been a cost to this victory — a cost of loss of life — and it has been heart-rendering to see how many farmers have been sleeping out in the cold and rain.

However, with international destination weddings still mostly off-limits, well-heeled, to-be-wed couples are exploring desi destinations in a big way. From beach and palace weddings to desert, cruise ships, hills, and jungles – the options are limitless, with most venues completely booked till March next year. RAJASTHAN IS THE FRONT-RUNNER, AS COUPLES OPT FOR ROYAL WEDDINGS ‘Natural beauty’ has become an additional factor while choosing a shaadi destination post pandemic, with outdoor and spacious venues being in demand. However, palace weddings have taken the lead, say wedding organisers. Nitin Arora, an entertainment specialist at a wedding and events management company, says, “Weddings in Rajasthan are quite a hit.” In fact, thousands of weddings are scheduled in Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, and Ranthambore from November to March. Vinay R Bantia, who recently organised a royal wedding in Udaipur, says, “Palace weddings mean ‘royal’. Every aspect is looked into – a defined guest list, an impeccable menu with exquisite drinks, and marvelous decor. Most clients who choose a palace as their location our ready to splurge, as the wedding has to match up to the royalty of the venue. Some opt for two to three day functions at palaces, while other choose to only hold their wedding ceremony.” Weddings have become a massive affair againPic credit: Uddipta Bhattacharjee The Escapade Events.CHARTER PLANES TO BOLLYWOOD SCRIPTWRITERS: COUPLES ARE GOING ALL OUT FOR THEIR LAVISH, DREAM WEDDINGSDakshna says, “Couples love experimenting and now that weddings have become a massive affair again, they want something exotic and fancy.” A wedding planner agrees, saying, “To reach these domestic destinations, some parents are booking charter planes. I have clients who have opted for a charter wedding proposal as they add a dreamy touch to the celebrations and the wedding video. And why not? Shaadi toh ek baar hoti hai.” Many couples are also hiring Bollywood choreographers and scriptwriters to write their wedding day speeches, apart from set designers to make the event a truly royal affair. A staff member at a wedding company tells us, “We are also hiring specialists - like sky lantern specialists - who can curate messages in the sky.” <p>When people opt for a destination celebration, away from their city, what they are looking for is an experiential wedding.</p><p><br></p><p>Pic credit:Rashi Entertainment</p>NOT JUST GOA, MAHABALIPURAM AND CHENNAI ECR ARE IN DEMAND FOR BEACH WEDDINGS tooSmall and intimate weddings are on their way out, as people are choosing to go lavish and extravagant on their D-Day. Rajiv Jain, director of a wedding and events company, says, “Lavish weddings are back full throttle. As per our research, apart from Rajasthan, heritage and beach locations are the in-thing right now. When people opt for a destination celebration, away from their city, what they are looking for is an experiential wedding. For instance, people in NCR-Mumbai want to getting married ‘closer to water bodies’. Everyone wants something new and different. Apart from Goa, Mahabalipuram has also become a popular wedding destination.” He adds, “While most venues are fully booked till March, our insights indicate that it’s 2022 that will be the year of weddings.” Dakshna Moorthy N Naidu, MD of wedding event company, adds, “Now that beach weddings have become so popular, is is not just Goa and Kerala that couples are going for.

The incessant rains started on Thursday evening, triggered by the deep depression formed over the Bay of Bengal, throwing life out of kilter in the region. More than 100 persons are feared to have been washed away in separate incidents in the four districts. About seven National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) teams have been deployed to lead the search and rescue operations, besides teams from the police, revenue and fire department. As Cheyyuru river overflowed, water from Annamayya irrigation project spilled over to several mandals in Rajampet assembly constituency and other parts of Kadapa district.  Three AP State Road Transport Corporation buses carrying passengers got stuck in flood waters near Ramapuram in Rajampet mandal. Though fire services rescued most of the passengers and APSRTC staff, 12 persons who were washed away were found dead at various places in Rajampet mandal. Seven bodies were retrieved near Gandluru, three near Rayavaram, while two bodies were found near Mandapalli. About 30 persons from Mandapalli, Akepadu and Nandaluru villages in Rajampet mandal have been washed away and officialhave launched a search operation to trace them. Rail and road traffic between Tirupati and Kadapa came to a standstill as floodwaters damaged railway tracks and national highways at several places along the route.

---||India||China should be in no doubt about India's stand: Jaishankar||NEW DELHI: China should be in no doubt about India’s position on the bilateral relationship and what is ailing it, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in a firmly worded message to Beijing even as military-level talks on the border stand-off remain stalemated and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a renewed mandate as the unchallenged leader of China. “I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would have experienced, I speak fairly clearly, reasonably understandably (and) there is no lack of clarity so if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Jaishankar told a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum in Singapore. “We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that indicates some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he said. The minister did not indicate any resiling from the Indian demand that ties cannot move towards normalisation as long as the borders are unsettled despite suggestions in some quarters that there may be need for a rethink now that Xi has further consolidated his powers. Referring to other relationships, Jaishankar said the US is today a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions and working arrangements than in the past. “I think this reflects a very different kind of world...” he said. ‘Manner of China’s growing influence is very different’We are moving into a world in a sense, you could say, when the real transitions after 1992 are now occurring,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said. Dismissing as “ridiculous” the notion that the US has been strategically contracting and yielding space to others amidst a global rebalancing of power, he said, “Don’t confuse it with the decline of the US. I think that’s ridiculous.” “It’s clear China has been expanding. But the nature of China, the manner of its growing influence is very different. And we don’t have a situation where China necessarily replaces the US. There are also a lot of other countries, including India, which have come much more into play. There’s been a rebalancing in the world,” he said. The world, he said, is changing. “It is certainly not unipolar and it is not really, really bipolar either. There are many more players. A lot of what we are doing in terms of repositioning, working with countries, (it) is multipolar work,” he said. “In a sense, it is partly a hedging strategy, partly autonomous partnership, often very issue based (as) we work with different countries on different sets of issues,” said Jaishankar. Earlier, countries did not worry too much about the internal politics of its neighbours. “Today, issues of trust and transparency are much more relevant in a data-driven world. So it does matter to me what the character of my partner is, who they are partners with,”the minister further he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-should-be-in-no-doubt-about-indias-stand-jaishankar/articleshow/87808728.cms||---

According to police, some families living on Muslim Street on the banks of Kottaru River used to take shelter in the concrete house belonging to Aslam Ansari whenever there is heavy water flow in the river. On Thursday night, 18 people from five to six families slept in Ansari's house. As the basement of the house got eroded due to continuous exposure to river water over the past few days, a major portion of the house collapsed around 8am on Friday.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka contractors expose rot in public infra projects||BENGALURU: A complaint by Karnataka State Contractors’ Association to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has brought to light the worst-kept secret in state administration — the deep-rooted, institutionalised corruption in how state public infrastructure projects are tendered, awarded and executed. It also highlighted the contractor-politician nexus and extent of kickbacks the state machinery allegedly extracts from contractors. Ahead of the 2018 assembly polls in Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi branded Congress government led by Siddaramaiah as a “10 per cent commission” government. In 2019, during his Lok Sabha poll campaign in Koppal, he dubbed the then Congress-JD(S) government as a “20 per cent commission government”. Now, going by allegations of the contractors’ association, the commission seems to have risen steeply, in just a couple of years, as it alleged that politicians are demanding 30% cut money to award projects in addition to 5%-7% to clear payments. The association wrote to the PMO on Thursday, alleging deep-rooted corruption. Facing harassment from mins, officials: Contractors’ assnThey to pay alleged ‘advance they’re commis forced - sion’ and then more kickbacks to get payments released after project completion. “We are facing harassment from ministers, elected representatives, officials and others starting from the junior engineer to the minister,” D Kempanna, association president, told TOI. In the past eight years, he claimed about 15 contractors died by suicide because they were unable to clear loans due to delay in payments. Payoffs are institutionalised in Karnataka with only percentage varying between departments and nature of work, alleged Kempanna. Official sources said the complaint to PMO was unexpected as contractors have never dared to go against political bosses and the all-powerful bureaucracy. “We know the consequences we’ll face by making these charges, but we are ready for that and we have solid evidence to substantiate them,’’ said Kempanna. He, however, did not disclose names of politicians and officials who demanded bribes but claimed that corruption exists at all levels, mainly in PWD, water resources and BBMP project works. A retired IAS officer said it’s impossible to win a government contract without paying a commission, irrespective of the party in power. “A strategically placed, high-level official/politician can manipulate the process to select a bidder. What has emboldened them are weak anti-graft watchdogs — Lokayukta and ACB — which earlier had exposed many such scams,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/contractors-expose-rot-in-public-infra-projects/articleshow/87808750.cms||---

According to the recently released Annual Status of Education Report (Aser), 62% children in the state studied using the traditional methods of textbooks, 44% from broadcast and 34% online. The survey indicated that some children used more than one mode for studying. Online classes did not work well in Karnataka. Only 34% studied online -- 41% in private schools and 32% in government schools. The most successful online classes were in Kerala where 91% studied online, followed by Himachal Pradesh (80%). When the survey was conducted in September-October 2021, only 83% students in both government and private schools in the state had their age-appropriate textbooks with them. This was the lowest in India at that time, whereas 98% children in West Bengal and 97% in Kerala had their textbooks. The worst performing states after Karnataka were Uttarakhand (87%) and Bihar and Rajasthan (89%). Nationally, 92% students had textbooks by then. In state, 72% kids have access to smartphones, says edu reportThe department now says distribution of textbooks is 100% complete, according to Made Gowda, chairman of Karnataka Textbook Society. The tender for printing textbooks was called only by July and the delay was expected. Nationally, one of the best performances by Karnataka came in lessons broadcast. There were lessons on Chandana TV and in radio programmes for primary school children, 44% of them followed this. The other states that had solid broadcast lessons were Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Aser report points out that even though the ownership of smartphones had increased in the past one year, accessibility was an issue. In Karnataka, of the 72% schoolkids with access to smartphones, 36% have access all the time, 53% sometimes and 12% no access at all. The access to smartphones in Karnataka last year was only 43% as against 72% this year. About 50% of the children who learnt online last year found it easier the next year. Unlike in 2020, the year 2021 saw children receiving more learning material. While only 82% received the material last year, this year it has gone up to 93% nationally. Around 28% government schoolteachers visited children at home when schools were closed across the country. Karnataka had introduced Vidyagama by which government schoolteachers were to reach out to children near their neighbourhoods in small groups. Private schoolchildren relied more on WhatsApp. Aser 2021 was conducted in September-October 2021 when schools were starting to reopen, among 1.92 lakh households and 11,545 schools through phone calls by Pratham, an NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/62-ktaka-kids-learnt-from-books-during-covid/articleshow/87808751.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Indian IT companies don't provide such long period forecasts. But most have said that customer demand is very strong, and have indicated double-digit growth rates.Cognizant has been lagging it's peers for some years, though its last quarter was relatively good. It said last month it expects to grow at 9.8% for the year ending December. Infosys, on the other hand, raised its guidance for the full year ending March to 16.5-17.5%. This year's growth rates are on top of the relatively low base of 2020, when revenue suffered on account of the pandemic. “We continue to make strong progress in positioning the company for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion," said CEO Brian Humphries in an investor briefing.A large part of Cognizant’s growth will be supported by digital deals, which is expected to contribute 55-60% of the topline by 2024, up from 45% currently. “Digital supports revenue growth, margin goals, increases our relevance to clients, and is core to our employee value proposition,” the company said.Of the total growth, 6-9% would be from organic constant currency CAGR and 2% would come from acquisitions. Cognizant expects to close the year with $18.5 billion in revenue. Margins will also get an uptick, expanding by 20-40 basis points annually. That would mean in a best-case scenario, margin inching up to 17% over the next three years. Cognizant’s margins for the third quarter ended September was 15.4%. In contrast, Infosys expects margins to be between 22-24%.TCS, which does not provide guidance, is also confident of double digit growth in the coming fiscal years supported by what its CEO Rajesh Gopinathan says is a “multi-year technology upgradation cycle that will fuel growth.”The company will deploy 50% of capital (of annual free cash flow) into acquisitions between 2022 and 2024. 25% will go into share repurchases and the remaining into dividend payouts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/will-grow-8-11-till-24-cognizant/articleshow/87808754.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||50% of women suffer from mental stress due to lack of public toilets, says survey||BENGALURU: Earlier this week, Bengaluru-based legal researcher Sneha Visakha’s tweet resonated with almost every woman travelling long distance in a bus. The driver of the interstate bus (Telangana State Road Transport Corporation) she’d boarded decided to stop by the road to relieve himself, while the male passengers followed suit. “Meanwhile, women on the bus apparently don’t have bladders/need to pee/need bathrooms, will probably stay off water all night,” she posted, adding: “The fact that constant dehydration is part and parcel of female travel plans should horrify & infuriate us, except we’ve normalised this so much, no one even notices a problem.” However, TSRTC took note of Visakha’s tweet and issued guidelines to field managers that buses be stopped only at wayside dhabas/restaurants with clean toilets and adequate illumination. The bus operators were also directed to stop at toll plazas to help women passengers. Several women like Visakha suffer distress either due to lack of toilets, or unsafe and unmaintained public urinals. According to a survey conducted by Channamma Kambara, assistant professor, Centre for Research in Urban Affairs (CRUA) at Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC), 50% of women faced mental stress due to postponement of defecation and 47% suffered from upset stomach, while 2% complained of urinary tract infection. She shared the findings during a webinar — Towards improved access and use of toilets in Karnataka: Status and the way forward — conducted by ISEC, Bengaluru on Thursday, on the eve of United Nations World Day of Toilets (observed on November 19). In her study of eight zones across the city (with 1,229 women), and a sample of 587 toilets (35.4 per cent of total toilets in Bengaluru), Kambara found that 97 per cent of women faced safety and privacy issues in toilets (including public, community and e-toilets). These reasons forced almost 30 per cent of them to delay in relieving themselves, while some of the remaining surveyed would choose to relieve themselves in public spaces, threatening their own privacy and safety. “Since most women lacked the ability or agency to modify their sanitation environment, they were forced to tweak their behaviour — like changing the timing of sanitation, limiting intake of food or liquids and withholding defecation or urination when they felt the urge,” she said, adding that 56% of the women found these public toilets did not have doors, forcing them to have company to guard them. Kambara suggested policy changes like gender mainstreaming of sanitation facilities, creating awareness and more pink-toilets/she-toilets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/50-of-women-suffer-from-mental-stress-due-to-lack-of-public-toilets-says-survey/articleshow/87808755.cms||Farheen Hussain

Poornima Ravindra, a school teacher, and her daughter Lakshmi Ravindra, an advocate, were on their way to Kempegowda International Airport in the cab. The two women and the driver, Raghavendra Ural, 45, of Bannerghatta, died on the spot. Police said Poornima and Lakshmi were from Kerala and their family had settled down in Kolkata. Lakshmi went to Kolkata on a holiday and the mother-daughter duo left for Bengaluru to attend a week-long yoga course. The course was supposed to end on Saturday, but the women decided to leave two days earlier and took Ural’s cab to the airport to return to Kolkata. Around 9pm, an SUV driven by MBA student Bharath BR, 22, jumped the median near Chikkajala, flipped in the air, and landed on Ural’s cab that was coming from the opposite direction. Police had to cut open the vehicles to remove the bodies. Bharath and his friend Vikas, 25, who was also in the SUV, sustained severe injuries.

But now he is travelling in a modest car, thanks to the abysmal condition of the main road linking Rayasandra, where he lives, with Hosa Road which he has to take to get to office. Rayasandra is a densely populated locality in southeast Bengaluru with many apartments and villas. Residents have to take the main road to reach Hosa Road and head towards Electronics City and onward. But the main road is teeming with craters, posing a threat not only to the bones and joints of users, but also the shock absorbers of their vehicles. More than 1,000 people, including schoolchildren, use Rayasandra main road which has been in poor condition for over a year and half now. It takes more than 20 minutes to cross the 1.5km stretch to reach Hosa Road. Residents joke that there is no way they can leave their vehicles behind and walk the stretch as negotiating the potholes calls for a dancer’s skill. The potholes are getting larger and deeper by the day. Continuous rain over the past weeks has worsened things. “We pay tax to the government. I paid Rs 14-15 lakh tax for registration of my new car. Every day, we hear of at least one person falling off a two-wheeler. Things have become really dangerous,” Jonack said. Last week alone, three women met with accidents on the road. “A woman fell off her bike and was injured badly. We rushed her to a hospital. We are not even allowing our children to go outside,” said Ravi Bhavsar, a resident of Jana Jeeva Splendour apartment at Rayasandra. “So often, workers come and dump sand on the potholes and go. But the potholes are back in no time,” he said. Jonack said Rayasandra Residents’ Association approached the BBMP and Rayasandra gram panchayat demanding a solution. Some people have taken to social media and are uploading videos of the bad road. “I had a fall yesterday and suffered severe ankle sprain. Will BBMP take responsibility if something happens to us?” tweeted Swathi Gupta, a resident. Another resident, Kannan, said he started getting backache walking on the road. Shanta Babu, former corporator of Singasandra ward, under which part of the road falls, blamed civic agencies for the mess. “BWSSB started some work but did not finish it. Though we had money, we couldn’t do anything as they would dig up the road again. The road can be fixed once they finish their work,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-brave-craters-on-road-off-e-city/articleshow/87808758.cms||---

The accused were earlier booked in four cases on similar charges in 2013, 2020 and 2021, while the kingpin, known as Chota Telgi, landed in police custody last year. The suspects are Hussain Modi alias Babu alias Chota Telg of Viveknagar; S Harish, of Basaveshwaranagar; stenographer Seema Shahan Sharif alias Shavar of Bapujinagar; Nayaz Ahmed, of Shammana Garden; Shabbir Ahmed of Vijayanagar. Police commissioner Kamal Pant said they were held in connection with a case at Ulsoor Gate police station in January. Police said hearing of the 2013 case is in its final stages while a chargesheet has been filed in the 2020 case. The papers were fraudulently used to show legal transactions that happened up to 20 years ago or more, when stamp papers were in use. Cops recovered from the accused duplicate seals of sub-registrar offices in the city and places such as Mysuru, Kolar and Bidadi. 2021 case On January 4, Krishna Nayak, sub-registrar at Gandhinagar office, KG Road, filed a complaint against unidentified miscreants for faking stamp papers. The high court, based on a PIL, directed police to form an SIT and probe the matter. The team was constituted in June. “Acting as decoys, our men purchased fake stamp papers from the suspects. Then, obtaining a search warrant from the court, SIT raided houses of the suspects and other places on November 12 and seized materials used for producing fake stamp papers,” Pant said. Who are theyHaving dropped out of school after failing class 8, Babu started earning as a tout outside Kandaya Bhavan in 1990. Later, he became a vendor until stamp papers were banned following the Telgi scam in 2002. Babu and Harish know each other from 2005. Harish worked as a typist outside the city civil court complex. Seema was a tout who opeated outside Kandaya Bhavan and is a close associate of Babu.

The girl, D Sinchana, 19, was from Nisarga Layout in Jigani. She was the only child of Doddaiah who owned a hardware shop in Harapanahalli, Anekal. The accused was Kishore Kumar, driver with a godown in Anekal. Sinchana’s family told police she was first-year student at a private college on Bannerghatta Road. The tragedy came to light when Doddaiah and his wife returned home late evening and found their daughter with her throat slit and Kishore hanging from the ceiling fan. No suicide note was found. “Textbooks and a few notes were found near Sinchana’s body, indicating she was studying at that time,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-stabs-girl-to-death-hangs-himself/articleshow/87808761.cms||---

Nataraj M alleged that Satish R from Chintamani targeted him for getting a special land acquisition officer trapped while he was accepting a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from him recently. According to the FIR, Satish works as a tout for special land acquisition officer Tejas Kumar. However, Satish filed a counter-complaint, alleging Nataraj had attacked him. Satish said he is a farmer and had lent money to Nataraj, who assaulted him when he asked for it. Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) sleuths said they arrested Tejas Kumar, special land acquisition officer, KIADB, when he was accepting Rs 2 lakh from Nataraj in the last week of September. Nataraj said he approached ACB after Tejas demanded more money to move files pertaining to land acquisition. “My land was acquired by KIADB and I approached Tejas Kumar for compensation-related work. I had already paid Tejas Rs 10.5 lakh and decided to approach ACB when Kumar demanded Rs 4 lakh more,” Nataraj told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/whistleblower-farmer-says-tout-attacked-him/articleshow/87808763.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

---||Bengaluru||Set your house in order, court tells BWSSB||Times News NetworkBengaluru: Allowing a petition filed over BWSSB claiming arrears of over Rs 2 crore, the high court sent a stern message to the water utility: Set your house in order. The petition was filed on November 10 after BWSSB demanded the arrears, inclusive of interest, from BBMP for Jayanagar swimming pool. The Palike, in turn, sent a communication demanding payment of Rs 1.9 crore as arrears from PM Swimming Centre, which has been managing the pool since 1996. The private company challenged this, contending that it has not been using water supplied by BWSSB for the past 25 years and whatever arrears were there were cleared by BBMP in 2003 itself. BBMP also claimed that all the dues were cleared in April 2003 and BWSSB had acknowledged this. However, the water utility contended that bills were issued month on month to the petitioner and every bill indicated arrears. Since neither the petitioner nor BBMP paid the arrears, either one has to do so now, BWSSB argued.Justice M Nagaprasanna, after perusing the records, noted that merely sending monthly bills claiming arrears meant little and BWSSB cannot contend after 25 years that they have to be paid, that too by the petitioner. The judge added that the board should have taken action, according to section 75A of the BWSSB Act, at the right time (within 15 days of issuance of bill) by stopping water or sewerage connection to the pool. “The case at hand is one where BWSSB officials should be held responsible for their lackadaisical attitude, having let the arrears grow to mountainous proportions. Since laxity on their part spans around 25 years and some officers who handled this matter would have retired, this court is restrained from directing any disciplinary proceedings against them. But the case should act as an eye-opener for the board to set its house in order and not repeat such glaring mistakes in future,” the judge observed while granting liberty to BBMP and BWSSB to resolve the dispute among themselves. A direction was issued to both entities not to claim arrears from the petitioner for the period prior to 1996.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/set-your-house-in-order-court-tells-bwssb/articleshow/87808765.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: No end to dynasty politics as leaders’ kin throw hat in ring||BENGALURU: Dynasty politics continues to thrive as all three political parties are in the process of fielding relatives of their functionaries in the December 10 council elections from local bodies. JD(S), which is branded as a party of the HD Deve Gowda family, has taken the lead in this exercise. The party fielded Suraj Revanna, son of former minister and Deve Gowda’s son HD Revanna, from Hassan, overlooking functionaries who toiled hard to build it. Suraj filed his nomination papers on Friday. Suraj is the eighth member of the Gowda family to enter electoral politics. Given the predominant presence of JD(S) in the form of members of gram panchayats and urban local bodies — who are voters in these elections — in Hassan, Suraj’s election seems to be certain. The opposition Congress decided to field Channaraj Hattiholi, brother of MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar, from one of the two seats in Belagavi district, and former minister Amaregouda Bayyapur’s nephew Sharangouda Bayyapur from Raichur-Koppal seat. Though the party is yet to officially announce the candidates, Hebbalkar has claimed it has given her brother a green signal to start his campaign. Bayyapur filed his papers on Friday. Apart from these two, the party is also likely to field former minister A Manju’s son from Hassan. Manju had joined BJP ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls protesting Congress’ decision not to field candidates in support of Prajwal Revanna, the JD(S) candidate. Congress and JD(S) were in an alliance then. Promoting dynasty politics is not a new phenomenon in Congress as the party already has several sitting council members from political families who are seeking re-election on December 10. They include Sunil Gouda Patil, brother of senior Congress leader MB Patil, Vijay Singh, son of former CM Dharam Singh, and S Ravi, a relative of KPCC president DK Shivakumar.  The ruling BJP has fielded DS Arun, son of former council chairman and veteran BJP leader DH Shankaramurthy, from Shivamogga, and former CM Jagadish Shettar’s brother and sitting council member Pradeep Shettar (he’s got ticket for the second time in a row). It has also fielded Suja Kushalappa, brother of Madikeri MLA Appachhu Ranjan, from Kodagu. The party is likely to extend support to Lakhan Jarkiholi, brother of former ministers Ramesh and Balachandra Jarkiholi, who is expected to contest from Belagavi as an independent candidate. BJP releases list of 20 candidatesThe BJP central parliamentary board late Friday released a list of 20 candidates who will contest the council polls. The big names include OBC and social welfare department minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and upper house deputy chairman MK Pranesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-end-to-dynasty-politics-as-leaders-kin-throw-hat-in-ring/articleshow/87808766.cms||---

During his visit to TOI office, Bommai had said they will table the bill notwithstanding protests from the Christian community. In his letter, Machado said: “The entire Christian community in Karnataka opposes the proposal of the anti-conversion bill ...and questions the need for such an exercise when enough laws and court directives are in place to monitor any aberration of the existing laws.” He also requested the CM to withdraw the order to conduct a survey of Christian missionaries, institutions and establishments in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anti-conversion-bill-archbishop-writes-to-cm-again/articleshow/87808768.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Lack of secondary centres choking Bengaluru’s healthcare||BENGALURU: What’s choking Bengaluru’s healthcare system? Insufficient secondary care hospitals and lack of referral from primary to secondary healthcare centres resulting in overburdening of tertiary care hospitals, according to a recent study by the Azim Premji Foundation. The report, ‘Healthcare equity in Urban India’, released on Friday, examines health vulnerabilities and inequalities in cities and terms urban health governance ‘chaotic’. “There is no streamlining of referrals, especially for chronic cases. Every patient lands up in tertiary care centres like Vanivilas or Victoria hospital. Though there are six community health centres in Bengaluru, they are grossly inadequate for an expanding city of Bengaluru with 198 wards,” said Arima Mishra, professor of sociology and public health, Azim Premji University and lead author of the study. The study involving 17 NGOs began in October 2020 and analysed urban health services in Bengaluru, Davanagere, Thiruvananthapuram and Raipur. “We chose a variety of cities to see implementation of urban health services in different areas to understand how different local self governments managed public health services,” said Arima Misra. The report highlights that all institutions classified as ‘District Hospitals’ in Bengaluru Urban district in the National Family Health Survey (NHFS)-4 database are in reality just referral hospitals but yet clustered within core BBMP area. “In NFHS-4, Vanivilas Hospital is mentioned as a district hospital but it is a tertiary maternity and childcare hospital,” said Arima. “The close geographic proximity within BBMP areas of different levels of facilities nullifies attempts at setting up a referral chain, since the public just goes to the facility closest to them, even if it happens to be a District Hospital. For those on the periphery, reaching a higher referral facility means a long trip on Bengaluru’s congested roads, making it safer to simply access a private facility located close by,” says the report. The report says that referral linkages between different levels of care are poorly defined in urban areas. Secondary-level institutions are scarce, resulting in overburdening of tertiary care. Primary and secondary institutions need to be strengthened, so that burden on tertiary institutions decreases. The researchers pointed out that primary health centres were not conducting deliveries, especially in Davanagere and Bengaluru. Overlapping of responsibilities between BBMP and Bengaluru Urban district was also pointed out by researchers. “Bengaluru’s continued expansion is affecting its urban health services,” she added. She gave the example of a mobile health clinic run by the labour department for beedi workers in Davanagere. “That’s a healthcare unit not run by the health department, an example for how accountability gets fragmented,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lack-of-secondary-centres-choking-citys-healthcare/articleshow/87808769.cms||---

In a video uploaded on social media, she said, “I have danced with an artificial limb and created history, making my country proud. But every time I go on my professional visits, I am stopped at the airport, and when I request CISF officials to please do an ETD (Explosive Trace Detector) test for my artificial limb, they still want me to remove my artificial limb and show it to them. Is it humanly possible?” Apologising to Chandran, the CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) tweeted “all our personnel will be sensitised again on the protocols so that no inconvenience is caused to travelling passengers”. This month, CISF has collaborated with disability rights groups and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to make the airport experience for differently-abled passengers hassle-free, without compromising on security. Last month, Sudhaa Chandran said she was left feeling ‘humiliated and disheartened’ CISF TO LAUNCH APP AND HELPLINE NUMBER TO AID DIFFERENTLY-ABLED PASSENGERSCISF officials say, “Representatives from NGOs were invited to share their experiences and put forth their expectations from the CISF aviation security group regarding the facilitation during security checks of differently-abled passengers at airports. They were also encouraged to give suggestions with regard to easing the process of security checks.” Officials add that detailed deliberations took place during the conference regarding the extension of Swarnim Sewa – an initiative launched by CISF aviation security group at Hyderabad airport in December last year – to other airports. The initiative included extending assistance to passengers requiring special attention, like senior citizens, differently-abled passengers, and expectant mothers. This included development of an app, and a helpline number. ‘THERE WILL BE INCREASED FOCUS ON TRAINING AND SENSITISATION OF PERSONNEL’The CISF said in a statement, “There will be increased focus on training and sensitisation of personnel. A periodic review of the achieved targets and way forward will be done every six months.” M A Ganapathy who was then DG, CISF told the NGO participants that all efforts are being made to ensure that passengers with disabilities do not face any problem at the airport. The current security guidelines for frisking differently-abled passengers, as well as their equipment like wheelchairs, prosthetics and others, were introduced by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security following the 2016 Somalia blast where a wheelchair-bound passenger was suspected to have carried out a blast in the aircraft after evading security at the Mogadishu airport. The NGO representatives present at the meet said that while the present guidelines are differently-abled-friendly, security protocols are different at different airports which leads to confusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-sudhaa-chandran-airport-incident-cisf-to-launch-app-for-differently-abled-passengers/articleshow/87808727.cms||Niharika Lal

---||Bengaluru||Odds stacked against Karnataka||Bengaluru: The odds will be stacked against Karnataka when they take on 12-time cha- mpions Railways in the final of BCCI women’s One-Day Trophy at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Saturday. It is a contest which pits the overwhelming favourites and defending champions against a resurgent young unit.Both the teams have taken similar routes to the title round, having remained unbeaten throughout the competition and their semifinals contests being washed out. They advanced on the strength of their superior net run rate. Again, weather which is gloomy and cloud-covered with more rain prediction, will play a decisive factor in who takes home the title. In the event of a no-contest due to the weather, Railways will retain the trophy on the basis of a better run rate. But Karnataka will hope for the rain to stay away and make a match out of the finale. Against a star-studded Railways line-up led by stalwart Mithali Raj, Karnataka have everything to gain. Throughout the tournament the top-order, comprising S Shubha, D Vrinda and G Divya, have consistently delivered leaving the middle-order largely untested. The bowlers have done well too with both their economy rate and wicket taking abilities.The host team skipper Veda Krishnamurthy, a former Railways player said, “I’ve played a lot of cricket with and against most of the Railways players, so I know their game. As a team, we have imbibed a brand of cricket which is aggressive in approach and style. In the final we hope to continue with it.”On countering their fancied opponents, the middle-order batter pointed out, “Railways come into every match with a clear plan, so it is important for us to unsettle them early. It will boil down to seizing the moment and converting the half-chances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/odds-stacked-against-karnataka/articleshow/87808839.cms||---

Promising a new start to agitating farm unions, the PM justified the three laws meant to allow freer trade and introduce contract farming as beneficial to farmers. He lamented that a small section failed to see this fact even when it was as clear as the light of a lamp, but refrained from pointing a finger. "There must have been shortcomings in our own efforts," he said. This was the second significant retreat, not counting the reluctance to follow through with the enactment of Citizenship Amendment Act by preparing the National Population Register, when the PM has retraced steps on a major initiative. In the earlier instance, the government allowed the ordinance to change the Land Acquisition Act to die a slow death. Read AlsoFarm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash.This time, Modi made no bones about the retreat. His address to the nation on Gurpurab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, seemed a deliberate outreach to the Sikh community in Punjab where farmers have been particularly agitated over fears that a new system of private mandis will sound the death knell for the minimum support price-based procurement. The symbolism was in keeping with the PM's visits to gurdwaras on special days and the decision to open the Kartarpur Sahib corridor - all intended to woo Sikh opinion. "While apologising to countrymen, today I want to say sincerely that perhaps there must have been some deficiency in our tapasya that we could not explain the truth like the light of the lamp to farmer brothers," the PM said after outlining several decisions and measures the government had undertaken to improve income and benefits to the farming community. Read AlsoFarm laws repealed, PM Modi appeals protesting farmers to return home: Key pointsPM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. Addressing the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, the Prime Minister said the three laws were for the benefit of farmersUrging agitating farmers to return to their homes, he promised a fresh start, saying once the laws are repealed, a committee will study zero budgeting farming or natural farming, scientifically changing crop pattern, and most significantly, make MSP more effective and transparent. The panel is to include Centre, states, farmers, agricultural scientists and economists. While the announcement of the rollback was viewed in the context of the upcoming elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, BJP sources emphasised the decision reflected concern over the long-running agitation having an adverse impact of reviving separatism in the border state of Punjab and providing a handle to Khalistanis and Pakistan. Read AlsoSeat-sharing with BJP 110% on: CaptainThe repeal of the farm laws has brightened the possibility of BJP tying up with Congress rebel and former CM Captain Amarinder Singh's Punjab Lok Congress, thus upending the equations of the coming assembly polls in the state. "The plan for seat-sharing with BJP will be worked out 110%, and farmersThe Prime Minister defended the aims of the legislation, saying that they were introduced as part of a campaign to improve the condition of farmers, particularly small ones who need to be empowered and get the right price for their produce as well as more options. Such support was vital for some 10 crore farmers who tend to holdings of less than two hectare. "For years, this demand was continuously being made by farmers, agricultural experts, agricultural economists and farmer organisations," he said. He has previously accused the opposition of double speak over reforms that previous governments have also called for. "Today is the auspicious festival of Guru Nanak Dev ji Prakash Parb....This occasion is not to blame anyone. On this day, I have come to tell you, the whole nation that we have decided to withdraw, repeal the three farm laws. We shall complete the constitutional process of repealing the three laws in the upcoming winter session at the end of this month," the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister said that for years, farmers of the country, agricultural experts of the country and farmers' organisations of the country were continuously making these demands. "Earlier also many governments had brainstormed on this. This time also there was discussion in Parliament, brainstorming took place and these laws were brought up. In every nook and corner of the country, many farmers' organisations welcomed and supported it," Modi said and expressed his gratitude to the organisations, farmers and individuals who supported it. He said four-pronged measures on seeds, insurance, market and savings were taken to help farmers. "Along with good quality seeds, the government also connected the farmers with facilities like neem coated urea, soil health card and micro irrigation," he said.

The daylong workshop, being organized by the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) at A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, would hold detailed deliberations on operating institutions’ accounts in PFMS under the revised procedure. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and higher officials of the education department and BSHEC would address the participants. BSHEC vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha told this newspaper that as many as 74 higher education institutions of the state, including 12 universities and 62 colleges, have received grants under RUSA in phase I and II. They are supposed to submit their utilization certificates before the allotment of grants under RUSA in phase III. As the Union finance ministry has recently made some changes in the PFMS system for the functioning of all schemes sponsored by the central government, the officials of higher education institutions would be apprised of the revised operating system.

Pawar himself assured workers that the opposition would be made to pay for every day and every hour that Deshmukh spends behind bars due to the extortion allegations. While addressing party workers at Lakadganj, the former Union aviation minister said it was not his opinion but this was expressed by Pawar himself. “Nobody should think that a big vacuum has been created in Deshmukh’s absence.” Stressing that the Katol MLA was a key person in the NCP family, Sharad Pawar said he missed him badly in this visit to Nagpur. “Today is the first day in many years that I came to Nagpur, and Anil Babu is not here with me. We have been working together for many years, but this had never happened before. In Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Wardha, he was very much in charge of empowering the party workers,” he said. The NCP chief earlier cancelled his Wardha and Yavatmal tours due to official reasons, according to NCP city chief Duneshwar Pathe, who was with the senior politician at Wadsa in Gadchiroli. Slamming the BJP for misusing central investigation agencies to target Maharashtra ministers to destabilize the three-party government, Pawar showed glimpses of his good old days during a fiery speech. He said the opposition would be made to pay for every day and every hour that Deshmukh spends behind bars, and NCP workers would not forget this humiliation till they teach a befitting lesson to them. “When you have power, you need to handle it carefully and respectfully, with feet firmly on ground. Else, those (BJP) who lost it, resort to intimidating tactics like harassing and defaming others. The central government may conduct any number of raids on us, but the voter would punish you and never let you come back to power.” Taking a dig at local BJP leadership, the former Union agriculture minister said after losing power, some unscrupulous elements are sending a list to senior leaders in Delhi for action and accordingly central agencies are targetting them. “After switching sides, senior leader Eknath Khadse and wife were summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). As nothing could be done to MP Sanjay Raut, his wife was targeted. Similarly, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sister was harassed after the government failed to indict him. Minister Hassan Mushrif’s home was raided but nothing was found.” Flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, the veteran politician said even as the prices of essential commodities sky-rocketed, it was busy targeting and harassing opposition leaders. “I recently visited Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur district, where farmers were fighting for their rights for over a year, including senior citizens and women. Similar protests are happening in other states like Rajasthan and Haryana. However, the NDA government does not have time to listen to the grievances of those who feed the nation. It’s leaders are piling up miseries on the farmers and common citizens, and there is a need to teach them a lesson. Calling on workers to work under Patel’s guidance in strengthening the party’s base in Vidarbha, the four-time chief minister said the change would begin from Nagpur and spread across Vidarbha. “I was a bit sceptical of workers morale while arriving in the city in Deshmukh’s absence. But looking at your enthusiasm, I am sure that any misuse of power would not deter you in standing behind the party. With all your hard work, we have formed the MVA government under CM Uddhav Thackeray. Our aim is to provide a stable government that will take Maharashtra to prosperity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pawar-patel-promise-deshmukh-as-minister-again-soon-oppn-to-pay-for-every-hour-behind-bars/articleshow/87787653.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

There is no justification for speaking anything special over this issue.” Responding to a media query on his arrival from Delhi at Patna airport, Nitish said, “The Union government had framed the three farm laws. It was the Centre’s decision. But today the PM has announced to repeal the farm laws in the coming session of Parliament. The PM, in his speech, very clearly stated that he took the decision in the interest of farmers, but could not make all people understand his motive, hence he was withdrawing the three laws... The PM has explained everything. There is no need of speaking anything special over this issue.” On being asked that the three farm laws were withdrawn keeping in mind the forthcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and other states, Nitish said, “People keep expressing their views. But today, the PM himself explained everything. Everything is clear. However, the leaders of opposition parties are free to express their views.” When asked about some opposition leaders’ comments like “ego of Modi has been broken” and “it is a victory of people/ farmers,” Nitish said, “People have right to express their views. Hence, they will keep expressing their views.” When pointed out about RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s statement that there is a need of a similar agitation to put pressure on the Centre for caste-based census, the Bihar CM said he was not aware what Lalu has said over the issue. “I had no talk with him (Lalu). Lalu’s son and other leaders of his party had met me. We (leaders of all political party) had met the PM with the demand of caste census. The Centre took its decision. But, I categorically said the leaders of all political parties (in Bihar) would sit together and take a unanimous decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pm-has-explained-everything-on-farm-laws-nitish/articleshow/87806467.cms||Madan Kumar

A study carried out jointly by botanist and zoologists of M S University has revealed the presence of 54 species of birds belonging to 32 families that are using 28 species of trees spread over nearly 29.4 acres in this residential area. The study was aimed to highlight the bird diversity of Pratapgunj, which has low disturbance and high tree count, and acts as a good refuge of birds. Avian survey techniques and citizen science/ citizen survey technique was used for data collection for the paper titled ‘Conservation importance of trees as urban green spaces: A case study of birds in Pratapgunj residential area, Vadodara’ authored by Tanaya Ambadkar, Geeta Padate from MSU’s Zoology department and Prof Arun Arya, former HoD of Botany. “Birds are known to effectively indicate quality of habitat in an area. Most of the resident bird species are observed to breed successfully in the area,” the study states. Two migratory species — Rosy Starling and White Wagtail — are observed in good numbers apart from two other species of Alexandrine Parakeet and Black-headed Ibis, which are classified as ‘near threatened’ in IUCN red lists. When compared with the IUCN list that indicates global population trends of bird species, the Pratapgunj area has seven bird species with decreasing trend, nine with increasing trend, 28 having stable global population and ten species whose trend is not known. Three stripped palm squirrel, gray langur, Indian grey mongoose, Indian flying fox and Asian house shrew are commonly found mammals in the area. And reptiles like - oriental garden lizard, spectacled cobra, Indian rat snake have also been recorded. There are 28 species of trees including 16 fruiting species in Pratapgunj which shares its boundaries on two sides with M S University campus and on one side with the Sayajibaug public garden which extend the green habitat for birds. The most remarkable feature of the area is its stretch comprising 75 Ashoka (asopalav) trees, all of which are more than six decades old. “The residential area being old has still retained several large trees along its internal roads which makes the area green and a good habitat for birds,” the study adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/birds-find-a-cosy-home-in-vadodaras-urban-sprawl/articleshow/87806580.cms||Prashant Rupera

A large number of devotees from Nepal and Mithilanchal region reached Simaria to take an early morning dip in the holy river. Kundan Kumar, a cultural activist and resident of Bihat village near Simaria Dham said, “According to a rough estimate over two lakh people took a holy dip by Friday afternoon.”  Begusarai Sadar SDO Ramanuj Prasad Singh said that like every year, this year also people turned up in a large number. “The district administration had made elaborate arrangements to ensure that the devotees are safe and have a spiritually fulfilling experience. Barricades were put up at various points and an elaborate traffic plan was prepared to control the movement of vehicles. A large number of police personnel, teams of the State Disaster Response Force and local divers were deployed at the ghats to ensure the safety of the devotees,” he added. Saroj Kumar, associated with various sports organization said that this year, there was no traffic congestion between Barauni Zero Mile and Simaria Dham owing to the construction of four-lane road. This saved the devotees from a lot of hardship faced during previous years. Raju Giri, a devotee, however, lamented that this year the district administration denied permission to organise the ‘Kalpavas mela’ , a long held religious tradition, according to which the devotees stay on the bank of the river at Simaria in thatched hutments during the entire Kartik month. “The Kalpavas, spanning over a month, usually culminates into Kartik Purnima event making it a spiritually fulfilling experience," he said.  Elsewhere, at Sigma ghat, a group of priests from Varanasi performed a special ‘aarti’ on the eve of Kartik Purnima on Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thousands-take-dip-in-ganga-at-simaria-dham/articleshow/87806551.cms||---

The victim’s mother, while talking to reporters in Navsari, said that the institution officials took no action despite knowing about the brutality inflicted on the girl. “I came to know that my daughter had informed the institution officials about the incident. But unfortunately they didn’t take any action. They should have informed the police or our family. Why didn’t they? When my daughter told them that she wants to leave Vadodara, why didn’t the officials make any arrangements to send her back home?” questioned the victim’s mother. The victim was undergoing fellowship training at the institute for the last two years. The victim’s mother added that she was satisfied with the police investigation and demanded that those behind the crime should get the strictest punishment. Meanwhile, the police have again started investigating the role of autorickshaw drivers in the crime. Sources informed that few officials of the institution where the girl worked are also under police radar. Cops are questioning autorickshaw drivers whose mobile phone was active near the crime spot when the girl was attacked. Probe revealed that the the institute’s mentor had posted photos of a few pages of the girl’s diary as well as of injuries suffered by her on a WhatsApp group and deleted these later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mother-why-was-her-institute-inert/articleshow/87806913.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mittal, an Indian citizen, who lives in a flat in Mayfair, London, was declared bankrupt by the London high court on June 19, 2020 after failing to settle a judgment debt against him of 139 million pounds (Rs 1,390 crore), which led to Moorgate Industries UK — to whom he owes the debt, which arose from a guarantee he provided — presenting the bankruptcy petition. Paul Allen of specialist business advisory firm FRP, who was appointed by the secretary of state as trustee in the bankruptcy of Mittal on June 29, 2020, took Mittal to the insolvency & companies court in June this year, seeking suspension of his discharge from bankruptcy, which should have automatically taken place after one year. An interim suspension of the discharge was made on June 17, 2021. At the final hearing on Friday, Allen’s barrister Tony Beswetherick told the court that during the initial year of his bankruptcy Allen had made multiple requests to Mittal to allow forensic experts to access Mittal’s electronic devices such as his laptops and smartphones and requested a second interview with him But he kept getting responses from Mittal’s solicitors, saying “we are taking instructions”. He said Mittal had displayed a “clear and flagrant non- compliance with his duties”. “We say this is a very serious case of deliberate non-compliance.” The focus of the trustee in bankruptcy is to realise the assets of the estate and distribute those realisations to its proven creditors. Bankrupt individuals must co-operate with the trustee and provide them with the information they ask for. Mittal’s barrister James Gibbons made no admissions regarding the merits of the suspension application but sought to get the case dismissed on a technicality, arguing that the papers were not served on Mittal according to the rules and he was not given adequate notice of the application, nor was he given adequate notice to file his evidence. Although Mittal successfully got an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) approved by 75% of the value of 20 creditors at a creditors’ meeting on October 26, 2020, he is not able to annul his bankruptcy order, since Moorgate is challenging the IVA in the courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/court-reserves-ruling-on-mittal-bankruptcy/articleshow/87807527.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Booster shot demand rises, hospital body to appeal to govt||KOLKATA: There is increasing anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) who received their vaccines almost eight months ago about their waning immunity. They are keen to get the booster shot, some hospitals and the Association of Hospitals in Eastern India (AHEI) are planning to make an appeal to the government for a third vaccination for them. Before vaccination, every hospital had anything between 20%-40% of their healthcare workforce getting infected by Covid. After vaccination, the infection rate reduced drastically. “Before the inoculation drive, about 230-odd HCWs in our hospital got infected. Post vaccination, despite greater exposure because they dealt with the second wave surge, only about 40 HCWs got infected and most of them did not need hospital care,” said Sudipta Mitra, Peerless Hospital CEO. Times ViewIt makes a lot of sense to give some sort of extra protection to healthcare workers. They are the ones who are most exposed to the virus, even though vaccination may have reduced the number of serious cases and deaths.The inoculation drive was launched on January 16 and, by March-end, a good number of HCWs had been fully vaccinated. “Now, eight-nine months after the second dose, many apprehend a severe infection due to dipping antibody level. That is why there is a demand for a booster dose,” Mitra said. At CMRI Hospital, around 10 HCWs are currently infected. All have received both doses. However, none has severe infection and all of them are being taken care of at home. “We had 100-odd HCWs infected during the first wave, before the vaccination. But after inoculation, we hardly had anyone getting infected. However, over the past two weeks, we have started getting a few cases of infection among our healthcare workforce,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO CK Birla Hospitals. In some hospitals, doctors and nurses have appealed to the management to raise the booster shot issue with the appropriate authority. “From about 40% before the vaccination, the infection rate among HCWs in our units have come down to less than 5% after vaccination. In fact, none of our HCWs dealing with severely infected patients got infected after they got both doses,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east), Narayana Health. Some hospitals and the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) are now planning to make an appeal so that the government rolls out the booster dose for the vulnerable, starting with the HCWs. “We have had only six fully vaccinated HCWs getting infected in the past six months. But there is anxiety about depleting antibody level and, hence, many are keen on the booster dose,” said Subhashis Datta, general manager operations at Ruby Hospitals. AMRI officials said the infection rate among the fully vaccinated HCW group across the three Kolkata units has came down drastically to just about 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/booster-shot-demand-rises-hosp-body-to-appeal-to-govt/articleshow/87807188.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The police were informed at 4.15am. Ajit Yadav, the child’s father, tried to cover up the matter by promising to bear all treatment expenses of injured Vicky and clandestinely rushed him to a couple of private hospitals, which refused to admit him. Then he took Vicky to the PMCH where the doctors declared him dead at around 3.30am, Ram Krishna Nagar police station SHO Jehangir Khan said. One Pinku Kumar (23) and his maternal uncle Pappu Yadav (42) were involved in celebratory firing in the party using countrymade pistols. The SHO said Vicky received injury in his head by the shot allegedly fired by Pinku. He said Pinku and Pappu are Ajit’s neighbours. Police said a video of Pinku dancing with the pistol in the party has also gone viral. He said Vicky had lost his parents in childhood and was brought up by his maternal grandfather Dayanand Singh at Pipra. Around 250 guests had gathered at Ajit’s residence where dancers and DJ were hired for the guests. “At least two to three crucial hours were lost in an attempt to cover up the incident, otherwise the man could have survived,” the SHO said. He said police visited the crime spot in the morning and found bloodstains at several places. “Vicky’s grandfather has lodged an FIR against Pinku, Pappu and Ajit. They are evading arrest,” he said. The SHO said the body was cremated after autopsy at PMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-in-celebratory-firing-at-a-birthday-party/articleshow/87806401.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Friday issued an advisory, making it mandatory for all hotels, banquet halls and dhabas to install CCTV cameras so that their footage could be obtained in case of any complaint. All SDOs, SDPOs and SHOs have been asked to keep watch on celebrations being organised at banquet halls and hotels and take immediate action against violators of liquor law. Agarwal will hold a meeting with hotel and restaurant authorities on Monday in the presence of IG, DM and SSP of Patna and ask them to ensure effective implementation of the prohibition law. Representatives of about 100 hotels, lodges and banquet halls are expected to attend the meeting. “All these venues will be asked to get a signed declaration on a printed proforma that none of their guests, even from other states or countries, would consume liquor during the get-together. Hotel managements would also have to keep watch on their staff, including waiters, to ensure that they do not serve liquor to the guests,” Agarwal told this newspaper. He also asked the authorities concerned to put up hoardings at all important chowks, crossroads and other places making people aware of the prohibition rules. These hoardings will also bear the toll-free number 15545/18003456268 for sharing information on production, storage, sale and consumption of liquor.

---||Pune||Devotees throng gurdwaras to celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti||PUNE: Guru Nanak Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the first Sikh guru and the founder of Sikhism, was celebrated with great fervour on Friday at various gurdwaras in Pune as well as in Pimpri Chinchwad. Footfalls at many gurdwaras were the highest in the last two years. Around 50,000-60,000 people turned up throughout the day at Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp. Mohindev Singh Kandhari, the PRO of the gurdwara, said, “We started distributing langar, comprising dal, rice, sabji, roti, accompanied by special festive preparation of kheer, from 11am and continued throughout the day till late at night. The crowd enjoyed the kirtan sessions by artists, who came from Amritsar and Delhi.” A representative of a gurdwara in Khadki said it was the busiest day for the institution sine the pandemic began, and the footfalls almost matched the pre-Covid numbers. “We always go to the gurdwara together as a family. After offering prayers, we meet friends and relatives there and sit down for langar. However, since senior citizens are discouraged from visiting crowded places, I and my husband decided to pray at home,” said Ramnik Kohli, a resident of Lohegaon. Manmeet Singh, a resident of Lullanagar, said, “The highlight of the celebration is preparation of different types of halwas made from sooji , carrot, wheat, almonds and jaggery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/devotees-throng-gurdwaras-to-celebrate-guru-nanak-jayanti/articleshow/87806942.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Once, we get clarity from the state authorities, the zoo will be reopened. Covid norms and guidelines will be followed for entry of citizens visiting the zoo,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, the Pune Municipal Corporation’s additional commissioner. According to PMC officials, the decision to restart the facility was not been taken due to the lockdown. Zoo officials said they were demanding the facility be restarted as all other facilities have opened. “Precautionary measures can be taken to start the facility. The PMC will make the declaration about it after due diligence. The zoo management has put forth its demand to the PMC to reopen the facility from December,” a senior official of the zoo said. According to zoo’s data, nearly 7,000 to 12,000 people used to visit the facility every day. The number was high during the weekends. According to the zoo’s data, it has nearly 440 animals of 63 different species. A total of 25 staff members directly get in touch with these animals. They include zoo keepers and veterinary doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/katraj-zoo-may-reopen-next-month/articleshow/87806948.cms||---

This is the first time that such a huge crowd will be turning up at Eden since the pandemic and cops have suggested that CAB appeals to spectators to arrive around 5pm, at least two hours before the match starts. Both CAB and Kolkata Police held internal meetings on Friday and took a few decisions. Cops have increased parking space, stretching from Gangasagar grounds till the Basketball grounds to enforce social distancing. “We have kept two categories of parking stickers — green and pink — for those parking opposite Eden Gardens and a portion of the Bangabasi grounds. All other stickers have been done away with. We are aware that a larger number of spectators will be using private transport and, hence, we have made arrangements accordingly,” said joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey. Officers said they will not let too many people inside at one go. “The instruction is that people will enter in batches. This has to be followed even if the match starts. We are asking everyone to reach early. We also have a few plans for dispersal,” said an officer. Sources said they have discussed the plan with CAB. “We will have an adequate presence inside and outside the stadium. We are not reducing our numbers from the usual IPL fixtures even through the crowd could be smaller,” said a source. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said each officer in charge of the stadium has been briefed about a specific role. While CAB president Avishek Dalmiya was unavailable for comments due to the multiple meetings, CAB officials said all government norms related to Covid will be followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/early-entry-more-parking-space-focus-on-crowd-mgmt/articleshow/87807203.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||RIL, Aramco will re-evaluate investment in oil-to-chemical business||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) and Saudi Aramco have decided to “re-evaluate” the latter’s proposed $15-billion investment in the Indian company’s oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. Consequently, the country’s largest company by market value will pull out its application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for segregating the O2C business from itself. The re-evaluation follows RIL’s “evolving” energy business play, which includes its recent moves in solar power. It plans to make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing even as it targets to become net carbon zero by 2035. In a media release issued late Friday night, RIL said that, due to the evolving nature of its business portfolio, the company and Saudi Aramco have mutually determined that it would be “beneficial for both parties to re-evaluate the proposed investment in O2C business in light of the changed context”. Two years ago, RIL announced that Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL’s O2C unit for $15 billion. As part of the deal, Saudi Aramco would get one seat on the board of RIL and the right to appoint its executives in key managerial positions in the O2C unit. But the Saudi Aramco investment got delayed due to the pandemic and its impact on energy demand. The Indian company, however, recently appointed Saudi Aramco chairman and governor of the Kingdom’s wealth fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on its board. The engagement over the last two years has given both RIL and Saudi Aramco a greater understanding of each other, providing a platform for broader areas of cooperation, the Indian company’s statement read. Analysts interpreted that Saudi Aramco could look at investing in RIL’s larger portfolio, including O2C and renewable energy & new materials businesses. The Indian company’s facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which accounts for a major part of RIL’s O2C assets, is envisaged to be the centre for its renewable energy and new materials play. Like RIL, Saudi Aramco too is pivoting towards green energy. In June this year, RIL announced that it will make a Rs 75,000-crore investment in clean energy over three years. Later, it bought Norway’s REC Solar and India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar. RIL’s Friday statement further said that it shall continue to be Saudi Aramco’s preferred partner for investments in India’s private sector. RIL and the Kingdom have an over two-decade-old relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from Saudi Aramco for many years and the latter, through its wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF), investing in the Indian company’s retail, telecom (Jio) and fibre-optic units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-aramco-will-re-evaluate-investment-in-oil-to-chem-biz/articleshow/87808138.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||RBI’s proposals restrict e-loans to regulated companies||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s proposed e-lending norms will impact many digital lenders who take on credit risk while distributing loans for others as these arrangements may be banned. The regulations, which stop short of bringing under the RBI umbrella entities that facilitate lending using technology, want to do away with non-lenders providing guarantees for loans. While this reduces systemic risk build-up through off-balance sheet lending by unregulated players, it still leaves a grey area for unregulated entities to operate as distributors. The RBI report notes that banks have lent Rs 1.1 lakh crore through digital mode, while NBFCs have advanced Rs 23,000 crore through this route. Most of these are in the form of unsecured personal loans for a couple of thousand rupees. But these have a short tenure and result in a high portfolio churn. According to a report by Macquarie, while many digital lenders will be hit, Paytm is safe as it does not engage in lending arrangements where it provides a first loss default guarantee (FLDG) to the actual lenders. “The report recommends that all fintech loans must be reported directly to credit bureaus. It also prohibits credit risk-sharing between fintech and banks/NBFCs in the form of FLDG agreements,” said Macquarie Capital associate director Suresh Ganapathy in the report. He added that while Paytm is in the clear here as it plans to act as a pure distributor for consumer loans, several players in the fintech industry for whom this is a norm will be severely impacted. While the RBI aims to ban fintech platforms, determining which guarantees are for credit risks might be tricky as all lenders seek a certain level of indemnity from service providers. “Even where FLDG arrangements are not there, lenders do have an agreement with the distributor to indemnify them from any loss caused by the action of the agent or the employee. This does not mean that the distributor is taking on credit risk. The challenge will be in distinguishing such clauses from a default guarantee,” said Sandeep Srinivasa, founder of microlending startup Red Carpet. “The proposals will demolish many existing loan sharks and curb unfair practices. Moreover, the recommendation for digital lenders to provide a key fact statement in a standardised format, including the annual percentage rate, will give a better perspective to borrowers about the high percentage rate they are willing to bear,” said Gaurav Chopra, founder & CEO of IndiaLends, and founding member of the Digital Lending Association of India (DLAI). In 2019, a high-level committee on micro, small and medium enterprises headed by former Sebi chairman U K Sinha had recommended loan service providers (LSPs). The Sinha panel had said that the regulator must create this new category of LSPs, which will be an agent of the borrowers. The LSPs offering individualised advice should act in borrowers’ best interest, respecting fiduciary duties of disclosure, loyalty, and prudence. Similarly, lender agents like direct selling agents (DSAs) and brokers should be required to disclose conflicts that compromise their impartiality, such as incentives from lenders to market higher-priced loans over others, and clearly break out the fees they add to the loans. However, the proposal for loan service providers was not taken up. “The RBI report has suggested that web aggregator of loans products be subjected to discipline and code of conduct. Regulating aggregators would have been a positive for the industry as this still leaves entities to operate outside regulation,” said another digital lender who did not want to be named. Signzy Tech co-founder & CEO Ankit Rata said, “Currently, the industry is seeing many unregulated digital lenders operating in the space who do not even have basic KYC checks in place. We believe that if the recommendations are passed, it will not only help protect consumers but also restrict breaches of data privacy while curbing fraudulent transactions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-proposals-restrict-e-loans-to-regulated-cos/articleshow/87807816.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Colleges start fee refund for cancelled admissions||KOLKATA: Colleges have started the process of refunding fees to candidates who have cancelled their admissions to undergraduate courses after securing admission in another college or university. Colleges have asked candidates who want to cancel their admission to submit a written application with payment details and date of cancellation. Some colleges have even sought explanation from these students for holding back the seat before ultimately deciding to cancel. According to University Grants Commission norms, students who cancelled their admissions before October 31 will get a full refund. Anybody cancelling their admission after that will have to take a deduction of Rs 1,000 as processing fee. At Maulana Azad College, candidates must submit the application for refund by November 30, principal Subhasis Dutta said. Candidates seeking refund of admission fee will have to write all the details about their admission and submit them at the entry gate of the college along with attested copies of bank challans, admission cancellation receipt and a cancelled cheque. The college has also requested the students to mention why they held back the seat for so long before cancelling, but this will not affect the fee refund. Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, too, has started the process of refunding admission fee. “The students have mailed us the details. We are making the refunds,” said college principal Asok Mukhopadhyay. Students scored high marks in all the board examinations this year on the basis of various computation methods that were used as examinations could not be held due to the second wave of the pandemic. At the time of application to undergraduate courses, students applied to multiple colleges and in different subjects, including those they weren’t to keen to study. As a result, seats in most colleges got blocked and students who actually wanted to pursue those subjects had to wait till the others cancelled their admissions. The education department had to extend the deadline for admission to undergraduate courses multiple times because colleges could not fill up their seats. Some colleges have again opened their admission portals to invite fresh applications to fill the vacancies. “Since the government waived application fee, students applied to several colleges and subjects. That locked our seats. Towards the end of September, almost 20% seats were vacant when students finally started cancelling admissions. Thankfully, the government extended the deadline and we could fill up some seats,” said a principal of a government college who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-start-fee-refund-for-cancelled-admissions/articleshow/87807180.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, cornered the state government on the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. Soon after the Jharjharpur incident came to the notice of the RJD leader, he tweeted, “There is complete administrative anarchy in the state. The law and order machinery has virtually collapsed and people have been left to fend for themselves.” Tejashwi alleged that criminal activities have gained alarming proportions in Madhubani during the stint of the incumbent SP Satya Prakash, who has close connections in the corridors of power. He further alleged that loot, murder, kidnapping and rape have become a routine affair in Madhubani. “Yet he continues to enjoy his posting in the district,” the RJD leader said, adding that ‘everybody is aware of ‘Nalanda model’. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra on Friday squarely blamed Nitish, who also holds the home portfolio, for such a sorry state of affair. “This is virtually the climax of lawlessness in the state. The incident shows how police have become ‘nirankush’ and ‘arajak’,” he said. “The police have shirked from their prime duty and responsibility. Imagine the situation when the police go amok. How they will behave with common people when judicial officers are not spared,” he added. Referring to the murder of an RTI activist-cum-journalist in Madhubani, Mishra said the accountability of the erring police officers should be fixed in such serious offences. The police have failed to arrest the real culprits, he lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-netas-corner-cm-over-assault-on-jhanjharpur-adj/articleshow/87806546.cms||Ramashankar

Visitors were seen clicking selfies in and around the gurdwara. General secretary of Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, Sardar Indarjit Singh, said the number of devotees could be between 18,000 and 20,000. “They are mainly from Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The Sikh devotees are happy with the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor because Guru Nanak Dev ji had spent 17 years of his life in Kartarpur and even worked as a farmer,” he added Sardar Daljit Singh, superintendent of the prabandhak committee, said, “Chief Justice of Patna high court Sanjay Karol, IAS officer Harjot Kaur and many other dignitaries reached the gurudwara and offered prayers to the first Sikh guru. Trilok Singh of Delhi, Gurmeet Singh of Dehradun and Indarjit Singh Fakkar participated in bhajan-kirtan.” Singh said it being the day of Kartik Purnima, hundreds of Hindu devotees who reached the Ganga ghat for holy dip also offered prayers at the gurdwara and joined the langar. In the evening, the Hukmnama of Guru Granth Sahib was read out to devotees. Since the Patna DM had directed the prabandhak committee to follow Covid protocols, several gurdwara officials were seen advising people to maintain distance and wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thousands-offer-prayers-at-gurdwara-on-prakash-parv/articleshow/87806411.cms||VK Tripathi

As per the earlier schedule, SA-1 was scheduled to be held from December 1. “In view of circumstances explained by the State Gazetted Headmasters Association, Hyderabad and Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA), Hyderabad, the issue of re-scheduling of SA-1 has been examined and it is decided to reschedule the exams from December 14 to December 20,” read a circular from DSE. The DSE, vide a circular, directed the district education officers in the state to take necessary action to conduct the SA-1 for class 1 to class 10 students on the said dates. According to TRSMA members, the exams have been rescheduled as most of the schools are yet to complete the syllabus. “It’s been only two-and-half months since students started coming back to physical classes after a gap of more than one-and-half years. It’s taking more time to complete the syllabus as teachers have to start again from basics so as to ensure that students understand various topics,” said S Srinivas Reddy of TRSMA.

There was trace rainfall on the outskirts, but the mostly cloudy conditions made the day humid with relative humidity reaching around 60-90% in many locations in the city on Friday evening. The humidity coupled with no rainfall resulted in marginally higher real-feel temperature in Pune on Friday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at IMD-Pune, told TOI that the city/district reported 6-7 okta clouds with moderately high humidity levels on Friday. “The light rain forecast stands for the city due to the prevailing systems. Rainfall evaded Pune till Friday evening due to the direction and speed in which the weather systems (that were to cause the rains) were moving,” he said. A well-marked low-pressure area over east-central Arabian Sea, with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 5.8 km above mean sea level, has been affected weather in the state. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over the same region in the next 24 hours. The trough from the cyclonic circulation associated with the above system from east-central Arabian Sea to west Madhya Pradesh across north Maharashtra also persists. Kashyapi said that the systems are likely to cause light rains, thunder, and lightning activity in parts of the state, especially south Maharashtra, till November 23. Light thundershowers in Pune have still not been ruled out, he said. “Rains and cloudy weather are likely to recede from Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune city/district, after November 23. By November 25, the city may see a drop in night temperatures,” he said. Pune, which recorded a day temperature of 30.4°C and a minimum temperature of 21.5°CC on Friday, would see the latter dipping to 19°C around November 25, as per the IMD forecast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rainfall-elusive-cloudy-skies-up-humidity-in-city/articleshow/87806957.cms||---

The transactions happened between 1.30am and 1.50am on November 16. After confirming with the bank, the sexagenarian on Thursday filed a complaint with the Dattawadi police. The complainant told TOI he came to know about the fraud in the morning. “I received four messages from the bank about the debit of the money from my bank account,” he said. The complainant said that by using the details of his credit card, the fraudsters first transferred Rs 12 lakh to a company. “My credit card is linked with my bank account. After they reached the credit card limit, the crooks transferred Rs 8 lakh from my bank account to my credit card,” he said. He said they also transferred amounts from his fixed deposit in the bank to his savings account, and subsequently to the credit card. “In total, I have lost Rs 21.11 lakh to the fraudsters,” he said. The complainant said he did not receive any OTP for the transactions. He never shared any details to unknown person. “The transactions happened when I was asleep,” he said. Inspector Vijay Khomane of the Dattawadi police told TOI, “Prima facie it was a case of card cloning. The complainant claimed he did not share any details with unknown persons.

The institute will also be creating a digital repository of the traditional artifacts to trace the design evolution of the Ojha craft. Deepak John Mathew, department of design, IIT-H, along with his team, has conducted a design intervention workshop on Dhokra crafts of Ojha Gonds of Adilabad as a part of an ongoing project ‘Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Telangana’ supported by Science and Heritage Research Initiative Programme, Design Innovation Centre and Institutional Innovation Centre, IIT-H. The workshop focussed on training the younger generations of the Ojha community in the traditional Dhokra crafts under the supervision and training of the master craftsman who was chosen from the Ojha community. Traditionally, the artifacts were majorly created for the ritualistic purposes of the Raj Gonds, which is a part of the intangible cultural heritage of the Raj Gonds of Telangana. “We define IIT-H as Inventing and Innovating in Technology for Humanity. Preserving Dhokra using the design concept and encouraging future generations to sustain it fulfills our motto. IIT-H also has a rural development centre to uplift the rural livelihood with the aid of technology,” said BS Murty, director, IIT-H. The institute will be creating a digital repository of all the artifacts created in the workshop by using photogrammetry and 3D digital printing which will be useful for the researchers for further studies as well as for the visitors from all over the world to get insights into the cultural heritage of the Raj Gonds and associated communities and their traditional practices. The digital museum is being intended to preserve the traditional artifacts with the non-destructive methods where the original artifacts will remain with the community and 3D printed artifacts will be served to fulfill the knowledge sharing purpose on the cultural heritage of Telangana at the global level, where the museum can be visited virtually from anywhere in the world, an IIT-H release read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-endeavour-aims-to-preserve-dhokra-craft-digital-repository-of-artifacts-to-trace-design-evolution/articleshow/87807637.cms||---

Around 3pm on Friday, Shripal was seen sitting inside his truck accessories shop, but there were no customers. “For the last one year, my business has been suffering. I used to earn Rs 5,000-10,000 daily, but now my sales are a mere Rs 400-500 per day,” he said. Shripal said he would welcome any decision that would end this protest and the farmers leave the border. “My family is dependent on the shop,” he added. Dinesh Kumar was seen standing inside a car accessories shop and talking to other shopkeepers. “I used to sell ice cubes and slabs earlier, but after the protest started I lost my customers. It is a welcome step by the Prime Minister as it will help us in reviving our business,” he said. Shyam Singh, who works in a cloth store near the protest site, said, “If the roads are opened, then the public will come to our store to purchase clothes.” A few meters away from the cloth store there were small garages. In one of them, Dinesh was playing cards with the mechanics and other shopkeepers. “I remember there was a time when we were extremely busy handling customers, selling oil and repairing vehicles. Now, we have hardly any work, so we spend time playing cards,” he said. “In the past one year, I had only heard that various meetings were going on and some solution would come to end the stir, but nothing happened. How can I believe any announcement now? I have also heard that the farmers will continue their stir till the government scraps the laws in Parliament,” added Dinesh. Other garage owners and mechanics said the situation would change for them the day the protesters leave the border. Satender Singh, a petrol pump owner, said he was suffering loss since the agitation began. Asked whether he was happy with the government’s decision, he said he would be happy only when his business picked up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shopkeepers-and-traders-hope-to-resume-business/articleshow/87807646.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||Crackdown starts in Kolkata: 10 app cab drivers fined, 33 under lens||KOLKATA: Ten app cab drivers have been fined by traffic police in the past week for demanding a higher fare or behaving rudely with customers. Thirty-three others have been identified and are likely to be called to the police headquarters at Lalbazar. As police could not fine app cab drivers for refusal due to certain techno-legal constraints, they were penalizing drivers for being rude or asking for extra money, said an officer. The police action comes in the wake of multiple complaints from app cab passengers against drivers, who demand more than the fare or refused to report for the ride. Very often, drivers call up riders after bookings are made to ask about the destination, just like metered cabs do when hailed down. Many of them also want to know about the mode of payment. If the destinations are not to their liking or the mode of payment is not cash, many of them refuse the ride but they decline to cancel the bookings as that would draw a penalty. In certain complaints, riders said seven-eight drivers had cancelled trips, leaving them stranded for prolonged periods till a driver finally obliged. Police said they had also received complaints about drivers charging extra. “We are telling app-cab drivers that they cannot misbehave with riders. Those guilty are being identified, cautioned and even prosecuted,” a police officer said. Senior cops had earlier advised aggrieved passengers to take screenshots of their bookings and report refusals. Since then, cops have been swamped with complaints, which are being forwarded to the special raid section. Kolkata Traffic Police said it was seeking help of its legal cell on how to book refusal cases by public transport aggregators. In Hyderabad, the Cyberabad Police threatened aggregators with abetment charges if they declined to disclose the details of refusal cases. Police in Kolkata also plan to ask all app cab aggregators to share their cancellation policies. “We will ask about the permit provisions. An app cab is not like a normal state carriage, which can be flagged down on the road. It is booked through an app service, where app cab companies are not even owners of the vehicles. Hence, they enter into a contract with multiple clauses with their driver partners. Once we have studied the documents, we will ask app cab companies how they intended to address the issue and then spell out our measures,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crackdown-starts-10-app-cab-drivers-fined-33-under-lens/articleshow/87806967.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Trichy||Trichy: Solution in sight for Melapudur railway subway’s inundation woes||TRICHY: Facing strong criticism for poor maintenance of the railway subway at Melapudur in the city, the state highways department has initiated a permanent solution to prevent rainwater from inundating the subway. Two additional high-power motor pumps were installed in the subway that can even displace sludge in a short span. A new minor drain is also being built to prevent run-off water from entering the carriageway. Connecting Gandhi Market and Chathiram bus stand with Trichy central bus stand and railway junction, Melapudur subway is heavily used by the residents. However, even during a mild rain, it gets inundated with knee-level water as the run-off water from adjoining high-level localities storms the subway. Although the subway has six motor pumps to drain rainwater, officials said that time consumption was high. Citing inundation, cars and two-wheelers skip the subway, only to cause severe traffic congestions in other parts of the city including Cantonment and Palakkarai. It is in this backdrop that the highways department installed two high-power motor pumps costing Rs 7 lakh each. “The newly installed pumps with 100 mm diameter pipes can even suck the sludge and silt from the subway along with the rainwater. Within an hour, the pumps can remove the stagnated water,” a senior official with the department told TOI. This is the first time that the department has installed such ‘sludge’ pumps in the city. As the number of motor pumps has increased to eight now, officials said traffic snarls due to flooding will be streamlined. The subway has a well on either side to store the drawn rainwater from where the surplus will be discharged to drains. “We will also construct a small drain along the walls of the subway so that water seeping from the adjacent areas will be diverted to the sump. The carriageway will remain dry,” the official added. As the surplus water from adjacent areas was seeping into the carriageway, the subway gets slippery causing two-wheelers to skid. The small drain constructed will prevent the condition, the officials claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/solution-in-sight-for-melapudur-rly-subways-inundation-woes/articleshow/87807636.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||India||Farm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'||NEW DELHI: Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash. Reforms are now more likely to be pursued at the state level, with BJP governments expected to take the lead, but the effort to bring about market integration will be hurt in the absence of uniformity. Moreover, with farm reforms now likely to move in bits and pieces, the pace might be slow for those farmers who actually stand to benefit in the short to medium-term. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament."No government will now dare to bring much needed comprehensive reforms in the farm sector in the coming 50 years and majority of the farmers would now remain poor," Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on contentious farm laws, told TOI. Read AlsoFarm laws repealed, PM Modi appeals protesting farmers to return home: Key pointsPM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. Addressing the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, the Prime Minister said the three laws were for the benefit of farmersCalling the decision "quite unfortunate", Ghanwat, president of the Swatantra Bharat Paksha (political arm of the Maharashtra-based group Shetkari Sanghatana), said, "This (move to repeal) is the most regressive step by PM Modi as he chose politics over farmers' welfare. If the government had to repeal it, why would it wait for so long?" Government sources, however, drew a parallel with the abandonment of the land acquisition amendments in 2014-15 and said solutions were found through state-level changes. They said the reforms had in any case been stayed by the Supreme Court and the agitation was only creating more doubts. Ghanwat, who was on his way to Delhi, said he would meet other two members of the Committee -Ashok Gulati and P K Joshi - on Monday and take a call on making the report of the panel, submitted to the SC in March, public, saying those recommendations may help the new committee which the PM said would be set up for looking into different aspects of farming and issues relating to minimum support price (MSP). Officials in the agriculture ministry and other advocates of reforms too think the process would now get into the mode of the past practices of forming one after another panel without actually any result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-govt-will-dare-to-bring-full-reforms/articleshow/87808895.cms||Vishwa Mohan

At least 3,000 delegates — film enthusiasts and industry personalities — will converge in Panaji for Iffi 2021. The number of delegates on ground has been curtailed to be able to maintain Covid protocols. However, besides the 3,000, a few thousand will watch the screenings, masterclasses and other events virtually, as Iffi 2021 is being conducted in a hybrid format. Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur will inaugurate the festival. “We have put up a huge set as an attraction for the opening ceremony,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday evening, after reviewing the opening ceremony preparations at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium. “Goans and guests coming from across India and abroad will be able to participate in an amazing festival of a massive scale this year. It is the first international event being hosted by Goa, since Covid. We will host the event following all Covid protocols and norms. It is a challenge that our entire government machinery has accepted.” The previous Iffi was delayed and held in January 2021 in a muted manner, due to the raging pandemic at the time. Only around 300 guests are expected to attend the opening ceremony on Saturday afternoon. “The 52nd Iffi has many new things to offer. There were many challenges as Iffi is being held amidst a pandemic. Yet, efforts were made to get the biggest global films to the Iffi platform. It will also be the first time that the BRICS film festival will take place parallel to Iffi,” said Thakur, after arriving in Goa on Friday evening. Minister of state for information & broadcasting L Murugan will also be present at the opening ceremony. Renowned Indian actress and MP, Hema Malini, will participate in the opening ceremony, as she will be presented with the Indian film personality of the year 2021 award at the event. Lyricist and chairperson, CBFC, Prasoon Joshi, will be handed the same award on the closing day of Iffi. “Due to Covid, our seating capacity for the opening ceremony is limited, but Goans should not get disheartened. We have to follow SOPs and guidelines, so they may enjoy the festival from home. They can participate in the festival later, over the next eight days,” said vice-chairperson of the Entertainment Society of Goa, Subhash Phaldesai. The entire eight-day event is being hosted at a cost of nearly Rs 28 crore, pitched in both by the Centre and the state. Following the inaugural ceremony, the Spanish language film ‘The King of all the World’ (El Rey de Todo El Mundo), directed by Carlos Saura, will be screened as Iffi 2021’s opening film at Inox. Among the other invitees at the opening ceremony are Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, Ritesh Deshmukh, Genelia Deshmukh, and Shraddha Kapoor. Iffi this year will showcase over 300 films from across the globe. Filmmaker Karan Johar and television personality Manish Paul will host the opening event. Iffi will feature 148 films from about 73 countries in the international section with about 12 world premieres, about 7 international premieres, 26 Asia premieres and around 64 India premieres. The festival received 624 films from 95 countries this time, up from 69 countries in the previous edition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iffi-goas-1st-intl-event-since-covid-starts-today/articleshow/87807651.cms||---

Other than sharing the statements of Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda, most of the party leaders, MLAs or MPs refrained from expressing their own views/comments on social media.TOI called up party leaders, but they either didn’t respond or refused to comment on the subject. None of the BJP state leaders had an inkling of the PM’s move; they all learnt of it only when the announcement was made at 9 am from Delhi.Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, Kailash Choudhary who has been leaving no stone unturned to count the benefits of farm laws, chose to get away from the media in Jodhpur by stating, “Modi ji’s move is in the interest of the nation and the farmers”. He had a busy day on twitter accusing the Gehlot government of poor power connections, greeting Union minister Kiren Rijiju on his birthday etc. When it comes to the major announcement on farm laws, he retweeted or forwarded the tweets of Modi, Shah, Nadda and the official Twitter account of BJP, but did not offer his comments. BJP state president Satish Poonia who was on the fore batting for the three farm laws did offer his comment in the form of one ambiguous tweet. Throughout the day he forwarded the tweets of his central leaders on the subject. He extensively travelled across the length and breadth of the state calling the farm laws ‘masterstroke by Modi’ ‘game changer for farmers’ or ‘doubling farmers income’ didn’t come up with his one-liners in support of the repeal. Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari makes five tweets related to the zero budget farming committee on MSP announced by Modi but had nothing to say on the repelling of the Act. Other leaders like leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore were largely silent. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-leaders-largely-mum-on-pms-move/articleshow/87807649.cms||---

The accused had touched the child’s cheeks and chest. While he claimed he had bumped into her by mistake after he slipped on the road and had apologised, the child and her mother told court that when they protested he had said, “Ha, kiya to kiya.” Refuting his defence, special judge H C Shende said, “Every woman has inherited bashfulness and she knows the difference between such an intentional act of molestation and the act of an innocent person, and act out of a mistake. Certainly, the victim felt ashamed and realized his act was intentional.” The court also observed that since there was no enmity between the child and the accused, it did not find any reason to disbelieve her testimony.  “There was no reason for the informant (mother) and victim to create a false story against the accused for filing a baseless FIR and put their character at stake, and invite humiliation from society,” the court said. Special public prosecutor Geeta Malankar cited evidence of six witnesses, including the child and her mother, to seek his conviction. The mother and daughter told court that on March 11, 2019, at 7.45pm, when they were about to enter a shop, the accused came from the front and molested the girl. The mother pushed him away, shouted at him and sought help from people at the spot. They caught the accused and beat him up. The mother and another person who she knew from the crowd took the accused away from the mob. They went to the police station and an FIR was lodged. The accused was taken in custody. While sentencing him, the court said the gravity of the offence was more since the incident took place in a public place. It said there was a need of giving adequate punishment to send the true message to such persons who are taking disadvantage of innocence of such victims. The accused was also fined Rs3,000. The money if recovered, will be paid to the child as compensation.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s own agri bills still pending with governor Kalraj Mishra||JAIPUR: Rajasthan was among the few states that introduced its own bills to counter the Centre’s three farm laws to protect farmers’ interests. The Essential Commodities bill 2020, the Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services bill 2020 and the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce bill 2020 — were passed by the Rajasthan assembly last October. The bills were designed to either nullify or provide viable options to farmers against the provisions of the Centre’s farm laws. The state bills are, however, pending with governor Kalraj Mishra, before they would go to the President for his assent. Sources said that the repeal of the three controversial farm laws would make many of the provisions in these bills irrelevant but still, the state would push them since they have certain provisions safeguarding the interests of the farmers. Following Congress’ Central leaders’ direction of exploring the legal routes to counter the farm bills, Punjab and Rajasthan moved three bills for the same. “Gehlot has been pushing Mishra for the bills to be moved to the President in almost all of his visits to the governor house since last October,” said a source at the governor house. The main provision of the bill which was played by the Congress leaders is granting farmers a farming agreement that will be valid only if the price of the product is equal to or greater than the prevailing minimum support price. “The provision of imprisonment of 3-7 years without penalty if any person or corporate harasses the farmers,” reads the bill. The bills invited sharp reactions from Central government which had accused Gehlot government of crossing the line of cooperative federalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/states-own-agri-bills-still-pending-with-guv-mishra/articleshow/87807643.cms||---

They are now hiring couriers who tie drug packets on their legs and use public transport such as buses to move from one city to another. In the recent past, police have made arrests in various districts including Bhilwara, Chittorgarh and Jodhpur in which the smugglers were found concealing the packets in their legs. CID-CB wing, Narcotics Control Bureau and the district police in Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Jalore and Jodhpur are continuously working to crack down on the smugglers. “On Wednesday, our team caught a man who had tied opium packets on his legs and thighs. He was intercepted and arrested while he was moving in a bus. He was nabbed with 1kg of opium,” said an officer of Bhilwara police on Thursday. The accused was nabbed by a team of Rayla police station area. “Based on a specific input, thus we raided a bus in which we found Leeladhar Sharma with illegal possession of 1kg of opium,” said a senior officer. According to an estimate by Bhilwara and Chittorgarh police, at least two dozen such cases were cracked by them. “They use this trick to evade arrest.

However, they said protest will continue till farm laws were formally repealed in the parliament and a law was passed to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce.They stated that it was a victory of democracy and farmers, a one-year-long movement, and a defeat of dictatorship. In a statement, the Rajasthan wing of Samyunkt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stated it will wait for the announcement to take effect through appropriate parliamentary procedures. "If this happens, it will be a historic victory for the farmers’ movement that has been going on for a year. However, around 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The stubbornness of the central government is responsible for these avoidable deaths, including the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre," it stated."SKM also wants to remind the Prime Minister that the farmers’ movement is not just about repealing the three black laws, but also ensuring legal guarantee of MSP for all agricultural produce. This important demand of the farmers is still pending. Similarly, the Electricity Amendment bill is yet to be withdrawn," the statement issued by Sanjay Madhav added.Rajasthan’s peasant leaders, such as Rajaram Meel, Ram Pal Jat and Himmat Singh, also welcomed the decision of the Centre, but emphasised their demand to ensure a legal guarantee of MSP for agricultural produce. Convenor of Hanumangarh’s Grameen Kiaan Majdoor Samity (GKS), Ranjit Singh Raju, said, "This is a victory of democracy and the defeat of dictatorship. This is a good sign for the whole country. We will continue our protest till the farm laws are repealed in the Parliament and a gazette notification is issued in this regard. Laws should be framed respecting the sentiments of the people of the country."Ram Pal Jat of Kisan Mahasabha said, "This is a huge victory of the farmers’ long movement. The Prime Minister should legalise MSP now. Regardless of the pressure under which he (the PM) made this announcement, this is in the right direction. The fact that he said the laws would be repealed in the next session of parliament can’t be disbelieved." Another farmer leader, Himmat Singh, said, "The protest at Shahjahanpur will continue till the farm laws are repealed in Parliament and MSP is legalised. Also, this is a victory for the movement and all those martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for this struggle." Rajaram Meel, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said, "They (government) succumbed under pressure because they (BJP) knew they would be defeated in upcoming elections (Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and other states)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unions-hail-decision-say-stir-over-msp-to-continue/articleshow/87807656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The transfer order was issued on Thursday night following a complaint lodged with the civic body’s solid waste management department by a manager of a commercial store. In his complaint, the store manager alleged that the KMC official had demanded money for collection of garbage from the store and when refused, dumped waste in front of the store. According to a KMC official, the civic top brass took the complaint seriously and decided to transfer the overseer to a borough located in the southern fringe. However, the owner of the store was also asked to pay requisite fees as applicable for collection of wastes from a commercial establishment. According to the KMC board of administrators member overseeing the civic body’s solid waste management department Debabrata Majumdar, though the matter was serious, it was a stray case and a section of the traders or businessmen was to blame for inviting troubles. “Instead of paying requisite fees for collection of wastes to the civic body’s coffer, a section of traders insists on making payments to individual officials who oversee the garbage removal of a particular commercial zone. We won’t spare our errant employees, we shall also keep a vigil over the owners of commercial establishments who won’t pay the fees to the civic body,” Majumdar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-shunts-solid-waste-overseer-seeking-bribe/articleshow/87806979.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore Medical College Hospital doctors remove needle from girl’s neck||COIMBATORE: Doctors of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital gave a new lease of life to a 19-year-old girl by removing a 7.5-cm-long sewing needle from her neck. The girl was brought to the hospital a fortnight ago with self-inflicted neck injuries. “Though she was treated for the wounds, the girl complained of neck pain. A scan revealed presence of a sharp foreign body. The needle had penetrated trachea and passed through c4-c5 vertebra and located close to an artery. It was no less than a miracle that it dodged vertebral artery and neural foramina. Had it puncture the artery, she would have died within minutes,” head of the department of ENT Dr Ali Sulthan told TOI. Doctors discussed the case and decided to conduct a surgery a week ago. “It was a challenging case given the location of the needle. It was closely abutting right vertebral artery, which carry blood to the brain and spine and right neural foramina, which is a critical structure in the spine that contain nerve roots,” the doctor said. A team consisting of Sulthan, ENT assistant professor Dr M Nallasivam, Neurosurgery HoD Dr Venkatesh, associate professor of neurosurgery Dr Anandha Shanmugaraj, Anesthesiology HoD Dr Kalyasundaram and anesthetist Dr M Sathya conducted the surgery. “The process of removing the foreign body was complicated. The latest C- arm x-ray helped us to locate it,” Sulthan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-docs-remove-needle-from-girls-neck/articleshow/87807661.cms||---
---||Jaipur||A victory of democracy & defeat of arrogance: Gehlot||Jaipur: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to repeal the three controversial farm laws on Friday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot termed the development a “victory of democracy” and “defeat of arrogance”. Gehlot claimed that the Modi government has taken this decision out of panic in view of the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.“The announcement of repealing all the three black agricultural laws is a victory of democracy and defeat of the arrogance of the Modi government. This is a victory for the patience of the farmers who have been agitating for the last one year,” Gehlot tweeted.“I bow to all the farmers who sacrificed their lives in the farmers’ movement. This is the victory of their sacrifice,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Friday morning announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. While talking to reporters at the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters, Gehlot said that the Centre has failed to understand the sentiments and the farmers of the country and remained arrogant, due to which the farmers’ movement continued for a year and hundreds of farmers were killed. “In Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister himself will camp for three days. To win the election, the PM himself and his national president JP Nadda, former chief minister Rajnath Singh and Union home minister Amit Shah, have been entrusted with the responsibility of booth management there. Today’s decision is also being taken after looking at the Uttar Pradesh elections,” Gehlot said. He said, “Guess from this, how much panic is there among them. Due to this panic, they had to make a decision today.” Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra said Congress has always stood by farmers and will continue to stand by them. He claimed that the arrogance and dishonesty of the BJP and its Central government has been ‘exposed’.Dotasra said, “They should apologise and fulfil their promises, including doubling the farmers’ income. This is what democracy is, but there is no hope from them.” Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot also called it the victory of farmers. Pilot tweeted, “After a long struggle, farmers have won today. The government’s arrogance had to bow before the voice of truth and justice raised by the peasant power and the three anti-agriculture laws had to be withdrawn. Farmers have written history by shedding their blood, through renouncement and sacrifice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-victory-of-democracy-defeat-of-arrogance-gehlot/articleshow/87807664.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Scientists of IFGTB develop eucalyptus, punnai clones||COIMBATORE: The Institute of Forest Genetic and Tree Breeding (IFGTB) at RS Puram here has developed two clones of eucalyptus hybrids that would grow 10% more than the best eucalyptus clone available with the institute now. The new clones are the result of several years of research by a team of scientists led by D Rajasugunasekar. They worked with interspecific hybrids from three different species - eucalyptus tereticornis, eucalyptus camaldulensis and eucalyptus grandis - to develop the new ones. Rajasugunasekar said while they had developed 11 clones so far, this was the first time they developed hybrid clones through a means of controlled pollination. “The clones are developed from known father and mother tree species, technically called as full-sib selection.” Another group of scientists led by R Anandalakshmi has, meanwhile, developed six new clones of calophyllum inophyllum, commonly called as ‘tamanu’ or ‘mastwood’ or punnai tree (in Tamil). The trees are cultivated for their fruits that contain high oil content. They are used for skin treatment. While the tree variety from unimproved seed source could yield up to 4.3kg fruit per tree per year, the improved variety could yield up to 6kg fruit. “Punnai is an environmentally friendly tree, which serves as a good bioshield on beaches, grows in varied soil types and supports apiculture and agroforestry. It is a beautiful tree for urban forestry and it can be grown along roadsides and highways,” Anandalakshmi said. The new punnai clones have 50% more oil content than the normal ones and starts yielding in six years, which is two years earlier than the normal ones. One litre of pure punnai oil could fetch Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000. C Kunhikannan, director, IFGTB, said the variety releasing committee of the Indian Council of Forestry and Research Education approved the clones on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/scientists-of-ifgtb-develop-eucalyptus-punnai-clones/articleshow/87807668.cms||---

Kumar said that the tourism department has already issued a work order to a private firm to revamp the Santa Monica jetty, and a similar effort is on to upgrade other jetties in the state so that they can be used for passenger commute and tourism. Kumar also announced that the state government has approved the notification of the Goa tourism board, which will have equal representation from the tourism industry. He said that the first meeting of the board is slated for early December. “There are various authorities who are involved in managing the affairs of the jetties in the state, we have captain of ports, tourism department and fisheries department. We are looking to have a policy which will regulate the affairs of tourism-related activities on these jetties. It will be notified soon,” said Kumar, speaking at a conference on nautical tourism organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry. Kumar said that the upgradation of the Santa Monica jetty, which is being done through private participation, will take close to two years. “There are a few jetties which are there either underutilised or unutilised... we need to ensure that these jetties are utilised to the maximum possible extent,” said Kumar. He said that inputs provided by CII and stakeholders from the tourism department are being incorporated in the tourism master plan and the tourism policy. “We have also been able to get the approval of the government for notifying the Goa tourism board, an industry-driven policy and program which will cater to the development of tourism in the state of Goa,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jetty-mgmt-policy-for-tourism-devpt-set-to-be-notified/articleshow/87807667.cms||Newton Sequeira

Vimala Chorotiya, Nita Kalsekar and Bani Debnath wanted to take a happy selfie outside Mulund tehsil office on November 18 but rain played spoilsport. Two months ago, the victory signs of this trio leapt off newspapers when Bombay high court directed the Maharashtra government to disburse a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the women whose husbands, Santosh Kalsekar, Govind Chorotiya and Vishwajit Debnath, had died while cleaning a septic tank in a housing society in Govandi in December 2019. While the women received the first installment of Rs 1.25 lakh immediately after the verdict, Rs 8.75 lakh came after two months. Thrilled on receiving the cheque, Chorotiya wanted to freeze the jubilant moment in a selfie. “But the sky was overcast, the photos came out dark,” said Chorotiya (38), a Kurla resident who called up all who helped her through her two-year battle to express gratitude. Among them was a retiree, Kishore Parikh, who had been sending her Rs2,000 each month to help her pay her daughters’' school fees. “He congratulated me but said that he would continue to send me money,” said Chorotiya, who deposited her cheque on November 20. “One tension is over, but the real fight begins now,” said Chorotiya, hinting at a criminal case the trio is pursuing against the management of the housing society in Chembur where their husbands died.

---||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput drugs case: Rahila Furniturewala gets bail, court says no material on trafficking||MUMBAI: Granting bail to Rahila Furniturewala over nine months after her arrest in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) drugs case connected to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, a special NDPS court this week held there is no material at all disclosing her prima facie involvement in financing, illegal trafficking and harbouring of offenders. The court also pointed out that no contraband was seized from her. “The investigation is over and the chargesheet has been filed. In such circumstances, nothing can be achieved by keeping the accused behind bars for an indefinite period. The majority of other accused, having more serious allegations, have already been released on bail. In such circumstances, the present accused is also entitled to be released on bail on the ground of parity,” said special judge D B Mane. Bandra resident Rahila was accused of purchasing one gram MDMA (commonly known as ecstacy) from alleged jailed peddler Anuj Keshwani for her friend in January 2020, for which she allegedly paid him Rs 6,000. The prosecution alleged that during investigations, Keshwani disclosed Rahila’s name. The FIR in the case was registered last year. Rahila was arrested in the case on February 4 this year. She was also booked in a separate drugs case involving Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law, Sameer Khan. Rahila has been granted bail in the other case too. In the Rajput related case, arguing for bail, her advocate Taraq Sayyad said she has been falsely implicated. The defence further submitted that no contraband was seized or recovered at her instance and there is no evidence connecting her to Keshwani and the alleged deal. It was also submitted that his statement was not admissible as evidence. The prosecution strongly opposed the bail plea. It was alleged that she also approached Keshwani offering him ganja and CBD at the rate of Rs 1,800 per gram on behalf of another accused. The prosecution said this showed that she had conspired to finance illicit traffic and harbour offenders, procure, possess, sell and purchase, transport, import inter-state, export inter-state and was involved in dealing in ganja. The court said there was no specific allegation about Rahila harbouring anyone. “There is no material at all disclosing the prima facie involvement of present accused in either financing illegal trafficking and harbouring the offenders. In such circumstances, the rigors of Section 37 of NDPS Act is not applicable to the present accused,” the court said. Under Section 37, no accused under Section 27A for trafficking and harbouring offenders or offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is not guilty. — Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rahila-gets-bail-court-says-no-material-on-trafficking/articleshow/87808606.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Farmers and agriculture activists are demanding an immediate solution to the burning issue as well as a clarification on the procurement of parboiled rice. Paddy procurement has been slow in the state owing to untimely rains and 90% of the harvest is yet to be procured. “There is confusion on what the Centre and the state government are saying. The state government is taking about the paddy procurement of the rabi season, while the BJP state unit is talking about the delay in paddy procurement in this season. Both are avoiding uncomfortable questions, but farmers are in despair,” agriculture scientist GV Ramanjaneyulu said. The Centre said on Thursday that it was verifying the state’s request for extra procurement this season, but did not mention anything about parboiled rice in the coming season, but asked the state to limit supplies. Farmers are also concerned about switching to other crops. “The government is now urging us to move to other crops, but we cannot do so because thorough conversion takes a lot of time,” said Mohammad Gouse, a farmer from Narayanpet. Finance minister T Harish Rao urged centra government to purchase parboiled rice from Telangana. He said the state government will buy rainy season produce and that arrangements have been made. “But the Centre must buy 90% of total production of paddy from Telangana in the same way that it does from Punjab,” he said. He alleged that the Centre was adopting double standards. “We will expose their duplicity. Procurement is delayed this season due to continuous rainfall and paddy has not dried up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-in-state-cagey-about-procurement-of-parboiled-rice/articleshow/87807682.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A call on pulling down the security apparatus will be taken only on the basis of the crowd and intel inputs. Senior officers TOI spoke to said so far no instructions had been issued and the deployment would continue. “Most farmer leaders are in Punjab for gurupurab. We were already in talks with them due to the upcoming event on November 26, when it’s the anniversary of their movement, as well as the call given by them for a march to Parliament on November 29,” said a senior officer. “Since the Prime Minister’s announcement, the status of the scheduled events might change, so we are waiting for the leaders to return and their governing body to meet and tell us their decision to decide the future course of action,” added the officer. Rakesh Asthana, Delhi Police commissioner, had earlier stated that the decision to remove barricades at the Ghazipur and Tikri borders was taken to send out a positive message after talks with farmer leaders and UP and Haryana cops. The farmers’ protest had caused road closures, making interstate vehicular movement difficult for people. “After holding talks with farmer leaders and UP and Haryana police, it was decided to open the borders and create a positive atmosphere,” Asthana had said. Delhi Police had been apprehensive about the law and order situation at the borders after the Republic Day violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-to-assess-situation-keep-security-intact-at-the-borders/articleshow/87807694.cms||---

The figure included issuing of around 19,600 certificates by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in its four zones, 11,320 by the east corporation in its two zones and 24,000 in the north corporation’s six zones. Though around 70,000 vendors were identified by the three civic bodies during the phase I survey, which was completed on September 30, the applications of many vendors have been put on hold as they could not submit all documents or had other lapses. “We had identified 20,000 vendors in east Delhi, but zonal offices found some issues such as correction in addresses, names or shortage of documents in many cases,” said an official. An SDMC official said, “Now that the Delhi government has extended the survey till December 7, the zonal teams have started coordinating with the vending committee members to cover the rest.” In north Delhi, the civic body will resume the survey from early December. “We are expecting to have around 40,000 vendors in six zones,” said Yogesh Verma, former leader of House at the north corporation. The corporation is mostly handing over the certificates to vendors visiting the zonal offices, added Verma. “This is done to avoid delay and give the certificates to the right person.” By month-end, the corporation may depute licensing inspectors to dispatch the remaining certificates. The deliberative wing even held public events to distribute certificates. SDMC, however, is mailing the certificates through postal services, standing committee chairman Col (retd) B K Oberoi. “We spoke to the commissioner and it has been agreed that a copy of the certificate will also be given to area councillors for reference and distribution by next week,” he said. “This will also help area representatives to figure out people who are not covered so far,” Oberoi pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corporations-issue-vending-papers-to-55000-in-phase-i/articleshow/87807731.cms||Vibha Sharma

Vehicles moved at snail’s pace and drivers had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to make it through the crossroads owing to the heavy traffic.  With state transport buses not plying because of the ongoing strike by a section of MSRTC employees, people travelling to to various parts of the district and state had to take cabs and other private transport.  Much of the chaos was caused by cabs, private buses and other private vehicles stopping and parking haphazardly at Dwarka junction to pick up passengers. Most of these passengers were headed towards Mumbai, Sinnar, Shirdi, Pune, Malegaon and Dhule. A police constable said that after the number of vehicles started increasing at the junctions, additional police personnel were sent there to streamline the flow of traffic. “However, the constables summoned were still insufficient in number as most personnel of the city police were assigned for security at the recruitment examination of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police scheduled from 3pm to 4.30pm on Friday,” the constable said. Other policemen said that owing to the arrangement for the exam, most traffic junctions had poor police deployment. DCP (Zone 2) Vijay Kharat said a force of close to 1,000 personnel, comprising a DCP, 2 ACPs, 14 PIs, 65 PSIs, 743 constables and 120 women constables, had been deployed for security for the exam. The arrangement was for 30 centres in the city where approximately 13,800 aspirants took the test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traffic-chaos-reigns-on-nashik-roads-dwarka-junction-worst-hit/articleshow/87805696.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Firefighting system goes kaput, blaze at Vile Parle mall injures 2||MUMBAI: In yet another instance of negligence, a fire at Vile Parle’s Prime Mall on Friday morning, that could have been doused easily to avert a major mishap, flared up and injured two people due to non-functional fire fighting system inside the structure. Located in the busy Irla Market lane, the mall has shops selling electronic items and mobile phone service stores. The injured include a fireman who was involved in the fire fighting operations. Fire brigade officials said a notice would be served to the mall shortly. Times ViewIn virtually every big fire in Mumbai, the fire-fighting equipment of the building — be it a residential tower, hospital, office complex or mall—was found to be non-functional. Periodic fire drills, regularly updating of safety manuals and inspection of fire-fighting apparatus in high rise buildings must not remain only on paper. The fire brigade must therefore be strict on compliance and take stringent action against violators.The blaze erupted on the first floor of the ground-plus-three storey structure around 10am when business for the day had not begun full fledged. The fire brigade rushed 16 fire engines, 11 water tankers, ambulances and its turntable ladders to the site. It took the fire brigade over three hours to cover the blaze from all sides to ensure it does not spread further. The injured have been identified as Mubasir Mohammed, 20, who was admitted in Cooper Hospital and fireman Mangesh Gaonkar, 54, who sustained minor injuries and is under treatment. A senior fire brigade official said their aim was to control the flames from spreading. “However, the fire fighting system, although present, was not functional thus hampering our operations. It being a completely air conditioned premise, there was not adequate ventilation available initially and we had to try to make arrangements for allowing the smoke to be let out. Also, anticipating that there was a lot of inflammable material inside the premises, we were very cautious to cover the fire from all sides as quickly as possible,” said an official. Dhaval Shah of the Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens Association said the fire brigade made the right move by immediately restricting traffic movement in the area. “Irla Market lane, where the mall is located, is very congested. Had the fire taken place during the evening hours, it could have been a disaster considering the high vehicular and pedestrian movement in the area. Besides, the hawkers that occupy almost one whole lane add to congestion. The administration should be strict in case of fire fighting systems not working in such commercial structures as it puts the lives of many people who visit them at risk,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-firefighting-system-goes-kaput-blaze-at-vile-parle-mall-injures-2/articleshow/87808644.cms||Richa Pinto

A sizable number of students, along with the examiners travel via MSRTC buses to the exam centres. Dr Ajit Pathak, the varsity’s controller of examination, told TOI, “Despite problems in availability of the buses, the attendance of the students in the practical exam has been over 98%, which is extremely noteworthy. Similarly, the examiners too travelled to the assigned colleges located either in their home districts or other districts to conduct the examination although the MSRTC buses are unavailable.” Over 45,000 first, second and third year health science undergraduate students and over 1,000 examiners are involved in the practical exams that started from November 8, the day the MSRTC staffers went on strike. The exam will continue till the end of this month. The practical exams are underway for several courses like allopathy, homoeopathy, ayurveda, dental, nursing, speech therapy, physiotherapy etc. The varsity’s examination department has been overseeing the smooth conduct of the practical examination under the guidance of the new MUHS VC, Lt Gen (Dr) Madhuri Kanitkar (retd) and the registrar, Kalidas Chavan. The MUHS examination department has set a deadline for completing the summer 2021 UG health science examinations by the end of this month as it was delayed due to the pandemic. The theory examination has been completed last month. Insiders of the varsity said they were apprehensive about the smooth conduct of the practical examination as both the examinees and examiners would face problems while commuting due to the MSRTC strike. “We had to alter the dates of only a handful of practical examinations as the examiners could not make it to the exam centre. But the majority of the exams were conducted as per schedule without any hiccups,” said Pathak. Meanwhile, MUHS has announced the schedule for the winter 2021 theory postgraduate medical examination for courses like MD (all specialities), MS (all specialities), MSc (Microbiology & Med Biochemistry). The exams will be conducted between November 20 and November 26.

---||Hyderabad||Paddy procurement goes at snail’s pace in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The farmers in Telangana are a worried lot as procurement of paddy is going at snail’s pace. Of the over one crore metric tonnes of Vaanakalam paddy targeted to be purchased by the government, less than 15 lakh metric tonnes have been procured till date. The slow pace of procurement is resulting in the farmers selling their paddy directly to either the rice millers or the traders in the private market at a much lesser price than Rs 1,960 per quintal MSP. The farmers associations have blamed it on the state stating that the government is intentionally slowing down the paddy procurement to wash its hands off the huge task. As if this was not enough, there is a delay on the part of the civil supplies department officials to deposit money into the bank accounts of the farmers for the paddy purchased from them. Sources said Rs 2,300 crore worth paddy has been procured from nearly 2 lakh farmers but less than 50,000 farmers got money into their bank accounts. One reason for delay is failure on the part of officials to host the details of the farmers on the online procurement management system (OPMS). All India Kisan Congress vice president M Kodanda Reddy charged TRS of not being committed to buy paddy. “Government has announced that it will procure every grain of paddy only to keep itself in the good books of the farmers. It knows that a farmer cannot wait for a long time and will sell his paddy to private merchants even at a lesser price, ” he alleged. Telangana rice millers association president Gampa Nagender said rice mills in the state have capacity to store another 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy as on date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-procurement-goes-at-snails-pace/articleshow/87807735.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two youths kidnap bizman, murder him to avoid arrest; accused held||NEW DELHI: Two men in their early 20s have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a businessman for a ransom of Rs 1 crore and then killing him to avoid arrest. The accused have been identified as Tanveer Alam and Mohammed Sharif, residents of Kishanganj in Bihar who worked in Paharganj hotels. After receiving a call about a body lying at Jawalapuri in west Delhi, a police team reached the spot where the cops from Kosli near Haryana’s Rewari were also present. The deceased was identified as Yogesh (32), a resident of Rewari who ran a Safal store in Paharganj. His father said Yogesh had left home for Delhi on November 16. In the evening, his wife, Anjali, received a call from his number. Claiming that he had abducted Yogesh, the caller demanded that Rs 1 crore be delivered near Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid, the father said. Yogesh’s family reached the local police station in Kosli and came to Delhi with a cop from Haryana Police while the caller kept calling for the ransom. The relatives reached the mosque around 2am on November 17, but the caller asked them to come to Dilli Gate and then to Daryaganj. Finally, they were asked to stand in front of an ATM booth on the main road. The cops caught one of the men, later identified as Alam, who came to collect the ransom while Sharif managed to escape. Alam allegedly said they had murdered Yogesh as he knew them. The accused took police and Yogesh’s relatives to B9, camp number 4 in Jawalapuri from where the victim’s body was recovered. A case was registered at Paschim Vihar (west) police station. Yogesh’s mobile phone and a key of the room where he was murdered were recovered from Alam. The accused allegedly said he and Sharif used to work at different hotels in Paharganj, but were fed up with their meagre earnings and poor living condition. A few months ago, they made a plan to kidnap someone for ransom to turn their fortune and zeroed in on Yogesh after overhearing that he had a lot of property in Haryana. The accused were aware that Yogesh would come to Delhi from home on November 16. They bought a rope and two pieces of cloth to tie him up and managed to take him to their rented accommodation in Jawalapuri. The accused reportedly claimed that they strangled Yogesh to death even before making the ransom call as he tried to escape after refusing them to pay and also threatened to expose them before police. Meanwhile, police also caught Sharif on the basis of Alam’s information. Both are remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-youths-kidnap-bizman-murder-him-to-avoid-arrest/articleshow/87807737.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Dirty message to fiancée is not an insult to her modesty: Court||MUMBAI: Observing that sending “obscene messages” to a woman one is going to marry cannot be termed as insulting her modesty, a sessions court acquitted a now 36-year-old man, 11 years after he was booked for cheating and raping her under the false promise of marriage. The court held that sending such messages in premarital period may delight and give the feeling that someone is close enough to understand one’s emotions. “If at all those are not liked by the other side, it has discretion with it to convey its displeasure to the other side, and the other side generally avoids a repeat of such a mistake. The purpose was to put up his expectation before her, to arouse her with similar feeling of sex, which may give happiness even to her, etc. But in no way those SMSs can be said as were sent to insult her modesty,” the court said. The woman lodged an FIR in 2010. The couple had met on a matrimonial site in 2007 and tried to marry despite opposition. The mother of the accused was against the match and refused to let him stay in either of the homes after the proposed marriage. In 2010, the man broke up the relationship. Acquitting the man of rape charges, the court said every breach of promise to marry cannot be termed cheating or rape. The court said the accused was was in relationship for more than two years, had initially taken a house on rent and later renovated a flat belonging to his family. “He had even been to Arya Samaj Hall with mangalsutra but it was the quarrel on the ground of stay after marriage and thereafter, by getting tired of his indecisiveness and getting surrendered before his mother’s wish and failing to handle and tackle the problem stood before him in proper manner, he came back. But it is certainly not the case of false promise of marriage. It is the case of failure to make substantial efforts,” the court said. It said it was not necessary for the woman to have allowed the accused to have sex with her prior to marriage. The court said she opted for it, believing blindly that they would marry, even though she was aware of opposition. “Even after respecting emotions of the informant (woman), respecting her fighting for justice for 11 years or more, this court is of humble opinion that this is not a case which would show that the offence of rape has been committed,” the court said. The parents of the accused were also booked in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dirty-msg-to-woman-one-is-to-marry-not-an-insult/articleshow/87808970.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ahmedabad||No new roads damaged in 3 years: AMC chief to Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar filed an affidavit in the Gujarat high court and claimed that no new roads have been damaged in last three years. He has asserted that he and his subordinates have diligently followed the court directions to improve city road quality, smoothen traffic movement, creating parking facilities and stop stray cattle nuisance on public streets. The commissioner was ordered to file an affidavit by the court in response to a petition accusing the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) of not fully complying with court directions issued in 2018 on a PIL filed after city roads were badly damaged in the 2017 monsoon. His affidavit reads, “So far as the new roads falling within defect liability of three years are concerned, none are damaged in last three years and so far as repairing work is concerned, it is periodically addressed by concerned engineering department.” He has attributed the marked improvement of road quality, the claim that is under challenge in the petition, to AMC’s decisions taken after the HC directions to maintain roads in good condition. He stated that the city has 2,580km of roads, of which 200km roads can be absolutely resurfaced or reconstructed every year considering finance and priority. He, however, also clarified that he has little say in clearance of projects related to roads which was mostly above Rs 30 lakh. This is because he has powers to finalise tenders up to Rs 30 lakh, and beyond this a nod from the standing committee is needed. Kumar claimed that various initiatives were undertaken like appointing six project management consultant to monitor on day-to-day basis the road construction and maintenance, request to the government to expeditiously finalize the Town Planning schemes to “achieve ultimate goal to have good quality of roads within city limit with proper checks and balance”. AMC also constructed and resurfaced 10 roads by using waste plastic material, but this was not found feasible. The commissioner also stated that for last three years, AMC holds meeting with all Road Opening (RO) agencies and planning for the whole city is finalized in advance so that digging of new roads can be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-new-roads-damaged-in-3-years/articleshow/87807101.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NGT lens on old polluting vehicles||KOLKATA: The NGT eastern regional bench of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) gave top priority to the phasing out of old polluting vehicles, both commercial and private, especially those below the standard of BS-IV. The NGT’s observation came in the wake of a petition filed by environment activist Ankur Sharma in connection with the plying of 13 commercial vehicles without permit and valid PUC certificate. The bench observed that the exemption to BS-III compliant vehicles is an antithesis of the environmental law and a licence to pollute the air — which is detrimental to the health of people — in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. All considerations override environmental health and sustainable development principle as well as the precautionary principle, which are now accepted as part of Article 21 of the Constitution. In pursuance of the orders of NGT dated August 11, 2016 and May 26, 2017, non-BS-IV transport vehicles registered outside the jurisdiction of Kolkata and Howrah were not allowed to remain in the city after seven days. An exemption has been allowed to BS-III compliant inter-regional stage carriages that ply on designated routes and enter the city during specified time schedules. Similarly, an exemption has been allowed to BS-III compliant All-Bengal Contract Carriage registered outside Kolkata, which carry passengers to the city only on contract as per the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the bench observed. It is high time for the state to ensure that the public transport vehicles below BS-IV are phased out rapidly and that only BS-VI vehicles ply. A committee was constituted by the transport department regarding the phasing out of old commercial vehicles following the Vardhaman Kaushik Judgment. From March 2020 onwards, the committee could not meet regularly due to the pandemic. The committee needs some more time to submit its findings and recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-lens-on-old-polluting-vehicles/articleshow/87807092.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

We will never find them. Our attempt is to reach as close to 100% (as possible),” said a senior DHS official. Two months ago, chief minister Pramod Sawant had declared that by October-end, the eligible population would be fully vaccinated, but subsequently, the deadline was pushed to November 15. The health official said that it is not possible to give an exact date by when the entire eligible population will be fully vaccinated, as plenty of people took their first dose recently, and their turn for the second dose is yet to come. Every day, 400-500 people are vaccinated with their first dose; they are either those who earlier declined to get vaccinated, or reached eligibility now. Last month, the DHS had announced that about 2.1 lakh people were yet to take their second dose even after the completion of the 12-week gap, but the officer said that the figure was erroneous. The actual number is around 75,000, he said, adding that due to technical errors, names of many vaccinated persons reflect as unvaccinated. “Since last month, many of them may have been fully vaccinated, as every day, an average 5,000 people are getting their second dose,” he said. After it came to their notice that many were not taking their second dose, the DHS started a drive, and the help of civic body members and others was taken to reach out to people in their respective areas. As of Thursday, Over 9.8 lakh people were fully vaccinated, and 2.66 lakh have received their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goal-is-to-get-as-close-to-100-as-possible-dhs-official-on-vax-drive/articleshow/87807777.cms||---

Demanding all farmers who died during the protests be declared martyrs, a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the families of each of those who died and government jobs for their kin, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said the decision to take back the laws was forced on BJP by its fear of losing the upcoming state polls. “It has also been proved that Narendra Modi and his government only work for elections and it was the fear of losing elections that forced you to take this step,” Singh said after paying tributes to the farmers who had died during the protests. Referring to the PM’s speech of Friday, Singh asked what he was doing when farmers were being targeted with tear gas, when they were barricaded using spikes and made to feel like residents of an enemy territory and when they were being lathicharged. He also hit out at the government for setting up a panel on MSP saying that would mean that the issue would be put in cold storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-declare-farmers-who-died-martyrs/articleshow/87808276.cms||Neha Lalchandani

She has also asked for a law to be brought in for minimum support price. “The year-long protests by farmers, who braved the cold, heat and rain to stand against the three farm laws that were forced on their heads by the central government have finally brought some result. The Centre has finally taken the delayed decision to roll back these laws for which I congratulate the farmers,” the former UP chief minister said, adding that had the Centre taken this decision earlier, the country would have been spared various conflicts and chaos.

With this, Pench now has 308 species of birds, as a survey years ago had led to bird experts identifying 164 species. The area of Pench was 257 sq km when the first bird survey was done identifying 164 species. Last November, when the first bird week was being celebrated, former field director RS Govekar had signed an MoU with Central India Bird Academy (CIBA), Nagpur, to conduct a fresh survey. As per the MoU, the CIBA team identified whether Pench was a habitat for endemic forest owlet, studied breeding of Malabar hornbills, and water birds at Navegaon Khairy and Totladoh reservoir, and capacity building of field staff. Over the last year, the CIBA team led by Dr Anil Pimplapure, Nitin Marathe, Jayant Wadatkar, and Gajanan Wagh conducted workshops to sensitize the staff. A WhatsApp group was created involving field staff, who used to post pictures of birds recorded in the tiger reserve. The CIBA team used to identify them. This helped the staff enhance their knowledge about the birds. All the bird species found in all the seasons were recorded and the list was released in the just concluded bird week. Deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Rahul Gavai said, “A similar MoU for a rapid survey of birds and their habitats has been signed with CIBA for Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pench-adds-144-bird-species-to-its-checklist/articleshow/87807129.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No drug recovery: Minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law; moves Bombay high court to quash NCB case||MUMBAI: Sameer Khan, son-in-law of state cabinet minister Nawab Malik, has filed a petition before Bombay high court seeking quashing of the drug seizure case filed against him in January by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Khan’s petition stated that the chemical analysis report of a forensic laboratory said the recovery of contraband from him is “negative” and hence, no offence is made out. He added that the criminal case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is thus not maintainable and must be quashed. Khan claimed that the case against him is “frivolous, bogus, concocted and farcical”. A special NDPS court had recently granted Khan bail, after nine months in custody. Khan’s petition said the NCB stated that it had received information about ‘some suspicious parcels’ received at Universal Couriers and Cargo office to be sent abroad and that they contained contraba-nd drugs. A raid was carried out on January 9, and packets containing ganja weighing 70gm, 265gm and 3.5gm were allegedly seized. NCB then carried out a raid at the house of a co-accused and allegedly recovered four big cartons, two small packets and four white sacks containing ganja. The co-accused mentioned Khan’s name and he was summoned. Khan said he appeared before the NCB and his statement was recorded. He was arrested on January 13 for various offences, including the serious Section 27A of illicit trafficking of drugs and conspiracy under the NDPS Act. His petition said: “It is pertinent to note that the alleged statement of the petitioner [Khan] is exculpatory [involving the removal of blame fr-om someone] in nature as the Supreme Court had said that statements recorded by NCB officials would not be admissible as evidence by itself... Admittedly there is no recovery of contraband at the instance of the petitioner or from his person and therefore the charge u/s. 20 (B)(2)(C) [possession of intermediary quantity of cannabis] is not made out.” The petition also claimed that the chemical analysis report negates the presence of any contraband and specifically notes the presence of ga-nja in only one out of 18 samp-les. “It is pertinent to note that the sole sample which tested positive was drawn from the contraband weighing 7.5gm,” it alleged, adding that even according to the NCB’s own case and the statements recorded and relied upon by the agency, the alleged contraband recovered was at the instance of the co-accused and intended for personal consumption. He added that from the rest of the samples, 11 of 18 tested negative for the presence of any contraband and therefore the prosecution’s allegation that a commercial quantity of contraband was seized fails. Besides, five samples were found to be only “vegetative part of the cannabis plant” and do not fall within the ambit of the NDPS Act, Khan claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-drug-recovery-maliks-son-in-law-moves-high-court-to-quash-ncb-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/87808678.cms||---

Though NGT has not imposed the fine on the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) yet, the bench made the recommendation of the committee a part of the order. According to the expert committee report to the bench, the total damage due to ground water and pond pollution was worth Rs7.30 lakh per month while the cost of air pollution was calculated at Rs1.26 lakh per month. The study was conducted by the senior scientists of WBPCB, CPCB and NEERI on February 25 and 26.  The estimation is done on the basis of total release of heavy metals on soil due to leachate and gives a value of probable damage by this. Environment activist, Subhas Datta, the petitioner of the case, said, “The bench has made some significant observations of the expert committee as part of its order.” The recommendation included ensuring advance demarcation and declaration of a buffer zone of no new habitation for up to 500 meters. The seepage of leachate from the dump site should be managed as per SWM Rule 2016. Proper drainage and pumping of the leachate to its treatment unit must be given special attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tribunal-pegs-dhapa-green-damage-at-rs-9l-per-month/articleshow/87807113.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

With the Opposition coming down on the government after Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew the three farm laws on Friday, Singh said that Yadav’s politics was only about himself and not about the common man. “First, he said that we should talk to farmers. When some farmers could not understand our point of view, the PM took a sympathetic view of the situation and decided to repeal the three laws but instead of appreciating that, Akhilesh is making useless comments on it,” he said. The minister asked why, if Yadav claimed to be a genuine well-wisher of farmers, was it that as soon as the Yogi government came to power, then loans of Rs 36,000 crore were waived for 86 lakh farmers? Why was it that cane farmers had to be paid dues pending since the SP government, that purchase of wheat, paddy and sugarcane was low during the SP regime and why sugarmills were shut down, he asked. “Akhilesh has no moral right to raise questions about the Yogi government which had cleared record dues of Rs 1.46 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers. The welfare of farmers is a priority for the double engine government of the Centre and the state. With schemes like Per Drop More Crop, Har Khet Pani, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report for MSP, adding more crops to the ambit of MSP etc, our government has shown resolve to improve the condition of farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhileshs-politics-is-about-self-goals-not-people-bjp/articleshow/87808288.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier T-Works had worked with Srija and her mentor Augustien, who approached T-Works though the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC), for making her innovation market-ready. T-Works helped Srija scale up the production of the biodegradable pots, called biopots, that are made from dough using groundnut shells. T-Works helped Srija conduct experiments to identify the right ratios of ingredients for the dough and optimal shape for the biopots. These biopots are an eco-friendly alternative to the black plastic bags commonly used in nurseries for growing saplings. T Works had designed and developed a biopress 4T machine that can manufacture 6,000 biopots per shift per month. The machine can also be modified to produce up to 50,000 pots per month per machine in one shift. GE Appliances will assist in setting up a small-scale domestic enterprise for manufacturing the biopots in Gadwal district as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative. GE Appliances will be funding the plant and machinery to generate employment opportunities for local rural communities. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, said:“After developing a mechanism to mass produce Srija’s biopots, we are now moving a step closer to setting up an industry based on this idea. This is why T-Works exists, to create impact on the ground. In GE Appliances, we have a partner committed to creating and celebrating the culture of innovation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-idea-to-be-scaled-up-into-biopot-enterprise/articleshow/87807118.cms||---

TOI had on Friday reported that Wankhede has a bar and restaurant licence in his name in Vashi. In fact, Wankhede had even confirmed to TOI that the licence was in his name and ever since he joined the all-India service, the power of attorney was given to his father Dnyandev. But Malik said he will take the issue up with the Central Vigilance Commission and DoPT . He claimed: “We have information that Wankhede had procured the licence when he was minor and was helped by his father, who was then with the state excise department. Wankhede also claimed that he has mentioned information on the licence in his immovable property returns since he joined the service in 2006, but we have information that it was first mentioned in 2017.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-minister-demands-high-level-probe-into-wankhedes-bar-licence/articleshow/87808681.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The matter came to light on Thursday evening when the man got discharged from the hospital and lodged a case at the Bhankrota police station area of Jaipur. According to police, the woman and the man have been in touch for a long time and both were practising yoga teachers.

---||Chandigarh||Mohali MLA bats for need based changes policy||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: With assembly elections drawing close, promises made in the Congress manifesto in the last elections are being taken up. Former Cabinet Minister and MLA from Mohali Balbir Singh Sidhu assured that he would hold a meeting with Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to notify the need-based changes policy. With population increasing, need based changes are the need of the hour, he said. During the last elections, then Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that if voted to power, the Congress would implement need-based changes policy for houses and allow construction of first floor in commercial booths and bay shops. Sidhu made these promises while releasing a 34-point election manifesto for the February 14 Mohali MC elections. “Soon, I will be holding a meeting with CM Channi to press for notification of the need-based changes policy so that benefits can be extended to residents. I had already had a word with the CM on this issue and he has invited me for detailed talks,” he said. The policy draft was approved in-principle by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in 2016 but there has been no progress since then. Sidhu said, “The Congress is committed to the overall development of the state. Here in Mohali, it is my duty to deliver on promises. Till date, we have delivered maximum by getting city bus service, grants for MC to be used for development works and improving the condition of roads. Soon, we will get a local bus stand for Mohali,” he said. Despite earnest promises, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has so far failed to notify “need-based changes” in houses and commercial buildings in various sectors of Mohali. Sources in GMADA said the request to allow changes in the basic provision of area pertaining to floor area-ratio (FAR), height, basement and covering of balconies has been accepted but with riders that allottees concerned would get a map approved as per PUDA building rules after obtaining structural stability certificate from an expert. The parties will have to deposit a requisite fee (which is yet to be decided) as per the additional FAR. Allottees opting for one-time payment will be given some discount, otherwise GMADA may also accept the payment in installments, said an officer. Residents will only be allowed need-based changes if the alterations do not threaten the structure of buildings and not disturb residential area of neighbours. For this, residents will have to furnish an undertaking saying that they would be solely responsible for any loss to the neighbours due to any previous or future construction and would be liable to compensate the neighbours for it, said sources. The official also made it clear that no concrete construction would be allowed under need-based changes but soft structures like aluminium glazing or glass may be acceptable. Residents had demanded that independent houses be allowed to construct second floor and owners living on the ground floor of LIG, HIG, MIG, and super MIG houses be allowed construct an extra room. Changes already made must be taken on as it is, where it is basis. Recently, GMADA has given interim relief to 784 flat owners of MIG-super housing society association by deferring action on building bylaw violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mla-bats-for-need-based-changes-policy/articleshow/87807124.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Ahmedabad||GST revised: Apparel to cost 20% more in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: As the Union government announced a revision in GST rates on all types of garments from 5% to 12%, a range of apparels and made-ups are set to get costlier by at least 20%. In the recent revision, a range of other textile goods including man-made fibre, man-made yarn, all types of fabrics, dyeing and printing job work, will now attract 12% GST. “Consumers will now have to pay 7% extra for their clothing — adding fuel to the inflation fire for clothing. With cotton and yarn prices going up by an estimated 60% in the past one year, apparel have anyway become costlier,” said Sanjay Jain, chairman, textile committee, Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC). “This will have a dual effect on both consumers as well as micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Demand will take a hit as consumers of low-end garments are more price elastic. This will have an adverse impact on MSME manufacturers whose working capital requirements will also increase,” Jain added. At a time when raw material prices are already running high with cotton, yarn as well as MMF yarn being costlier, jacking up of GST rates on textile goods and garments will further make apparel expensive. Manufacturers have raised concerns over losing costcompetitiveness to manufacturers in Vietnam and Bangladesh for international orders. “As raw materials are costlier, the finished product prices have already been increased. An increase in GST will further add to this cost and manufacturers will lose out on their cost-competitiveness to other counterparts, in the international market. Large retailers have already shifted sourcing to Vietnam and Bangladesh, who enjoy free trade agreements and therefore are able to offer lower prices,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council. The GST rates on man-made fibre and yarn have also been revised to 12%, making synthetic and rayon textile and apparel expensive. However, industry players are rejoicing the normalising of tax structure. “The synthetic value chain had an inverted duty structure with fibre attracting 18%, yarn 12%, fabric 5%, garments below Rs 1,000 per piece 5%, and garments above Rs 1,000, 12% duty. This used to result into accumulation of a huge amount of input tax, and obtaining refunds was a concern. However, with uniform tax structure, these challenges will be ironed out,” said Pramod Choudhary, past president, Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council (SRTEPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-revised-apparel-to-cost-20-more/articleshow/87807127.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Victory of farmers & democracy over ego, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Congratulating the farmer community for their relentless historic protest which compelled the Centre to announce the rollback of the three ‘black farm laws’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Friday that the government may bring back the laws once the assembly elections get over. He described the development as “Ahankaar ki haar … kisano aur loktantra ki jeet” (Victory of farmers and democracy over ago). “BJP is eyeing the vote of the farmers and not bothered about their well-being. The government should bring in a law on MSP, but it will not because they (BJP government) are not interested in the prosperity of farmers. These farm laws were drafted in favour of corporate houses,” he said as an e-banner with “Saaf nahi hai inka dil, chunav baad phir layenge bill (Their intentions are not clean, they will bring the farm bill again after polls),” written on it as a couplet fluttered in the backdrop. Addressing a press conference in October, Akhilesh had announced that the BJP was planning to withdraw the farm laws in wake of the assembly elections in UP and Punjab and would bring it again after the polls. “The BJP governments in UP and at the Centre were rattled by the unprecedented support that SP got recently by farmers and people of Purvanchal and decided to repeal the black farm laws” he said, adding that they may introduce the bill again after polls. “Ye sirf vote ke liye dhokha hai (This is only a gimmick for votes),” he said. Akhilesh took a jibe at the manner in which the government asked farmers to overlook the stalemate that continued on the issue on farm laws. “What about the families of hundreds of farmers who died during protest, can that be forgotten,” he asked. “The manner in which ministers insulted the farmers, the (Union) Cabinet should take responsibility for it and the government must resign,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/victory-of-farmers-democracy-over-ego-says-akhilesh/articleshow/87808300.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The survey will begin on November 22 and officials will track down the owners and send the bills to their homes. If a person refuses to pay on time, his or her house connection will be discontinued. In the city, around industries with 4,000 water connections out of which 2,000 have been disconnected and 2,000 are still connected. Connected ones are easy to track, but for the disconnected ones, PHED officials have to find out how many of them haven’t paid their bills. PHED additional chief engineer Manish Beniwal said, "We have to find out the pending bills and their owners as many factories and industries were shut down during pandemic. Their owners are still living in the city. We will track them and give them the bills. If they pay it on time it is ok. Else, we will discontinue their house connections." PHED will start a campaign from November 22 to recover water bills pending in the Jaipur region. Bills worth more than Rs 100 crore are pending with the public and various government departments. Also, many water bills are pending for the last 10 years. During the campaign, people will be given an option to either pay the bills on the spot when officers go to collect it or their water connections will be disconnected within a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phed-to-recover-water-bills-from-owners-of-non-functional-factories/articleshow/87807131.cms||---

Roshan Shinde was riding back home when the accused attacked him when told to take a turn and move his vehicle after they were about to collide. Vile Parle police arrested Noor Naseeruddin Shaikh (22), a cargo loader, who attacked Shinde with a knife he had carried along. When Shinde was riding from Sahar to Vile Parle (E) at 11.50pm both stopped their vehicles head-on near Sahar Classic building on Sahar Cargo Road, and had an argument when the victim told him to move ahead instead of blocking his way. This enraged Shaikh, said Vile Parle police senior inspector Alka Mandve. Shaikh, who escaped from the spot, was arrested within few hours and was booked for attempt to murder. If found guilty he can be sentenced to life. Shaikh charged at Shinde after pulling out a knife he had kept in the bike’s luggage box. “Shinde was attacked on the shoulder, chest, hands, and abdomen. Shaikh and Shinde are known to each other as they were from the same locality some years back and were not on good terms. Shinde’s condition is stable. He got stitches for the cuts,” said Mandve. Shaikh was arrested after Shinde’s friend Akash Salvi (23) gave police his details. Shaikh was tracked down at Sahar based on information provided by Salvi. Police recovered the weapon used in the crime. “Shaikh claimed Shinde abused him and told him to go ahead, which enraged him,” police said. Police are collecting information on whether Shaikh has a criminal history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-biker-attacks-old-foe-with-knife-many-times-in-road-rage-case/articleshow/87808696.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Electric vehicle sales surge nearly tenfold in October||AHMEDABAD: With fuel prices surging and state and central governments rolling out sizable subsidies on electric vehicles, an increasing number of buyers in Gujarat are moving to green mobility. The sale of electric vehicles shot up nearly 10-fold from 149 units in October 2020 to 1,621 units during the same month this year, according to the data compiled by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). These units include cars, twowheelers as well as three-wheelers. Even during the recently concluded Navratri-Diwali festive season, 2,471 electric vehicles were sold across Gujarat — up 846% against the 247 sold during last year’s festive season, suggests FADA’s data. The prices of CNG, petrol, and diesel are among the key reasons for the shift towards EVs, according to automobile dealers. “Even CNG prices have increased over the past six months or so,” said Pranav Shah, the chairman of FADA’s Gujarat region. “This increases the cost of ownership and maintenance of a vehicle. Therefore, over the past four to six months, the shift towards electric vehicles has been visibly good across segments.” Shah added: “Moreover, over the past two to three months, the government as well as civic authorities have announced significant subsidies on electric vehicles.” Over the past three months, Tata Motors consecutively sold at least 1,000 EVs per month. The automobile giant’s passenger vehicle manufacturing plant in Sanand makes one of the two electric car variants launched by the company. Vivek Srivatsa, the head of marketing, passenger & electric vehicles business unit, Tata Motors, said: “With rising demand for EVs, we have seen the penetration of vehicles grow at a fairly good rate.” Srivatsa added: “The recent surge in fuel prices could be one of the reasons for the spike in EV sales.” Srivatsa went on to say: “But customers are gradually making a shift towards EVs as they enjoy the seamless driving experience and also get the benefit of low ownership cost from a long-term perspective.” The Gujarat Electric Vehicle Policy, 2021, provides for subsidy of up to Rs 20,000 on EVs in the two-wheeler category, Rs 50,000 for three-wheelers, and up to Rs 1.5 lakh for cars. Over and above this, even the central government has extended subsidies under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles (FAME)-II. The amount of subsidy is based on the battery capacity. “Subsidy is one of the biggest factors that has made electric vehicles much more affordable,” said Dishank Chhabaria, branch head, Gujarat, Ather Energy. “For our two-wheelers, a clear subsidy of Rs 63,500 is available to customers which is definitely a good deal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ev-sales-surge-nearly-tenfold-in-oct/articleshow/87807143.cms||Niyati Parikh

This lot will have a capacity of 680 cars. Due to the Covid pandemic, the plan was delayed as tenders had been floated in 2018. The agency will get environmental impact assessment study and clearance for the project. Already, there is a multilevel parking near the new OPD, which has a capacity of 600 cars and is always filled to capacity. Around 20,000 vehicles need parking in PGI. Sources said that parking may be started this year. “This is the only institution in the city to have two multi-level parking spaces in one campus. Due to the daily overflow of patients and their attendants, it is difficult to find parking space. As most of the parking is required for OPD patients, parking in that area will be convenient,” said an official in the PGI administration. With expansion of the institute, where new centres are being constructed, there will be more vehicles on campus. “At any given point of time, most of the vehicles are parked along the roadside within the institute as there is no space in the public parking. Sometimes, it takes more than 30 minutes to find a parking slot,” said the relative of a patient. Also, there is a plan to make six additional parking slots to accommodate more vehicles. Besides the people, doctors may also face a problem. “Often, we have to walk a lot as we do not find place in the faculty parking. In fact, those who stay on the campus must cycle or walk so that those who come from far off places get space to park,” said a faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-have-another-parking-lot/articleshow/87807134.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Chandigarh||PGI resident suffering from depression due to workload sent home on leave||Chandigarh: A resident doctor in the city’s prestigious Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research was sent home on leave after she was evaluated to be suffering from depression due to workload in the institute. The woman doctor, who is attached with the department of neurosurgery, was sent to her hometown in Lucknow after counselling. In the absence of a job manual thar defines job profile of the resident doctors at PGIMER, many resident doctors often face such workload-related depression, feel doctors in the institute. Three months ago, Dr Sandeep Yadav of the same department had alleged harassment and left the institute. However, at the time top officials at the institute had explained the doctor’s move as inability to withstand work pressure. As the neurosurgery department is the most demanding, the residents are often working round-the-clock. “There are 28 resident doctors in the department and this is too low for the flow of patients pouring in the emergency,” said a faculty member. “We also teach the residents to stay polite with the patients, but it is practically impossible to spend more than four hours in the emergency where the corridors are also clogged with patients on trolleys,” he added. As per the data available from the PGIMER, most of the resignations by doctors have been in the surgery branches. In 2018, seven DM (Doctorate of Medicine)/MCh (Master of Chirurgiae) students had resigned, including two from the paediatric surgery department. In 2019, there were three resignations, including two by surgeons. In 2020, the number of resignations declined to one but this number rose to three resignations again this year. The association of resident doctors had been demanding the PGIMER authorities must formulate the job manual like New Delhi’s AIIMS since the last two years. However, there has been no progress yet. “Once this manual is prepared, the residents on duty who do the job of supporting the PGIMER staff in their absence cannot be held accountable for patient negligence,” said a resident doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-resident-suffering-from-depression-due-to-workload-sent-home-on-leave/articleshow/87807154.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Worst Diwali in a decade for Gujarat auto dealers||AHMEDABAD: As the intensifying global semi-conductor shortage has amplified production shortage in the automobile sector, automobile dealers witnessed the worst festive season in a decade. From Navratri to Diwali, the 42-day festive season reported an overall de-growth of 18% in car and two-wheeler sales, suggests data by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), which terms this as the worst sale in decade. Against 2.32 lakh vehicles including cars and two-wheelers that were sold during the Navratri-Diwali festive season of 2020, merely 1.91 lakh vehicles were retailed during the same period this year, according to FADA. Two-wheeler sales declined 15% whereas car sales showed a steeper fall of 32% during the said period. Explaining the trend, Pranav Shah, chairman, FADA, Gujarat, said, “Two-wheeler demand failed to pick up due to increased cost of ownership of two-wheelers and high fuel prices. Moreover, with more people working from home and educational institutions not functioning, the number of new two-wheeler buyers went down.” According to him, the loan rejection ratio increased from 8% last year to 15% this year in case of two-wheelers. “The moratorium for automobile loans was temporary. Lower income groups who could not repay loans due to income shortfall have bad credit scores, due to which their auto loan applications were rejected,” said Shah. Car sales remained slumped due to supply constraints triggered by the semiconductor shortage, which led to a dramatic increase in waiting periods for cars, as high as 8-9 months. “The waiting period for certain fast-selling models has increased dramatically. This is especially true for electric vehicles and CNGrun vehicles. People are preferring electric vehicles and customers are ready to wait as well,” said an Ahmedabadbased dealer. Dealers said that long waiting periods were a deterrent over the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/worst-diwali-in-a-decade-for-auto-dealers/articleshow/87807156.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Lucknow||Will BJP reap benefits of repeal in Uttar Pradesh elections?||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement for the repeal of three contentious farm laws is likely to have a major impact in the politics of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the two states going to polls early next year. While the BJP may make a comeback in the contest in Punjab, its dilemma over the impact of the farm laws in UP will also be over for now. Live updates: Govt repeals farm lawsThe impact of the farmers’ agitation was primarily visible in western UP as the region happened to be the native place of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait and Naresh Tikait. Since the Tikaits come from the Jat community, most of the Jat farmers also stood behind the BKU leadership. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament.Though discussions on the issues of farmers are common in UP and Bihar during, before and after the elections, they have never come out as a consolidated votebank. Even farmers get affected by the caste divide and politics which ultimately positions them in favour or against a party, or a candidate, at least in UP and Bihar. Read AlsoFarm laws: Modi move may change Punjab poll equationsNEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's announcement of the repeal of the three farm laws may change the electoral temper in poll-bound Punjab. Until the PM went on air, the three laws seemed set to be one of the themes which would have defined next year's contest in the Congress-ruled state. Congress rebelThis is where the BJP’s Jat politics was getting affected ahead of UP assembly polls. Not only Tikaits, even parties like the Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) – which primarily thrives on Jat support base – was also trying to cash in on the protest against the farm laws. Read AlsoFarm laws: Boost for Rahul line on 'street politics'?The decision of the Modi government to rollback the three farm laws is reminiscent of the BJP regime’s wilting under pressure over its proposed amendments to the land acquisition Act, and is likely to strengthen the Rahul Gandhi line of argument that the opposition needs to pick issues against theAccording to BJP leaders, farmers’ protest had undoubtedly given a new lease of life to the RLD, a party which had been losing confidence and Jat votebank ever since Jayant’s father late Chaudhary Ajit Singh grew old, and the BJP, after Muzaffarnagar riots, penetrated deep into the Jat community. Riding on the Modi wave, BJP had bagged all the 17 seats from the region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.  In 2017 UP elections too, the party won 60 out of 80 assembly seats in west UP. However, BJP registered a slight dip in the number of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party shared seven seats between them leaving BJP with only 10 out of 17 seats. “Even then, the BJP managed to get maximum Jat votes in its favour. Since the Jat community is vocal in nature, it is not easy to keep them in good humour all the time,” a BJP leader told TOI. The farmers’ protest added to the woes of the BJP as Naresh Tikait and Rakesh Tikait, under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, managed to create a buzz in west UP and Terai region. Read AlsoRepeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decisionPM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs ofParties like RLD pounced on the opportunity and rallied behind farmers to win back Jat support. “The common refrain among RLD workers in west UP was ‘Krishi kanoon to bahana hai, Jayant Chaudhary ko jamana hai,” a BJP leader claimed. Talking to TOI, RLD spokesman Rohit Agrawal said, “Now, it has been proved that RLD was on the right track by standing with the farmers. We have not been talking about Jats or Gurjars but bhaichara (brotherhood),” he added. As the 2022 UP assembly election will be the first after the demise of Chaudhary Ajit Singh, Jayant faces the tedious task of cementing his position and saving the RLD’s vote base. According to political analysts, the “floating” Jat voter, who was a bit confused over the farm law and was mulling to switch loyalty, would now be able to make up his mind. They said the repeal of farm laws will not only be a matter of concern for RLD but also for other opposition parties as they had been rallying behind the farmers to create a perception among voters that the BJP was working against their interests. Former journalist and BJP spokesman Avinish Tyagi, who is also a native of west UP, termed the PM’s decision as “far-sighted”. However, Congress leader Surendra Singh Rajput claimed that the fear of losing the elections forced the PM to repeal the farm laws. “Farmers and youths can see the intentions of the BJP and would not fall in the trap. The government should also guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) to farmers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-bjp-reap-benefits-of-repeal-in-up-elections/articleshow/87808323.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Gehlot was reviewing the corona and seasonal diseases situation at his residence on Friday. He said sampling should be increased across the state, especially, in those areas where cases of infection were increasing. He said considering the experiences during the second wave and the nature of this virus, the strategy of re-testing, tracking, and tracing should be implemented strongly. He said it was necessary to stop the infection at the primary level. The chief minister said a letter will be written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to allow booster doses. He said booster doses were being administered in about 35 countries of the world and it was necessary that to save people from the third wave. He directed that emphasis should be given to fogging for preventing dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. Medical minister Raghu Sharma said wherever Covid positive cases were being reported, mobility of the people should be curbed. Secretary, medical and health, Vaibhav Galaria, during his presentation, pointed that number of active cases had gone up to 95 and said instructions had been given to increase the number of sampling to 25,000 per day. He said random sampling was being done in malls, schools and markets along with genome sequencing at the lab located at SMS Medical College to identify the variant of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-booster-jabs-for-people-with-low-immunity/articleshow/87807164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Travel in wheelchairs to identify concrete obstacles on pavements, says Delhi high court to to SDMC staff||NEW DELHI: Zeroing in on concrete ramps encroaching public pavements in colonies, Delhi high court has said these prove to be a “harrowing experience” for children and elderly. In a unique experiment to ensure the usability of footpaths, the court has asked engineers of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to travel on wheelchairs in a south Delhi colony to identify obstacles. Justice Najmi Waziri said the corporation’s “executive engineer/assistant engineer/junior engineer shall traverse the entire colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair without any aid or assistance from anyone. This will test the efficacy of SDMC’s efforts to make the streets and footpaths user-friendly”. The court also pointed out that concrete ramps damaged trees that needed breathing space around them and directed that all concretisation beyond the road and the walking-paths laid by the corporation/PWD “shall be removed from the earth, no matter how deep the concrete”. Freedom of movement is a constitutional guarantee and “it should not be hemmed in by the lack of requisite civic amenities”, the court noted. “Citizens need to be empowered and facilitated in the enjoyment of their constitutional rights for which provision of basic civic amenities is essential, like a safe and secure neighbourhood, tree-lined avenues and footpaths, where an endeavour of a leisurely stroll is actually a pleasurable exercise and not an obstacle-dodging, harrowing experience.” It added that ramps “discourage walking to neighbourhood shopping centres, to community-bonding cultural events and for leisure-time in colony parks. Instead, people would use motor vehicles, adding to the city’s ever-burgeoning traffic congestion and unmitigated air pollution. So, it all starts with taking care of the neighbourhood trees and greenery and ensuring that the footpaths winding through the tree shaded avenues are obstacle-free”. The directions came while taking stock of steps taken to deconcretise trees in Vasant Vihar. It directed SDMC to place photographs of each stretch “so repaired, restored and made user-friendly, showing the before and after scenario”. On ramps, the court cited agreement by all stakeholders that removal of encroachments “will facilitate movement in the colony of the elderly, children and the wheelchair-bound”. Petitioner Bhavreen Kandhari has highlighted failure of civic bodies to monitor the wanton concretisation of sidewalks and other constructions on public land, leading to drying up of tree roots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/travel-in-wheelchairs-to-identify-concrete-obstacles-on-pavements-hc-to-sdmc-staff/articleshow/87807167.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Law in drain, worker forced into manhole in Chandkheda||AHMEDABAD: An AMC contract labourer was made to descend into a manhole late on November 17, Wednesday, in Chandkheda. A video recorded by a member of Manav Garima Trust, an organization championing the rights of sanitation workers, shows a few workers standing at the mouth of a manhole while their colleague is lowered into it. The video shows that the worker, clad in shorts and a vest, has no safety gear besides a harness attached to a rope. “Our member recorded this incident late on Wednesday night on the road opposite Tulsi Residency in Chandkheda,” said Parsottam Vaghela, the director of Manav Garima Trust. “Our member told the AMC contractor’s men that making workers enter a manhole is a criminal offence. However, they did not listen.” He added: “This is a clear violation of Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.” The Act prohibits states and Union Territories from employing workers for manual cleaning of sewers and drainage lines. In July 2019, a writ petition was filed by Manav Garima Trust over workers’ safety. In response, the Gujarat government had submitted to the Gujarat high court that the state’s civic bodies have been directed to ensure that no person is asked to enter manholes for cleaning. The government had also submitted that nodal officers will be appointed in all civic bodies to ensure adherence to safety guidelines. The officers are supposed to initiate criminal proceedings for violations of the guidelines. M P Parmar, the AMC-appointed nodal officer for the Chandkheda ward, said that he was not aware of the incident. “Members of Manav Garima Trust have informed us about an incident. We will definitely look into it and take action if we find that any law was violated,” said Ahmedabad city’s nodal officer Manish Shah. “Despite all these laws, civic authorities in the state have mostly outsourced the work for cleaning sewers and drainage networks,” Vaghela said. “Civic authorities wash their hands off once they give away a contract. Due to such negligence, workers lose lives.” On August 26, two tribal labourers were asphyxiated after they were made to enter a sewage line in Bopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/law-in-drain-worker-forced-into-manhole-in-chandkheda/articleshow/87807174.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Flight operations were disrupted for a short while, and at least one flight was diverted to Mumbai as a precautionary measure. The Indian Navy’s electrical team conducted a full inspection of the electrical circuits and ensured that the lights were back before nightfall. “During the ongoing runway work, there was a technical snag around 4pm. The runway lights were restored by 5:05pm,” said a naval officer. The Navy had issued a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) at 4pm warning airlines about the glitch and the expected disruption in flight operations. The airport at Dabolim operates out of the naval air base INS Hansa, and the aerodrome is managed by the Indian Navy. Due to the technical snag, departing flights reported delays ranging from 10 minutes to 90 minutes. IndiGo flight 6E-5402 from Delhi was diverted to Mumbai while en route to Goa. Goa airport director Gagan Malik said that the Navy’s air traffic control had informed airport authorities as soon as the technical snag was detected. “There was a technical snag during the ongoing runway repair works, and as a preventive measure to check all the circuits, the runway lights were switched off as the navy’s electrical team undertook a thorough inspection of the circuits on a war footing,” said a naval officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-airport-runway-goes-dark-after-tech-snag-flights-delayed/articleshow/87807836.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Change of heart for fear of defeat in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||LUCKNOW: Terming the central government’s decision to repeal the farm laws a “U-turn”, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the change of heart was due to the fear of defeat in assembly elections. “The PM has sought an apology from the nation on the issue of farmers… He has announced to repeal the farm laws but people of the country are not naive. They are aware that elections are round the corner and circumstances are not in favour of the BJP. Therefore, he is asking for an apology now after the death of over 600 farmers,” Priyanka, who was in Lucknow, said. Reminding the people that the farmers were addressed with terms like ‘andolanjeevi’, ‘goonda’, ‘aatankwadi’ and ‘deshdrohi’, she questioned the PM’s silence when such disrespect was shown to farmers. “What was the PM doing when farmers were being labelled as ‘andolanjeevi’ and ‘aatankwadi’? Why was he silent when the farmers were cane charged and when they died during the course of agitation,” she asked. Referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, she said: “While he remained ignorant to the pain and plight of the aggrieved families, he continued to keep the minister, whose son is accused in the case, under his wings.” Priyanka raised doubts over the intention of the government but expressed happiness over the fact that it finally realized that there was nothing more important than the farmers of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/change-of-heart-for-fear-of-defeat-in-polls-priyanka/articleshow/87808328.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Addressing the gathering during foundation laying of Rs 3,240 crore Arjun Sahayak, Bhawni and Stauti irrigation projects for Mahoba, Hamirpur and Lalitpur, Yogi said the basic facilities like potable water “remained a dream” for the region for years after Independence. “It was in 2014 that the country got a leadership under PM Narendra Modi who pitched for holistic development of farmers, youth, women and poor and gave thrust to development in backward regions, including Bundelkhand,” he said. He lauded the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for lending thrust to the development of hitherto parched region. The CM said not only development projects like Bundelkhand expressway were initiated, but irrigation and potable water under Har Ghar Yojana was also being fast-tracked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-gave-thrust-to-devpt-in-bkhand/articleshow/87808334.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Sackings continue, MSRTC to hire 2,000 fresh recruits||MUMBAI: With the employees’ strike entering its 23rd day on Friday, the MSRTC suspended 297 more workers, taking the total number of suspensions to 2,776, and terminated the services of 238 daily-wage workers, an official said. And to tide over the employee crisis, the management has decided to hire fresh recruits for the posts of drivers, conductors and clerical staff on daily-wage basis to operate its fleet of buses lying idle at 250 depots across Maharashtra. Sources said that over 2,000 drivers and conductors are likely to be recruited soon. “Most of them will be from our earlier waiting list of candidates who will have to agree to our new terms and conditions and work during crisis situations,” said a senior official. The MSRTC had issued termination notices to 2,296 daily wage drivers, conductors and few other staffers for not reporting to duty despite being called on an emergency. The state transport corporation will also sign fresh contracts to hire 500 buses with drivers, who will operate them on ‘wet lease’, to ferry over a lakh commuters across Maharashtra. The private vehicles will operate on the lines of Lal Pari—the standard non-AC bus of MSRTC—and charge normal fare, an official said. Transport minister Anil Parab said there was no proposal to “privatise” MSRTC at the moment, but they will study the transport corporations of other states to explore solutions. “... this(privatisation) too is an option, but there is no proposal as of now,” said Parab. The minister further said that they have appealed to the workers to resume work and that the government is open for discussion. “As a government, we have to consider the inconvenience faced by the general public too,” said Parab. On Friday, the MSRTC operated around 150 buses across the state ferrying 3,500-4,000 commuters, sources said. The strike is likely to continue over the weekend, while scores of protesters from the 250 bus depots are likely to converge in Mumbai for a ‘show of strength’ protest by Monday, sources in the unions said. Union leader Shashank Rao said that workers will continue to be on strike till the key demand of merger of the MSRTC with the state government is accepted. The Bombay high court will hear the contempt petition matter on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sackings-continue-msrtc-to-hire-2000-fresh-recruits/articleshow/87808996.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kochi||Globetrotting tea-seller K R Vijayan from Kochi bids adieu||KOCHI: K R Vijayan, the globetrotting tea-seller from Kochi, has set on his final journey. The 71-year-old, who visited 26 countries in the last16 years with his wife Mohana Vijayan (69) using the money they saved from their small teashop, succumbed to a cardiac arrest on Friday morning. The couple, who inspired many people to achieve their travel goals despite financial constraints, had recently visited Russia -- one of Vijayan's dream destinations. It was their first international trip since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. It was also the first international tour in which their children and grandchildren accompanied them. The couple was planning to head next to Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia. Mohana, wife of K R Vijayan, breaks down when his body was brought to their house at Gandhinagar in Kochi on Friday eveningThe duo had shown to the world how people could fund even world trips with their meagre earnings. They have been running the Sree Balaji Coffee House at Gandhinagar in Kochi for nearly 30 years and they found money for their trips by saving Rs 300 a day. Vijayan’s passion for travel began in his childhood when his father took him on short trips. He began travelling on his own when he grew up. His first destinations were mostly within Kerala like Munnar and Wayanad, and later he started exploring other states. The trips turned even more exciting when wife Mohana became his travel companion over four decades ago. The couple became international tourists in 2007 with a trip to Israel. Since then, they have visited the UK, the US, France, Austria, Egypt and the UAE, among other countries. They took loans whenever their savings fell short for a journey and worked overtime to repay them. “I always wanted to see the world with my own eyes rather than through videos or travel stories of others. And when it happens with my beloved wife, it is even more beautiful. Money will not be a problem if we are determined to travel and are really passionate about it,” Vijayan had said once. Later on, when they hit the headlines, many travel agencies started sponsoring them on trips. Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra had offered to sponsor one of their trips in 2019 after hearing their inspirational story. The pandemic, however, affected their travel plans after a 2019 trip to Australia and New Zealand. Vijayan was also planning a Singapore trip to inaugurate a travel agency there that made him its brand ambassador. The couple had also brought out a book of their travel stories -- Chaaya Vittu Vijayanteyum Mohanayudeyum Loka Sancharangal (The World Trips of Vijayan and Mohana by Selling Tea). Besides Mohana, Vijayan is survived by daughters Sasikala V Prabhu, Usha V Prabhu, sons-in-law Jayaram P Pai, Muralidhara Pai and grandchildren Arun, Amritha and Manjunath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/globetrotting-tea-seller-vijayan-bids-adieu/articleshow/87807183.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition hail withdrawal of farm laws||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition leader VD Satheesan and other leaders lauded the farmers for maintaining the tempo of the protests until the Centre decided to withdraw the controversial farm laws. “The year-long farmers’ protest has finally triumphed. Indian farmers have scripted one of the brightest chapters in the history of class struggles. Salutes to the martyrs, farmers and organisations who fought with unmatched resoluteness and undying spirit,” Pinarayi Vijayan tweeted. In a further statement, the chief minister said that it was when the farmers realised that their very existence is in danger that they rose in protest. In the protest that lasted for almost a year, 700 farmers became martyrs. Their martyrdom did not go in vain, the chief minister said. The farmers protest is a tight slap on the face of Sangh Parivar agenda of dividing the people to enforce corporate interests, he said. The Centre had to kneel before one of the biggest protests witnessed by the 21st century, said Satheesan. More than the late realisation at the doorsteps of elections to two major states, it cannot be believed that the Prime Minister or the Sangh Parivar forces have any sincerity towards the farmers of the country. The farmers have won over an undemocratic government that would do anything with their brutal majority. This is the victory of democracy, he said. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that the Centre withdrew the laws for fear that it cannot withstand the wrath of farmers. This achievement was scripted with the blood and sweat of lakhs of farmers. Maintaining the Gandhian method of protest even after falling prey before bullets is something which is unparalleled, he said. Congratulating the farmers, he said that the Centre and the state will have to reduce the fuel prices also before such protests by the people. The farmers gave a befitting reply to the Centre’s move to impose the corporate agenda, while also trying to divide the farmers, said CPI leader and All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) national secretary Satyan Mokeri. He said that it was after the failed efforts to divide the farmers, who stood united, that the Prime Minister finally apologised to the farmers and announced withdrawing the laws, he said. He said that the Prime Minister has not yet said anything about minimum support price and clarity is needed in such matters. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said that the decision of the Centre to give up before the farmers is an indicator of hope for the country’s democracy. He said that the downfall of Narendra Modi has begun from the farmers’ protest land and it will soon spread across the country. The farmers’ protest reminds of the historical fight put up by the country’s public against British rule, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-opposition-hail-withdrawal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/87806362.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Only 3% of questions raised by corporators on bad roads in Mumbai: NGO||Mumbai: All major political parties had promised a pothole-free Mumbai in their 2017 BMC election manifestos, but till date, only 3% of the questions raised by the elected representatives were on bad roads, found a recent analysis by NGO Praja Foundation. This, despite Mumbaikars registering 17,908 pothole complaints from 2017 to 2021. The maximum citizen complaints were about sewerage (75,915), but only 6% of the questions posed by corporators across party lines were on the issue. Also, almost all parties had promised better solid waste services in the run-up to the 2017 civic polls, but 40% of the complaints received by the BMC till date are on garbage not collected. With the BMC elections scheduled early next year, Praja Foundation analysed the manifesto promises of the major political parties—Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party—and compared them with deliberations, specific manifesto points and citizens’ complaints related to those points. The NGO’s survey, while tracking the complaints and deliberations, found that some of the most common citizens’ complaints have not been successfully deliberated upon by elected representatives. In the period from 2017-21, the BMC received 34,129 complaints about unauthorised hawkers, but only 6% of the questions raised by corporators were on the issue. “The disparity between complaints filed and questions asked by corporators reaffirms the importance of deliberation of citizen-specific issues,” Milind Mhaske, director of Praja Foundation, said. The NGO’s analysis also showed that 14% of the questions asked by corporators in civic meetings were on renaming roads, chowks and buildings in the city. For the 2022 BMC elections, Mhaske has called for target-wise manifestos to be released so that citizens too can analyse the targets achieved before the 2027 polls. “Despite promises to resolve issues related to potholes, water supply and unauthorised hawkers among others, deliberations on them have not been adequate,” said Mhaske. “The overall proportion of questions asked by political parties on issues related to potholes was only 3%. Parties should therefore set targets and ensure that the manifestos align to achieving these targets by creating programmes around the same,” he suggested. Nitai Mehta, trustee of Praja Foundation, said, “Before civic elections, parties develop their own manifestos that outline the objectives of their candidates for the upcoming corporators’ term, based on which citizens elect their representatives. The manifesto, among other things, includes action plans and promises to provide civic wants and needs as well as solve various service delivery related issues that citizens face on a regular basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-3-of-questions-raised-by-corporators-on-bad-roads-in-mumbai-ngo/articleshow/87808702.cms||Richa Pinto

Of the total 7,583 sanitary workers (both permanent and daily wagers), 17% work with other departments, with most of them assigned to corporators and working as domestic helps. Another 7% are engaged in cleaning choked sewerage lines, reveals data procured from the BJP ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Most of the 17% sanitary workers deployed in other departments are being used as personal help by corporators and officials. Data procured from NMC revealed that 7,583 sanitary workers have been deployed with the solid waste management (SWM) department to sweep around 4,400km roads in corporation limits. However, as many as 1,297 have been attached with other departments, while around 525 are engaged in cleaning choked sewage lines across the corporation limits. Most of the workers attached with other departments are working as personal helps either with corporators or at the homes of senior NMC officials. NMC’s fire and emergency services department also has 70 daily wagers, who work with them as helpers, assigned to it by SWM. According to the data, the highest number of sanitary workers engaged for other works are from Gandhibagh zone. Under this zone, out of 957 sanitary workers, around 214 are engaged for other works. It is followed by the Lakadganj zone. Of the 732 sanitary workers deployed for sweeping works, 154 are doing non-sanitation works and 71 are working for cleaning drainage lines. The situation is no different in Dharampeth zone. Here, of the 828 sanitary workers deployed for sweeping of roads, 147 were attached to different departments, and 55 are being spared for cleaning choked sewers. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said the prime responsibility of sanitary workers should be sweeping roads, and blamed redeployment of workers to other places on the freeze in recruitment by the state government. “Due to lack of staff, many sanitary workers are being deployed in other departments,” he said, refusing to comment further. Senior Congress corporator Sandip Sahare said many corporators use sanitary workers for personal works. “In the past, the misuse of sanitary workers for personal works had been raised in the general body meeting. But in vain,” he said. “This was one of the reasons Nagpur city fails in Swachh Bharat rankings. In last ranking, the city had secured low points for unclean streets in former mayor Nanda Jichkar’s ward,” he said. Activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “The working hours for sanitary workers are from 6am to 2pm. However, hardly any sanitary worker is seen sweeping the road before 8am.” “We need to increase field working hours and strict monitoring, which will significantly reduce manpower requirement and our roads will also look cleaner. We are also falling short on co-ordination between garbage sweeping and garbage pick-up,” he said. “We often see in social media, so many NGOs conduct road cleaning activities and claim to collect huge amounts of waste. If road cleaning by sanitary workers is regular, then how do these NGOs collect such a huge amount of waste?” Chatterjee said. “Most importantly, we must accept modern technology, gadgets and change according to the times, considering the cost benefit economics. Failure in implementation of award winning wristwatch concept is very disappointing. We must agree that we are falling short in proper manpower management and supervision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/almost-17-sanitary-workers-working-as-domestic-helps-for-corporators/articleshow/87807201.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They also lit earthen lamps on the banks of the river. To avoid snarl-ups, traffic was diverted, with security arrangements already in place to prevent any untoward incident. The mela area was divided into nine zones and 32 sectors, officials said. With All India Sikh Conference president Gurucharan Singh Babbar writing to the DGP that Prakash Utsav will be celebrated by the organisation at Har-ki-Pauri, where 464-year-old Gurdwara Sri Gyan Godri was demolished decades ago, officials barricaded the area, dividing it into a separate zone to ward off any trouble. At gurdwaras in different parts of the city, shabad kirtan was performed and langars (community kitchens) were organised. The festival began on Devutthana Ekadashi (the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) of the Hindu month of Kartik, which is considered auspicious as gods rise on the day) and concluded on the 15th day (Kartik Purnima). At Shantikunj, Tulsi-Shaligram marriage was solemnised by Gayatri Banamala Mandal, a social organisation. Tulsi plants were distributed and schoolchildren, dressed as Radha and Krishna, performed on the occasion. Meanwhile, local traders had a field day, with their business picking up after a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/12-lakh-pilgrims-take-holy-dip-in-ganga-at-har-ki-pauri-on-kartik-purnima/articleshow/87806365.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar tree felling: IAS body backs Bennichan Thomas, to seek review of suspension||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The IAS association has thrown its weight behind principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Bennichan Thomas, who has been suspended from service for issuing orders permitting Tamil Nadu to fell trees from baby dam in Mullaperiyar. It is reliably learnt that the association that met here on Thursday, passed a resolution in support of Thomas and has also decided to request the government to review his suspension. Sources said that the suspension of an upright officer has adversely affected the morale of the all-India service officers. The association members are also likely to meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to request him to revoke the suspension of the officer. The government has already instituted an inquiry in the matter. Interestingly, the move by the IAS association has come at a time when forest service officials are upset about one of their members being made a scapegoat by the government, despite records showing that the order permitting felling the trees was issued with the knowledge and involvement of two senior IAS officers. “Instead of passing a resolution now, the IAS officials involved in the matter should have done their share properly and informed the government about what happened in the chain of events that led to issuing such an order, including owning up their role in the matter. Not doing anything when an honest officer was made a scapegoat and passing a resolution now is sheer hypocrisy,” said an IFS officer on conditions of anonymity. The political executives and the secretaries of water resources and the forests and wildlife departments claimed that they neither had any knowledge about nor any role in issuing the order. However, the records prove that senior officials, including additional chief secretary (water resources) TK Jose who is also the additional chief secretary (home and vigilance), and principal secretary (forests and wildlife) R K Sinha, had clear knowledge of the subject, and had even assured Tamil Nadu that the request to fell the trees is being processed. Last week, the IFS association members met the chief minister, and submitted a memorandum requesting the government to revoke the suspension of Thomas. Meanwhile, the IPS association is remaining silent in the matter as one of its senior members, G Lakshman, has ended up being suspended from service last week for colluding with fraudster Monson Mavunkal. Sources said that it might not be the right move to come up in support of a fellow all-India service officer, when its own member has been suspended, even though Lakshman’s suspension has a legitimate reason unlike in the case of Bennichan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ias-body-backs-bennichan-to-seek-review-of-suspension/articleshow/87806384.cms||KP Saikiran

However, as hospital admissions continue, doctors feel this will be certain, more or less, only after December. “We are keeping our fingers crossed that this low positivity continues. After the festive season as well, the numbers have not increased,” said a public health expert. It has been only two weeks since Diwali got over. At the same time, as immunisation has been enhanced, severity levels have dipped. Presently, 20 patients are admitted in various Covid authorised hospitals in the city. Out of these, six are on ventilators. The weekly positivity rate is 0.22% The active cases are 27, while the recovery rate is 98.7% “There can be a few peaks here and there, but not a major surge if one goes by the current trend since the past few months,” said a public health expert. Since November till date, 44 cases have been reported with an average 2-3 new cases a day. “But we have to wait until the end of next month till we are able to vaccinate all the adult population here. The antibodies level is above 75% in the overall population while first dose coverage is more than 100%,” said an official in the UT health department. Doctors do not warn of any more variants even though there are some countries and states in the country which are seeing a rise in the weekly positivity after the festivity. “That is why we still need to follow Covid-appropriate behavior as there are no travel restrictions now,” said a doctor in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pandemic-turning-into-endemic-guess-experts/articleshow/87807199.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic, Taliban forcing mafia to clear drug caches in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The recent seizures of some of the biggest drugs haul in Gujarat cannot be mere coincidence but that happened because the drug mafias had earlier could not clear the drug loads as there were restrictions of movement across the globe due to the Covid-19 pandemic and later the Taliban took over power in Afghanistan — the major manufacturer of the opium. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were restrictions in travel and transportation due to which mafias could not send the drugs by individual couriers as they earlier used to. Earlier, these drugs mafia used to send small time couriers with the drugs weighing merely in few grams or kilos,” said an agency officer. When the situation was a bit normalised post the pandemic, Taliban took over the power in Afghanistan in August this year. Due to this, the drug mafias are in a hurry to clear their stock fearing fear confiscation of the heroin stock by the Taliban and the drug lords may also face the prospect of summary execution if caught by the Taliban. Not just in India but other countries have been witnessing the big hauls of the drug seizure, said officers of different agencies. This situation also pumped in prodigious quantities of the drugs, mainly heroin, in India. In September, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had seized 3,000kg heroin from Mundra port in Kutch. On September19, the Gujarat Anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had seized 30kg heroin with seven Iranian crew members in a mid-sea operation. That drugs were also sent in desperation by an Iranian drugs mafia Imam Baksh. Later on November 15, the Gujarat ATS seized 120kg drugs worth Rs 600 crore from Jinjuda village of Morbi and so far nabbed seven members. The drugs consignment was sent by an alleged Pakistani drugs Mafia Zahid Baloch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-taliban-forcing-mafia-to-clear-drug-caches/articleshow/87807202.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Nashik||Centre must ensure foodgrain MSP round the year: Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse||NASHIK: State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said the Centre must ensure that the mechanism to give the minimum support price for foodgrain is active throughout the year and is not limited to certain months. Bhuse, state civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal and farmers’ organisations felt that the PM’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws was a “victory for the resolute farmers, who had put up a brave fight against the Union government.” The important demand of the farmers’ movement is the enactment of a central law guaranteeing a fair price for all agricultural commodities and all farmers. “The government has not said anything about this. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), Kisan Sabha and like-minded organizations will hold an immediate meeting to study all these developments and announce the necessary decisions,” said Ajit Navale of SKM. Farmers organisations and other political parties gathered at the statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar in Nashik city to celebrate.  Bhuse told TOI, “Had the Union government made this decision earlier, the lives of the farmers, who died in the agitation, would have been saved.” Bhujbal said the prolonged stir had forced the Centre to withdraw the laws. “The farmers in the country, by continuing with the agitation for about a year in a peaceful manner, have set an example. The government had to repeal; though it may have happened after a series of defeat in elections and some upcoming elections,” Bhujbal said. The farmers from Nashik had joined the agitation in December last year, when about 2,000 farmers went to Delhi to express their solidarity with the agitating farmers. Raju Desle, the state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, said the government should quickly draw up rehabilitation plan for the families of about 700 farmers who died in the agitation. The issue does not end with the Prime Minister seeking ‘forgiveness’ of the farmers. The kin of the farmers, who died during the agitation, should be given Rs 50 lakh as ex-gratia and even a government job to one relative,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-must-ensure-foodgrain-msp-round-the-year-agri-min/articleshow/87805709.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Farmer groups welcome historic victory, demand law on MSP now||Mumbai: Farmers groups in the state greeted the repeal of the three farm laws with processions in different parts of the state, but said the real victory would come when the Centre passed a law assuring minimum support price (MSP) for crops. “We welcome the repeal of the anti-farmer and pro-corporate laws. This is a victory of a historic farmers agitation,” said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha. “Besides the repeal, the Centre should fulfil our demand for a beneficial minimum support price for crops and farm produce. It should also withdraw the amendments in the Electricity Act,” said Ajit Navle of the farmers union, Kisan Sabha. The Maharashtra government should also withdraw its draft farm laws that the Kisan Sabha has demanded. The amendments had been tabled in the state assembly session in July and opinions had been sought on the draft. Unions have argued that the draft laws only make minor changes in the repealed Central laws. “Farmers will not stop raising their voices until a law guaranteeing MSP is passed,” said Raju Shetti from the Swabhimaani Shetkari Sanghatna. Shetti who had tabled two Private Members’ Bill in the Parliament in 2018, said, “I had introduced a bill to guarantee remunerative prices for farm produce. It is time to re-introduce the bill with some relevant modifications,” Shetti said. “It will ensure whether or not the produce is sold inside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee or outside, and to government or private entities. Farmers will get remunerative prices without worrying about the artificial price drop or frauds carried out by private entities,” he added. “Maharashtra had reformed farm laws beginning in 2006, but it did not improve the economic condition of farmers,” said Kishor Tiwari, from the Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti who is in the Shiv Sena. He said that the decision on repealing the laws had a lot to do with the upcoming polls in UP and Punjab. “We always welcome elections because at least then, some pro-farmer announcements are made,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farmer-groups-welcome-historic-victory-demand-law-on-msp-now/articleshow/87808999.cms||---

The tourist accommodation facility at the reserve, which can house 60 people at a time, was inaugurated on Friday by state food and civil supplies and consumer protection minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also the district guardian minister. The reserve is popular for sighting blackbucks, hyenas, foxes and wolves. Opening the facility for tourists, Bhujbal appreciated the role of the villagers in encouraging the forest department to carry out various projects while maintaining an ecological balance. “The villagers here are cooperative and hence the forest department has taken steps to strengthen tourism here. This, in turn, will help the economy of the region,” he said. The facility at the Mamdapur reserve was set up at a cost of about Rs 40 lakh and more development is expected there. Committees have been set up in the area for the conservation of wildlife and various facilities have been provided to the citizens of the area, Bhujbal said. Assistant conservation of forest Sujeet Nevse said the tourists visiting the sites will be provided with tents and bicycles and allowed to go on nature trails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mamdapur-reserve-to-offer-dorms-tents-for-tourists/articleshow/87805729.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||Char Dham priests divided over contesting polls||Dehradun: With state government yet to take a call on the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act, priests and their organisation remain divided on the issue of contesting the upcoming assembly polls in Uttarakhand due early next year. While some senior priests are in favour of fielding candidates on 15 seats of the Himalayan state, another section opines that the focus should be on "opposing the board and protesting against it till the time the Act is repealed". Krishna Kant Kothiyal, president, Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, a body representing the teerth purohit (priest) community, had on Thursday announced that the priests, in protest against BJP government’s decision to create a Devasthanam Board, would field candidate from 15 assembly seats of Uttarakhand. "If the Act is not withdrawn by BJP government, we will field our candidates. We will speak with opposition parties and convince them not to contest from these seats. We want a direct fight with the BJP and crush them by a convincing margin," Kothiyal told TOI. When told a section of the teerth purohits were opposed to the idea, he said, "Some people may have changed their mind and have started supporting BJP government but I am not doing so. It is clear that either the BJP takes back the Devasthanam Management Board or we will enter the political arena." On the other hand, Brijesh Sati, spokesperson, mahapanchayat, said, "Our work is to perform religious rituals and help pilgrims and not to field candidates in assembly elections. Teerth purohits have their presence in 17 assembly seats but it does not mean that we will enter the political arena. It may be the view of an individual but not the organisation." Another teerth purohit Umesh Sati said for past 23 months, the priests have been protesting against the board. "It’s been 23 months since we have been fighting for the cause. Amid all this, a statement was made by few individuals on contesting elections. We strictly criticise the statement and distance ourself from it. We are a non-political organisation and the body was formed to oppose theboard. We do not want to derive any political mileage out of it," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-priests-divided-over-contesting-polls/articleshow/87806382.cms||---

The BJP group party leader in the BMC, Vinod Mishra, in a letter to the BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal said that the asphalt and mastic ready-mix plant owners colluded with each other and rigged the bidding process. Mishra claimed he had already cautioned the civic body about this.“Even before the financial bids can be opened, it was decided whom the tenders are going to be bagged by and I have a list of these names too. Due to the restrictive and arbitrary condition of undertaking with asphalt and mastic plant owners, a cartel has been formed by them and their crony contractors. I therefore request the BMC to cancel all these seven Tenders of Reinstatement of Trenches,” said Mishra. He added that the BMC must order a strict, independent and fair inquiry into the matter which he termed to be a scam because it is a criminal conspiracy and ‘loot of public money’. Corporators have been suggesting that the BMC remove the condition of undertaking of bidders with asphalt & mastic plants in all future tenders to avoid Cartelization. The BMC said that the tendering process is still ongoing and the rules would be followed. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-alleges-cartelisation-in-bmcs-trenching-tenders/articleshow/87808711.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Allowing the plea of an IAS officer for inter-cadre transfer, the high court said, “the right to meaningful family life, which allows a person to live a fulfilling life and helps in retaining his/her physical, psychological and emotional integrity would find a place in the four corners of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, when the state unreasonably denies a request of an employee seeking inter-cadre transfer, it impinges upon such person’s right to demand respect for his/her family life.” A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh agreed with the woman IAS officer’s contention that denial of her request for inter-cadre transfer by West Bengal government has resulted in an infraction of her right to family life. “The fact that such rights are recognised as a part of human rights clearly emerges upon a perusal of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. A plain reading of Article 8(1) of the Convention discloses that every individual has the right to insist that the state respects his/her private and family life, home and correspondence,” the high court pointed out. The bench rejected WB’s opposition to her transfer and noted that her request was declined without a cogent reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-to-family-life-hc-allows-plea-for-inter-cadre-transfer/articleshow/87807219.cms||Abhinav Garg

The teen was with two friends and the parlour owner saw one of them allegedly taking milk from a crate outside his shop. The man chased the kids in his car and injured the teen, according to the complaint. The victim’s 40-year-old mother, a Narol resident, filed the complaint on Thursday. She said that at about 5am her son was on a gearless two-wheeler with his friends. She said that they were on their way to play cricket. The woman said that not long after her son had left home, the security guard of her society told her that the owner of the parlour was beating her son. She rushed to the parlour and found that her son had been injured on hands and legs and was bleeding. Cops aware of the case said it appears that one of the boys had emptied milk pouches from the crate into the storage compartment of the two-wheeler. The woman said that the kids ran away from the scooter after spotting the parlour owner. According to the complaint, the man first threw stumps at the kids and then chased them in his car, injuring the teen. The teen stated that he and the other boys were then taken to the parlour where two other persons beat them with stumps. The woman said that she called the 108 ambulance service and her son was taken to hospital. Narol police has registered a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code against the parlour owner, including 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons) and 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life). The cops have also invoked sections 338 (causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 279 (rash driving).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/milk-parlour-owner-injures-boy-in-car-chase-beats-him/articleshow/87807215.cms||---

The court was hearing the petitions filed by five police personnel challenging their transfer orders from Palayamkottai Central Prison in Tirunelveli district to Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai. According to the petitioners, a remand prisoner P Muthu Mano was murdered by the other inmates in the prison on April 22. While the accused prisoners were arrested, the authorities who were on duty and responsible for security of the prisoners, were placed under suspension. Following this incident, the authorities transferred the petitioners on administrative grounds. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they were not at all on duty on the occurrence date and were not responsible for the said incident. However, the state submitted that since Palayamkottai Central Prison being a caste sensitive place, the prisoners have been segregated and lodged in separate cells. Even though the petitioners do not belong to any sensitive sector, they have the habit of spreading malicious information and creating group clashes between two core sects of prisoners, as well as the prison staff. In order to avoid more complications and for security purposes and transfer orders came to be passed, based on a discreet inquiry report. Justice D Krishnakumar observed that a perusal of the transfer orders shows that it was passed on administrative grounds, however, in the counter affidavit, it is stated that the orders were passed based on the discreet inquiry report. The judge concluded that the orders are in violation of the principles of natural justice, since the orders are contrary to the clarification letter issued by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-tn-to-issue-guidelines-for-clarity-in-transfer-matters/articleshow/87807852.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the court relies on the medical certificates for taking certain decisions on the applications filed before this court. If such false certificates are issued, this court may not be in a position to rely upon them. It is the duty of the medical council to eradicate such a type of impression created by few doctors, the judge said while dismissing the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Gopinath, who was arrested by the Thanjavur district police for possession of ganja in February. Taking into account the Covid-19 pandemic, the special court granted interim bail to the petitioner on the same day for three weeks and directed him to surrender before the trial court on March 29. Since the petitioner failed to surrender, the court issued a warrant against him and the police had registered another case. Subsequently, the petitioner filed petitions before HC seeking anticipatory bail in both the cases. He produced medical records stating that he was hospitalised for two months after he sustained a fracture in his leg in a major accident. The petitioner also produced a medical certificate from a doctor. Since the medical certificate stated that it was only for leave purposes, the judge directed the authorities to inquire about its genuineness. When the judge was informed that the certificate issued by Dr C Balaji was false, he recommended disciplinary action against the doctor. The counsel for the council informed that disciplinary action would be initiated against the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-tells-med-council-to-ensure-docs-dont-issue-false-certificates/articleshow/87807848.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Ajay Ghildiyal, a native of Saharanpur, was arrested for facilitating illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India. He would get their Indian passports made using fake Hindu identities and then send them abroad. Two of his aides, Sameer Mandal and Vikram Singh, were arrested on November 11 in the same case. IG ATS Gajendra Goswamy said that during questioning, Vikram had disclosed Ajay’s name. “Vikram had claimed that as an airline employee, Ajay would facilitate the boarding of these passengers with fake passports and visas at the airport. These documents had been prepared by gang members Sameer and Vikram,” said Goswamy. Ajay had been employed with the airline since 2016. He would also help in boarding of deported persons at the airport by taking money from agents. “For this, Rs 15,000 was charged per person, this money would be divided among employees of the airline,” said Goswamy. Ajay had met Vikram and gang member Gurpreet in 2020. So far, Ajay has conspired to send 35 to 40 people to Spain, Britain, and other European countries for money.

The students will have to travel to the KMS English School in Parel for the first semester board exams. While minor papers have commenced from November 16 and 17 for class 12 and 10, the major papers will begin from November 30 and December 1 for class 10 and 12. Parents of the Billabong High International School students have written to the CBSE regional office in Pune for a change of centre. “To travel 25-30 km during exams is insane in Mumbai’s traffic,” said a parent. A school spokesperson said they have spoken to the CBSE authorities who assured them that the centre would be changed to INS Hamla in Malad. The admit cards with the changed centre would be issued by Monday., the spokesperson said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-60-students-allotted-cbse-exam-centre-25km-away/articleshow/87808722.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He remembers that evening as if it was yesterday. The apple of his eye, his grandson Navreet, just 25 and back home from Australia after his marriage in that country to a girl he knew, had been killed during violent protests against the farm laws in Delhi. "There was darkness in our house, in fact in the whole of Dibdiba (a small village in Rampur)," he said. "People loved Navreet. He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today. I miss him so much." Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur in UP from Melbourne after completing his graduation in commerce from a university there. He dived headlong into the farmers' agitation. His wife, Mansweet Kaur, 22, stayed back in Australia to finish her masters. She had told him she would join him later. After Navpreet died, the cause of his death mired in conspiracy theories, his body was sent to Rampur and the autopsy done by a panel of three doctors. The report mentioned “shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injury”. However, the doctors also noted that "brain matter had spilled out of an everted wound near the right ear". The Dibdiba family claimed that the wound was the result of a bullet shot at him while he was driving a tractor. Dibdiba "collected evidence" and moved the Delhi high court on February 10, contesting the official version. He maintains to this day that his grandson was "murdered". The case is pending. But this agitation, he said, was also about thousands of other farmers. So Friday's turn was welcome. “Our blood and sweat has paid off. I lost my grandson, but nearly 700 families lost their kin too.” Some distance away, in Lakhimpur Kheri, relatives of farmers killed in Tikunia on October 3 when four of them were allegedly mowed down by a convoy of cars led by Ashish Misra, the son of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra, the government’s decision has come "too late". Jagdeep Singh, son of Nachhatar Singh, 60, who was one of the farmers crushed by one of the SUVs, said, “Several lives would have been saved had the government realised this a bit early. We are mourning, but we are happy for the larger cause. My father’s fight against the farm laws is won but we will carry on our battle for justice until those responsible for the Kheri deaths are sent to jail.” Next door, it was a father who was grieving. Satnam Singh said, "Lovepreet Singh was just 19 years old when he was killed. My son was a student and always used to take time out to protest peacefully against the farm laws. How can one ever fill such a vacuum? If only the government decision had come before (the incident at) Lakhimpur Kheri." Jasbir Singh Virk, national president of the Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan, said, “Every person who lost his life while protesting will be remembered and recognized as a martyr of the movement. We fought together and forced the government to withdraw the laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/at-dibdiba-a-grandpa-grieves-in-kheri-a-father/articleshow/87806397.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Girls online have hacks against patriarchal wall||Ahmedabad: Some were from small towns, from both rich families and extended households. Some were in the first year of college while others were studying for boards. But what connected these teenage girls from across India participating in a study was their engagement with social media and the internet. The study titled “Good Girls Don’t Go Online: Unpacking the Quotidian Playful Resilience Influencing Girls’ Social and Digital Engagements” tracked a group of girls for one year. The aim was to understand their online usage patterns, the issues they faced, and how they dealt with them. The study was published in the latest issue of International Journal of Communication. Its authors are Kiran Bhatia. University of Wisconsin-Madison, US; Payal Arora, Erasmus University, Netherlands; and Manisha Pathak-Shelat from MICA in India. The researchers argued that the majority of the girls, first-time social media and internet users, cleverly dodged social conventions to get online and experience the cyberspace. If they didn’t have a smartphone or a computer, they took help from their friends. If they didn’t find good Wi-Fi connection, they bribed their way into their parents’ connections. If they had snoopy family members, they requested their friends to cut them out of social media posts. “We term it playful resilience — they won’t openly rebel or oppose, but will find ways out of the situation,” said Prof Pathak-Shelat, a faculty member at MICA. “It’s primarily the patriarchal mindset which assumes that if the girls are allowed to have a smartphone or access to the internet, they may encounter bad influence or become victims of predators.” The professor added: “But we argue that the reality is different and they do experience it, albeit differently.” City-based experts said that the internet has indeed created issues in many families. Falguni Patel, coordinator of Abhayam 181 helpline, said that after the pandemic, the service recorded a spike in complaints involving girls and smartphones. “The parents believed that the girls started spending more time with their gadgets and also developed friendships,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girls-online-have-hacks-against-patriarchal-wall/articleshow/87807237.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||Repeal of farm laws a face-saving tactic ahead of key polls: Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: The Centre has decided to repeal the three farm laws because it feared electoral losses in the upcoming UP and Punjab polls, said NCP chief Sharad Pawar. A view echoed by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Ashok Chavan. The MVA leaders welcomed the repeal and saluted the farmer’s agitation. The state BJP said the Prime Minister was forced to repeal the laws which would have benefited farmers, because he was left with no option. “There will soon be elections to UP and Punjab. People in the villages will ask questions on the farm laws and their leaders will have no answers. That’s why this decision was taken by the Centre,” said Pawar. He said he saluted the farmers for their peaceful agitation and pointed out that the farm laws had been pushed through parliament with no consultation. “Farmers had been agitating for a year but the government did not even talk to them,” said Pawar. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the decision was motivated by “political fear” with the BJP feeling the ground slipping under its feet in UP and Punjab, where elections are forthcoming. “The PM should apologise to the family of 700 farmers who lost lives, and announce monetary relief. He should also withdraw all cases against farmers, including cases registered for violence at Red Fort,” he added. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the decision to repeal showed, “the strength of the common man of the country and what he could achieve.” Saluting the farmers who lost their lives in the agitation, he pointed out that the MVA government had opposed the farm laws both in the cabinet and the state assembly. “In future, before drafting such laws, the Centre should consult opposition leaders and the organisations in order to avoid such a setback,” Thackeray added. “The Centre and the BJP should apologise for the atrocities against the protesting farmers. They insulted the farmers by calling them terrorists and anti-national. A union minister’s son crushed farmers under his car,” said Congress leader and PWD minister Ashok Chavan. State Congress chief Nana Patole said the party would celebrate Kisan Victory Day on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state BJP said the Centre was forced to repeal the farm laws because it was left with little choice. “The PM was forced to repeal the farm laws, which would have brought prosperity to the farmers, with great sadness because he was left with no option,” said state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. “Ordinary farmers backed the farm laws but a group of farmers created disturbances and held others to ransom,” he added.

The stench from the tonnes of garbage piled up overpowers the fragrance of flowers being sold in very unhygienic conditions. About a quarter of the perishable products, including flowers, leaves and the plastic bags that they come in end up in the garbage dumps of the market regularly. The agricultural marketing committee, which is in charge of the maintenance of the market, set up a recycling unit similar to a micro composting unit on its premises. However, it is in a shambles now and nothing from the piles of biodegradable waste that collects is recycled. “We didn’t mind the uncleared garbage during summer. This year we were kept out of the market due to Covid restrictions, but now we are fearful that we would fall sick in these conditions,’’ said Jayakumar, a retail flower trader. S Ramachandran, president of Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Malar Makkal Nala Sangam, says mosquito menace and stench from the garbage have become unbearable. Since the market has opened after a long time, the garbage was affecting their business.  Officials from the AMC said they were taking all efforts to clear the garbage with the help of Madurai corporation. Six tonnes had been cleared in the last few days and the entire dump was expected to be cleared in a day or two. “It was the monsoon that hindered the cleaning process and now the corporation officials have agreed to give us more vehicles to carry the garbage,’’ said sources adding they had not found the micro composting unit viable and hence it was shut down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/garbage-piles-turning-into-health-problem-in-madurai-flower-market/articleshow/87807856.cms||---

Livestock and poultry farmers have been advised to keep their animals safe and indoors. “Because of possible formation of a trough near the latitudes of Goa, rainfall activity is likely to increase. Heavy rainfall exceeding 64.5mm to 115.5mm of rainfall in 24 hours is very likely at one or two places over Goa on November 20,” the IMD said. Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning are very likely to continue over Goa up to November 22. Short intense spells and winds of speed around 40kmph are likely over both districts. Light to moderate rain and thunderstorm activity with a much lesser spatial distribution is likely to continue over Goa up to around November 25, the forecast stated. “The clouding and rainfall activity may affect sowing or agriculture land preparation during this period,” the IMD advisory read. It advised farmers to avoid nursery sowing and sowing of cowpea on November 20. “In already sown fields they can provide proper drainage to remove excess water. Also, avoid transplanting of vegetable seedlings on that day due, clean the drainage channels to avoid water logging,” the department said. For animals, farmers were advised to store sufficient fodder and feed, provide clean drinking water, provide curtains at both sides of poultry houses or add overhang of four to five feet to avoid direct entry of rains into sheds and conduct frequent checking of litter material. Citizens have been asked to avoid open areas, fields, taking shelter under tall trees or structures during thunderstorms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-warns-farmers-of-heavy-rainfall-advises-against-sowing-seeds/articleshow/87807889.cms||---

Vasavan told a meet-the-press programme organized by the Calicut Press Club on Friday that the department could take action only on the basis of a probe conducted by the department. “We cannot take action on the basis of statements made by K T Jaleel or allegations raised in press conferences. We can take action only if authentic documents come up before us. Till now, we have not received any complaint pertaining to the allegations that you are mentioning about,” the minister said. He added that Jaleel had told him that the documents he had presented at a press conference were received from the income tax department which had conducted an inquiry into the allegations of irregularities in the bank. The cooperative department had issued orders to look into the allegations against the bank but it was stayed by the court. The government has now issued the order the third time after vacating the stay, the minister said. Jaleel had raised serious allegations against A R Nagar Cooperative Bank saying that huge black money and illegal transactions have been unearthed in the bank in the random examination conducted by the IT department. The minister said that both the UDF and LDF should jointly oppose the moves by the central government against the cooperative sector and alleged that IT department was making unwanted interferences in the sector with the aim to destroy the sector. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had publicly pulled up Jaleel for demanding an enforcement directorate (ED) probe into the alleged irregularities in AR Nagar bank. CPM had also conveyed the party’s displeasure to Jaleel over raising the demand, which it feels would lead to ED meddling with the cooperative sector, especially when Centre was trying to intervene in the sector which has been a preserve of state governments. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cant-take-action-based-on-allegations/articleshow/87806406.cms||---

SHO, Imaliya Sultanpur, Rajesh Singh said the accused told the police that he got married in May this year. “He claimed that he often used to spot his wife talking to someone over the phone during late hours. He said his wife also remained out of the house for long,” Singh said. He claimed that he once saw his wife with a man, Mohit, in an objectionable position. “He initially ignored the matter but soon became a butt of jokes among his relatives and villagers. He discussed the matter with his father after which they decided to eliminate Mohit,” the officer said. “The duo called Mohit for a meeting at Golapur-Sitapur turn on Wednesday where they slashed his throat with a sharp-edged weapon. They then tied the body to his motorcycle and hit it with a tree to make it appear as an accident,” said Singh. Mohit’s postmortem examination report on Thursday revealed it to be murder. Mohit’s kin also informed the police that he had received a call from the accused.

An hour later, the girl’s relatives attacked him with a big stone and a stick. While a man tossed him all over the place and threw the stone on his head, the woman attacked him with a log.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Security firm’s ex-CEO named in Rs 1 crore con case can fly abroad||MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) has permitted Niraj Gul Bijlani, who quit Topsgrup Security Services Ltd in 2018 as its CEO, to travel to Dubai in a 2020 case filed against him for alleged siphoning off of Rs 1.17 crore from the company. The HC suspended a lookout notice issued against him in a case registered by the EOW of Mumbai police. The complaint against him was filed by the company, alleging that Bijlani had siphoned off the amount as the group’s former CEO. Bijlani, in his petition before HC, argued by senior counsel Vikram Nankani along with advocate Ishwar Nankani, said he worked at the company as a “consultant’’ and submitted his relieving letter where the company’s finance director had appreciated his “dedication and sincere efforts put in building the company’’ during his nine-year tenure. His petition seeking quashing of the lookout circular said he resigned since the co-mpany had “defaulted in statutory dues” and payment of his salary. The HC noted that he challenged the circular on various grounds and also that “it is entirely unwarranted as the petitioner has been extending co-operation; and the right of the petitioner to travel abroad is being curtailed”. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai opposed his plea, saying a forensic audit has been done and the report will be received in a week. She said the probe may be concluded in 6 weeks. On a plea by Nankani, the HC permitted Bijlani to travel to Dubai from November 17 to December 22 on a work commitment after observing that a grievance of the EOW that he is not cooperating does not appear to be present. The permission is to Bijlani and not to his family members, said HC. Pai sought, and the HC agreeing imposed, a condition that he has to inform the EOW three days before leaving India and inform his return date and he will submit surety amount of Rs 1.17 crore. Bijlani was present in court and has to remain present before the high court on December 22, the next adjourned date.

All key political parties — BJP, Congress and AAP — are waiting to know their rival candidates to reveal their cards. Only after the dates are announced, they can start their preparation and plan things because they feel that matching wards with suitable candidates is significant. “Since the MC election will be contested on faces besides issues, we want the candidates of our rival parties to be announced so that we can plan things accordingly. Moreover, candidates will be decided as per the wards and their popularity among people,” a senior leader of a political party said. All the political parties are eyeing the Punjab and Haryana high court and election commission, hoping the date will be announced by next week. Since the entire election process has to be completed by December 31, the role of the commission will be crucial in this exercise. All political parties have, however, completed their internal exercise to select candidates. On the one side, where Congress has received around 200 applications against 35 municipal wards, the BJP has also received applications through their district presidents. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also completed its exercise in this regard. Till date, only Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is the party, which has announced its candidates. The SAD issued its list of the nine candidates, out of total 35 candidates for the MC election. Since the SAD has tied up with the BSP in Chandigarh for the first time, their seat sharing has also been decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-poll-date-delay-keeps-parties-tense/articleshow/87807239.cms||Deepak Yadav

Sidhu made this announcement during a recent public meeting in Mohali. He said he would demand separate land for the bus stand at a centralised place. “We will request the CM for directing Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) to allot land for setting up of the bus stand. I will press for the old bus stand site to be revived for the new one as it is the central place and most suitable for residents,” he said. Sidhu said, “The Baba Banda Singh Bahadur bus stand was good for nothing and served no purpose for the welfare of Mohali residents as it was located at the farther end of the city. A bus stand must be approachable.” Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu in a recent MC house meeting announced private bus service route in Mohali. In the first phase, the MC is to press six local buses under its dream project of a city bus service. The MC has approved the project to run 25-seater low floor CNG buses. He said, “This service is especially for poor people and the fare of these buses will not exceed Rs 10 per passenger inside Mohali jurisdiction.” MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said for the first phase, the MC has approved eight bus routes to ply six buses. Garg said, “For the first phase we have got eight bus routes approved for which six buses will be pressed into action by January 1. We have already called for the tenders on build operate own basis. Passenger tickets will be provided by the MC but will be distributed by the private operator.” Garg added that MC will also allow space for advertisements on the buses to get more revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-ask-cm-to-give-mohali-separate-bus-stand-mla/articleshow/87807243.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

On Friday, several villagers, mostly women, came out on the streets to protest against alleged police atrocities. Villagers alleged that innocent people were detained and tortured by police. Nearly 35 people were detained by police, they claimed. So far, four policemen, including the SHO and the police outpost in-charge, have been transferred for failing to make a breakthrough in the case. A woman among the protesters claimed, “We were sleeping in the night when two policemen barged into our house by jumping over a wall. They said they were searching for someone. We are scared as almost every man of the village is in their custody.” Another woman alleged, “My husband was taken into custody and thrashed. Later, he was found to be innocent.” Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit SP, told TOI, “The villagers had gathered on a link road outside their village after they were misinformed that police were arresting the young men. They returned home after we assured them that no action would be taken against anyone who is innocent. We have not tortured anyone in police custody. We are close to cracking this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/pilibhit-rape-murder-case-villagers-protest-against-police-atrocities/articleshow/87806410.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Effects of better law & order now evident in UP||Law and order is the hallmark of any governance. The perception of one’s safety is so critical and treasured that it calls for no further elaboration. It is reflected not only in a victim-oriented policing approach or evidence-based delivery of police services but also in the sense of freedom one desires to enjoy. It is imperative to have the freedom to avail equal opportunities. Having a facilitating environment to take initiatives, to achieve and grow without any inhibitions or fear are some of the other necessary attributes one covets for. These are, therefore, the minimum expectations that any able governance must ensure. The recently released data by National Crime Record Bureau for the year 2020 shows some of the remarkable facets of a state like Uttar Pradesh in this context. This prompts one to really take it as a case study, partly to understand the truth and partly to reassess the ‘policy on policing’. One of the litmus tests of a strong Law & Order grid in a democratic set up is the safety of women. If we take the figure of crime against women, the national average is 55.9 per lakh population. UP, however, has a rate much below the national average at 45.1, whereas figures of the states such as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana are much higher at 76.2, 90.5, 95.14 & 112.9, respectively. Though the statistics in itself cannot be an absolute yardstick but to initiate an analysis, such data are important and reflective of the character of governance. Observers have seen a better equilibrium in UP in the recent years. A further micro analysis of NCRB data shows that the cases of blatant assault on women with the intent to outrage their modesty have gone down in UP at @ 3.5 per lac population. This is much lower when compared with other states. UP has reportedly also recorded the highest conviction rate in cases related to crimes against women and cyber-crime in the country as per NCRB. This has been made possible due to several steps taken to check crime against women which include UP-122 India App, night security cover scheme, women helpdesks and pink booths besides the enforcement of relevant criminal laws. Also, the hyper activation of cyber cells along with enhanced public awareness programmes was a timely act. UP Police has gone through multiple ups and downs. It has, however, proved its mettle when the right leadership is provided at the apex level in terms of an appropriate policy and congruent support. The outcome in the present era is reflective of the role and goal clarity of those at the helm of affairs. The doctrine of ‘Zero tolerance towards Crime & Criminals’ upheld by the Chief Minister is quite evident right to the cutting-edge level. Not only the ‘Mafia Raj’ seems to have shrunk to its lowest ebb but, even the second and third-line criminals have been largely neutralized within the ‘Rule of Law’. The ensuing sense of security has opened vistas for development too in terms of investments. UP`s economy has reportedly doubled from Rs 11 lakh crore to Rs 22 lakh crore in the past four years. It is glaringly manifested by the infrastructural development in the state including the new institutions, both in health & education sectors. Development has its own positive impact on the Law & Order Grid. Both are complimentary as well as supplementary to each other. The top man at the helm of affairs enjoys a clean image with respect to his integrity and enforces the same down the line. Wiser and concerned leaders would like to create an oasis of statesmanship rather than otherwise. Yogi Adityanath has rapidly adopted technologically empowered governance tools that are free from any biases. This ensures a professional outcome. UP model reflects upon the visionary view to policing in terms of a holistic approach. Police Commissionerate system is one of the visionary steps taken by the CM in this regard. He is seen to have emerged as a committed leader with a fast-rising learning curve. That he holds a respectable stature in various circles has generated a positive response in the form of a strong Law & Order grid. Leadership impacts! The behavioral change in police is also very prominent. It is indeed satisfying to observe the humane side of policing whether it is the Kanpur Police Commissioner or a SHO ready to outreach the harassed senior citizens or women in distress in real time. It speaks volumes that the police as the first responder have moved closer to the community. Nature thrives on mutual synergy of all its sub-elements and we are all a part of this. Hence, the way we imbibe Nature becomes our Culture. So, for our long-term sustainability there is no rule other than the rule of ‘Holistic-Sustenance’. To me the principle of ‘Vasudhev-Kutumbakam’ stands for the same. And that finally brings us to the dictum, “Only those who know how to merge will finally re-emerge!” (The writer is former DG, CRPF & BPR&D, advisor to Lt Governor of Puducherry)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/effects-of-better-law-order-now-evident-in-up/articleshow/87808363.cms||AP Maheshwari

Data of Delhi Prisons till October this year accessed by TOI showed that more than 1,35,000 mulaqats were held between inmates and their family members. It included over 74,000 physical visits. “In all, 61,164 online mulaqats were also held where relatives interacted with inmates through videoconferencing,” the data showed. Over 50,000 people visited Tihar, followed by 18,050 at Mandoli and 5,867 at Rohini. “While 36,298 online mulaqats were held at Tihar, there were 13,944 meetings at Rohini and 10,922 at Mandoli,” showed the data. Mulaqats were stopped on April 5 due to the second Covid-19 wave and they resumed on July 19. From January to March last year, more than 90,000 mulaqats were held in the pre-Covid period. Later, after the pandemic gripped the country, the meetings were stopped on March 19, 2020. “Steps were taken to control the disease. Mulaqats resumed again in October last year,” an officer said. From August to December last year, 30,262 mulaqats were held of which 9,452 were online and 20,810 offline. Before the pandemic, inmates met their relatives twice a week and three members were allowed to meet them. When the pandemic began, inmates were allowed to make phone calls only to their relatives for five minutes twice a week,” said the officer. After resumption, inmates were allowed one mulaqat in a month. In February this year, it was changed to one mulaqat per week. However, during the second wave, meetings were stopped again. “When it resumed, we allowed two mulaqats in a month,” said the officer. Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said currently active cases were nil, but they had not let their guard down and all precautions were being strictly followed. “Before any mulaqat, a visitor has to go through a Rapid Antigen Test. The maximum number of visitors in the mulaqat hall has been kept at half the cabins available. We regularly sanitise mulaqat windows on both sides,” he added. Visitors without face masks are not permitted inside the prison complex and all inmates have to wash their clothes received from their families members during mulaqat before use. “The timings for registration of mulaqat is from 7.30am to 11.30am on all days, except Saturday, Sunday and gazetted holidays,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-covid-curbs-eased-over-74k-turn-up-to-meet-inmates-in-10-mths/articleshow/87807240.cms||Abhay Singh

Taking a dig at political leaders who had earlier insinuated that "Khalistani elements" had "infiltrated" the agitation, Jadon said, "The same netas later got scared after their image took a beating ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab." Jadon also demanded that the Narendra Modi-led government should condole the death of farmers who died during the long-drawn protests. “The government should also provide monetary compensation and jobs to families of those who died protesting. And, cases registered against farmers for supporting the protest should be withdrawn,” he said, adding the agitation will continue till the government provides legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). Jadon said, “This a is victory of farmers, and this victory is dedicated to the more than 600 of us who have died in the interim. It is dedicated also to the tribals, women and workers from different spheres who became a part of this movement," Jadon said."The sudden announcement to repel the three black laws certainly comes due to the impending elections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/those-fighting-farm-laws-were-real-farmers-not-terrorists-bkus-jadon/articleshow/87806417.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||JBT teacher recruitment scam: Serve notice through newspapers, says SC||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Hearing the JBT and TGT teacher recruitment scam, the Supreme Court objected to re-issuance of notices to aggrieved teachers. The administration said notices could not be issued to such a large number of teachers due to various reasons. The court said that instead of issuing notices to every teacher, public information should be published. The court has fixed December 17 as the next date of hearing in the case. Sources said the education department conducted a written test for the recruitment of 1,150 JBT and TGT teachers in 2014. Appointment letters were issued to these teachers in 2015. The paper was leaked from a printing press in New Delhi three days before the written test for recruitment, after which Chandigarh police registered a case on July 29, 2016 on the basis of a Punjab Vigilance report. The administrator then formed a committee headed by the finance secretary, which submitted a report to the administrator cancelling the recruitment. A case was registered against about 50 teachers working in government schools of Chandigarh due to this scam. Out of 1,150 teachers, about 600 were working in government schools of Chandigarh while the rest have quit. The administration had sacked these teachers on May 30, 2018. Hearing the case on Friday, the court said that notices had to be issued to all the parties involved in the scam, which were not issued. Earlier, the CAT and the High Court had ruled that it was wrong to remove teachers whose names were not included in the FIR in the teacher recruitment scam. The matter could not be proceeded further as the notice was not served in some cases. To overcome the problem related to service of notice to the large number of candidates, the Apex Court has directed that notice be served to everyone via Punjabi Tribune and The Tribune newspapers as the education department, Chandigarh is unable to track the addresses of a few teachers. The court informed all the parties that on the next hearing, the case must be proceeded further under any circumstances. The next date of hearing has been fixed on December 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jbt-teacher-recruitment-scam-serve-notice-through-newspapers-says-sc/articleshow/87807246.cms||---

While the police arrested hostel warden Archana for allegedly luring the girls into the act, the protest was withdrawn late in the evening after talks held by Dindigul range DIG Vijayakumari and revenue officials.College correspondent P Jothimurugan was the AMMK candidate for Dindigul parliamentary constituency in 2019. Inquiries revealed that he owns a nursing, a catering and an arts and science college in the district besides holding prominent positions in sports bodies. At least one victim is said to be aged below 18 years while most of the others are older, said V Nicholas, Childline district coordinator, who inquired with the protesting girls. He quoted the students as saying that the warden would ‘canvas’ and send a group of 10 to 15 girls to another college owned by the correspondent in a MUV around 10 pm. In the dark, the students were asked to dance to songs in a manner that pleased the correspondent, after which he abused them. The students were then dropped back in their hostel around 3 am. It is learnt that the girls were lured into the trap or silenced with the promise of good marks in the examinations, timely placement in good hospitals or attractive jobs in the entertainment industry.Dindigul district superintendent of police (SP) V R Srinivasan told TOI that a case was registered against the correspondent and the hostel warden under a few sections including Pocso Act based on the complaint lodged by one of the students. “The warden has been arrested and search is on for the other accused,” he added. The incident came to light after the college management along with the district legal services authority held a sexual abuse awareness programme on the college premises on Saturday. On Friday morning, the students resorted to road blockades near the college and on the Dindigul - Palani road and made multiple calls to the Childline helpline number 1098. Earlier in the evening, the students temporarily suspended the protest based on an assurance by the police that the correspondent would be arrested by 6 pm. As it did not happen, they resumed the blockade. The protest was withdrawn after talks were held by the DIG of Dindigul range, Vijayakumari, and revenue officials. AMMK general secretary TTV Dinakaran issued a statement later in the night removing Jothimurugan from the basic membership of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dindigul-nursing-students-flag-sexual-abuse-block-roads/articleshow/87807887.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Repeal of farm laws victory of farmers, democracy: Rawat||Dehradun: Terming it a huge victory for farmers, who refused to budge even an inch and fought hard for the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat on Friday said "the repeal of the "black laws" is the victory of democracy and sustained fight of farmers who remained united through the long haul." Attacking the Modi government, Rawat said fear of defeat in the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is behind the withdrawal of the farm laws but "it will fail to make any impact and the BJP will not get any mileage from the issue. People are now well aware of their intentions". Remembering those who lost their lives during the agitation, the former CM said, "I request government to acknowledge the contribution of those who sacrificed their lives during the protest. They should be given the status of martyrs." He did not fail to mention that Rahul Gandhi was among the first politicians to raise the issue and take out a tractor rally in Punjab to express solidarity with the protesting farmers. Rawat was surprised that the law was framed even without consulting the farmers. "What is the point of having a law when the people who are associated with the sector do not want it. The farmers were never in favour of the three farm laws but it was forced on them. We need to appreciate their determination and patience. They camped for months at Delhi borders, braving the tough conditions. Their never give up attitude forced government to bow before them," he added. When told to reply if the move would benefit the BJP in the upcoming polls, Rawat said, "The damage has already been done and it is too late. It was the fear of being wiped out in the elections which made them take the decision. Let me remind my friends in the BJP that the farmers have fought for the cause and emerged victorious. It is the Union government’s defeat."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/repeal-of-farm-laws-victory-of-farmers-democracy-rawat/articleshow/87806413.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Woman used as honeytrap to ‘loot’ bizman of Rs 3.3 crore, 3 of her aides held in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Two women are among three arrested on Thursday for allegedly blackmailing and extorting Rs 3.3 crore from a businessman from Kolhapur. One of the two women was used as a honeytrap to falsely implicate the 64-year-old businessman and blackmail him in a fabricated case of sexual assault, the police said. Even after the businessman paid up, the threats to get him arrested continued with a video of him with the 42-year-old woman, Monica Bhagwan alias Dev Choudhary, who “played victim”. Monica is wanted by the police. Her accomplices who have been arrested — fashion designer Lubna Wazir alias Sapna (47), Anil Choudhary alias Akash (42) and jeweller Manish Sodi (41) — helped Monica in the extortion and blackmail, said officials of the police. In 2019, the businessman was in Mumbai and had put up at a five star hotel in Andheri. Sapna, Anil and Monica who had struck up a friendship with him met him at his suite. The police said that Sapna and Anil hurriedly left the hotel, leaving Monica in the room with the businessman, saying they had to rush out urgently for some time.. This, said the police, was part of their conspiracy. Just as they returned, Monica partly undressed and lay on the bed. “As per plan, Sapna started to shoot a video of Monica in the state of undress with the businessman around. Sapna started to yell about a sexual assault on Monica,” said an officer. The businessman claimed innocence but the three threatened to call the police. “They demanded Rs 10 crore to settle the matter,” added the officer. A series of extortion threats followed. The police said that the businessman ended up paying Rs 3.25 crore over a period of time. The extortion continued until recently, said the police. Recently, they demanded Rs 5 crore, and threatened to upload the video on social media. “The businessman got suicidal and told his son to take care of his business,” said an officer. Due to his “unusual” behaviour, his son enquired what the matter was. The businessman told the son who approached the police. The police have recovered Rs 29 lakh, seven phones, gold worth Rs 9 lakh and two cars from the accused. The three were arrested while accepting Rs 17 lakh from the businessman, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/woman-used-as-honeytrap-to-loot-bizman-of-rs-3-3cr-3-of-her-aides-held-in-mumbai/articleshow/87807251.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ashok Gehlot ministers Raghu Sharma, Harish Chaudhary, Govind Singh Dotasra quit ahead of cabinet rejig||JAIPUR: The much expected cabinet reshuffle has gathered momentum with three ministers in the Ashok Gehlot government tendering their resignations to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Congress in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken revealed this to the media upon his unexpected arrival in Jaipur on Friday night. The three ministers who have tendered resignations are school education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, health minister and AICC in-charge for Gujarat Raghu Sharma and revenue minister and AICC in-charge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary. Dotasra is MoS, while Sharma and Chaudhary are cabinet ministers. With their resignations, the vacancy in the Gehlot cabinet has increased to 12. The maximum strength allowed in the state cabinet is 30, going by the 15% cap rule in the 200-member state assembly. The unannounced visit of Maken in Jaipur indicated that the cabinet reshuffle is likely to be held in the next few days. Governor Kalraj Mishra is at present in his home state of Uttar Pradesh and scheduled to return on Saturday afternoon. According to sources, even the CM came to know of Maken’s visit only at the airport when he (Gehlot) returned from Banswara. Maken told reporters that after meeting Congress MLAs one-on-one on July 30 some ministers had expressed a desire to work in the organisation instead of the government. Maken said that the three ministers had accordingly tendered their resignations to the Congress president, who had accepted the same. According to law, the resignations ought to have been tendered to the governor directly, or through the CM. Gehlot had given enough indications in the recent past about Dotasra leaving the ministry. At a teachers’ felicitation function held the other day, the CM had said that the education minister's speech at the function seemed like a farewell speech. He said that Dotasra had been requesting the party high command to divest him of one responsibility in keeping with the principle of "one man, one post". A day earlier, Gehlot had said that the party would accommodate Independents and BSP-turned-Congress MLAs in the cabinet reshuffle for supporting the Congress government during the crisis created by BJP last July. Former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and his 18 MLAs had rebelled against the Gehlot government then. After the high command’s intervention, Gehlot will have to accommodate Pilot loyalists in the reshuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-ministers-sharma-chaudhary-dotasra-quit-ahead-of-cabinet-rejig/articleshow/87807892.cms||---

The woman, who claimed to be a foreigner on a visit to India, concocted a story about being caught carrying “excess cash” and claimed that she had to “bribe officials at the airport” and asked Gonsalves to help him with the money required for the same. Gonsalves, a resident of Ambernath, lives alone while his sons stay abroad. He lodged a police complaint on Thursday. In April, he had received a call from a woman, who identified herself only as Idath from the United Kingdom. She claimed that she had found Gonsalves’s number from the dating app. After that call, the two started to chat with each other. On May 24, he got a fake call from a woman who claimed she was calling from Mumbai airport and said that Idath had to pay a penalty. What led Gonsalves to believe this fake caller was the next call which he got from Idath who corroborated the version of the person who claimed to be an airport official. “Gonsalves has said that Idath was sobbing hysterically about having to pay the money. She told him to pay up on her behalf and promised to return the entire amount.” He paid up Rs 4.8 lakh, but later found Idath’s number switched off. Even the number of the “airport official” was not reachable. On receipt of his complaint on Thursday, the police said they are trying to track down the account to which the money had been sent. —Pradeep Gupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-76-year-old-goes-on-blind-date-with-foreigner-duped-of-rs-4-8l/articleshow/87807283.cms||---

BJP state president K Surendran would inaugurate the protest programmes planned in Kozhikode on Sunday. He would also address the protest programmes at Palakkad on Saturday. Other leaders would lead the protests at the district headquarters. Kurien said BJP had declared support to the anti-K-rail protests from the start and would continue to oppose the government plan. “K-Rail is not a project that would provide any help to the poor.

---||Mumbai||Another Mumbai hospital says won’t waste vax, to give booster shots to staff, seniors||MUMBAI: A day after Bombay Hospital announced free jabs for all, Powai’s L H Hiranandani Hospital has decided to administer booster shots to its healthcare workers and the elderly if it fails to exhaust vaccine stocks within two months. The hospital, which currently has 10,000 shots of Covishield costing nearly Rs 63 lakh, said administering booster shots would be more prudent than throwing away vaccines. India still doesn’t have a policy on booster shots, although many in Mumbai and several other cities have skirted CoWin to take a third dose. It remains a hotly debated topic with the US, Israel and several countries in Europe administering booster shots already with studies showing waning antibody levels after full immunization. “Giving booster shots would be inappropriate and CoWin will not accept it till there is a national policy,” Dr N K Arora, chief of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI), told TOI. “We will have a clear national policy on boosters in the next two weeks. They mustn’t get impatient,” he said. Private hospitals in Maharashtra are holding more than 40 lakh doses and have few takers. Hiranandani’s stand comes a day after Bombay Hospital, which has 17,000 doses, became the first in the city and perhaps in the country to give free vaccines for all through donations from two organisations. On Friday, around 228 people availed of the free shots. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of Hiranandani Hospital, said even though their vaccine stocks have a shelf life till May 2022, they have decided to start using it for booster shots after 60 days. “We would prefer to wait and watch for two months or so, as we cannot rule out the possibility of a rush of people waiting to complete their second jab. After that if stocks remain, we will start giving it as free booster shot to our hospital staff and outsiders, such as elderly people,” he said. He added the hospital believes it is a better alternative to tossing doses in a bin once they reach expiry. Interestingly, not many are willing to follow Bombay Hospital’s suit or take a decision on giving boosters yet. “We are waiting for the national policy on a third shot,” said the head of a private hospital. Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital concurred that most hospitals are eagerly waiting for the booster policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-another-hosp-says-wont-waste-vax-to-give-booster-shots-to-staff-seniors/articleshow/87808730.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Nishu, now 23, had taken leave from studies to till the land vacated by the menfolk in her family as they sat in dharna at the Ghazipur border. On Friday, as the government proclaimed the nullification of the laws that led to the agitation, Nishu had an announcement of her own to make. She would head back to her classroom. "I am relieved," she said. "Education is important too." Nishu will now be able to complete her post-graduation in physical education from her college in Dehradun. PM Narendra Modi's early morning declaration had taken her by surprise on Friday. "I was preparing to go out to our fields. But we heard the news and huddled back in. Later, we took time off, the women in the family, to celebrate. Papa joined us in the afternoon. It was like a festival. It is a great achievement." In the photo from December 2020 is also an older woman in red salwar kameez. She is Nishu's mother Mukesh Devi, a feisty 56-year-old. And though not in the frame that day but present in the slushy patch of land were Nishu's aunts and her younger sister. The women had taken over the 10-bigha farm of patriarch Jasveer Choudhary. "I became famous but the camera did not capture the other women with me that day," Nishu said. Her mother added, "Modi ji took a year (to take this decision) but at least he listened to us. So, thank you. We are now more than happy to take care of our kitchens as our men will return to the fields." Choudhary, 58, beamed like a baby. "I have four children. Since childhood, Nishu used to accompany me to the fields. When I along with my two teenage sons went to Ghazipur, she held the reins and did a wonderful job. With her and the other women around, I never had to worry about my crops."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/girl-who-took-over-dads-farm-during-protests-will-head-back-to-college/articleshow/87806435.cms||Sandeep Rai

Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil confirmed that the court has granted bail to the doctor and three nurses. “Police do not require their further custody. Our investigations are on. We will summon them during the course of investigation if needed,” he said. The Ahmednagar police had arrested Dr Vishaka Shinde and the three nurses, Sapna Pathare, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant, on November 10. The Ahmednagar police had arrested Dr Vishaka Shinde and three nurses saying all four were supposed to have been at work in the ICU at the time of the incident but were not present. The police had slapped sections 304 & 304-A of IPC against them. Speaking to TOI, Dr Shinde’s lawyer, Yohan Makasare, said the judge heard all four bail applications together. “I told the court that Dr Shinde has been working as a resident at the civil hospital, doing her internship as part of her post-graduation in orthopaedics. She was not a state government employee on its payroll. She had paid Rs 2 lakh as fees for doing her internship at the hospital,” he said. Makasare said the court has ordered the four to pay a personal bond and surety bond of Rs 25,000 each with one or more sureties. “Besides, they will have to co-operate with the police in the investigation and cannot leave the Ahmednagar revenue division without the court’s permission. They are expected not to tamper with the prosecution witnesses in any manner,” he added. The state health department had terminated the services of Sheikh and Anant and suspended Dr Shinde along with the district civil surgeon, Dr Sunil Pokharna, and another medical officer, Dr Suresh Dakhe. A few days ago, the government had revoked Dr Shinde’s suspension as she was not on the payroll of the government. The medical fraternity of the civil hospital has welcomed the court’s verdict. The hospital’s doctors had stopped their OPD services ever since the arrests were effected. “The police had acted hastily based on the CCTV footage. They should have waited for the probe team that the state government has set up to submit its report before proceeding with any legal action,” said a senior medical officer of civil hospital, Dr Prasad Saigaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hospital-blaze-court-grants-bail-to-doctor-3-staff-nurses/articleshow/87805758.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Delhi||South Delhi Municipal Corporation sets January 31 deadline for 3 parks for children||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has fixed January 31 as deadline for completing work on three children parks in New Friends Colony, Dwarka, and Mayapuri. Waste and discarded material, including scrap from vehicles, tyres, fibre and seats from old swings, etc, are being used to make recreational parks. At New Friends Colony, play equipment, gazebos, sitting area, toilet blocks, office and even the entrance are being made out of 12 discarded shipping containers received from a public sector undertaking, Container Corporation of India Limited, under its CSR activity. The park has been levelled and the play equipment is being installed. The park is being developed on a 2-acre plot in Ishwar Nagar and will be opened to the public by December end, said a senior SDMC official. “The play equipment will excite and engage children while checking their physical strength and capacity to solve puzzles. For example, the colourful structure of double wall-holla and zigzag ladder on artificial mountains will be a challenge for kids,” said a south corporation official. The Woodland Adventure Park in Dwarka Sector 19 is partly complete and the work is held up due to funds constraints. The facility is spreading over 2.5 acres. Officials said that facilities like rope and rock climbing, tree decks, and mechanical rides had been provided. “These will be a woodland adventure park for kids up to 14 years of age. We are expecting to complete work here by mid-January,” said the official. In west Delhi, a 2.6-acre plot has been obtained near Mayapuri from the DDA and the process to convert it into a children’s park from the dumpyard will start soon. “We have plans to use old and discarded tyres in maximum numbers to create a playing facility. An in-house team has been formed to work upon the discarded tyres after painting or refurbishing is properly. We will also be using fibre so that the kids won’t get hurt,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-sets-jan-deadline-for-3-parks-for-children/articleshow/87807261.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Vaigai dam’s level touched the 69.42 feet mark against its maximum level of 71 feet. Hence, 3,834 cusecs was discharged into the river adding to the existing flow which saw the churning flood waters entering Madurai city in the afternoon. In the morning, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan asked people living near the banks of the river to move to safer places saying that the water passing through Peranai was 10,000 cusecs and was expected to increase to 11,000 cusecs. The causeway at Yannaikkal was flooded and water flowed over it with force. People started gathering near the causeway as soon as they saw the river in spate which prompted the authorities to erect barricades to keep them from crossing over. The river which usually flows on a small stretch touched both its banks due to the sudden flood situation. Police and revenue officials cautioned people against attempting to enter the river for taking photographs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rain-ceases-but-vaigai-in-spate/articleshow/87807891.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Oil millers fret as groundnut farmers wait for better selling price||Rajkot: With the groundnut farmers adopting a wait and watch strategy to get better price for their produce, the Saurashtra oil millers have become anxious. This is mainly because the oil millers are finding it difficult to procure the required quantity of groundnut to fulfil the rising export demand from Africa and China. Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA), the apex body of oil millers in Gujarat, claimed that farmers were selling their crops a per their needs and waiting for the prices of the commodity to come up. The oil millers are eager to buy because they do not have last year’s carry forward stock. Last year’s groundnut oil export was five times higher than normal because of crop failure in China. This year too, there are a lot of inquiries from African countries and China. Praful Desai, an exporter of peanut and groundnut oil said, “Every year in November I buy stock as per my requirement from the market. But this year I am finding it difficult to get the quantity that I require as the arrival in the market is lower.” The Rajkot Market Yard which is considered Gujarat’s groundnut trading hub too has seen low groundnut arrival after the Diwali break. Atul Kamani, president of Rajkot Market Yard Traders Association said, “About 3.5 lakh bags (30 kg of each) have arrived in the market for auction after Diwali break. Nearly 80% of buyers for the stock were oil millers. The price for 20kg groundnut had dipped to Rs 950. But with the rising demand for export, the prices rose and got stable at Rs 1,150/20kg.” Meanwhile, the government has also started registration to procure groundnut at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,110 per 20 kg. According to SOMA’s estimate, groundnut production in Gujarat was expected to reach 34.4 lakh tonnes during the current Kharif season. Though the crop suffered damage due to delayed rains and later due to excess downpour at the end of monsoon, the production is expected to be nearly the same as last year. This is because the groundnut sowing this year was in 20 lakh hectares against 16 lakh hectares the previous year. Kishor Viradiya, president of SOMA said, “Those farmers who have sown both cotton and groundnut are first selling cotton because of the good price they are getting. Farmers who have sown only groundnut are also not selling the entire crop as they are waiting for a better price. This has been the trend for the last five years. Farmers are currently selling their crop as per their needs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/oil-millers-fret-as-groundnut-farmers-wait-for-better-selling-price/articleshow/87807192.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Khotkar refuted the allegations and said that the entire transaction is on record and he purchased shares in the sugar mill after taking a loan. He told TOI, “I am not the owner of the sugar mill. I just own shares worth Rs 70 lakh there.” Khotkar claimed that a controversy is being created on the behest of a BJP leader, who considers Khotkar a big challenge in the next general elections. He further said that if Somaiya wants, he may purchase the entire mill and its land for Rs 100 crore. Somaiya said, “After the sugar mill came into existence in 1986-87, a total of 9,000 shares worth Rs 20,000 each were given to the farmers. The outstanding loan of a bank in the year 2007 was Rs 11.42 cr. The bank was forced to auction the mill and in 2012, bids were invited.” He further said, “Despite the ready reckoner of the mill’s land being Rs 70 cr, it was ‘managed’ to undervalue it, and the mill along with land was given a reserve price of Rs 42 crore.” Somaiya further alleged that the 100 acres worth Rs 940 crore that the state had given on lease has been usurped by Khotkar. The entries made on the revenue record have been challenged and the matter is being heard before Jalna additional collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rs-100cr-fraud-by-khotkar-somaiya/articleshow/87805783.cms||Mohammed Akhef

She underwent treatment at Dahod and Vadodara and was finally discharged after her condition turned stable with minimal oxygen requirement. Geeta Dharmik, who had lost her father in April had gone to Bhopal for his last rites on April 23. That trip was the beginning of her long journey with ailment after Dharmik started feeling unwell upon her return on April 25. Her husband Trilok Dharmik, a railway employee, said that Geeta stayed in home quarantine and gave her sample for a RT-PCR test. However, her oxygen levels went down on May 1 and she also started having fever and had to be rushed to the Dahod railway hospital. “Later, her tests also confirmed Covid infection,” said Trilok. Geeta was doing well for the around three days, but her condition deteriorated on May 5 and she was admitted to a private hospital in Vadodara on May 7, where she was kept till May 23. “We decided to shift her back to Dahod as she only needed oxygen therapy and all other treatment had been done,” said Trilok. Geeta was brought back to the railway hospital in Dahod. Here, she was kept on a ventilator for two months and then for another month on a BiPAP machine. Even after this, she remained on high oxygen requirement. Trilok said that about a month back Geeta’s oxygen requirement went down significantly and she needed only 1 to 1.5kg oxygen. “She regained her health to what she had been before the infection. Doctors decided to discharge her on Friday,” he said. Geeta still needs oxygen support, but can stay off it for 10 to 15 minutes. “We can manage with an oxygen concentrator now. A gas cylinder has been kept as a spare at our residence,” said Trilok, adding that her lungs were yet to recover completely and with time she may not need oxygen support at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-slayer-returns-home-after-202-days/articleshow/87806686.cms||Sachin Sharma

Choudhary was arrested for allegedly duping a Gurgaon resident on November 11. The SIT had registered one more cheating case of Rs 6 crore against Choudhary on the complaint of a former district revenue officer of Haryana for excluding his name from a cheating FIR. In the meantime, the income tax department has sought details of assets of Choudhary from the police to investigate his disproportionate income. Police had also sent a communication to the enforcement directorate (ED) to investigate the matter. The SIT sleuths had identified 45 properties of Choudhary and his family members of worth around Rs 150 crore in Chandigarh, Mohali, Kharar, Ludhiana, Zirakpur and Nayagaon.

The protesting nurses demanded that the government not hold mega vaccination drives on Sundays and also reduce the timing till 5pm. “We are working for the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive and are also going for door-to-door duty every day. This is taking a toll on us. We are ready to work hard to provide Covid-19 vaccination for all but it is unfair to give us unreasonable targets and pressurize us,” said K Chinnaponnu, Madurai district secretary, Tamil Nadu Village Health Nurses Association. “Other department officials are not providing us the support we need consistently. We are also continuously enduring verbal abuse from public who tell us not to force them to take the Covid-19 vaccine. This is greatly affecting our mental health. The state government has said that vaccination is a choice and not mandatory but are putting pressure and threatening us to achieve vaccination targets,” said a VHN. “We are not asking to relieve us from Covid vaccination duty. We just need some breathing space. Let the public also have some accountability for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine,” said another nurse. The other demands included promotion in five years instead of 33 years and 50% quota for CHNs for promotion to district maternal and child health offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nurses-hold-protest-against-high-workload-due-to-vax-duty/articleshow/87807896.cms||---

Muraleedharan was talking to reporters on Friday after visiting the family member of the BJP follower, Koppara Biju who was allegedly murdered by SDPI activists, at Manathala, near Chavakkad recently. The relatives of Biju are telling me that the police are threatening them, rather than proceeding against the accused, Muraleedharan alleged. Meanwhile, the Union minister also visited the house of Sanjith A, an RSS who was hacked to death by allegedly by SDPI men, at Elappully on Friday. He alleged that the state government is trying to scuttle an investigation by National Investigating Agency (NIA) on the brutal murder of Sanjith at Kinassery on Monday in broad daylight. “The state government wanted to keep the investigation with them to help the culprits escape the law. If the case is handed over to NIA, it will definitely probe it and bring the culprits to book. The police are in the know about the culprits in this heinous crime but not arresting them as they want them to go scot free.” The recent murders at Manathala and Palakkad indicate that SDPI activists are becoming increasingly emboldened to commit violent acts. Their target is not just a single party, but members of all parties are becoming victims of their attack, he alleged. “This is happening because the LDF government in Kerala is supporting religious terrorism and the police instead of taking action against such fundamentalist forces are threatening those who oppose them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/islamic-terror-spreading-in-kerala-alleges-union-min/articleshow/87806484.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, though present in Lucknow, will join the event from Saturday. While inaugurating the conference, Shah appreciated the role played by security forces during the Covid-19 pandemic. He stressed on better coordination between state police and other central agencies, while urging delegates to focus on quick implementation of suggestions discussed during the meet. Shah emphasised on the need to zero in on security-related issues, including coastal security, left-wing extremism, narcotics trafficking, cyber-crime and border area management.  He hailed the hybrid format of the conference as directed by the Prime Minister and observed this would help in better dissemination of cutting-edge proposals. He emphasised on reforms at police stations for effective policing. Police chiefs of states and union territories and director-generals of central armed police force were present at the police headquarters at Lucknow. Around 350 officers attended the session virtually from Intelligence Bureau offices in various states and union territories. Shah distributed police medals to Intelligence Bureau officers for meritorious service and handed out trophies to station house officers of three best police stations — Sadar Bazaar in Delhi, Gangapur in Odisha and Bhatta Kalan in Haryana.

---||Delhi||Until next year? Stubble burning season nears end||NEW DELHI: The farm stubble burning season is drawing to a close, with fire counts in Punjab and Haryana starting to decline. The daily farm fire count came down from over a 1,000 a few days ago to 285 in Punjab and 67 in Haryana on Thursday, according to images from Nasa’s VIIRS-SNPP satellite. Delhi’s air quality, however, remained “very poor” for the third consecutive day on Friday with the air quality index at 380. A late monsoon withdrawal and frequent rain had kept the farm fires low in the first few weeks of October, but the number saw a steep rise in November and even surpassed the figures of the past few years. An analysis by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) on the trend of farm fires in 2021 as against 2020 shows that the combined daily count of Punjab and Haryana crossed 3,000-mark in the last week of October last year. This year, it touched 3,000 in the first week of November. L S Kurinji, programme associate of CEEW, said, “This year, Punjab and Haryana reported over 84,000 farm fires, the highest since 2016. The cumulative number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana observed a marked spike from just 20,723 until October 31 to 84,513 till November 18. However, he added, the fire count “has started to decrease as we approach the Kharif season’s end”. Over the past two days, the cumulative daily count stood at less than 1,000 farm fires as opposed to the daily peak of 3,000-6,000 at the start of November, Kurinji pointed out. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was 3% on Friday. “While the farm fires usually subside by mid-November, a delay of four-five days is noted, especially in Punjab, this year. This slight shift in the trend can be attributed to the delayed harvest on account of late monsoon withdrawal,” he observed. Gufran Beig, founder project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said, “If the wind direction and transport-level wind speed are favourable, the low fire counts can also impact Delhi’s air.” However, experts emphasised the focus should now be on controlling other sources of pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Farm fire is an episodic problem around this time of the year. The daily fire count will become negligible soon. Now the focus has to be on aggressive control of local pollution in the entire NCR to prevent more smog episodes this winter. Also roll out the strategies for round-the-year action.” According to SAFAR, Delhi’s air quality is likely to improve to the lower end of “very poor” or “poor” from Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/until-next-year-stubble-burning-season-nears-end/articleshow/87807286.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Aurangabad||HC issues notices to Centre, 6 others over CNG pipeline issue||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court has directed notices to be issued to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (P&NG) and six other respondents in response to a PIL filed by four lawyers, raising objection to the way the work of installing a 24-inch CNG pipeline — connecting Shrigonda in Ahmednagar district with Aurangabad city — is being carried out. The notices are returnable on November 29 when the matter is slated for next hearing. The Rs 2,000-crore project, being executed by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) subsidiary Bharat Gas Resources Limited (BGRL), is part of the larger Dahej-Vishakhapatnam CNG pipeline project. It has a junction at Shrigonda from where a 175-km-long pipeline will connect with Aurangabad city that is expected to get household piped gas connections in the next two years. “The counsel (for the petitioners) submits that the laying down of the CNG pipeline has not been done in accordance with the norms and because of that one person has already lost life. The pipelines are not being installed five feet below the ground. Thus, nuisance is caused,” the HC division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice RN Laddha said on November 15 while asking all respondents to file their written response. Apart from the ministry of P&NG, BPCL, BGRL, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad district collectors, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) are the other respondents. The four petitioner-lawyers, who hail from Nevasa in Ahmednagar district, have pleaded through their counsel Ganesh Gadhe that as per norms the CNG pipeline should be laid at least five feet below the earth’s surface, but at several places it is being laid between one to three feet under the ground. The debris of road digging work alongside the highways and roads controlled by the NHAI and MSRDC are posing serious threat of accidents to motorists, they claimed. The work of laying down CNG pipeline is not in accordance with the standard technical norms set by the BGRL, which specifically mentions that the steel gas pipe should be laid underground with a minimum clear cover of 1.2 meter, the petitioners pleaded. Due to non-implementation of this specific norm by the contractor carrying out the work, it has become a threat to life of surrounding residents in the form of hazardous substances, the petitioners said, citing that explosion and gas disaster caused by accidents cannot be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-issues-notices-to-centre-6-others-over-cng-pipeline-issue/articleshow/87805785.cms||Mohammed Akhef

It has also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on him. The convict had kept the girl in confinement for seven months, when she was rescued. Initially, her father had filed a kidnapping case against Ali, then 25 years old, but after the girl was rescued from Moradabad and he learnt about her ordeal, sections of rape were added to the FIR. Special public prosecutor, POCSO Act, Basant Singh Saini said the girl, daughter of a farmer from Kanth area of Moradabad, was on a visit to her maternal grandparents’ house in Amroha when she was abducted. Ali knew the girl as she was a neighbour at the village. According to police, Ali came to the minor’s maternal grandparents’ house and told them that the girl’s mother was sick and asked her to come home. He had been sent to fetch her. He took the girl with him. The girl’s father arrived a few days later and found her missing. He approached local police as he was unable to find her. He filed a complaint against Ali. It took police seven months to locate and rescue the girl. The accused was arrested and sent to jail. Special public prosecutor Saini said at one point, the two parties came to an agreement on withdrawing the case. But based on evidence, the court convicted Ali and sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-gets-10-year-jail-term-for-kidnapping-raping-minor/articleshow/87806488.cms||Harveer Dabas

The last cases (2) were registered on November 10 though civic officials insist that at least 700 people are tested here daily. “B Ward has had cases in single digits for some time now. In fact, it has the lowest proportion in the city’s 7.6 lakh tally,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Since the Covid pandemic began in March 2020, the area has registered only 4,121 cases so far. Another official said people’s exposure to the virus must have been high due to cheek-by-jowl living conditions. “But it seems to have led to herd immunity here,” he said. Congress MLA Amin Patel remembers the pandemic began on a bad note here. While the overall Covid mortality has been around 1%, the area initially saw a 10% mortality. "Almost 10% of positive cases in the ward would pass away,” said Patel. But the all-round panic along with public health measures of sealing and isolating patients helped check the initial spread, he said. The change in B ward’s pandemic profile prompted officials to conduct an internal study. “The economic profile of the area is poor. Houses are close to each other and congested with no cross ventilation. In some areas, windows open into windows of neighbouring buildings,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The area also has many illegal constructions that don’t observe basic civic rules. Kakani ordered a study into why wards B, C and M East, despite having huge slum pockets with poor living conditions, had the lowest Covid numbers. “We thought it could be some underlying disease condition or exposure to a previous virus that was leading to some immunity, but the team couldn’t come up with any scientific reason for it,’’ he said. Local civic officials and social activists say public health measures such as roping in more community health volunteers and using local influencers helped during the first wave. During the second wave, the focus has been on vaccination. B ward’s civic in-charge Dhanaji Herlekar said the ward had 13 and one ‘zero’ tally days in October and September respectively. “We are aggressively working towards vaccinating maximum people. So far, we have managed to vaccinate 95,164 people,” said Hirlekar. Vaccine drives have been held in madarsas and community centres. “We also held many sessions for women only,” said Hirlekar. B ward’s medical health officer Dr Sandeep Gaikwad said, “We roped in local people who knew the area well as most of our staff didn’t live locally,” he said. The two groups worked well in explaining the need to test, quarantine or get vaccinated. “Those who died during the early days were persons with co-morbidities. Deaths are extremely low now,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/smallest-ward-of-mumbai-city-clocks-zero-cases-for-9-straight-days/articleshow/87808749.cms||Richa Pinto

Pimpri Chinchwad commissionerate had received a total of 21,000 applications for filling up the posts of 720 constables. As many as 80 examination centres from Aurangabad district, including 71 from Aurangabad city, were shortlisted. Due to the candidates’ failure to check the updates about examination centres, several students, who had reached Aurangabad, ended up at the wrong centres. On learning about it, Pimpri-Chinchwad’s assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Naik-Patil and senior inspector Madhukar Sawant brought the matter to the notice of senior officers. Police vehicles were used to take the candidates to the correct centres. More than 1,100 policemen and officers, including 500 from Aurangabad city, were deployed for the examination bandobast. Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta also asked the authorities to grant extra time to the candidates, who had reached the centres late. Sawant said, “An N-4 Cidco examination centre was changed due to lack of facilities on November 14. The candidates were sent text messages, email and fresh hall tickets, but some of them failed to check the updates and ended up reaching this centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-recruitment-candidates-get-help-to-reach-exam-centres-extra-time-for-test/articleshow/87805801.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Welcoming the decision of the Centre to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Shetti said they shouldn’t have been drafted at all. Shetti, who had tabled Private Members’ Bill in the Parliament in 2018, said, “I had introduced two bills — loan waiver to farmers and guaranteeing remunerative prices for farm produce. Now that the farm law that aimed to do away with the MSP system has been repealed, it is time to re-introduce the Private Members’ Bill. Farmers will get remunerative prices without worrying about artificial price drop or frauds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-will-raise-voice-till-msp-a-reality/articleshow/87805789.cms||---
---||Lucknow||After repealing 3 farm laws, PM Narendra Modi in Bundelkhand slams opposition’s agriculture politics||LUCKNOW/JHANSI: Hours after he announced repeal of the three farm laws, which were at the epicentre of a raging farmers’ protest for a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose parched Bundelkhand to tear into Opposition parties, accusing them of pushing farmers into a quandary to cement their very foundation. “Kisanon ko samasyaon mein uljhana hi kuch rajnaitik dalon ka aadhar raha hai. (Entangling farmers in unsurmountable problems forms the foundation of their politics)," Modi said, while addressing a gathering after inaugurating Rs 3200crore Arjun Sahayak, Bhawni and Ratauli and Majgaon irrigation projects from Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh. The projects would benefit not only Mahoba, but also Hamirpur and Lalitpur. PM’s remark marked his pointed counter-offensive at the Opposition, which sought to corner BJP for taking the decision vis-à-vis repealing farm laws in view of ensuing assembly elections in various states, including politically crucial Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. He slammed the Opposition for running a government of ‘parivarwadis’, who kept farmers in perpetual penury. “They make announcements in the name of farmers, but not a penny reaches them," he said, highlighting how Centre’s flagship PM Kisan Samman Nidhi managed to distribute Rs 1.62lakh crore to small and marginal farmers in the country. “Ye (opposition) samsyaon ki rajneeti karte hain aur hum samadhan ki rashtra neeti karte hain (Opposition does politics over problems, we do the politics of solutions)," he said, stressing that his government took steps to facilitate farmers on various fronts, including providing them quality seeds, helping them sell their produce in the open market, raising MSP of various crops, including pulses and initiating a national mission for making the country self-reliant in production of cooking oil. Modi squarely accused the Opposition of turning once fertile Bundelkhand into a parched region, triggering exodus of villagers. He said, people who ruled Delhi and UP for years did not spare a chance to impair the region. “Forests and other key resources of the region were handed over to the mafia,” he said. “In logon ne Bundelkhand se saath jaisa bartav kiya usey yahan ke log kabhi bhool nahi sakte. (People of Bundelkhand can never forgive or forget the apathetic attitude of former regimes),” he said, admonishing the previous government for swindling funds for their own “personal interest and for benefit of their families” while leaving the poor to struggle for a drop of water. “Everyone knows the truth. Only ‘commission and loot' prevailed in implementation of projects and schemes,” he said in an apparent reference to massive funds pumped into Bundelkhand, but without result. Modi categorically pointed out how false promises in the name of installing tubewells, hand pumps and constructing ponds and lakes were made without making people aware about the plunging ground water-table. “The government of ‘parivaarwadis' kept people of Bundelkhand thirsty, but the double-engine government of ‘karmyogis’ provided tap water supply to 30 lakh people in last two years,” he said, citing a host of initiatives taken by the BJP government for women and poor. The PM also cited the Arjun Sahayak project, which was left languishing for years. “It was only after 2014 that the Centre sought records of such projects. We discussed with then UP government about this project, but nothing happened," he said, terming the previous SP regime as “Gunehgaar of Bundelkhand” (Villain of Bundelkhand), which was not interested in completing irrigation projects. He asserted it was only after 2017, when BJP came to power in UP, that the project was fast-tracked. “Woh UP ko loot kar nahi thakte they...aur hum kaam karte karte nahi thakte hain (They were not tired of looting UP, we don’t tire working),” he said, adding the Centre and the state government were trying their best to resolve problems of Bundelkhand. Asserting that the laying of Bundelkhand expressway and UP Defence Industrial Corridor would open new vistas of employment for the youth, PM stressed the region also had vast potential for religious tourism to boost growth of the region and the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-oppn-pushed-farmers-into-quandary-to-cement-pol-foundation/articleshow/87808406.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||High spirits for booze business licence flood Telangana with cash||HYDERABAD: It was a day records were broken in terms of liquor licensing auction for 2021-23. The state saw 67,841 applications pour in, with 121 applicants jostling for a single shop in Madhira town of Khammam. While each shop in the state received an average of 24 applications, the excise department earned more than the estimated revenue of almost Rs 1,400 crore in just few days as application fees. Majority of applications came from districts of Khammam and Mahbubnagar, which share a border with Andhra Pradesh. For 2,620 stores across the state, Khammam district alone received over 10,000 applications. In terms of individual stores, the second highest number of applications were received for a shop located in the same Madhira town, with 119 people seeking a licence. “We are equally surprised. True to its name, both shops in Madhira town had so many applicants,” said an excise official. Three other shops in town received more than 90 applications. On the final day of applications, Thursday, a whopping 37,152 applications were filed until late hours across the state. Officials credit the significant number of applications to two key factors. First, many people from Andhra Pradesh applied since the government is selling booze directly to people without providing individual permits. “The Telangana government also campaigned on improved margins for retailers on liquor sales, which resulted in many people filing applications at the last minute, and there was no limit on the number of applications submitted by each person.” officials said, about the second reason. During the last auction, 48,000 applications were received making this times figures a huge increase. Interestingly, a shop in Mortad village in Nizamabad district was the only one that received a single application. The number of applicants in each auction has been increasing, officials said on Friday. The application cost in 2017 auction was only ₹1 lakh, garnering ₹498 crore income; which increased to ₹968 crore in the 2019 auction and Rs 1,208 crore in 2021. From the 2019 auction, application price was raised to ₹2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-spirits-for-booze-biz-licence-floods-t-with-cash/articleshow/87807295.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

It was ‘Dev Deepawali’, the Diwali of Gods, in Kashi, the permanent abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Annapurna. Amid the unique merger of heavenly and earthly with religious fervour, the city also witnessed the modern paraphernalia like shows of hot-air balloon and musical laser during the Dev Deepawali, which is celebrated a fortnight after the festival of Diwali on Kartik Purnima. The reflection of illuminated riverfront in the river and floating diyas in the stream created a mesmerizing world from the beholders. The grand Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat and the riverfront beauty were also watched by the crowds of people from boats as well as ghats. For Hindus, the Kartik month is believed to be one of the holiest months. It holds great importance in Hindu culture. Hundreds of ‘akashdeeps’ (sky lamps) are hung in baskets at the top of bamboo poles along the ghats particularly at Panchganga Ghat in the evening during the month. It is believed that these lamps brighten the way of ancestors on their annual visit to the earth. According to tradition, Lord Vishnu wakes up from his slumber of ‘charutmas’ on Prabodhini Ekadasi. During the five day from Prabodhini Ekadasi to Kartik Purnima, the ghats witness the morning bathers, who stop at Bindu Madhav temple for the darshan of Lord Vishnu. Kartik Purnima is one of the biggest bathing festivals, when lakhs of devotees take holy bath in the Ganga. Thousands of devotees from far-off places started thronging the ghats since Thursday afternoon, and with the daybreak they started taking dip in the Ganga. After bathing they offered prayers to the deities. A sea of devotees was seen along the ghats. Elaborate security and traffic arrangements were made for the convenience of people and visiting tourists and VIPs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also witnessed the grandeur of Dev Deepawali last year. “The Dev Deepawali festival has become a global event today after the participation of the Prime Minister last year,” said UP minister Neelkanth Tiwari, adding that the state government has been actively supporting the festival since 2018. “Before 2018, there was no support of the government in such an event,” he said and added that with a beginning from Panchganga Ghat in the past, today the festival is celebrated at all ghats. The government set a target to illuminate the riverfront with 12 lakh earthen lamps on the ghat steps for which 120 committees were formed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/majestic-ganga-ghats-light-up-as-kashi-celebrates-dev-deepawali/articleshow/87807293.cms||Binay Singh

The water level reached 2,399.70ft at 7pm. One shutter of Cheruthoni dam was lifted up to 40cm on Thursday in the wake of opening of the spillway shutters of Mullaperiyar dam. A KSEB dam safety official said that the water level was slowly increasing in the Idukki reservoir. “The present rule curve for Idukki dam will end on Saturday and the new rule curve will be applicable from midnight onwards. As per the rule curve fixed by the central water commission, from November 21 onwards the orange alert level will be 2,401ft, red alert level will be 2,402ft and upper rule level will be 2,403ft,” said the official. According to the KSEB officials, the shutter of Cheruthoni dam would be closed soon after the rule curve changes. The closing of the shutter also depends on the rainfall in the catchment area, said an official. For the last 24 hours, the rainfall in the catchment areas of the dam was very low and it was 1.8mm. The power generation at Moolamattam power plant is at maximum level and it generated 17.171mu on Friday. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu closed one more spillway shutter of the Mullaperiyar dam and the height of another shutter was reduced to 10cm after the water level in the dam decreased. The officials on Thursday opened four spillway shutters after the water level rose to the rule curve level of 141ft on Friday morning. Later, TN closed two shutters. The water level declined to 140.90ft at 7pm on Friday. The new rule curve will come into effect at Mullaperiyar dam from Sunday onwards. The new upper rule curve till November 30 is 142ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/slow-rise-in-water-level-of-idukki-dam/articleshow/87806495.cms||---
---||Meerut||Scenes of celebrations with gur, laddus & impromptu jigs around tractors in west UP, U’khand||Meerut/Muzaffarnagar/Agra/Rudrapur/Roorkee: After months of protesting against the three contentious farm laws, farmers in parts of western Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand burst into a frenzy of celebrations following PM Narendra Modi's announcement to repeal the three laws. Jaggery (gur) and laddus were freely passed around and there were scenes of impromptu jigs around tractors to the tune of ragini songs and the beats of drums. While the farmers celebrated their "victory", many maintained a cautious approach. "It took a year for the government to make this decision. Farmers suffered a lot. They didn't deserve this kind of treatment," said Jitender Hooda, a farmer in Shamli. Another farmer, Naveen Pradhan, from Meerut, said, "A huge burden is off the shoulders of farmers. But they paid a heavy price to achieve this. We've sacrificed hundreds of our brethren during the year-long agitation. The government should not try to take credit for this so-called 'benevolence'. It was their mistake and they had to rectify it." Rakesh Dhankad, also from Meerut, said that “the decision was taken out of electoral compulsion." Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar said, “We welcome the decision. On Guru Nanak Dev ji's birthday, we are now on the threshold of victory - of truth and patience." In Agra, many also said that the PM should provide monetary help to the families of those who died during the agitation. Family members at the Kasganj house of Lakhvinder Singh, 60, who fell ill near Ghazipur border and died soon after on January 22, were still in mourning. His brother Satnam Singh said, “Over 700 farmers, including my brother, lost their lives. The PM did not utter a word in their memory.” Interestingly, the members of the ruling party who were advocating the "goodness of the agri laws" till a day ago, now sang a different tune. BJP's west UP vice-president Manoj Poswal said, "Modi ji took this decision in public interest to free ignorant farmers from the clutches of political opportunists." Meanwhile, the farmers of the Terai region, also known as the 'rice bowl of Uttarakhand', were elated. They assembled in Jaspur, Kashipur, Gadarpur, Rudrapur, Kichha, Nanakmatta, Sitarganj and Khatima towns to distribute sweets and burst crackers. "It is a huge relief for the people of the Terai region. It's a win for farmers and the labourers," said Tejender Singh Virk, president of the Terai Kisan Mahasabha, who was critically injured in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 and is still undergoing treatment. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said the protesting farmers would wait till the laws are repealed in Parliament. "We don't trust this government. They never stood for our cause," added Karm Singh Padda, BKU's state president. While Sahab Singh, district president of BKU (Chadhuni), said that "we will continue our peaceful protest till we get the official papers."

Show cause notices have been issued to NMC staffers for recovering Rs10 from beneficiaries for printing out the vaccination certificate. TOI had on November 18 reported the civic body had opened and was operating a vaccination centre in storeroom at New Chopde Lawn at Awasthi Square in West Nagpur, violating the guidelines of Covid-19 vaccination drive. Taking serious cognizance of TOI’s report, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi directed officials to visit the centre and do the needful. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar visited the centre and directed officials of NMC Mangalwari Zone to close the centre. “We have shut down the centre. Staffers working at the centres have now been engaged in door-to-door survey and vaccination. Mangalwari Zone is planning to restart the centre in a hall in the same area in next few days,” he said. Dr Chilkar admitted the centre was not operating as per guidelines of the government. The centre was operated from a tin-shed room, which was a makeshift facility for storing materials used for decorating and hosting functions at the lawn. As per government guidelines, waiting hall, registration arena, another room for vaccination and third one for observation of beneficiaries for 30 minutes are mandatory at every centre. NMC had not displayed any banner or board highlighting it as its centre. But Chopde had displayed a banner, which was also a violation of model code of conduct in place for MLC elections. The banner highlighted the centre along with the BJP party symbol, pictures of Chopde and other leaders. Collector R Vimala said, “A team visited the lawn. Banner was found removed.” TOI had also reported Rs10 was being charged to beneficiaries at the centre for printing out of certificate. Dr Chilkar said it was also a violation. “Show cause notices have been issued to staffers working at the centre.” Chopde was also sending messages in social media groups every morning, saying Covishield was available free of cost at New Chopde Lawns from 11am. Though the centre was run by the civic body, the messages had no mention about the NMC or government providing free vaccine facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-shuts-vax-centre-in-storeroom-of-bjp-netas-lawn/articleshow/87807308.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Two metro trains will be kept as reserve. These two metro trains will remain parked in the depot. There will be a total of eight metro trains designated for the nine-kilometre priority. At present, two metro trains are available. Both are parked in the depot. One of them is also being used for carrying out trials under the supervision of RDSO. A third metro train got dispatched from Gujarat on Friday night. It will reach here in industrial city after a couple of days. By the end of December, the remaining metro trains will arrive. Metro trains are being readied in Gujarat from where the trains will be dispatched for Kanpur via road route. It then takes six to seven days to reach here. Metro train coaches started arriving in Kanpur in September. In September and October, two coaches of the train had arrived. The three coaches saffron-coloured metro train can accommodate over 974 passengers. Kanpur Metro trains are state of the art infrastructure and once services are rolled out commercially, people will get the latest and modern metros for commuting. While the work on the priority corridor is nearing completion, the construction work for the underground metro station at Naveen market is also in progress. It will take at least one year or even more to construct the underground stations between Chunniganj and Nayaganj. Meanwhile, on Friday evening, the metro trial was carried out by the RDSO. The trial was carried out between IIT and LLR. The trial was done at different speeds. The speeds at which the metro was run was 50km/hour, 70km/hour and 90 km/hour. The launch of the Metro trial was done by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on November 10. The trials started immediately after the launch. The trials will go on for four to six weeks before the services are commercially launched - most probably by the end of December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/six-metro-trains-to-run-on-9km-long-iit-motijheel-priority-corridor/articleshow/87807311.cms||---

Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said an average person in Delhi burns unnecessary fuel for 25-30 minutes a day and the campaign seeks to eliminate this practice. Launching the second phase of the campaign at the ITO intersection on Friday, Rai said, “The ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, which had been running for the past one month, has been extended for 15 more days. This marks the second phase of the campaign, which will run till December 3.” He added, “On an average, a person in Delhi crosses 10-12 intersections or traffic signals in a day, for which even a rough waiting time of two minutes per intersection amounts to 20-25 minutes of unnecessary fuel burning. This rough figure for the large population of Delhi is a significant contributor to the pollution in our atmosphere. Keeping this in mind, the objective of this campaign is to prevent people from polluting through their vehicles while waiting at red lights. By doing this, there will be a significant decrease in unnecessary fuel burning, as a result of which the pollution levels in Delhi will be brought down. Hence, this campaign in its second phase aims to further reduce vehicle pollution.” Commenting on the repeal of the three farm laws, Rai said this is a huge victory for the farmers’ movement. “This is such an arrogant government that it left farmers unaided on the roads in summer, winter, rain, and saw many get martyred. The central government was not ready to listen to anyone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/red-light-on-gaadi-off-drive-enters-second-phase/articleshow/87807314.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Healthy move: Telangana likely to increase Aarogyasri coverage to Rs 5 lakh soon||HYDERABAD: In a significant step towards providing free and high-quality healthcare to people, the state government is expected to increase the Aarogyasri coverage from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. A formal directive is expected to be issued soon. According to sources, the state administration is currently soliciting inputs from the state’s network hospitals and experimenting with various possibilities. They added that the decision, to enhance the cover, was taken keeping in mind the fact that the cost of basic treatment too has increased in recent years. This has pushed many people into seeking additional debts to meet their medical expenditures. “Therefore, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has proposed raising the coverage limit to reduce the load on people,” a top source said. According to insiders, the enhanced limit will also be beneficial if more than one member takes ill in a year. Aarogyasri currently covers 1,020 forms of treatment, while the Ayushman Bharat Yojana of the Central government covers 1,668 treatments. After strong opposition to the Centre’s demand to apply their healthcare system, the Telangana government implemented the scheme this year. The state has now integrated both schemes. Both schemes share 1,020 treatments, while the central scheme also includes 646 schemes. Aarogyasri covers 79 lakh people, while Aayushman Bharat Yojana covers an additional 30 lakh families. But sources said that several large hospitals are refusing to accept patients insured by the scheme due to delay in payments. Network hospitals have also often complained to the state government about late payments. “If the payments are not too far behind schedule, many hospitals will take patients under the system,” said the manager of a network hospital, adding. “It is true that broadening the coverage will greatly benefit patients. So, we will do our best to provide the best service possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/healthy-move-t-likely-to-increase-aarogyasri-coverage-to-rs-5l-soon/articleshow/87807298.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s maha dharna led to repeal of farm laws, says TRS||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) said party president K Chandrasekhar Rao’s dharna on Thursday was one of the reasons for the repeal of three farm laws by the Centre. “The (Narendra) Modi government feared that situation was going out of its hand. If the farmers’ protest spreads from north to south and KCR takes the lead, it would be difficult for them,” ministers S Niranjan Reddy and G Jagadish Reddy and MLA Balka Suman said at a press conference here on Friday. Soon after the Prime Minister’s announcement that the government would repeal the farm laws, the TRS hailed the decision and said it was a victory of the entire farming community and those fighting against the agri laws over a year. The party also demanded compensation to those who lost their lives in the protests. Party working president KT Rama Rao tweeted, “The power of people is always greater than the people in power.” Party MLC K Kavitha said in tweet: “A historic victory for our farmers. My humble tributes to the martyrs for their supreme sacrifice.” Finance minister T Harish Rao said farmers have proved their commitment and strength through their dharnas and hunger strikes on the farm laws. Telangana Rashtra Samithi MPs Kotha Prabhakar Reddy, Ranjit Reddy, P Ramulu, Manne Srinivas Reddy, M Kavitha and Venkatesh Netha said the Centre should announce ex gratia to the farmers who died during protests. “There was momentum at the Centre after KCR’s dharna at Indira Park. Several CMs of the states have decided to follow KCR on the farmers-related issues,” the MPs said. The party organised celebrations at Telangana Bhavan and Gun Park where party MLAs Danam Nagender and Maganti Gopinath took part. BJP political strategy behind move: DasuDasu Suresh, national working president of national BC welfare association, said Modi government’s decision to cancel the three controversial farm laws, calling it willpower of 62 crore farmers. Dasu said recent by-election results probably forced the ruling party to introspect and make this move. Government’s U-turn after defending laws and refusing to back down comes months before elections in some states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcrs-maha-dharna-led-to-repeal-of-farm-laws-trs/articleshow/87807305.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: EOU raids premises of suspended CO, unearths disproportionate assets||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the state police on Friday raided three premises of suspended circle officer of Koilwar, Anuj Kumar, after registering a disproportionate assets (DA) case against him. The EOU has found frequent money transfers in two bank accounts of Kumar’s wife from business establishments existing only on papers. The CO was earlier accused of conniving with sand smugglers. He was suspended by the state government along with 40 other officials, including two IPS officers, in June this year for allegedly turning a blind eye to illegal sand mining and smuggling. The FIR against Kumar was registered on Thursday following which the EOU procured search warrants and conducted raids at his rented accommodation at flat number 303 in Block-C of Vamika Enclave in Jagdeopath, Patna, paternal residence at Narhat Laugh village under the Sirdalla police station area in Nawada and his in-laws’ residence in Durga Shankar Road, Gaya. EOU sources said Kumar’s approximate disproportionate assets were calculated to be nearly 52% more than his total income from all known sources. “His total income from all sources, including salary, was Rs 80 lakh,” a senior EOU officer said. He added Rs 20 lakh had been deposited in two separate bank accounts of Kumar’s wife even though she is a housewife and has no source of income. “Most transfers were made from 2019 onwards when Kumar was posted in Koilwar,” the officer said. EOU authorities said they found around Rs 5 lakh in two bank accounts of Kumar. “The total value of his movable and immovable properties is estimated to be Rs 44 lakh. However, immovable properties are undervalued in deeds. They might be of worth a few crores in actual market price,” another senior EOU officer said. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said Kumar’s ill-gotten money probably came for hawala transactions and real estate in form of cash. He added several valuable items, including household goods, cash and jewellery were probably removed from the premises of Kumar which the EOU raided on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-premises-of-suspended-co-unearths-da/articleshow/87807323.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: 30 years after being rejected, teacher gets appointment and Rs 80 lakh||DEHRADUN: In 1989, following an advertisement in a newspaper, then 24-year-old Gerald John applied for the post of commerce teacher at CNI Boys’ Inter College, a government-aided minority educational institute in Dehradun. However, despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he did not get the job. In 1990, the Farrukhabad resident moved Allahabad high court (HC). After Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in 2000, the case was transferred to the HC in Nainital. Finally, as he turned 55, the Uttarakhand HC ruled in his favour in December last year -- ordering him to be appointed in the school as well as release of Rs 80 lakh as compensation. Of this, he was paid Rs 73 lakh by the Uttarakhand government a few months back although the balance of Rs 7 lakh, which is to be paid by the UP government, is still due. Being the senior-most teacher, John is also the acting principal of the school now. Reminiscing about his long fight, John told TOI that he was quite taken aback when despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he did not get the job. “When I asked authorities why I was rejected, I was told the candidate needed to have stenography skills to be selected. Stenography was not mentioned as one of the required criteria in the job listing. I suspected that the candidate who got the job had connived with authorities. That’s when I decided to take the matter to court.” The case made little progress until 2000, when it was shifted to the newly-functional Uttarakhand high court in Nainital after. Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh. In 2007, a single bench of the Uttarakhand HC ruled against John. He challenged the verdict at the Supreme Court. Here, former union minister and lawyer Salman Khurshid took up his case and fought it for free. “Khurshid saw it as a genuine case and since both of us are from Farrukhabad, he did not take any fee. The case stayed in SC from 2007 to 2010, when the court said that the case had merit and asked us to appeal for it in front of a double bench of the HC instead of a single bench. Ten years after the case moved back to Uttarakhand HC, a double bench ruled in John’s favour in December 2020. In January this year, John was appointed the Commerce teacher for classes 11 and 12 at the CNI Boys’ Inter College. In April, after the principal retired, he was also made the acting principal. “The high court ordered that I should be given around 60% of the salary I would have earned since 1989. That came to around Rs 80 lakh. Had I worked, I would have received a total of Rs 1.25 crore,” he said, adding that the fight was worth it, since he will now receive pension once he retires at the age of 60 in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-decades-after-man-denied-teachers-post-despite-topping-merit-list-he-gets-the-job-plus-rs-80l-compensation/articleshow/87805815.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kochi||Ernakulam authorities plan more festivals in rural areas of post-Covid period||TS.Sreemol KOCHI: The festivals, which used to be concentrated in the city, are moving to rural areas in the post-Covid period to leverage local economy and encourage morale of residents in Ernakulam. The district is going to witness many festivals, which will last for days, next month. It has been decided to conduct festivals in Vypeen and Cheranelloor and discussions are going on to conduct another one in Kolencherry. The folklore festival in Vypeen will be held between December 1 and 31. While Cheranelloor festival, which will focus on culture and tradition of Kerala, will be held between December 21 and 31. The festival in Kolencherry will give thrust to Kudumbashree works and the value-added products they make. The date of the festival is yet to be decided. The Vypeen festival will see around 50 artists from across the state making graffiti on a 25-km stretch from Goshree Junction to Munambam beach for the first 15 days. The next 15 days will witness performances of various folklore art forms of Kerala at various venues. The festival will also include local cuisine using marine products, musical programmes in memory of Mehboob and products related to fishing, which is the traditional vocation of people in Vypeen. The festival will be conducted in eight panchayats falling under Vypeen constituency. “The festival is part of promoting tourism in the area to encourage people in the post-Covid period. Support for folklore art forms and artists in Kerala and making beaches in Vypeen part of cultural centres are some of the objectives of the festival,” said Vypeen MLA Unnikrishnan. While Cheranelloor festival will be held in the panchayat limit alone by setting up a shopping village near Varapuzha bridge. “We will set up traditional houses of tribespeople in Kerala with the support of the forest department in the shopping centre along with other products used in the state many years ago. We create an opportunity for people to come out and enjoy the festival mood,” said panchayat president K G Rajesh. The festivals are conducted in association with the district administration, tourism department and private agencies. In Kolencherry, Kunnathunad MLA P V Sreenijan has discussed the possibilities of conducting a festival with Kudumbashree officials. “We are planning to conduct the Kudumbashree festival in five venues. Their competitions will be held and food counters will be set up at various places as part of the festival. Officials will give a detailed report on the festival this week,” said Sreenijan. “These festivals are aimed at reviving the local community. Earlier, we used to celebrate such festivals along with other celebrations like Onam. But due to the pandemic, such festivals could not be conducted in the last two years,” said DTPC secretary in-charge Abilash Kumar T G.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-plan-more-festivals-in-rural-areas-post-covid-period/articleshow/87805810.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Forest department stays felling of trees at Chimbel||PANAJI: The proposed felling of 30-odd trees at Provedoria’s old age home at Chimbel, which had evoked fresh protests recently from villagers and activists, has been stayed by the forest department. The permission to fell the trees had been granted by deputy conservator of forest and Provedoria, which runs the old age home at Chimbel. The felling of trees was scheduled on November 17. A controversy has arisen over the location of the new old age home – to be built from central government funds at the historic site – after Provedoria chose the site on the western side with a green patch instead of demolition of the old building.  After Chimbel villager Brian Gonsalves filed an appeal, seeking to quash the permission for felling of the trees, conservator of forests stayed the felling and fixed a hearing on the plea on December 2. The Provedoria authorities have also decided not to go ahead with felling of the trees on the basis of advice from higher authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forest-dept-stays-felling-of-trees-at-chimbel/articleshow/87807971.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC faces loss as cos’ plan user change of plots in Empress Van||Nagpur: Adding fuel to a controversy, two private companies are trying to change user of its industrial plots in Empress Van under section 37 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act under provisions that would require them to pay lesser amount of premium. If this happens, the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will incur financial loss like what had happened in other cases in the past. Controversy had erupted couple of years ago after NMC proposed to construct road from Empress Van by felling 380 trees. Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC) is supposed to construct the road as it owns the industrial layout in Empress Van. Even as funds yet to be received from MSTC, NMC has started road construction after issuing tender and appointing a private contractor. Trees have been cut down followed by execution of works like laying storm water drain, levelling the land for road etc. Activists including advocate Ankita Shah had alleged the civic body was doing this to benefit three companies that have purchased sprawling plots in the layout. A couple of years ago, Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Orange City Garment Park and Acharya Shree Vidyasagar Garment Vyapari Welfare Society had purchased plot nos 1, 2 and 8, respectively, from MSTC. The companies have proposed commercial projects on the plots whose user is industrial. It requires change of user from industrial to commercial. Last year, Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP and Orange City Garment Park had submitted an application with urban development minister Eknath Shinde seeking user charge under section 37 of the MRTP Act. Under this provision, companies will have to pay 5% of ready reckoner value of the plots. The state government and NMC will get share of 50% each. The urban development department (UDD) directed the NMC to submit details. NMC said user change under section 37 of MRTP Act cannot be permitted but there is provision of change in user from industrial to commercial under clause 10.3.3 of Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) under which 20% premium is required to be paid. NMC is yet to receive reply on this. It has come to fore that the two companies recently sent letters to MSTC and forwarded copy to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari seeking user change under section 37 of MRTP Act recently. Confirming this, director in Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Ramdeo ‘Rammu’ Agrawal, told TOI that some traders have come together and procured the plots. “We proposed the project to ease congestion in Itwari, Gandhibagh and adjoining areas. It is in larger interest of the public and city. We are seeking user change under section 37 of MRTP Act which is well within the law and permissible. We will have to follow whatever decision is taken by government and NMC,” he said. There are trees on two of the three plots. The area too has more trees that are under threat due to development of commercial complexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-faces-loss-as-cos-plan-user-change-of-plots-in-empress-van/articleshow/87807345.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

T-Hub startup Paymatrix worked with Muthoot Pappachan Group (also known as Muthoot Blue) to identify cost-effective digital customer acquisition channels for their financial products such as gold loans, personal loans and MSME loans, among others. Muthoot Pappachan Group has been working to ramp up its digital presence and lending capabilities by partnering with fintech startups. Paymatrix, in lieu of their lowcost customer acquisition channels, was seen as an effective customer acquisition engine for their products and as a result Paymatrix also secured an investment from Muthoot Pappachan Group (also known as Muthoot Blue), which has picked up 54% stake in the company. In fact, for T-Hub there have been over 75 cases of corporate interactions with startups to solve business challenges. Similarly, Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited (formerly JUSCO) partnered with Bengaluru-based AI startup Road-Metrics, that was a part of one the corporate innovation programs at T-Hub, to help them maintain the roads in Jamshedpur city in an efficient manner. Using RoadMetrics’ AI-based solutions, the company’s utilities & road maintenance team were able to save money on early detection and prioritise stretches of roads that needed immediate attention with detailed location information for potholes and other early stage surface degradation. Another blockchain and AI startup StaTwig got connected to GMR Group at the beginning of the pandemic and is now a vendor for GMR Cargo. StaTwig deployed a Blockchain technology-based solution for tracking and monitoring of vaccine shipments handled at the Hyderabad airport’s cargo terminal. Blockchain solution, ‘VaccineLedger’, gave visibility on aspects such as location, product quality and safety of vaccine shipments to both vaccine manufacturer and buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/corporates-collaborate-with-startups-to-boost-innovation/articleshow/87807327.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: How colour codes hold key to enforcement||NEW DELHI: With the national capital facing an air emergency, the Delhi government’s transport department is carrying out an awareness drive regarding installation of colour-coded fuel stickers in cars. The department also came out with its plans to empanel manufacturers of retrofitment kits for converting 10-year-old diesel and petrol vehicles into electric ones. Sources said that the objective is to sensitise vehicle owners about the need to get colour-coded fuel stickers at the earliest, but enforcement drives would not start at the moment. The department on Friday issued a public notice stating that the installation of chromium-based hologram stickers is mandatory as per Supreme Court’s order dated August 13, 2018. Diesel-run vehicles need to have an orange fuel sticker on the windshield and petrol and CNG-run vehicles need to have light blue stickers, which helps identify the fuel used in a vehicle from a distance during pollution-related enforcement drives. Vehicles registered from October 2, 2018 come affixed with colour-coded fuel stickers at the time of registration. Officials said that though vehicles registered in the last three years have these stickers, not many owners of vehicles registered prior to this come forward to get these affixed. Vehicle owners can get these fuel stickers affixed on the windshield by approaching their vehicle dealers. According to the amended MV Act, a vehicle without the sticker can be fined Rs 10,000, which has been compounded to Rs 5,500. However, sources said the department doesn’t plan to start special enforcement drives against vehicles without fuel stickers immediately. Officials said that the aim behind the notice is to create a sense of urgency as there has been undue delay by vehicle owners to get fuel stickers despite the Supreme Court’s order three years ago. In a move that would help reduce vehicular pollution and give a further push to electric vehicles in the capital, the Delhi government on Friday issued a notice for empanelling manufacturers and suppliers of approved electric retrofitment kits. These kits would be used to convert diesel and petrol vehicles with conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) for pure electric operation with retrofitment of approved pure electric propulsion. The manufacturers and suppliers of the kits will provide the information about the make and models of vehicles to which electric propulsion kit can be fitted, along with the range in kilometres of the kit on a single charge. ‘Type Approval’ certificates received from approved testing agencies would also have to be submitted by the applicants looking for empanelment. Senior transport department officials said that this move would be particularly beneficial to owners of more than 10-year-old diesel-run vehicles and more than 15-year-old petrol-run vehicles, which are not allowed to ply on Delhi’s roads. The retrofitment of these vehicles would mean that their owners would be able to use these for a longer period instead of just selling these at very low rates or even as scrap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bad-air-how-colour-codes-hold-key-to-enforcement/articleshow/87807334.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Under a scheme floated by the Centre, a total of 157 new medical colleges would be set up in three phases in 27 state-Union Territories in the country under the central scheme with funds sharing of Centre-state 60:40, and North East/special category states in 90:10 ratios. In a statement released by the Centre in October, out of the 157 medical colleges that have been approved since 2014, a total of 63 of them are functional and have started taking admissions. According to the reply received under the RTI, the maximum budget of Rs 2,467 crore has been released for Uttar Pradesh, while Rs 263 crore has been alloted for Maharashtra, including Rs 113.4 crore for phase-I and Rs 150 crore for phase-III. No funds have been allotted for two medical colleges in phase-II. “Maharashtra contributes maximum GST and tax revenues to the central kitty. Its population is the second highest in the country but compared to other BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat, the state is being given a step-motherly treatment,” said RTI activist Prafful Sarda. According to the RTI reply, the highest number of medical colleges, 27, have been allotted to Uttar Pradesh. Sarda said it is being done by the Centre keeping in mind the crucial UP elections due in early 2022. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh told TOI, “It is true that our state has been given a very small share but we are pursuing the central government to allot us more funds so that we could improve health facilities in rural, backward, Naxal-hit and aspiring districts of Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-got-just-rs-263-cr-funding-for-medical-colleges-rti-activist/articleshow/87805832.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Tax dues of around 131 units of KSRTC bus terminal complex at Thampanoor go above Rs 1 crore. The main building of the government secretariat owes the corporation Rs 56 lakhs between 2016-17 and 2021-22. Ten other units under the secretariat also record dues around Rs 20 lakhs in past five fiscals. Cash strapped Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA) seems to top the tax defaulter list. TRIDA’s due to corporation for a single building in Palayam is Rs 1.58 crores. Around 295 units under TRIDA owe corporation tax dues between Rs 10,000 and Rs 3 lakhs. Nearly 100 buildings owned by TRIDA owe the corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs as it is the top defaulter of tax dues as per the list made available for the Medical college area. Corporation authorities hinted that fresh notices will be served to all these buildings after the mandatory time-period of filing appeal against the dues is over. In 2019, the city corporation prepared the list of tax defaulters among government buildings following re-assessment of all the state government buildings in the city as part of issuing fresh demand notices under new tax regime. The process had posed challenges for the revenue wing as they came across government buildings which had not received building numbers for decades. Under the new tax regime, office buildings are assessed at a rate of Rs 80 per sq.m Over 700 buildings and around 1,000 building numbers were identified by the revenue wing in 49 wards in 2019. The arrears of government buildings in terms of property tax had swelled to Rs 50 crores as per corporation estimates. Four wards in the city have over 30 government buildings. TRIDA, KWA and SAP were found to own the highest number of buildings in various wards. Central government buildings which had defaulted on service charges were also listed in 2019. As per the norms, 75% of property tax shall be levied as service charge from central government buildings. The corporation council had earlier considered the pending arrears from the central government buildings; however, many of these arrears had to be written off as it was calculated over four decades or more. The revenue wing had earlier carried out an inspection of the central government buildings following an audit report which slammed the corporation for not identifying the buildings owned by the central government and for not having an exhaustive list of such buildings. In a communication sent to the corporation, the audit department invoked section 235[5] of Kerala Municipality Act which says that in the case of properties exempted from property tax, the corporation is entitled to claim the cost of services covered by service taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/government-buildings-are-major-defaulters-in-corps-tax-dues-list/articleshow/87787382.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has planned five modern fish markets at a cost of Rs 19.4 crore. Two are already functional. The decision was taken keeping in mind several factors including the necessity of hygiene and how sale of fish on the streets was disrupting traffic. The additional benefit will be that all varieties of seafood will be made available at modern fish markets. Two of the modern fish markets at Nacharam and Kukatpally have already started functioning. Works are near completion at two fish markets at Begum Bazar and Mallapur. Another fish market, proposed at Narayanaguda market, at a cost of Rs 4 crore will open soon, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/five-modern-fish-markets-planned-in-city-to-cost-rs-19-4cr/articleshow/87807350.cms||Sunil Mungara

Overwhelmed by the reduction of theft cases by 79% in comparison to the pre-pandemic days of 2019, the RPF observed that their diligent implementation of the ‘meri saheli’ scheme to protect women travelling alone in trains is likely to have contributed in keeping a check on the thieves targeting passenger belongings. In 2019, there had been 768 cases of thefts till October. During the pandemic lockdown, the cases had dwindled to 137 as mostly empty trains were plying till October 2020. Though there is a rise in cases of thefts — 161 — this year till October in comparison to the last year, passenger belongings remained safe even though the frequency of trains had increased. RPF’s senior divisional security commissioner Ashutosh Pandey said RPF had been attending to solo women passengers in 16 trains under the ‘Meri Saheli’ scheme which included three originating from Vidarbha. “The RPF in ‘Meri Saheli’ team would spend time talking with such women. The RPF also had to click photographs to maintain records. The increased presence of police in trains seems to have helped in reducing theft cases,” he said. Pandey also said long-distance trains not stopping in in smaller stations like Ajni, Itwari, Narkhed, Pandurna etc also helped. “Most thieves prefer to board or get off at nondescript stations where surveillance is less. Access control during Covid checking also helped,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/railways-scheme-for-women-safety-reduces-theft-cases/articleshow/87807332.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Spraying ops on to control ‘dieback’ in neem: Officials||Hyderabad: With complaints flooding in from various parts of the city — and from across the state — about neem trees drying up due to ‘dieback’, a fungal disease, the forest department officials have said spraying chemicals is the only remedy to control drying of neem trees. With thousands of trees affected, people have been asking about possible remedies. Forest divisional officer (FDO), flying squad, Ranga Reddy, Maqsood Mohiuddin said, “Take 1gm of carbendazim 50% WP and mix it in one litre of water, followed by 3gm of copper oxychloride in three litres of water. Spray this after seven to 10 days on the neem trees with tractor mounted sprayers,” said Masood. Certain procedures have to be followed during spraying operations to control dieback effectively said officials. These include spraying between 3pm to 6 pm in a phased manner to complete whole area. The operations have to be taken up over four to five days. There must be a power shut down while spraying operations are in progress. In case the neem trees are located on premises of educational institutions, then spraying operations must be taken up when children are not around, said forest officials. Explaining the effects of dieback, the FDO said, “Tender leaves of neem trees turn brown and started drying. The trees die within a short period of three to six months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spraying-ops-on-to-control-dieback-in-neem-officials/articleshow/87807359.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Nagpur||SC-appointed committee to study farm laws may make report public||Nagpur: The decision to repeal three farm laws has left members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee disappointed. They are considering the option to make the report, which was submitted before the Apex court in March, public. Following a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the laws, the SC had appointed a three-member committee to study the laws. The panel, which was formed on January 12, had submitted the report on March 19, a day before the deadline. “The report was supposed to be made public during the next hearing scheduled eight weeks later. However, the hearing did not take place. While we raised concerns over the report not being released, the government has repealed the laws itself,” said Anil Ghanawat, the president of Shetkari Sangathana — a farmers’ outfit in Maharashtra — and a member of the committee. Ghanawat said he was heading to Delhi to meet other members of the committee. They plan to meet on Monday and take a decision to release the report. “Since the laws itself have been repealed, there should not be any legal issue in doing so,” he said. The other members of the committee are Pramod Joshi, the director of South Asia Food Policy Research Institute, and Ashok Gulati, the former chairman on committee on agriculture costs and practices. Gulati said he has no idea about the plan to release the report. “The committee has done its job and submitted the document to the court. Now since the laws itself have been repealed, the report has no relevance,” he said. Without divulging much details, Ghanawat said the committee had made recommendations on all the three problematic laws. The major stress was on making the Essential Commodities Act more liberal. “Under the law, stock limits would be imposed if rates of perishable produce went up by 100% of the last five years’ level and for non-perishable items it was 50%. We had mooted to do away with the stock limit or increase the ambit of price rise,” he said. There were similar measures to make the other two laws more trade and farmer friendly too, according to Ghanawat. Dinesh Kulkarni, the organization secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, which is the farm outfit of the Sangh Parivar, said, “We also want a law to guarantee a basic remunerative price for farmers under all circumstances. This can be in the form of a mandatory MSP.” A press release by the Sangh said Friday’s decision is a right move “for avoiding unnecessary controversy over the issue”. “However, the stance by the so-called farmers opposing the laws will lead to a loss in the long run. The laws would have brought benefit to the small and medium farmers,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-appointed-committee-to-study-farm-laws-may-make-report-public/articleshow/87807366.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Patna||Bihar: 2 cops held for assaulting ADJ, admitted to DMCH||PATNA: Ghoghardiha police station SHO Gopal Krishna and sub-inspector (SI) Abhimanyu Sharma were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting ADJ-1 Avinash Kumar inside his chamber in Jhanjharpur sub-divisional court in Madhubani district earlier in the afternoon. However, the two were admitted to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment as they had been thrashed by the lawyers and court staff after the physical assault on the ADJ. Sources said the police tried to submit a petition before the Jhanjharpur court on Friday that both the accused SIs could not be produced before it after arrest as they were undergoing treatment. Sources, however, said the court accepted the copy of the FIR against the accused SIs but refused to accept the petition for inability to produce them. The ADJ had lodged an FIR against the duo with Jhanjharpur police station after the incident. Meanwhile, both the SIs recorded their statements before police in the Darbhanga hospital on Friday and alleged that the judicial officer and a few others inside his chamber abused, humiliated and even thrashed them first. All senior police officers avoided to say anything on the issue. They were not even clarifying officially that whether the two police officers had been arrested or not. TOI tried for an official statement of ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar on the issue, but he disconnected the call. Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar, who was in Madhubani on the second consecutive day, only said police were following all legal procedures on the basis of FIR registered by the judicial officer. “Both SIs are undergoing treatment at DMCH for their injuries received from thrashing. The DM and SP will send a report on the Thursday incident to senior authorities soon,” the IG added. A senior police officer from Madhubani said both the SIs could not be produced before court on Friday as they were taken to hospital after falling seriously ill late Thursday night. Meanwhile, Bihar Judicial Services Association secretary Ajit Kumar Singh strongly condemned the incident. “I have nothing much to say as the Patna high court has already taken suo motu cognizance of the incident. I believe the matter would be taken to its logical conclusion with redressal of all grievances,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-2-cops-held-for-assaulting-adj-admitted-to-dmch/articleshow/87807368.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Pune||12 companies show interest in riverfront devpt project||Pune: Twelve companies have expressed interest in Pune Municipal Corporation’s riverfront development project, designed along the lines of the Sabarmati riverfront development project. Tenders worth Rs360 crore for the first phase were issued in October. The project faces opposition due to increased cost by around Rs 2,000 crore. Activists and environmentalists have red flagged the project on the grounds that it could cause floods. They also claimed cost-escalation was done without proper public consultation. The tenders were issued on Wednesday. Work will begin five years after it was announced. “The response to the tender was very good. Twelve firms have shown interest. The final figure will be known after a fortnight, when the deadline lapses,” said Mangesh Dighe, a senior PMC associated with the project, said. He said PMC was hoping that even more firms show interest in the project. Though the consultant for the Sabarmati riverfront project has designed this initiative, the Pune project will have its own identity. As per the tenders, the first phase will be carried out from Sangam Ghat to Bund Garden. The work includes beautification of the banks, cycle tracks, beautification of Naik island. Boating activity is also proposed in this phase. The proposal also states that greenery will be developed on the tracks to maintain the temperature. The total project is to be completed in 11 phases. “Environmentalists and experts have raised alarms about this initiative. If the authorities go ahead with the project against the public will, we may explore legal options. The matter may be taken to court,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-companies-show-interest-in-riverfront-devpt-project/articleshow/87807974.cms||---

Authorities said police teams have carried out searches at the office of the academy as well as at the residences of the office-bearers. Though nothing substantial has been found, pamphlets as well as leaflets calling for a bandh have been seized. Nanded range’s deputy inspector general of police Nisar Tamboli said, “Multiple teams have been formed to arrest suspects, including these three members, identified for their alleged role in violence.” The officer said police teams have also been fanned out of town to track the ones who have allegedly fled Nanded after the police launched a crackdown against those involved in violence. The stone-pelting and violence on November 12 in Nanded left eight policemen injured and several vehicles damaged. Police also registered four offences against 60 identified and around 240 unidentified suspects caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras as well as other footage while committing violence. Additional SP Vijay Kabade told TOI, “After verifying their specific role, we have so far arrested 69 accused and the number is all set to increase in coming days.” The officer added that with the help of CCTV footage, a strong case is being built up against the rioters. “After the organisers of the bandh made a written representation to the tehsildar, the mob was dispersing, when suddenly a group of youths started heading back to the collector office, but were stopped by police. They then resorted to stone pelting,” said Kabade. To bring the situation under control, police ended up firing 50 rounds of hand pump action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-launch-manhunt-for-3-raza-academy-members/articleshow/87805859.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He praised the PM for respecting the essence of dialogue in democracy. “Initially, many believed the laws could play a key role in doubling income of farmers. However, when farm organisations came out in protest, the government tried to hold dialogue with them. Maybe, there was something lacking on our part that we failed to explain our point of view to farmers. Honouring dialogue in a democracy, PM announced withdrawal of three farm laws and the setting up of a committee on minimum support price,” the CM said. Earlier, while attending Guru Parab celebrations organised by Naka Hindola gurdwara in Lucknow, he said, “Krishi kanoon chahe jaisa bhi raha ho, loktantra me iski awaz ansuni ni kar sakte. Aapsi samvad se hum iska samna karenge. (Whatever may have been the farm laws, it’s our duty to hear the voices of people in a democracy. We will deal with it through dialogue)," he said. The CM also highlighted the importance of the announcement on the occasion of Gurpurab, which celebrates the birth of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-decision-historic-respects-the-true-essence-of-democracy-yogi/articleshow/87808434.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maoists call bandh in 6 states to pay homage to 27 killed in Gadchiroli encounter||NAGPUR: The central committee (CC) of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) has declared ‘bandh’ in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Telangana on November 27 to pay homage to 27 rebels, including top leader Milind Teltumbde, who were gunned down by Gadchiroli police’s C-60 commandos in the forest of Mardintola village on November 13. In a press communication released by CC spokesperson Abhay on Friday, the rebels described November 13 as the “most sorrowful day in the revolutionary history of Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra”. The rebels have vowed to take the battle ahead and prepare “more cadres like Teltumbde from among students, dalits and oppressed classes”. The press release was also circulated on social media in Gadchiroli. TOI too has a copy. According to senior police officials, the Maoists have for the first time not levelled any allegations regarding the encounter or questioned its fairness. The Maosists have confirmed the death of Teltumbde much to the relief of security forces who have collected DNA samples too for scientific identification. Cops had earlier sought assistance from surrendered Maoists to identify Teltumbde. SP Ankit Goyal said security forces will remain alert during bandh which is likely to impact Gadchiroli and parts of Gondia. “Forces will follow standard operating procedures (SOP) to thwart the bandh call,” he said. The SP refrained from commenting on other contents of the press release which mentioned “contributions and sacrifice” of Teltumbde and his team. Maharashtra government had announced rewards of Rs51 lakh for the C-60 jawans for killing the elusive Teltumbde who had a reward of Rs50 lakhs on his head and around 63 offences against him. In the press release, the CC has vowed to fight till the end to complete the “unaccomplished task” of the rebels who were killed in the 10-hour long gunbattle close to the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. The press note also mentioned that the rebels had fought till end to save Teltumbde who was also the in-charge of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. TOI had earlier reported how Teltumdbe’s body guards had fought to death before the C-60 jawans could gun down the top rebel leader. The press communication also mentioned the “courageous sacrifices” of Teltumbde’s bodyguards like Bhagat and Yogitha. As per the press release, Bhagat had been with Teltumbde for the last eight years. Yogitha worked as his “personal assistant” managing the computer-related tasks. The CC has also conformed deaths of its other members like Ramanna, Chintan da, Haribhushan, Amber da and Saketh in different encounters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoists-call-bandh-in-6-states-to-pay-homage-to-27-killed-in-encounter/articleshow/87807360.cms||Soumitra Bose

We will be seeking only a judicious tariff hike for the next control period starting from April 2022, the board said. “KSEB will file a tariff revision petition based on new tariff regulations issued by the state electricity regulatory commission. The board will be seeking a judicious tariff hike. It would be impossible to foretell the rate of tariff hike as it comes into being through a judicial process. The new tariff petition is expected to be submitted before the commission by December 25,” said authorities. Meanwhile, consequent to government directive and approval from the power regulator, KSEB has issued an order enhancing the free consumption ceiling for BPL category consumers from 20 units/month to 30 units/month. The change in the free consumption ceiling for non-paying and BPL category of consumers was announced by the government in June 2021 as part of the relief package to domestic consumers. As per the relief package, free power given to domestic consumers with connected load up to 500W will be eligible for free power up to 30 units/month. Similarly, electricity given to domestic consumers under BPL category, with connected load up to 100W at the rate of Rs 1.50/kWh for monthly consumption up to 40 units shall be eligible for 50 units/ month, without changes in connected load.

---||Kanpur||India now working towards self-reliance in defence sector: PM Narendra Modi||JHANSI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that India which became known as an importer of arms has now adopted the mantra of “Make in India, Make for the World” to turn the country self-reliant in the defence sector. At an event in Jhansi in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the PM formally handed over the Light Combat Aircraft (LCH) designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to the Air Force chief, drones and UAVs built by Indian start-ups to the Army chief, and the DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Limited-manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to the Navy chief. He said that a lion’s share of spending on procurement of weapons from the defence budget will be done on indigenously designed ones in time to come in line with the country’s policy of self-reliance in the crucial defence sector. The PM was here on the concluding day of the three-day Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv, ‘Jhansi Jalsa’, which coincided with the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani Laxmibai. He addressed a limited gathering of 750 people from the precincts of the historic Jhansi Fort with the backdrop of the fort contour from where the Rani had jumped with her horse Badal while fighting the British force. He also laid foundation and inaugurated a number of projects worth Rs 3,425 crore, including a Rs 400 crore Bharat Dynamics plant to make propulsion system for anti-tank guided missiles, in Jhansi node of UP Defence Corridor. Modi said that the defence ministry has already released a list of 200 such equipment and weapons which would be purchased only from within the country. “The new warfare weapons and equipment manufactured in the Jhansi node of Defence Industrial Corridor (DIC) will not only help firm up the security of the country, but will lend a strong impetus to the ‘Atmanirbhar’ campaign envisioning self-reliance in the crucial defence sector,” he added. “The corridor will sow fresh seeds of development in the region and turn it into a new investment destination. Bundelkhand region known for valour and courage will now be known for strategic growth,” the PM said. Modi further said, “We were once famous as an arms buyer country. But with our new mantra ‘Make in India’ and ‘Make for the World’, India will now export defence equipment to the world and in this Jhansi node of UP Defence Corridor will play an important role. In this, MSMEs are also going to play an important role and also generate employment at the local level.” Modi said that the history of India’s freedom struggle would have been different if the brave 19th century queen of Jhansi, Rani Laxmibai, had military logistics which matched those of the British. The PM was cheered by the audience chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ slogans a number of times. The entire programme was focused mainly on women as a number of girl cadets were present among the audiences as well as on the fort and even during conducting the programme. Notably, during her recent visit Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Chitrakoot and Lalitpur, where she had announced a number of benefits for the women and girls if Congress party comes to power along with distributing tickets to 40% of women. While starting his speech in the local Bundelkhandi dialect. Modi said that I bow to the land of valour of Rani Laxmibai and Jhalkaribai and said, “I congratulate all the people of this region as your ancestors too were part of the forces of Rani who fought against the British. He termed the region as ‘Kranti ki Kashi’.” He further said, “I feel lucky that I represent the birthplace of Rani that is Kashi and have the opportunity to serve it. I bow to both the places from here.” While mentioning Chandelas, Bundelas, Ala Udal, Modi said that this region has produced a number of leaders in history. He further said that already girls are being admitted in many of the sainik schools and very soon these schools will churn out many Rani Laxmibais. Praising defence minister Rajnath Singh and his team along with UP government under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for organising the event, Modi said, “This Utsav will go a long way in the development of defence corridor and Bundelkhand making it a fertile land for producing equipment for national defence.” He also praised the innovative ideas of Jhansi MP Anurag Sharma. Before reaching the rally ground, Modi visited the Jhansi Fort where he unveiled a plaque of Rani Laxmibai and witnessed the ‘beating the retreat’ ceremony. The PM was accompanied by UP Governor Anandiben Patel, Rajnath and Yogi. In addition, CDS Gen Bipin Rawat along with chiefs of Navy and Air force were also present. PM lays foundation of solar parkPrime Minister Narendra Modi laid down the foundation stone and dedicated a number of sops worth Rs 3,425 crores here on Friday including Rs 400 crore Bharat Dynamics plant. In addition, foundation was laid for 600MW solar power park spread in 3,023 acres of land in Garotha tehsil of Jhansi district. The PM also inaugurated the newly built Atal Ekta Park in the city which has a central library of 8 thousand books along with an ampi-theatre and an open gym. The announcements included setting up of 100 new Sainik Schools, launch of NCC border and coastal scheme, NCC alumni association and national programme of simulation training for NCC cadets, in boost to Atmanirbhar Bharat. A digital kiosk at the national war memorial was also launched to pay tribute to fallen heroes and NWM mobile app. PM inaugurates Rs 3,240 projects in MahobaBefore reaching Jhansi, PM Narendra Modi went to Mahoba where he inaugurated Rs 3,240 crore worth of projects including Arjun Sahayak Project, Bhawani Dam Project, Ratuli Dam Project and Bhargawn-Chilla Sprinkler project spread in Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda and Lalitpur districts. All these projects are expected to help in solving the serious and persisting drought situations causing irrigation problems for the farmers of Bundelkhand. Addressing a rally in Mahoba, Modi said, “For the first time, the people of Bundelkhand are seeing the government working for their development. Previous governments did not get tired of looting UP but we do not get tired of working.” The Prime Minister further said that the resources of the region were handed over to mafias by the previous governments. “Those who ruled Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for a long time left no stone unturned to ruin this region. It is no secret how jungles and resources of this region were handed over to mafias. Now that bulldozers are being used against these mafias, some people are making a hue and cry,” said Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pm-india-now-working-towards-self-reliance-in-defence-sector/articleshow/87807373.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Kolhapur||In special drive, 76 homeless people given jabs by Kolhapur Municipal Corporation||KOLHAPUR: As many as 76 people from Kolhapur city, who are homeless and lack valid documents, were vaccinated during a special drive conducted by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Friday. An arrangement of registering people without valid identity documents have been added on the CoWin portal. The KMC had carried out a survey of people who do not have an Aadhar card or any other identity proof. During this survey, the authorities searched for people living at the bus stand and railway station. They also searched the shelter homes and approached social organisations to help the civic body reach to such homeless people. “Henceforth, we will continue vaccination of such people. They need to be vaccinated since they come in contact with large number of people every day. They need to be protected as they are more vulnerable in comparison to others,” Amol Mane, vaccination nodal officer of the KMC, said. Meanwhile, around 17,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district on Friday. The district administration has a tough task ahead to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries by Saturday as directed by district guardian minister Satej Patil. However, it is unlikely to meet the deadline since 85% beneficiaries have received the first dose and in a day vaccinating the rest of the population is a daunting task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-spl-drive-76-homeless-people-given-jabs-by-kmc/articleshow/87805874.cms||---

The firm’s general manager, Sandeep Raizada, submitted before the steering committee of NMC’s transport department that it could deliver only four e-buses by February 2022. However, the panel headed by chairman and additional commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena directed the department to impose ₹16,800 fine per day for the failure to abide by the agreement to deliver e-buses. TOI had highlighted that NMC gave an ultimatum to the firm to deliver 40 electric buses by November 15, or it would start levying 0.1% fine per day against its performance guarantee amount. Sources said Meena expressed anguish over the firm’s inability to maintain date for e-buses delivery. So far, NMC has extended the deadline to deliver the e-buses at least five times. Every time, the firm has failed to meet its promise and now it is seeking more time to deliver only four e-buses by February 2022. The committee, however, expressed doubt over the firm’s demand for a new deadline as it may miss that too. Sources pointed out that the firm’s delay in delivering e-buses is hampering Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari’s dream of NMC operating only eco-friendly buses, by replacing all diesel buses. Sources also said that receiving e-buses before February is a must for NMC as it will have to scrap 150 standard buses, which are at the end of their lifespan. The steering panel also directed operational manager of Aapli Bus service, DIMTS, to conduct an audit of standard buses. According to transport department officials, the JNNURM buses are in a bad shape. Apart from procuring these 40 e-buses with the help of Rs18 crore sanctioned by the central government under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle), NMC will also get 15 electric buses from NSSCDCL (Smart City). The panel also directed both private firms providing conductors to the Aapli Bus fleet to increase their manpower. Against a demand of 1,000-odd conductors, the firms are providing only 850 conductors. The shortfall of manpower is affecting city bus service on many routes. Meena has given a fortnight’s time to the firms to increase manpower. Decisions of the steering committee will now be reviewed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/evey-trans-unable-to-deliver-40-e-buses-demands-fresh-deadline/articleshow/87807372.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The MHWF SOP grants special dispensation for administration of the second dose of Covishield vaccine prior to the prescribed time interval — after 28 days, but before 84 days — to eligible persons intending to undertake international travel for educational purposes, for joining employment in foreign countries, etc. Sawaikar pointed out to Mandaviya in his letter that upon the expiry of the time limit of the SOP on October 31, a large number of eligible persons, particularly seafarers, are unable to undertake international travel. “Goa, like many other states of India, has a large diaspora and NRIs, which include seafarers. It has come to light that there was a time limit imposed in the MHFW SOP up to August 31, 2021, which was subsequently extended till October 31, 2021, but thereafter there has been no extension,” Sawaikar said. He urged Mandaviya to extend the validity of the MHFW SOP. The special dispensation SOP issued in June was available to three categories of people — students who have to undertake foreign travel for the purposes of education, persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries, and athletes and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending the Olympic Games held in Tokyo in July-August. A competent authority was mandated to be designated by the state/UT governments in each district for according permission for such administration of the second dose of Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/extend-relaxation-on-vax-gap-for-intl-students-sawaikar/articleshow/87807982.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bawankule, not incumbent Vyas, is BJP’s MLC candidate||Nagpur: Former cabinet minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has been chosen as BJP candidate for the upcoming polls, over incumbent Girish Vyas. The official list issued by the saffron party is confirmation of rumours doing the rounds for the last month, with Bawankule’s political rehabilitation on the cards after a shocking denial of MLA ticket in 2019. TOI had also recently reported that Bawankule is likely to get the ticket. Recently,in a public event, Vyas had spoken about the work done during his tenure, leading some to believe that may be Vyas had edged out Bawankule and retained his claim to the seat. Bawankule did not respond to TOI’s phone calls or messages. Girish Vyas, the incumbent MLC, said he has no qualms over denial of ticket. “I have always worked for the party and their decision is final. Bawankule is a great choice and I have no doubt that he will be an asset in the upper house. I shall continue to focus on party work in my role as spokesperson,” said Vyas. BJP city president Pravin Datke tried to play down the decision not to give Vyas a second shot. “Party high command has taken the decision and I am convinced that they have taken it after due consideration. Girishji is a very senior BJP member and I have no doubt that the party will give him some other important responsibility,” said Datke. Party insiders say Bawankule had raised the pitch for his claim to the MLC seat. A BJP leader said, “Right from the time of a major power outage in Mumbai, Bawankule took the front row seat in attacking the MVA government using his former energy minister portfolio as credentials. Since then, he has remained in the limelight regardless of the issue and led multiple street level protests and agitations.” Another party member said Bawankule’s street smart political acumen was on display, especially after being denied the ticket in 2019. “After the first few days of tantrums, he quickly toed the party line. Ever since, he has never spoken against either party or any leader. Bawankule stuck to this policy even in private discussions,” said another party member. A party worker, known to be in the Vyas camp, said the MLC ticket for Bawankule could be a double-edged sword. “Now that he’s got the MLC ticket, does that mean in 2024 he won’t get back his MLA ticket? Only three years to go now, so wonder what the party leaders have in mind,” the worker said. But Datke dismissed this as too speculative. “Who knows what will happen at that time. I am neither the authority to decide nor I would like to take a guess,” said Datke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-not-incumbent-vyas-is-bjps-mlc-candidate/articleshow/87807375.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nashik co gets US FDA nod for liquid biopsy to detect early breast cancer||MUMBAI: A Nashik-based cancer laboratory on Friday announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has granted a “breakthrough device designation” for its liquid biopsy test to detect early-stage breast cancer. US FDA grants such a tag to devices (including tests) that represent breakthrough technology with no alternatives. Last month, it granted the tag to an American company for its liquid biopsy test for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Usually a biopsy involves removing a piece of tissue or a sample of cells from a patient’s body to detect cancer, but in the past few years there has been increasing research on the non-invasive liquid biopsy method. As the term suggests, liquid biopsy is the process of analyzing tumor material—molecules or whole cells—found in bodily fluids such as blood.On Friday, the Nashik company, Datar Cancer Genetics, said its TriNetra blood test could detect circulating tumour cells and cluster-specific to breast cancer with accuracy. “Our clinical trials with over 20,000 women have shown the test can detect stage ‘0’ and stage ‘1’ breast cancer with an accuracy better than 99% without any false positive,” said Rajan Datar. He said the test, which requires 5ml of blood, is already available in Europe and will be launched in the US after it receives marketing authorization from the US FDA. The company’s press release said the test will be available in India shortly. “We are exploring tieups with various chains of laboratories to offer this test,” said Datar. According to the release, “This is for the first time that women above the age of 40 can obtain a breast cancer-specific blood test in consultation with their physician from the privacy of their home or office.” Breast cancer is the world’s most widely prevalent cancer. In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 6,85,000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past five years. In India, too, it is the most common cancer among women; affecting 25.8 per 100,000 women and with a mortality of 12.7 per 100,000 women. When contacted, leading breast cancer surgeon and director of the Tata Memorial Centre, Dr R Badwe said there is yet no solid evidence about the efficacy of liquid biopsy. Another doctor said that liquid biopsies are used as a “therapeutic guidance” to check if a treatment modality is working or if the disease has resurfaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-nashik-co-gets-us-fda-nod-for-liquid-biopsy-to-detect-early-breast-cancer/articleshow/87808791.cms||---

---||India||Repeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decision||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs of a resolution. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament.The need to remove what has been a thorn in BJP's side ahead of important state elections, particularly UP, has widely been seen as as a trigger for the announcement, but BJP and government sources stressed that the souring of inter-community relations in Punjab was a stronger reason. The announcement came soon after the Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage was restored, and Modi remembered Guru Nanak in the two meetings he addressed in UP later in the day. Modi had observed the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur and visited Gurudwara Rakabganj. He has recalled the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's two sons in his Mann Ki Baat.

The assessment that the farm stir had become a lightning rod of all manner for BJP's opponents also prompted the party brass to consider repeal of the laws.

This is said to be the first case involving a boy in the district.The 17-year-old boy from a village in Ballari district had allegedly stolen cash and gold from his neighbour’s house when the inmates were out of the city. Though none suspected him in the case, police arrested him after month of crime as they noticed a change in his behaviour.Sources said the boy’s parents are poor, while he wanted to lead a lavish life. To fund his habits, he struck the house in his neighbourhood.Ballari SP Saidulu Adavath told TOI that none suspected the boy soon after the theft. “When a neighbour went out of the city last month, the boy struck his house and made away with jewellery and Rs 2-3 lakh cash,” the SP added.But police suspected him after the boy kept travelling to Bengaluru. “After we took the boy into custody, he admitted to stealing. We have recovered 105gram jewellery worth Rs 5.50 lakh from him,” he said.During interrogation, the boy told police that he had stolen money to party in Bengaluru, and to buy costly liquor and cellphones. “He travelled 2-3 times to Bengaluru for partying.

As many as 10 goats and 40 hens got buried under the soil. The bodies of three goats have been found till now. When he understood that his remaining goats were in danger, he has chosen to shelter them in his home. The house has five rooms. His family adjusts in one room and the other rooms are occupied by 30 goats. “Without them I cannot survive. There is no other place, where I can house them. A few officials have visited the spot and promised me compensation. But I have not received any further information from them,” said Rajan. The landslide occurred in the early morning at 5.30am. Rajan, who was awake, suddenly heard a huge sound of the soil and trees falling down. When he rushed to his backyard, he saw that the shed was fully buried under the soil. Rajan had started the farm five years ago and it was his only source of income and that too has been destroyed in the landslide. “From this income, I used to pay for my daughter’s education and meet other necessities. Now, I have lost my source of livelihood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/landslide-hit-farmer-keeps-surviving-goats-inside-home/articleshow/87787418.cms||---

NCP chief Sharad Pawar said it was solely the fear of losing the upcoming Uttar Pradesh and Punjab elections that led to Modi changing his stance. Addressing media at Chandrapur, Pawar said, “BJP got a lot of negative reactions from these two states and Haryana. Hence, looking at all these things a political decision was taken to repeal the farm laws.” Lauding the protesting farmers, Pawar said, “They were resolute and steadfast in their opposition to the new farm laws. They braved the cold, rains and heat and continued their struggle. I salute the farmers who continued their protests peacefully for a year.” Pawar claimed that discussions over amendment in agriculture law for better support price for the harvest and to create an international market for farm produce were held when he was the Union agriculture minister. “Then, the BJP, which was in the opposition, was pressing for framing of new agriculture laws. I am of the view that agriculture is a state issue and hence no initiative can be taken without discussion with the states and other stakeholders. I met agriculture ministers, marketing and cooperative ministers and different farmer unions. Suggestions and recommendations were sought from agriculture universities too,” said Pawar. State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray issued a statement saying that Friday’s developments prove that the common man has won. “I pay tributes to those who lost their lives during this agitation. We hope that in future, the Union government will consult opposition parties before making any law,” said Thackeray. He also added that MVA had always registered its opposition to the farm laws at both cabinet meets and the legislature. State Congress president Nana Patole said that Modi needs to do more than just repeal the farm laws. “Modi and the BJP are habitual liars. We demand that Modi must first apologize to the farmers and also promise that in future no such anti-farmer laws shall be introduced,” said Patole. Patole added that certain actions of Modi do not inspire confidence in farmers. “Why is the Union minister, whose son mowed down farmers under his car in Lakhimpur, is still part of the cabinet. So, his decision is only because of fear of losing elections,” said Patole. Cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said there was nothing in Modi’s decision “to be welcomed”. Wadettiwar said, “Why should I welcome the decision which comes at the cost of 600 lives of agitating farmers. Why did the government wait for nine months before taking this decision. It’s been done due to impending polls, nothing else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/political-compulsions-forced-modis-hand-say-mva-netas-on-move-to-repeal-farm-laws/articleshow/87807378.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The plan, if approved by the state, could provide relief to lakhs of residents. The proposal was brought up in the House by Shiv Sena corporator Ram Repale and seconded by party colleague Vikas Repale. The move, timed ahead of the civic elections scheduled early next year, saw minimal resistance from other netas who refrained from opposing the same.

---||Nagpur||Kingmaker Atal Bahadur Singh dead, city mourns||Nagpur: Atal Bahadur Singh, 79, a prominent figure in the city’s administration, academic, cultural and sports circles, passed away on Friday afternoon following prolonged illness. The last rites would be performed on Saturday. Born on March 2, 1942 in Benaras, Singh was a revered figure across many circles due to his friendly nature. After becoming deputy mayor in 1974, he had twice donned the mayor’s cap in 1977 and 1994. Several dignitaries, who closely worked with him during his heydays, mourned the demise of the leader, who was also known as ‘kingmaker’ in Nagpur Municipal Corporation circles. After floating a political party Lokmanch, Singh had unsuccessfully contested 2009 Lok Sabha polls on BJP ticket, but lost to former Union minister Vilas Muttemwar of the Congress. Union minister Nitin Gadkari said Singh was never bogged down by caste-religion-creed politics. “I shared a long-standing relationship with him. No matter what crisis befell this city, he was the first to run, help and build. As a sensitive and socially responsible person, Singh will always be remembered by the people. Many of his memories are etched in my mind as a person who always kept his word. Despite political differences, he worked to bring together people from all walks of life,” said Gadkari. “He enriched the city’s art and culture scenario and was extremely passionate about development, keeping aside political differences. As a student leader, Singh had taken part in the initiative to name various Nagpur University campuses after revolutionary freedom fighters,” recalled leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Besides holding the post of Nagpur District Football Association (NDFA) president, Singh was a member of NU’s Executive Council, Senate and other bodies for a long time and was part of many important decisions. A disciple of former NU registrar Balraj Aher, he had suggested conferring honorary DLitt on melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. “With his three decades long association with the NMC, Singh was known as a popular mayor due to his significant contribution for the city’s development. He was always at the forefront of sports, literature and social work activities,” said mayor Dayashankar Tiwari. Considered as one of the main pillars of NMC during his times along with Prabhakarrao Datke, Nana Shyamkule, Himmatrao Saraikar, Singh was instrumental in starting Sheshrao Wankhede Vidyaniketan for poor students and also took an initiative to start several libraries during his tenure as mayor. In 2014, he was honored with Shiv Chhatrapati Lifetime Achievement award by the government of Maharashtra. “Atal bhaiyya was an asset for the Western India Football Association (WIFA). I happened to work with him for more than 30 years and we had organized many events in the region including the India vs Rest of India football match at Yashwant Stadium,” said NDFA president Haresh Vora. For senior BJP corporator Sandeep Joshi, Singh was a guiding light and he shared a close relationship with him. “He was real inspiration and guide on how to do social work, how to back budding players,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kingmaker-atal-bahadur-singh-dead-city-mourns/articleshow/87807401.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Vehicles carrying sugarcane without reflectors being fined||KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur traffic police has started taking action against the transporters for not installing reflectors on their vehicles carrying sugarcane to the mills. So far, 14 tractors operators have been fined Rs 1,000. Since the start of the crushing season three weeks back, several fatal accidents have occurred. The commuters are unable to spot the trolleys parked on the roadside at night and crash their vehicles into them. Kolhapur traffic inspector Sneha Giri said, “By rules, installing illuminating reflectors on the rear and front side of the vehicles carrying the sugarcane is mandatory. We have conducted several meetings with the sugar mill operators and they have agreed to get the illuminating reflectors fitted on the transport vehicles. We are also conducting the awareness session by visiting the fields and interacting with the transporters. We are providing them with suitable reflectors as well.” “Most accidents take place in urban areas and along major highways. In a city like Kolhapur, sugarcane carrying vehicles are not allowed during day time. The routes have been fixed by the traffic department to reach the respective mills. According to the primary estimates, over 1,000 tractors transport sugarcane in the district daily during the crushing season,” Giri said. She further said that the tractors or the bullock carts are parked along the roadside as they cannot be taken into interiors most of the time. During the night hours, the rush of vehicles continues along the National Highway 48. At times, the overloaded trolleys get overturned in the middle of the roads and cause obstruction. In such cases, lack of reflectors causes major fatal accidents, Giri said. “To make more trips and earn more money, the transporters speed up the vehicles. The drivers are also fined if they drive under the influence of liquor and play loud music,” said Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vehicles-carrying-sugarcane-without-reflectors-being-fined/articleshow/87805899.cms||---
---||Delhi||Jeet, Jalebi And Joy After A Year Of Agitation||Ghaziabad: The modest bunch of protesters holding fort at UP Gate (Ghazipur border) had nothing special planned on Friday. Dull as the November sky, it was to be another eventless day for the vanguard with their heels and tents dug in as the battle of attrition with the Centre moved towards an important landmark – a week from now, the protest against the three new farm laws on Delhi’s borders will turn a year old. Then, the mobile phones started ringing. One of the first to get the morning’s biggest “breaking news” was Bijender Singh, a farmer from UP’s Ghazipur district who was in his tent, yet to start his day. At the other end, his son was screeching. “Krishi kanoon wapas le rahe hain (the farm laws are being repealed). Modi ne announce kiya (Modi has announced),” he told a stunned Singh. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” Singh told TOI. “I cross-checked and when I was convinced that what my son was saying was true, I rushed out to inform others.” Soon after, the celebrations began. The sizzle ofjalebis in the langar, a round of crackers, a group dance, bellows of triumph and excited phone calls to family followed. Some drove along the protest site loudspeakers blazing till the border where they were stopped and turned back by Delhi Police. “This too will go soon,” yelled a protester, pointing at the barricades. Through the nippy air and the acrid overhang of smog, the warm breeze of victory that swept into UP Gate on Friday when the PM announced that the farm laws would be repealed was lapped up by just 150-odd tired but beaming faces. With none of the farmer leaders around, the moment belonged to the footsoldiers. By afternoon, many of them were on national media, their faces lighting up newscasts on mobile screens as journalists outnumbered protesters at UP Gate. “Jeet” was the word on everyone’s lips, but this was a bittersweet win, achieved through sacrifice and months of struggle through the turn of seasons, moods, opinions and politics Balwant Singh, a farmer from Shahjahanpur, said, “We will stay put at UP Gate till the time laws are repealed by Parliament because we can’t trust it will happen till then.” “A lot has gone into making this year-long protest a success. I remember the day Kashmir Singh from Bilaspur committed suicide at UP Gate (Jan 2). It shook me and others, but we remained determined and succeeded at last,” said Manjeet Singh Atwal, a farmer from Uttarakhand. Others said a law on MSP and compensation forfamilies of farmers who died during the agitation remained unfulfilled demands that the Centre needed to respond to. Speaking to TOI over the phone, BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, “The battle is half won. Apart from the repeal of the farm laws, we also want a guarantee on MSP. The agitation has seen so many farmers losing their lives at the protest sites in the past year and we demand that their families get compensation.” At the protest site, though, several farmers were relieved they could go back to their families, and not empty handed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jeet-jalebi-and-joy-after-a-year-of-agitation/articleshow/87807413.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Tribal school in Thiruvananthapuram facing threat of wild animal attacks||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The life of children studying at Thalathoothakaavu tribal school in the district continues to be in misery due to the threat from wild animals. The students have been facing the threat from wild animals, including bison, elephants and wild boar for many years. Recently the wild elephants destroyed the trees which are too close to the school building. Around 28 tribal students from eleven tribal settlement areas are studying here. The herd of elephants was spotted on Wednesday by PTA committee members Mahesh and Suresh who live near the school. They saw the elephants near the school around early morning. The herd has destroyed most of the trees in the compound. “The elephant has destroyed the coconut trees in the compound. It is sure that the herd will come again for the coconuts. We have been trying to build the compound wall around the school, but the forest range office has denied our request. We are planning to talk to the Palode range office authorities again, if they are not ready to grant the permission, then we would surely stage a protest in front of the office,” said Jain P, a teacher of Thalathoothakaavu tribal school. “The students are not safe in this compound. The parents are really scared to send their children to school,” said Asharaf M, the headmaster of the school. The school had even suspended classes due to the disturbances by these wild animals. The forest department have denied the permission for the compound wall saying that the school authorities failed to produce the required documents. The demand was put forward by the PTA committee members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tribal-school-facing-threat-of-wild-animal-attacks/articleshow/87787449.cms||---
---||Pune||Private sites in Pune sitting on 21 lakh doses, Mumbai close second||PUNE: Vaccination slow down has hit the private hospitals in Pune and Mumbai the most, with stocks at these sites increasing to 21 lakh doses in Pune alone, followed by Mumbai (20 lakh) — both of which form a lion’s share among nearly 54 lakh doses available with the private centres across Maharashtra. Nashik, Thane, Palghar, Satara and Raigad (in that order) are other districts where private sites are now left with considerable number of doses and few takers. A bulk of the stock is that of Covishield. Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI, “There are no plans to use private hospital doses as there is sufficient stock available with the state government.” Private hospitals said it has now become a matter of worry for them as weekdays hardly see any beneficiaries approaching them for inoculation. Dr Madhav Chavan, managing director - Phoenix Hospital, told TOI, “There are days when the authorities cannot open a single vial as they don’t even get 10 beneficiaries for vaccination. We have 4,000 Covishield doses lying unused with us, while some others have 8,000-plus. We are in a dilemma, and fear that our Covishield stocks may not be utilised completely, especially if mix and match doses for booster shots are approved.” He said stocks with private sites were now double of what they were in October. “One of the ways to deal with this situation is that vaccine manufacturers could buy the unused stock back from us and supply it to government sites. Even corporates are not coming forward as many of their employees are already vaccinated and the ones left out are getting the doses for free from government sites,” he said. Hospitals in Pune are now considering approaching corporates (to sell off their stock to the latter under their CSR funds) for the under privileged at a no-profit, no-loss basis to reach a break-even point. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, which has three private vaccination sites said, “After suitable permission from the government, corporates could procure the excess vaccine doses from us at the cost price, under their CSR funds. We could then go to remote areas to administer the excess vaccine doses to the poor or tribal population without any additional cost.” The three Symbiosis private sites have an excess stock of nearly 20,000-plus doses. Dr Prince Surana, chief executive of Mumbai’s Surana Group of Hospitals, told TOI, “We started using the vaccine doses under corporate CSR funding a month ago at the cost price of Rs 600 per dose. We had realised very early that demand for paid jabs was plummeting and thus opted for this. We are currently left with 25,000-odd doses to be used as a part of the CSR activity, hence no dose is likely to go waste. However, many hospitals have hit the panic button as in a month or two, there might not be many people to inoculate. Hospitals left with huge quantities are therefore now trying to liquidate the stocks.” Dr Suman Singh Rawat, medical administrator at Sanjeevani Hospital in Mumbai, said the hospital has close to 7,000 doses, with the hospital administering just 25-odd doses per day lately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-sites-in-pune-sitting-on-21l-doses-mumbai-close-second/articleshow/87807051.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Falling cotton, soya prices, not farm laws, worry Vidarbha farmers||NAGPUR: Amid the hype over scrapping of the three controversial farm laws, farmers in Vidarbha remained rather indifferent as it was also during the protests in Delhi. The reaction in rural Vidarbha remained low even as a group of members from the Sikh community in Nagpur were rejoicing over the decision. Here, the farmers are concerned about prices of cotton and soyabean — the two main crops of the region. They are worried that the textile and poultry industry lobbies may soon succeed in bringing down rates of the two crops. While cotton is used for making yarn, soyabean is also a raw material for chicken feed. The prices of cotton, which had touched an all-time high crossing Rs8,500 a quintal, have now come down to the range of Rs7,500 to Rs8,000 a quintal. Soyabean rates too crashed from all-time high of over Rs10,000 a quintal, now settling at Rs5,600 to Rs5,700 for the better grade. After over a decade, rates of the two crops had reached a level that the farmers had always hoped for. Gajanan Sindadwar at Yavatmal-Telangana border said that cotton rates had fallen by Rs900 touching Rs7,500 quintal. Soyabean was at Rs5,000 quintal and hoped it should be at least Rs6,000. Former MP and Swabhimani Paksha leader Raju Shetti has already initiated an agitation seeking intervention to improve rates of soyabean. In Maharashtra, sale of farm produce is already allowed outside agriculture produce marketing committee’s (APMC) yards. The state also allows contract farming. “There was little impact of the whole issue on the farmers here. In Maharashtra any one can get a licence and even purchase farm produce out of the APMC areas. Buying fresh vegetables doesn’t even need a licence,” said Sudhir Kothari, chairman of APMC at Hinganghat in Wardha district. Ganesh Nanote, a cotton grower from Akola, said that the textile industry and poultry lobby are already making representations demanding measure to reduce prices of cotton and soyabean. The farmers are at a loss due to low yield of cotton. Nitin Khadse from Yavatmal said that his primary concern was the low cotton yield. Shetti’s party will be continuing the agitation over soyabean prices. “Going against the very spirit of Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, the Centre imposed stock limit on soyabean. This led to a crash in rates of the produce, he said. “We are also demanding a law making purchase at MSP mandatory. Even if the MSP is declared for a number of crops, farmers have to even settle at rates lower than that. It should be made mandatory for even private traders to buy at MSP,” he said. Kishore Tiwari, the chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavlamban Mision, said the farmers crisis in Vidarbha has different dynamics. “The farm laws have already been eased in the state but it has made a little impact on farmers’ earnings,” he said. On the other hand, consumer activist Shahid Sharif said repealing the Essential Commodiies (Amendment) Act will help in keeping the prices under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/falling-cotton-soya-prices-not-farm-laws-worry-vid-farmers/articleshow/87807404.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Pune||Only 48% beneficiaries in 45-plus age group fully vaccinated in Maharashtra||PUNE: The state public health officials are yet to achieve 100% first dose vaccination of the 45-plus population in Maharashtra — one of the crucial measures to reduce hospitalisation and deaths in case there is a third wave of Covid-19. Nearly 21 districts have so far registered below 80% coverage of the first dose. Only a handful of districts have managed to fully vaccinate 70% of the population in this age group though it was the focus of the inoculation drive. The state’s average first dose coverage in this group was 80% and it was 48% for the second shot till November 16. The state health officials stated that there would be special focus on ensuring that the entire population in this age group was administered at least the first dose by November 30 in all the districts. The earlier deadline set by the state health department to vaccinate the vulnerable group was October-end. “With the Har Ghar Dastak programme, we want to ensure that there is maximum coverage of this age group. We want the local authorities to make extra efforts to complete the vaccination of the 45-plus population at the earliest,” said a senior official of the state public health department. The Union health ministry and WHO have been continuously iterating the importance of immunizing the 45-plus population because the severity of the disease and deaths were higher in this age group. The Covid task force members from the death audit committee also stated that maximum deaths in the state had occurred in the 45-plus age group. Still, many people in this category are yet to get even the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines. Only Sindhudurg has fully vaccinated 81% of its population in the 45-plus age group, closely followed by Mumbai and Kolhapur with 71%. The two-dose coverage in almost all other districts is below 70%. Hingoli and Aurangabad are at the rock bottom with 31% coverage. Hingoli, Nanded, Palghar, Nandurbar and Aurangabad remained in the red for poor first dose vaccination. All these districts have registered below 65% first dose coverage and for the second dose it was in the range of 30-39%. The Covid task force members cautioned that vulnerable groups cannot be left out from the vaccination drive at any cost. “The local authorities should prepare an age-wise list and ensure under the door-to-door vaccination programme that those yet to be vaccinated visited the near-to-home inoculation centre at the earliest,” said a state health official. The local authorities were earlier told to prepare a detailed list of the beneficiaries left out in all age groups with the help of the electoral rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-48-beneficiaries-in-45-plus-age-group-fully-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/87807056.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Rash with itching in focus as chikungunya cases rise in Pune||PUNE: Rash all over the body with itching as well as redness over face and joints were prominently being seen among chikungunya patients in the city, besides fever and weakness, treating doctors said. More patients have been testing positive for chikungunya, along with dengue, over the past few days. “I have been seeing more cases of chikungunya than dengue in the last few days. Patients often present with prominent facial and joint redness. The proportion or percentage of chikungunya cases to dengue is 60:40 now, which was earlier 20:80,” said general practitioner and family physician Santaji Kadam. The redness in dengue-infected patients is often uniform. “But in chikungunya, it is more prominently seen on the patient’s face and joints, mainly shoulder, knee, and finger joints,” Kadam said. The early symptoms of chikungunya include fever, headache and joint pain (arthralgias). The knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, and/or fingers are generally affected. Joint pain increases with movement and is worse in the morning. It may take many weeks before the symptoms improve. “Besides these symptoms, I am seeing more patients presenting with rash all over the body with itching, usually on the fourth and the fifth day from the onset of illness. The rash is also a symptom in dengue but in chikungunya it is usually all over the body with itching,” said family physician Mahesh Wayal. Wayal underlined that the chikungunya cases had surged significantly over the last 10 days. “I do see dengue cases even now. But compared with the last month, when dengue cases were seen in 90% of the patients and chikungunya in 10%, the number has surged considerably now. I see chikungunya cases in about 40% of the cases of mosquito-borne illness now.” Experts said chikungunya was mostly clinically diagnosed by doctors based on a patient’s symptoms as fatal complications in chikungunya were considered a rarity. “It often happens that a patient is prescribed symptomatic treatment without being subjected to any diagnostic tests. This is one of the reasons why many chikungunya cases often go unreported,” said senior family physician Avinash Bhondwe, dean (elect) of Indian Medical Association's College of General Practitioners and past president of IMA, Maharashtra. Experts stressed on physical activity and early rehab to get over the joint pains that patients have to bear for a long period after full recovery from chikungunya. “Patients often get well within 15 days. But joint pains last for months. Hence, initiating early rehab under doctor’s supervision is the key,” said senior physician Narendra Javadekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rash-with-itching-in-focus-as-chikungunya-cases-rise/articleshow/87807064.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Though night safari was started in Palsasgaon two years ago, in Khadsangi it was launched on November 5. In the last few days, there were protests by green activists from Chimur led by Kawdu Lohkare. “After opening huge forest area for a day-long safari through 14 gates in the buffer zone, why night tourism should be pursued putting nocturnal animals in distress. As it is, there is no response,” said Lohkare. “Night patrolling by vehicle is meaningless because one can view the light from 5km and hear the sound of vehicles from the same distance. No poacher or wildlife criminal can be nabbed,” said Lohkare. “Vehicular movement with torches has been prohibited because as per wildlife science, eyesight gets reduced and affects animals’ natural movement, habits, modus operendi, behavior, and its biology. It also induces pettism,” remarked Uday Patel, honorary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli. Talking to TOI, deputy conservator (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “It is basically not night safari but night patrolling through forest roads along with the villages and farms. In Khadsangi we have a 30km to and fro route. This patrolling will deter wildlife criminals.” However, Suresh Chopne, founder president of Green Planet Society says, “Any form of night tourism is unacceptable. The forest officials should put conservation at the top and not commercial gains. Neither permission has been taken from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) nor the statutory Local Advisory Committee (LAC). Besides, the TATR’s Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) also makes no mention of night safari. The park is charging money from tourists and hence it is basically night tourism under the garb of night patrolling.” Patel says, “Night tourism will increase human-tiger-wildlife conflicts as the animals would be exposed to light which they generally avoid. Ask any expert they will always opine against such unnatural haphazard form of tourism in the name of providing jobs to locals. Does it make sense at the cost of wildlife?” “It is a non-sustainability process and seems to be driven by the resort lobby where a maximum number of gates matches the number of resorts. As per guidelines, there should minimum disturbance and exposure to wildlife,” says Patel. Earlier, such experiments were undertaken in Gorewada, Nagalwadi (Pench), and Narnala (Melghat) but have met with poor response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-no-to-night-tourism-in-tadoba-buffer/articleshow/87807408.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Vomiting after any head injury is dangerous even in youth: Doctors||NAGPUR: The unfortunate incident in which a young boy from the city lost his life due to brain hemorrhage on November 17 once again trigerred discussions on the serious issue of brain injury at a young age. The boy had a fall from his bike on November 14 and had episodes of vomiting in the evening. He had visited local doctors but as he was not having any serious symptoms, he avoided going to the hospital and having a CT scan. The boy had his dinner and went to sleep. Next morning, when his grandfather tried to wake him up, he did not respond. In spite of 3 days’ treatment, his condition deteriorated and doctors declared him brain dead on November 17. Neurologists and neurosurgeons told TOI that injury can happen at any age and there is no point in neglecting the falls due to sudden dizziness, followed by vomiting etc. “Injury can be of different types. Even if you feel good and recover after the fall, it could be a kind of internal injury. One should not take head injury lightly at any age or at any circumstances,” said neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal. Early intervention and check-up in a hospital with good facilities can detect the nature of injury in the ‘golden period’ and life can be saved. According to interventional neurologist Dr Amit Bhatti, time is of the essence in the treatment of brain injury. “In case a stroke occurs due to a clot, about 1.9 million neurons die every minute until medication or interventional neurological procedures clears the clot that’s blocking or reducing blood flow to the affected brain area. The sooner you get to the hospital the better,” said Dr Bhatti. He further said that in stroke-ready hospitals, one can undergo MRI or CT scan which creates a picture of the brain to look for physical evidence of internal bleeding or stroke. “An angiogram looks for blood vessel abnormalities,” said Dr Bhatti. Doctors said even blood tests can detect signs of infection and clotting abnormalities. Neurosurgeon Dr Ninad Shrikhande said that any symptoms post head injury or fall should never be avoided. “Sometimes, symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke present slowly and steadily worsen over time. Early visit to specialized clinic can be the best remedy. Symptoms like spinning sensation, mild confusion, nausea or vomiting, temporary ringing in the ears should be taken seriously,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vomiting-after-any-head-injury-is-dangerous-even-in-youth-docs/articleshow/87807411.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Rs 25 lakh lottery bait leads to loss of Rs 45 lakh||PUNE: A 34-year-old man fell hook, line, and sinker for a Rs 25 lakh lottery scam and ended up losing nearly twice as much money to fraudsters. In his desperation to bag the lottery, regarding which he had received a text message, the man broke his late father’s fixed deposits, borrowed money from relatives and made 30 bank transfers totalling Rs46.35 lakh to15 accounts between May and August before he realised he had been taken for a very expensive ride. The Bibvewadi police said the victim, a resident of Indiranagar, works as a deewanji (traditional accounts employee) with a prominent vegetable merchant at Market Yard. He filed a complaint with the cyber police and an FIR was registered on Wednesday. Senior inspector Sunil Zavare said the complainant received an SMS on May 22 claiming that his mobile number was selected for a Rs22 lakh lottery. The man contacted the phone numbers mentioned in the SMS. “The suspect(s) asked him to pay different ‘taxes and fees’ to get the lottery. He ended up paying Rs46.35 lakh between May and August,” Zavare said. The complainant told TOI on Thursday, “I continued to make the money transfers in the hope that the caller(s) would deliver on their promise. I wanted the money as I thought it would make my life easier.” Zavare said, “The complainant’s father, a retired police constable, died a few years ago. He kept some fixed deposits, all of which the complainant broke. He also borrowed money from his friends and family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-25l-lottery-bait-leads-to-loss-of-rs-45-lakh/articleshow/87787461.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Pune||Increased under-reporting of AEFI events a worry: Experts||Pune: Public health experts have observed an increasing trend of under-reporting of Adverse Event Following Immunisation events in all states. Virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI that the system of reporting the incidents of Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) continued to be faulty 11 months after the vaccination drive teed off in India. “Transparency on AEFI and clarity are the need or two legs for the vaccination campaign. The country has not devised a system to collect data with quality. The under-reporting is not merely quantitative, but also under-detected, undercounted and under-investigated AEFIs,” he said. The country has administered over 113 crore vaccine doses to the eligible population so far. The Union ministry of health stated that 1,868 serious adverse events were reported post-vaccination till October 25. Dr John felt that under-reporting of AEFI events would only increase vaccine hesitancy. He said there were only two ways. “First, the government clearly says it does not have the data to be transparent about AEFI. Second, the government gives out what it knows. When the second does not happen, the first is also a suspect,” he said. The health expert claimed that the country had not devised a system to collect data with quality and comprehensiveness on health events. “If we aspire to be a developed country, we must be able to develop a system. It is not difficult or very expensive. No government in the past or present has understood this as a necessity,” Dr John said, adding that AEFI was just one item in this black hole. Malini Aisola, the co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network, said the health ministry’s presentation to the National AEFI Committee noted a trend of decreasing AEFI events being reported while the vaccination drive was expanding. Officials from the Union health ministry said there were some delays in verification by local authorities. The health ministry instructed the officials concerned to scale up reporting of minor AEFIs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/increased-under-reporting-of-aefi-events-a-worry-experts/articleshow/87807072.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The neta claimed many truck drivers travelling between JNPT and Gujarat, Nashik opted for this route as the stretch was toll free, even though it was longer. He said this often led to traffic congestions on the route and also blamed the continuous heavy traffic for the frequent damage to the road.  The road was designed in 2000 to divert heavy vehicular traffic off the old Pune highway. The stretch has been popular with freight vehicles as the existing toll plaza on the route was removed few years back.

Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said the city recorded the lowest inflation rate for food prices in the country in the financial year 2020-21. Sisodia was releasing Annual Report of the Price Index for Delhi, prepared by the directorate of economics and statistics for 2020-21, which reveals that in the last fiscal, the increase in inflation in Delhi was 3%, while Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai and Bengaluru registered 4.6%, 4.4%, 4.1% and 4% hike, respectively. The finance minister said the data showed that the Delhi government efficiently managed to keep inflation under control in the national capital and, even during Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi recorded the lowest rate of inflation among the five metro cities in the country. While releasing the report, Sisodia said that in the financial year 2020-21, the rate of growth in average annual inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) was 5% nationally, while it was only 3% in Delhi. Sisodia also said that in the previous fiscal, the national inflation rate for food prices was 5.7%. On the other hand, in Delhi the rate was recorded at 4.1%, which, he said, was the lowest in the country. The housing index of the consumer price index saw an increase of 5.2% in the entire India in 2020-21, but it was only 3.9% in Delhi, the finance minister said. Sisodia also pointed out that the inflation rate increased sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic in the country and the prices of essential commodities increased. In Delhi, however, the rate of increase in inflation is much lower than that of the entire country even during this period, he said. The increase in inflation in Delhi was 2% less than the national figure, which saw an increase of 5%, Sisodia added. The deputy chief minister said that due to the timely measures adopted by the Arvind Kejriwal government, the prices of commodities in Delhi remained stable during this period and did not increase much. Sisodia said the Delhi government was constantly monitoring the prices of essential commodities and made efforts from time to time to control and stabilise the prices of commodities through market interventions. Sisodia further said that the Aam Aadmi Party government was committed to the common man and always stood with him. He said that the stable inflation rate even during the pandemic was a big relief for the people of Delhi at a time when the inflation rate had increased rapidly in the entire country. The finance minister said that the Delhi government did not allow an increase in inflation in the city during the pandemic period by taking different measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-inflation-lowest-among-metros/articleshow/87807419.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The airport area is a habitat for three packs of golden jackals and the foresters are working out a strategy to keep the animals away from the runway. Earlier, a plane was delayed in landing due to sighting of these animals on the runway by the pilot of Mumbai- Sindhudurg flight. Chief conservator of forests (Territorial) Clement Ben said, “The strategy is still in its planning stage. In the next two days, some concrete plan will be worked out to keep these animals away from the airport premises. The area is huge with wall fencing around its 275 acre premises. It, however, has heavy grasslands in the surroundings.” Ben added, “There are three packs of around 25 to 30 golden jackals having their habitat here. This area is not a recorded forest land, but now as these jackals have also been sighted on the runway, it’s a serious concern. I am in talks with the officers.” The senior forest officer said that there are plans for airport expansion as well with the airport authority and hence, they have to act fast about translocating the jackals. “Tranquilising or dotting might be an issue. Instead, netting or trapping them would be a better option I feel. We are having word with experts and within 2-3 days, some concrete solution will be found out,” he added. Earlier, the Chipi airport was inaugurated amidst controversial presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Narayan Rane in October. The airport runs daily flights to and from Mumbai and is getting good response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/foresters-worried-as-jackals-seen-on-chipi-airport-runway/articleshow/87805921.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Domestic abuse victim stabbed by husband||Kollam: A woman who initiated legal action against domestic abuse against her husband had to face even bigger violence as the latter tried to kill her by stabbing with a knife. The incident occurred at Malakayal under Paravur police station limits in Kollam district on Wednesday morning. Sheeba of M S Bhavan, Malakayal, is the injured. Paravur police have arrested her husband Vijayakumar, 42, of Kurumandal near Paravur on charges of attempted murder. He was produced before the court on Thursday and remanded in judicial custody. According to the police, Sheeba, who worked in a private firm, was living separately from her husband for the past six months due to domestic violence. She had even filed a petition before the court accusing Vijayakumar of domestic abuse. He is a carpenter by profession. Even though her husband had made several attempts for reconciliation, Sheeba rejected his requests every time. On Wednesday, Vijayakumar waylaid her and attacked her while she was on her way to work on her scooter. When she reached around 500 meters away from her house, Vijayakumar, who was waiting for her, blocked her path and attacked her. Sheeba told the police officials that Vijayakumar, aimed his knife at her chest, but she blocked it using her left hand and sustained a serious injury below the elbow. He then pulled out the knife and stabbed her again on her knee before fleeing from the spot. Vijayakumar was soon caught by a police team led by Paravur station house officer inspector A Nizar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/domestic-abuse-victim-stabbed-by-husband/articleshow/87787463.cms||---
---||Pune||Successful liver transplant at taluka-level hospital offers hope||PUNE: Doctors successfully performed a cadaver liver transplant on a 54-year-old patient suffering from an end-stage liver condition at a private hospital in Karad in Satara district recently. “This is the country’s first liver transplant that was successfully carried out at a taluka-level hospital, which happens to be our branch in Karad. The procedure was carried out last month. The patient is doing well post surgery,” Sahyadri hospital’s head and senior neurosurgeon Charudutt Apte said. The taluka-level organ transplant centre in Karad is expected to bring much relief to the patients of Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, and the surrounding areas. The patients will not need to travel to major cities for liver transplant services. The organ transplant centre can conduct liver, pancreas and kidney transplants, Apte said. The hospital’s liver transplant surgeon Bipin Vibhute said, “The 54-year-old patient, a resident of Ahmednagar, was the first one to undergo a liver transplant at Sahyadri Hospital’s Karad unit on October 14. He received the liver from a 52-year-old woman, who was declared brain-dead at a hospital in Kolhapur. The liver was brought in from Kolhapur to Karad in 25 minutes via a green corridor. Thereafter, it took four hours to complete the transplant surgery.” Liver-related problems are a growing concern in India. Not only alcohol, but wrong lifestyle choices, wrong diet, lack of exercise add to the risk. If neglected and not diagnosed and treated on time, they can cause further complications, a doctor said. “We have been conducting outreach programmes through liver OPDs in semi-urban areas and smaller cities. Many times tranpslant is the only option left in patients with end-stage liver disease or in patients with liver failure. Therefore, an organ transplant centre at taluka-level can reduce time and give a new lease of life to many,” Vibhute said. Venkatesh Mule, the chief manager of Sahyadri Super Specialty Hospital, Karad, said, “The diagnosis and surgical facilities under one roof give much relief to patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/successful-liver-transplant-at-taluka-level-hosp-offers-hope/articleshow/87807077.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Centre feared farm law backlash in UP, Punjab elections, says NCP chief||PUNE: Former Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday that the central government’s announcement repealing the three farm laws was spurred by the need to prevent a backlash in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Pawar, in a series of posts on a microblogging and social networking site, said, “It was good that farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Harayana participated in the protest. The farmers and the people in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab would have posed questions to the BJP’s candidates on farm laws during the elections. Fearing a backlash, the government decided to repeal the laws.” The NCP chief said that though the government’s decision came late, it was a wise decision. “I salute the farmers for their peaceful protest for one year. For the first time in the history of the country, the farmers had to protest for more than a year. The government should have listened to their demands and opted for a middle path to address their concerns through dialogue, but it took the extreme step of going ahead with the laws,” he added. “The government ignored the views of the opposition parties on the three farm bills. We told the parliament that the agriculture sector is the soul of the country. Thus, a discussion on the subject should have been taken, irrespective of political differences. However, the government did not pay heed to opposition views and passed the bills in haste,” Pawar added. Pawar reiterated that there was a discussion on reforms in farm laws when he was the agriculture minister. “But I am of the view that this kind of decision should not be taken at ministers’ meetings or in New Delhi. As per the Constitution, agriculture is a state subject. The Centre need to take the states into confidence along with farmers’ organisations and agriculture experts before going for any reforms in farm laws.” Senior state NCP leader and home minister Dilip Walse Pati said in a social media post, “Had the Prime Minister’s announcement come earlier, many lives of innocent farmers could have been saved. I pay tributes to the farmers who lost their lives in the struggle.” Another NCP leader and Shirur Member of Parliament Amol Kolhe said, “The announcement is a victory for farmers’ unity. The Union government might have taken the decision in view of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. However, it is a big thing for the affected farmers.” Prakash Ambedkar, president, Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi, said, in video and social media message, “Even though Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has said that the three agricultural laws have been repealed, the Supreme Court of India should still give its judgment on whether agriculture is a state subject or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-feared-farm-law-backlash-in-up-punjab-elections-says-ncp-chief/articleshow/87806596.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Govt must ensure minimum support price: Kisan Sabha||PUNE: All India Kisan Sabha’s state unit general secretary Ajit Navale said on Friday that the central government should now take an early decision on bringing in an enactment to ensure legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) for various crops. He said the farmers who died in the struggle to get the three contentious laws repealed deserved a salute after the government’s announcement. “It’s a victory for more than 500 farmers’ organisations who fought collectively against these laws.” he added. Sachin Holkar, agriculture activist, said, “Today’s announcement proves that the farm laws were against farmers and hence the government had to repeal the laws. Now, the MSP is the most crucial thing for farmers. If farmers get guaranteed rates for crops, they won’t be dependent on the government. Often, farmers had to sell their harvest/ produce at very low cost due to the existing system of open auction in markets. This method is inappropriate and hence many farmers are economically poor.” Anil Ghanwat, a member of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to listen to the grievances of farmers relating to farm laws, termed the government’s announcement an “unfortunate step” for farmers. Ghanwat, who is also the president of the Shetkari Sanghatana, said, “The government surrendered eventually. Because of the old farm laws, the farmers were not getting any benefit and were driven to take extreme steps, like committing suicides. Our panel had addressed loopholes/drawbacks of the laws. However, without studying our recommendations, the laws will now be repealed. No party in power will ever dare to reform farm laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-must-ensure-minimum-support-price-kisan-sabha/articleshow/87806598.cms||Sandip Dighe

After the polls were announced, Patil had requested Awade to allow his son Rahul to contest the elections. However, after Awade declined the offer, Patil approached Mahadevrao Mahadik to let his daughter-in-law Shoumika Mahadik contest elections.

---||Delhi||Repeal of farm laws: A victory for democracy, says Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday described the Centre’s decision to withdraw the three farm laws as a victory for democracy. He said the farmers were called terrorists, Khalistanis and anti-nationals, and all sorts of attempts were made to break their spirit, but they didn’t give up and fought like freedom fighters. A timely withdrawal of these laws could have saved the lives of 700 farmers martyred during the struggle, Kejriwal said at a press conference. “This day will be written with golden letters in the chronicles of Indian history, just like August 15 and January 26. The Centre had to finally bow in front of the farmers' tireless struggle and withdraw all the black laws. It is not only the victory of our farmers, but also of democracy,” the CM said. He said the farmers had proved that in a democracy, a government would always have to listen to the people. “Only and only the will of the people will rule. Be it any party or leader, your arrogance will not work in front of the public,” Kejriwal said. The AAP government had stood with the farmers right from the beginning, the CM said, adding that it had arranged for water, toilet and other facilities for the protesters when they arrived on Delhi borders. Kejriwal, meanwhile, postponed his visit to Punjab by two days to November 22 where AAP would celebrate the “victory”. The CM claimed that the “system” did its best to try and break the movement, but it could not succeed. “The water cannons dried up in front of the courage of the farmers. The laathis of the government were broken. All their tricks fell flat,” Kejriwal said. He said the death of over 700 farmers engaged in the movement pained him. “These deaths could have been avoided if the laws were rolled back earlier. Our brothers and sisters did not need to suffer in the cold, rain and the sun, sitting on the roads for so many months. I salute these martyrs, bow to their families,” Kejriwal said. The CM said that the country would never forget the sacrifices the farmers had made. “The victory of the farmers is a lesson for the children and the youth of our country that if we fight peacefully with the right intention, then success will be achieved, no matter how tough the fight,” he added. AAP MLAs, councillors, officebearers and workers joined the protesting farmers on the Singhu border to congratulate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-victory-for-democracy-says-kejriwal/articleshow/87807497.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Winter assembly session may be deferred till January||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra Legislature’s winter assembly session is most likely to be deferred till January on account of various factors. It would be the first session in the city in almost two years as it was cancelled last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to sources from the legislature offices, the forthcoming elections for six MLC seats in the state was one of the reasons as the code of conduct was already enforced and would stay till December 16. Another reason was time taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to recuperate from his neck injury after his recent operation. “We have discussed the issue in our cabinet meeting and it was decided to defer the session due to many factors. Earlier, the dates were proposed in December third or fourth week, but after realising that those clashed with holiday season, it was decided to defer it till next month. However, the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) would take a final call in this regard during its meeting shortly,” guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI. State water resources minister Jayant Patil said that the winter session would be held in Nagpur only, but it would not start on December 7 as proposed earlier. “Since, the CM is recuperating and would take time, it was decided in the cabinet to postpone the session. The BAC would be apprised of this development and it would take a final decision on new dates,” he told TOI. Earlier, the session was scheduled in the city from December 7 to 17 and legislature’s principal secretary Rajendra Bhagwat had also conducted a meeting with top officials including divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Varma, collector R Vimala and others last month for its preparations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/winter-assembly-session-may-be-deferred-till-jan/articleshow/87807416.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Hadapsar resident Garad was part of a group of Kamble’s aides who had gone to the civic ward office around on Wednesday to inquire about the delay in completion of drainage and concrete work in the area. The officer then called and asked the contractor to speed up the work. The contractor and his men then reached the ward office and questioned Garad’s locus-standi in the matter before abusing and assaulting him, police said. The Wanowrie police have registered a case under various sections of the IPC. The TOI on Thursday afternoon called the contractor but his phone was switched off. Corporator Kamble told TOI, “The contractor is expected to do the work within the timeframe since he has bagged the tender.

City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said on Friday, that the currency notes were seized when the accused were attempting to transport them in an SUV in the city. The accused are Zubair Hammabba,52, Abdul Nasir,40, and Deepak Kumar,32, who are residents of Mangaluru. While Zubair and Abdul are drivers, Deepak assists his father, who is an electrical contractor. The vehicle used for the crime has been seized. Preliminary investigation revealed that the accused had procured the notes from a person near Shivamogga and Chitradurga districts. They had reportedly approached some people in the city, offering these notes at 20% of their face value. They claimed that banks would accept such notes at 50% of the face value under a special provision. Clarifying that demonetised currency notes have no value, the top cop requested the public not to fall prey to such claims. The accused have been booked under IPC Section 420 and various provisions of Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act-2017. The accused will be produced before a court, and the police will seek their custody for further investigation. “We need to track the source of demonetised currency notes, and to whom they tried to supply the same,” the commissioner said.

From 60 in 2014, the number of women who have joined Telangana Rifle Association (TRA) and National Rifle Association (NRA) is now around 150. Women students and professionals and housewives have now picked up the gun for a shot at gold and glory. Many of them can be seen hard at work at the Sports Authority of Telangana State (SATS) shooting range in HCU campus at Gachibowli. “There are 150 women shooters. It was 60 in 2014. This range was constructed in 2002 and it now needs to be upgraded,” Telangana Rifle Association general secretary J Kiran said. While SATS coach Sandeep Varanasi said that the number of women coming into the sport has seen a spurt in the last three years alone in a couple of categories. “Overall, shooters’ numbers tripled in the last three years, both in 10 metre and 50 metre shooting. International players also practise here. We are hoping to win medals in Nationals in the 50 metre and 10 metre range. Most of these shooters spend extra hours here before competitions, keeping aside their work,” Varanasi said. In the upcoming competitions at least 15 women shooters were likely to take part, he said. Among shooters at the range is VVS Kiran, an interior designer who left her job and took up shooting. “In 2019, I started shooting after enrolling as TRA member. I have participated in pre-nationals and now practice for nationals,” she said. She added, “I also started my own firm. More women are into 10 metre shooting. This sport is for everyone.” While Agastya Sai Kumar, an architecture student, said: “One can’t become an Olympian overnight. There is a lot of process that goes into it.” Many women cops and forest officials also practise at the shooting range for competitions. Prasanna Kumar, inspector (IT and communication) of Rachakonda commissionarate and a certified International Shooting Sports Federation coach, said: Women cops come here too. Shooting requires less physical endurance, but it’s a sport that requires more psychological fitness. Women can excel with their focus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/guns-glory-city-women-take-to-shooting/articleshow/87807425.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Additional public prosecutor Leena Pathak, who examined nine witnesses, including the girl who was the star witness, told TOI, “On January 25, 2016, the girl had called her boyfriend near her high school to take her along with him for marriage, fearing that her family won’t agree with the same. Her boyfriend reached the spot along with Chavan and together they went to her boyfriend’s home. Her boyfriend told her that their marriage won’t happen under the circumstances and she should return home.” “Chavan then offered to drop the girl home on his bike, but instead took her to an isolated place on a hillock and committed the first sexual assault. He put fear in the girl’s mind that her parents would beat her if she went home and she should instead marry him. He then took the girl to a relative’s place where he again committed another sexual assault,” the prosecutor said. Pathak said, “The evidence recorded by the girl, besides the statements under Section 164 CrPC recorded by three witnesses, medical and chemical analysis reports proved crucial in the conviction of the accused. The defence had claimed consensual physical relationship, but the court upheld our argument that a minor’s consent is immaterial in such cases.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-gets-20-years-in-jail-for-kidnap-rape-of-minor-girl/articleshow/87806601.cms||Vishwas Kothari

He is in a critical condition and under treatment at a private hospital in Daund,” assistant inspector Sandip Kamble of the Shirur police said. Police identified the victim as Vaishali Samir Tavare. The body of her sister-in-law, Maya Satav (32), was found in a well earlier in the morning. “It was a case of suicide,” Kamble said.

---||Delhi||Delhi court junks plea in 1984 riots case: ‘No proof son existed’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed an 80-year-old man’s plea seeking a declaration of his son’s death, allegedly killed during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saying he has produced no document to prove that his son even existed. The court said it is a matter of common and legal sense that only a person known to have existed in the first place can be declared dead. The man had approached the court seeking declaration of civil death of his son Ajit Singh and procuring/issuance of a death certificate from the office of the concerned registrar of births and deaths. “Needless to say, before seeking a declaration that a person is dead, plaintiff had the onus to prove the existence of Ajit Singh, who is the ‘person’ sought to be declared dead. On the contrary, despite a query by the court during final arguments, the plaintiff did not bring on record any ID proof of Ajit Singh nor any document which could reasonably satisfy the court about his identity and existence,” Civil Judge Helly Fur Kaur said in an order on Thursday. The court noted that it was an admitted fact that no missing report was available with the man since the police allegedly refused to register the same. The one lodged with Delhi administration was misplaced. According to the suit filed by the man, his son allegedly went missing during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and his efforts to trace him failed. He submitted that it is trite law that a person who has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of if he had been alive should be presumed dead. The suit said it was incumbent to submit here that the plaintiff’s son had not been heard by anyone among the family/relatives/ friends since the riots, so his son was presumed and declared dead. It further said that in any event, for issuance of a death certificate and for seeking compensation, the plaintiff needs to obtain a declaration of civil death of his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-junks-plea-in-1984-riots-case-no-proof-son-existed/articleshow/87807455.cms||---

The jeweller filed a complaint with the Chinchwad police on November 12. An officer from the Chinchwad police told TOI that around 4pm on November 11, the shop’s accountant sent a screenshot of the customer’s payment to the complainant. “The customer had purchased a gold coin worth Rs25,000 and he showed a screenshot of the payment. When the complainant checked his bank account, he found that the amount had not been credited,” the officer said. The officer said the screenshot of the payment had the name of the jewellery shop, but the transaction ID was fake. An officer from the cybercrime cell said a racket of fraudsters was operating in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and duping shop owners. They first take a photograph of the QR code from the shop and select an item, which they want to purchase. After scanning the code, they get the details of the account and subsequently create a fake screenshot of the payment. A pharmacist from Kothrud, Yogesh Nankar, said, “Customers have duped me at least thrice till date, by showing fake screenshots of payments. As I was busy at the time, I believed them and allowed them to go. Later, I found out that the amounts were not transferred to my account.” He added, “Since then, I have started taking precautions during the payment process. I equest the customers to wait the till I get a payment message from the bank.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conman-dupes-jeweller-of-rs-25k-with-fake-screenshot/articleshow/87787504.cms||---

None of the 119 corporators in the 122-member house have returned the oxygen cylinders given to them despite getting reminders from the corporation. Each corporator was given five oxygen cylinders. The NMC polls are expected to be held early next year and any sitting corporator, who wants to contest the election, has to take the certificate from the civic body informing the election authorities that they do not have any liability with the NMC. Nashik mayor Satish Kulkarni also said that the corporators should return the concentrators and he would take steps in the direction in next couple of days. “Most of our members are new in the house this time. There is no intention to keep the concentrators at home. I will ask each of the member to return the same,” he said. The NMC had procured 1,200 oxygen concentrators, some of which were distributed among the corporators so that they could provide the same to the citizens who needed them most. “Since it is the civic property, the members should have returned them to the corporation. But that has not happened so far,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent, NMC. Dr Nagargoje said that the oxygen concentrators turned out to be an important resource for some of those who required only oxygen and there was a shortage of beds in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/return-o2-concentrators-or-no-noc-for-polls-civic-chief-tells-corporators/articleshow/87805973.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||BJP trying to destabilize MVA by hook or by crook: Sharad Pawar||CHANDRAPUR: NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the BJP leadership at the Centre was frustrated for not having a state like Maharashtra in its hand. Replying to a query about repeated cases being filed by central government agencies against the ministers and leaders in MVA government, Pawar said the senior BJP cadre was trying to destabilize the Maharashtra government “by hook or by crook”. Addressing a press conference in Chandrapur, the NCP neta said, “Soon after the MVA government was formed, BJP leaders had started predicting that this government will not survive for long. However, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given a stable government for two years, which has irked the central leadership of BJP.” He claimed that similar tactics were being employed in non-BJP states like West Bengal and Kerala to destabilize the governments there. “The cards are being moved at the highest level. However, they should remember that history will have mention of the people abusing power,” Pawar said. He added that the “dirty tactics” of BJP to destabilize the government had instead brought the constituent parties of MVA together and steadfast in their resolve. On the Vidarbha statehood agitation, Pawar said the party is not against the movement in the name of the region’s development. However, there were differences in opinion about keeping the state together. “Our stand is that if there is a need of keeping Marathi-speaking people together, then their unity should be maintained,” he said. The senior NCP neta was accompanied by party leader Praful Patel, minister of state Prajakt Tanpure, district NCP president Raju Vaidya, OBC leader Ashok Jiwtode and district women president Baby Uike in the press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-trying-to-destabilize-mva-by-hook-or-by-crook-pawar/articleshow/87807460.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Mumbai||Western Railway plans to set up terminus at Mumbai's Jogeshwari||MUMBAI: The Western Railway has sent a proposal to the ministry to set up a terminus at Jogeshwari, primarily to operate Tejas class trains and privately operated trains. Indian Railway’s almost all long-distance trains run with locomotives. If platforms have a dead-end, a locomotive has to be attached at the rear end of the train to pull the coaches out of the platform once all the passengers deboard. A senior Western Railway official said, “We plan to run Tejas class types which are like suburban trains that can be operated from both ends of the rakes and there will be no need to attach locomotives to pull in and pull out a train from platform. Railways is planning to run private trains and hence a proposal has been sent to the Railway Board for operating trains from Jogeshwari.” In Mumbai, WR operates long-distance train services from BDTS, Mumbai Central and Dadar but these have now become saturated. A senior official said, “At present, there is a goods shed that handles freight traffic like cement and even food grains. Without disturbing freight operations, Jogeshwari can be upgraded into a terminus at a cost of Rs 70 crore.” The plan is to have an island platform that will allow handling of two trains simultaneously. Also, there will be one stabling line. Another senior official said, “We will await directions from the Railway Board when it comes to deciding which trains to be operated from Jogeshwari.” The terminus will come up on the east side of the tracks –between Ram Mandir and Jogeshwari suburban stations..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-plans-to-set-up-terminus-at-jogeshwari/articleshow/87808849.cms||Manthank Mehta

On November 17, the state average of vaccination of the first dose is over 76% and it is nearly 39% for the second dose. The vaccination in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts is significantly lower than it. In fact, Nandurbar is ranked at the bottom in the state. Nandurbar’s district health officer Dr Mahendra Chavan said they were hoping that vaccine coverage improves with the door-to-door drive. “We are aiming to vaccinate 70% of the beneficiaries with at least the first dose by this month-end,” he added. The health authorities from the region have blamed ‘vaccine hesitancy’ for the low coverage. In Nashik city, the health department officials said that beneficiaries of some pockets are still not keen to take the vaccine. In Nashik district, a sizeable population of Malegaon is yet to take their first dose. Covid-19 coordinator of Dhule, Dr Vishal Patil, said that people are not forthcoming to take their shots as the cases have reduced and things are back to normal. Jalgaon civil surgeon Dr N S Chavan said even they have started a door-to-door vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-hesitancy-hinders-coverage-in-n-maha/articleshow/87805995.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Dehradun||Gur mixes with ragini songs, but celebrations muted||Meerut/Muzaffarnagar/Agra: Farmers in parts of western Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand burst into a moment of joy in their villages and towns following PM Narendra Modi's decision to take back the three farm laws. Jaggery and laddus were passed around as ragini songs rang out around tractors and people danced to the beats of drums. But after months of protest, fatigue had sent it, lives were lost and disrupted. Celebrations at many places were muted. While Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Naresh Tikait welcomed the Centre's decision and demanded a law on MSP, several farmers of the region were cautious. "It took a year for the government to tell us this. Farmers suffered a lot and they didn't deserve this kind of treatment," said Manveer Huda, a farmer in Shamli. Another farmer, Naveen Pradhan, from Meerut, said, "A huge burden is off the shoulders of farmers. But they paid a heavy price to achieve this. We've sacrificed hundreds of our brethren during the year-long agitation. The government should not try to take credit for this so-called 'benevolence'. It was their mistake and they had to rectify it." Rakesh Dhankad, also from Meerut, said that the farmer's stature has now increased. "This decision was taken out of electoral compulsion," he quipped. "People know our worth." There was recognition, too, of the importance of Friday's announcement. BKU's Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar said, “We welcome the decision. On Guru Nanak Dev ji's birthday, we are now on the threshold of victory -- of truth and patience." Joining Parihar in celebration, BKU Agra district president Rajveer Lawaniya thanked everyone who supported the movement. In Agra, many also said that the PM should provide monetary help to the families of those who died during the agitation. Kin at the Kasganj house of Lakhvinder Singh, 60, who fell ill near the Ghazipur border and died soon after on January 22, were still in mourning. Tributes were paid to the ex-block development council member at the local gurdwara on Friday. His brother Satnam Singh said, “Over 700 farmers, including my brother, lost their lives. The PM did not utter a word in their memory.” Farmers of the Terai region, also known as the 'rice bowl of Uttarakhand', were elated. They assembled in Jaspur, Kashipur, Gadarpur, Rudrapur, Kichha, Nanakmatta, Sitarganj and Khatima towns to distribute sweets and burst crackers. "It is a huge relief for people of the Terai. It's a win for farmers and labourers," said Tejender Singh Virk, who was critically injured in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 and is still undergoing treatment. Gulshan Rod, head of Uttarakhand Kisan Morcha, said "it is a historical day for not just farmers but the entire nation. But trust in the government has been hit, of course".

Although police remain tight-lipped about the development, sources confirmed that a man was taken into custody and is being questioned. The suspect was picked up from Krishna Nagar and is reportedly associated with the film industry. Police are probing whether the suspect was involved in similar offences in the past. In February 2021, a similar offence took place at KBR park, when there was an attempt to rob a woman, who had also sustained injuries during the robbery attempt. The offence took place at the same place where the actress was robbed. “We suspect the person in our custody has committed similar crimes in the past. We are trying to ascertain the facts before we come to a conclusion,” sources at Banjara Hills police station said. Recently, the actress had told reporters that despite she offering to transfer ₹10,000 to the accused’s ewallet, the accused did not accept the money and sought valuables from her. In the complaint lodged by the victim in February, there has been no breakthrough so far. Police have beefed up security in and around KBR park after the latest incident. On Sunday night, when the actress was walking in the park, an unidentified man came from behind and gagged her mouth with a cloth. The victim managed to escape but the accused snatched her phone and fled from the spot. The actor called the police with the help of passers-by. Police have verified CCTV footage and the tower location of the actress’ mobile phone which was snatched by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kbr-park-theft-accused-nabbed/articleshow/87807509.cms||---

---||Pune||Biggest brands maximum plastic polluters, reveals SWaCH audit||Pune: An audit report prepared by SWaCH Pune has found that several local brands, including some of the top ones dealing in sweets, biscuits and spices, are the biggest contributor to the city’s plastic pollution. The report, based on the audit of 1.5 lakh pieces of plastic by 1,000 volunteers from 19 states, also stated that some international and national brands had been consistently contributing to the plastic pollution at the national and local levels. It found that of the total audited plastic pieces, non-recyclable plastic made up 35% of all waste and the share of branded plastic was 40%. SWaCH Pune, along with Break Free From Plastic movement members, including those of CAG Chennai, Hasiru Dala, Zero Waste Himalaya, Paryavaran Mitra and Natures Buddy, conducted brand audits across the country. Brand audits are data-driven and citizen-led initiatives that document the plastic waste and identify the companies responsible for the pollution. These audits are conducted every year across the world by members of the Break Free From Plastic movement. Brand audits involve counting and documenting the brands and companies contributing to plastic waste. SWaCH project in-charge Lubna Anantakrishnan said, “The dominant narrative on plastic pollution has been crafted by plastic producers to focus on consumer behaviour, littering and waste management. These companies have continued to pump in more plastic. Low-value plastic is difficult to recycle into our communities. Through brand audits, we hope to correct the narrative and shift the focus back onto the producers. The problem with single-use plastics begins with oil extraction and extends to the chronic externalisation of life-cycle costs by producers.” Satyarupa Shekar, Asia Pacific coordinator of Break Free From Plastic, said, “Given that 99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels and that the fossil fuel corporations are actively shifting their focus to plastic as an increasing source of revenue, all of these companies are contributing significantly to both the climate and plastic pollution crisis.” When contacted on the issue of plastic pollution, Sanjiv Rangrass, group head of ITC Limited’s environment, health and safety, projects and life sciences and technology, told TOI, “We are holistically addressing the issue of plastic waste through running large-scale plastic waste collection programmes like the flagship initiative, ‘WOW – Well-Being Out of Waste’, as well as working towards ensuring that 100% of its packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable within the next decade. ITC is already ensuring that it collects and manages plastic waste that is in excess of the plastic packaging utilized in its operations. ITC is all set to go beyond plastic neutrality this financial year.” Though TOI contacted a senior official of city-based Chitale Group, he refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biggest-brands-maximum-plastic-polluters-reveals-swach-audit/articleshow/87787527.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

District Home Guard commandant Murali Mohan Choontharu said that the deceased is Santhosh Kumar Kateel,35, from Kateel. It is learnt that on Wednesday, at 4.30 pm, the victim spotted a group of eight children being attacked by poisonous insects at Mulki. He rushed to their rescue, and got bitten in the process. He even ensured that the children were examined at a primary health centre, and went back home at 7 pm, probably without seeing a doctor. He later suffered breathlessness and died, Choontharu said. His mortal remains were handed over to the family on Thursday afternoon, and the last rites were performed. Choontharu said that Santhosh joined as a Home Guard in 2017, and had served in the fire and police departments, and performed Covid-19 and bandobast duties. He is survived by his wife and three children. Senior officers from the police department and Home Guards have pooled in Rs 25,000 that will be handed over to his family. The Home Guard commandant will also write to the government for providing Rs 10,000 for immediate expenses. Meanwhile, tributes were offered at the Home Guard headquarters on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/home-guard-saves-children-from-poisonous-insects-dies/articleshow/87806004.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj administration identifies 28 pollution hotspots||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when pollution, be it through the smoke emitted by factories, vehicles and burning of stubble or for that matter due to dust and noise, is causing problems across the country, the Sangam city too has registered a significant increase in pollution levels. In view of the increasing pollution of dust, smoke and noise, 28 busy roads have been identified as the most affected and district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri has officially termed them as “pollution hotspots”. These hotspots include Noorulla Road, Transport Nagar, Master Zahrul Hasan Marg, Shivram Das Gulati Marg, Muir Road-I, Muir Road-II, Kutchery Road, Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, Sardar Patel Marg, Dr Lohia Marg, Clive Road, Strachey Road, Cooper Road, Tashkent Marg, Tej Bahadur Sapru Marg, Kamala Nehru Road (1st), Shobhnath Singh Road, Katra Road-II, Mission Road, Hashimpur Road, Mumfordganj Road, Babi Bindeshwari Road, Subhash Nagar Road, Pannalal Road, Bank Road, Sarojini Naidu Marg, Kamala Nehru Road-II and PD Tandon Marg. The DM has ordered officials of all departments concerned to take necessary steps to bring this pollution under control. To oversee these efforts to cut down on air and sound pollution on city roads, environment engineer of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) Uttam Kumar Verma has been made the nodal officer. “The DM has ordered strict monitoring of air and noise pollution in the city and ordered that all necessary steps be taken to bring it under control. However, the 28 spots identified as the most affected would take priority in this regard,” said Verma. As part of the strategy to bring down dust floating in the air, the Jal Kal department has been directed to do regular water sprinkling to reduce the dust on the under-construction roads of the city while the responsibility of taking action against those who burn garbage or polythene under the open sky has been entrusted to zonal officers of the PNN. The responsibility of controlling noise pollution owing to vehicles has been entrusted to the transport department and the traffic police, the official shared. He said that the problem of too much dust ails most roads which have become pollution hotspots. Many of these roads are being widened. Though the Prayagraj Development Authority has started black-topping these roads to reduce dust on them, the PDA has also been asked to sprinkle water on these roads, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dist-admin-identifies28-pollution-hotspots/articleshow/87807517.cms||---

Each box contains 25 to 26 kg of tomatoes. A sudden shortage of tomatoes in the wholesale market has pushed up tomato prices,” he said.There is not enough supply from the local tomato growers from Dharwad district, Harpanahalli, Davangere and Kolar. The majority of the produce was damaged because of heavy and untimely rains in the last 2-3 months that caused the shortage in the market, he said.Earlier, the price of tomatoes per box was hovering between Rs 60 to 80 but now it has jumped to Rs 1,000 to 1,200 per box in the APMC. As a result, the price of tomatoes in the local retail market has increased to Rs 50 to 60 a kilo. Tomatoes are likely to be costly for some more days, said APMC merchants.Muttu Bhupalil, a tomato grower at Govankoppa village in Dharwad district, said: “I suffered a huge loss when the price of tomatoes crashed six months back and I had to destroy the crop on my 2 acres of land. But now, I am enjoying better profit though the tomato yield has been very low. Due to low yield, I am able to get only 60 to 70 boxes in one acre against the 100 to 120 boxes in a normal season. Many tomato growers have lost their crops to the heavy rain,” he said.Vijayakumar Ryagi, senior assistant director in the horticulture department in Hubballi admitted that there is a big drop in tomato yield now because of the untimely rain. The tomato plants had rotted after excess rain in Dharwad and other districts. “As tomatoes can be grown throughout the year, farmers should do the proper seed treatment to protect it from heavy and untimely rains,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/tomato-prices-move-skywards-in-north-karnataka-after-rain-ruins-crop/articleshow/87797190.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

According to district fire officials, the incident happened in the morning when locals informed them that a car got washed away due to flash floods which caused the river water to spill over to the road, leaving 10 people stranded. The car was attempting to cross the submerged road but the force of the gushing water resulted in the vehicle skidding off the road and into the river. When fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot along with locals, they found it difficult to reach the spot where the people were trapped due to the force of the water current. As the fire officials and locals helplessly looked on, those trapped managed to stay afloat by sitting on top of a JCB excavator, with the water levels rising every minute. Local MLA Topudurthi Prakash Reddy then brought the matter to the notice of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who then sought Indian Navy’s help to airlift them. Navy reached the spot in a chopper and lowered a rope. Navy personnel then slid down to lift each of those sitting on the roof of the JCB into the chopper. Officials said the chopper had to hover at the same spot for about 15 minutes to complete the operation. The survivors were later dropped off at a secure location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/navy-airlifts-10-people-trapped-in-chitravati/articleshow/87806822.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The idea behind the exercise was to arm the traffic police with information on how infrastructure and road design play a crucial part in improving road safety and traffic efficiency. The Sant Jagnade junction, located close to the Lalbaugcha Raja Ganesh mandal has a footfall of 3500 people during peak hours and witnessed 26 road crashes between 2016 and 2019. It was transformed earlier this year by the BMC, under the Bloomberg Initiative of Global Road Safety, and made safer with pedestrian friendly infrastructure. The traffic police play a crucial role in the current situation when large parts of the city have been taken up for Metro construction and bridge repairs. Using basic materials like barricades and cones, traffic policemen can make changes in street geometry and influence motorist behaviour. A well designed street can help regulate traffic and minimise the need for police presence. “Our experience of working at Bharatmata junction, Turner Road junction and many other key junctions in Mumbai is that simple design changes can regulate traffic to the extent that the burden of traffic regulation is taken off the police almost entirely. This in turn can aid better enforcement instead. Infrastructure will self regulate the traffic," said Dhawal Ashar, head of integrated transport at World Resources Institute, India, who conducted the training workshop at Traffic Training Institute, Byculla, on Thursday. Following a two hour presentation by Ashar, the traffic personnel in the audience were divided into seven groups. They were handed over drawings and designs of the Sant Jagnade Chowk pre-transformation. In the absence of road markings, pedestrians would dart across, endangering themselves. "We were asked to make changes in the design focussing on pedestrian infrastructure such as refuge islands to halt," said sub-inspector Hanumant Pise of Bhoiwada traffic chowky, one of the participants. "Being a Lalbaug resident, I have experienced first-hand the woes of pedestrians here," he added. The focus of the exercise was also on lane alignment and reclaiming unused space on roads to improve its efficiency. Once the police teams were done putting forth their ideas, they were shown visuals of the transformed intersection in its present-day avatar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-get-training-in-traffic-junction-redesigning/articleshow/87808852.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolkata||4,000 Kolkata Metro smart cards returned daily||KOLKATA: Metro’s footfall graph may be rising, but around 4,000 commuters are returning their smart cards every day, forcing the carrier to pay back around Rs 1.7 lakh from its cash counters daily. These commuters are purchasing the smart card to travel by Metro in the morning but returning them at the end of the day to take back the balance. Most of these commuters used to buy single-journey tokens before the pandemic. With Metro not issuing tokens now, these commuters were forced to adopt smart cards as a means to travel by Metro. However, many of them are unwilling to leave the cash on the card by the day’s end and instead return the card to take back the balance, only to purchase a fresh card the next morning. A smart card costs Rs 120, of which Rs 80 stays deposited with Metro. Of the remaining Rs 40, Metro offers a 10% incentive or rides worth Rs 44. When this balance is exhausted, the cards need to be recharged. But when the card is returned, the unused balance and the deposit amount is refunded to the commuter. Metro is campaigning on the plus points of having a smart card. It is the most user-friendly ticketing system, especially in pandemic times, it says. But smart cards and tokens can’t be directly pitted against each other, confessed officials. “Officially, we can’t discourage any passenger from submitting his card, even if it means debiting huge sums of money every day. The trend is worrying,” rued a station manager. Metro deputy general manager Protyush Ghosh said while smart cards are safe during a pandemic, it is even convenient otherwise as the commuter is spared of long queues. The card can also be recharged online. He, however, added, “In absence of tokens, it is true that some passengers may find it convenient to return smart cards. Though they are valid for a year, some may be reluctant to spend Rs 120 while embarking on a single day’s journey.” At the meeting of the Metro Railway Users Consultative Committee on November 9, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said that tokens will be back as soon as Covid cases reduce significantly, responding to a question by Shankar Das, nominated member of Railway Board, as to why only smartcards are allowed for boarding a Metro train. The GM explained that tokens would add to the risk of transmission. Metro had earlier announced re-issuance of tokens from March 15, but deferred its decision on March 13 as Bengal’s daily Covid count rose to 700-plus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4000-metro-smart-cards-returned-daily/articleshow/87806821.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

It was declared a heritage site in 2013. It was in Barrackpore that the oldest cantonment was set up by the British in 1775. The old governor general’s house was originally a permanent barracks and was setup as a cantonment of the British East Indian army. However, the history of the place predates that. It was called Chanak before the British came here to establish their military base. Chanak was inhabited by the then Bengali zamindars. From the 15th century onwards, Chanak and its adjoining area Nona Chandan Pukur grew up as a trading centre on the banks of the river Hooghly. When Marquis Wellesley took over the charge of the commander-in-chief in 1801, he decided to make improvements to the cantonment area. He built a single storied house for the future governor generals of India that is presently known as the governor general's House in Barrackpore. It was designed by Captain Thomas Anbury in 1813. Wellesley also landscaped the adjacent gardens in the English style and made various other arrangements by adding an aviary, a menagerie and a theatre. He also added a park which later became a popular place and is known as the Barrackpore Park. The old governor general’s house is located at Barrackpore’s Lat Bagan. However, the site was lying in a shambles due to lack of maintenance. The commission took up the restoration in 2012, engaging Manish Chackraborty as a conservation architect. Kolkata CP Soumen Mitra was then the ADG of police (training) and in charge of Lat Bagan Police Training School. “It was under his supervision that the restoration was done. Over Rs 5.5 crore has been spent so far. We have decided to visit the site on this Sunday and install the plaque,” said WBHC chairperson Shuvaprasanna. Speaking to TOI, Mitra said: “The greatest challenge was to convince my department 17-18 years ago not to pull it down and to make our men understand the value of this building. But once work started and my officers and men at the Police Training Academy learnt about the history and heritage of Barrackpore Park, their response and support were overwhelming.” Mitra also established a museum at the basement of the building. It currently has a good collection of arms and ammunition of the British period. The adjoining area of the building is also brought under restoration. That includes an aviary, menagerie and a large water body. On being asked about opening the museum to public, Mitra said: “Once the restoration is complete, it will be open to public in a restricted manner as it is located in a protected area close to the shooting range.” According to officer on special duty Basudeb Mallik, apart from the installation of the heritage plaque, we also plan to take a trip of other heritage sites in Barrackpore. That includes the Annapurna temple, Garrison Church and Stuart Kuthi (Lal Kuthi), among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-plaque-for-old-governor-generals-house/articleshow/87806836.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No interim relief to Adsul, court says sufficient material for interrogation||Mumbai: In a detailed order rejecting interim relief from arrest to Shiv Sena’s former MP Anandrao Adsul, a special court this week observed that the availability of sufficient material against him necessitates an interrogation to unveil the larger conspiracy in the serious offence. “From the material shown by the respondent Enforcement Directorate, a need to have custodial interrogation of the applicant is found necessary, which is more fruitful for collection of further evidence,” said Special Judge H S Satbhai. Adsul (74) had moved an anticipatory bail plea in a money laundering case last month. The ED is investigating a case where they suspect Adsul is a beneficiary of misappropriated funds of City Cooperative Bank. It had summoned Adsul. The court said that prima facie, the case made out by the ED is neither found to be frivolous nor groundless. “Success in interrogation would elude if he knows that he has been protected by a pre-arrest bail order. The grant of interim anticipatory bail in economic offence would definitely hamper the effective investigation,” the court said. It further said that prima facie the material shown by the ED is found to be substantial and satisfactory to not grant the relief of interim anticipatory bail. In the plea seeking interim relief, Adsul said that he was a Union minister of state for finance between 2002 and 2004. He said that in 2006, he contested City Cooperative Bank. He became the chairman. The plea said in 2014-2015, certain anomalies and irregularities in loan disbursement by the bank were noticed by the auditor. The plea said that on getting to know about this, in June 2017, Adsul approached the Economic Offence Wing (EOW), and lodged the complaint. The plea said that in an audit report, certain general and vague allegations have been made against the bank’s board of directors. It said that there are no specific and substantial allegations against him. He denied having any nexus with the alleged anomalies and irregularities in the loan disbursement. The plea said he was unaware for what purpose he had been summoned to appear before the ED. It was further submitted no information has been disclosed to him that for what reason he has been asked to appear in the office of the ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-interim-relief-to-adsul-court-says-sufficient-material-for-interrogation/articleshow/87808865.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Police have termed it as a suicide as a poisonous substance was found in her body, however, they have not ruled out the possibility of murder. A case has been registered at the Kotwali police station. Police said the deceased woman, Sunita, had been with her family members and was a widow. "She got a job on compassionate grounds after the death of her husband. On Thursday evening, she had her dinner and went to sleep. Suddenly, she complained of uneasiness, drowsiness, and respiratory problems. She was rushed to the BDK hospital, where she was declared brought dead," said a senior police official on Friday. "It has to be verified if she consumed the poison by herself or she was given poisonous substance by someone," said the official. Police said Sunita’s brother had stated that she consumed poison as she was depressed. "Prima facie it appears to be a suicide, but we are probing the murder angle into the case as well. Certain things have to be clarified in the case," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/48-year-old-govt-hospital-nurse-dies-under-mysterious-circumstances/articleshow/87806862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The melas had been cancelled last year due to the pandemic. This year, stalls selling a variety of handicrafts, including Nagina’s popular wooden handicraft, Khadar’s jute mattresses, Bijnor’s reed furniture and Amroha’s dholaks, are doing brisk business at the melas. Talking with TOI, apar mukhya adhikari (district panchayat) SB Sharma said, "Small traders and vendors faced huge losses during the pandemic. The Ganga snan fair has brought cheer to local artisans and villagers, as they could make money by selling their products.” The four-day melas commenced on November 16. Officials estimate that officials that around five lakh pilgrims in Bijnor’s Vidurkuti, 15 lakh in Amroha’s Tigri and over six lakh in Hapur’s Garhmukteshwar will take the holy dip in on Friday on Kartik Poornima, which is the last day of the fair. A large number of devotees have pitched their tents on the banks of the Ganga. Mats made of reed and tall grass that grow abundantly in wetland areas have been rolled out to cover the floors of the tents. Rajeev Kashyap, a resident of Ganj said, "We have been making reed mats for generations. One person weaves 10 to 15 mats a day, which are sold to the contractors or pilgrims for Rs 10 per piece." Local blacksmiths have also set up their stalls to sell sickles, spades, knives and other traditional and agricultural equipment made by them. In addition, several stalls selling toys, handicrafts, makeup products, tea and sweets dot the fair grounds. On Thursday, the devotees floated diyas in the river and offered prayers for their family members who have passed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ganga-snan-melas-bring-smiles-back-as-small-traders-biz-picks-up/articleshow/87806857.cms||Harveer Dabas

Thousands of people fled villages in Rajampet region following massive floods in the local streams. Several dozens of villages are facing threat of inundation as it took no time for the heavy rains to maroon the region. The communication system in many villages has been cut off as people living in high-rises were seen seeking help from the authorities. The roads were completely washed away as the swirling streams mercilessly jumped onto villages in almost all parts of Rayalaseema. Crops were damaged in thousands of acres as no land is visible in any part of the region.  According to water resources department officials, Gandikota dam in Kadapa received highest-ever flood in its history. Anticipating the situation, the officials started releasing about 1 lakh cusecs of water to the downstream Penna river since Thursday night. The lifting of gates at Gandikota dam had eased pressure on the project but wreaked havoc in the downstream areas.  Breach of Annamayya bund further complicated the situation in the villages close to the project including Baggidepalle, Pulaputturu, Paparajupallem. They were completely marooned in the floodwaters.  “Chief minister is closely monitoring the situation. Our first priority is to oversee the relief operations to help people trapped in the floodwaters. We will focus on enumeration of crop losses a little later,” said agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu.. According to initial estimations, crops in over 1 lakh acres were washed away in the floods and heavy rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/standing-crops-in-over-1-lakh-acres-washed-away-by-torrential-rains/articleshow/87806845.cms||Samdani MN

Nani had moved the high court with a lunch motion petition seeking urgent hearing of the matter. Arguing on behalf of Nani, N Ashwani Kumar said that according to the AP Municipal Act, a member of parliament can choose a municipality of his choice to be the ex-officio member. He has chosen to be the ex-officio member of Kondapalli municipality and sent representation to the authorities concerned. Ashwani Kumar argued that after notifying the elections for municipality, the municipal commissioner should inform about the same to the elected members of the parliament allowing to choose if they wanted to be the ex-officio members. Though the municipal commissioner claiming to have sent letters about the same, Nani did not receive any letter, he said. Justice D Ramesh directed the officials to allow Nani to cast his vote. Ex-officio vote has become a deciding factor in Kondapalli municipality as TDP and YSRC won equal number of wards in the election. TDP is now poised to win the municipality by fielding its candidate as chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-mp-to-vote-in-chairperson-election/articleshow/87806871.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: FOB ready for December opening, eye in sky for Chingrighata trouble spots||KOLKATA: A day after police presence was doubled at the accident-prone Chingrighata, state fire services minister Sujit Bose inspected the foot-overbridge — in its final stages of construction — at the traffic-heavy intersection on Friday. Drones were used by the police to identify spots that might need further police interference. While police looked at both immediate and long-term plans to make Chingrighata safe, Bose said the FOB will be opened in December. “Construction work along with its trial run will be completed by this month and it is scheduled to be inaugurated in December,” said Bose. KMDA officials said that escalators have been fixed on both ends of the FOB and a trial run is on to check them. “Some finishing work is left that will be completed in a few days and the FOB should be thrown open by this month-end,” said an official. About Rs 6 crore is being spent to set up the FOB. Kolkata Police, on the other hand, has started setting up 14 LED blinkers across EM Bypass — from the Metropolitan crossing to the Hyatt crossing — that will act as a guide along the median divider and help motorists comprehend the exact curvature of the road. Police officers said they were following the standard highway procedures in setting up these LED blinkers. “It has an added advantage. It throws light on the face of motorists and stop them from falling asleep. In the past, we have had accidents here as drivers dozed off. This will help stop such accidents to an extent,” explained an ACP. If successful, blinkers will be put up across the Bypass and Basanti Highway to combat dense fog, said Lalbazar sources. “Basanti Highway is extremely accident-prone, especially in winter. The installation of blinkers can be a major help to prevent vehicles from rolling down to the adjoining water bodies when visibility is low,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fob-ready-for-dec-opening-eye-in-sky-for-chingrighata-trouble-spots/articleshow/87806877.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The town buzzed with religious rituals and songs and there was maha aarti in evening. With this, the Pushkar fair drew to a close. There was drizzling since morning on Friday which pushed the mercury down. A large number of devotees mostly from the rural regions of the state visited Pushkar. Every community has a temple of their own deity where people conduct the rituals. "Pushkar fair is also important because community members meet, discuss and fix marriages of their children," said Santosh Jat of Sikar who came along with his family to attend the event. Devotees later were seen shopping in the main market of Pushkar and many of them enjoyed swings in the mela ground. Brahma Temple opened early in the morning and there was a queue of devotees to offer prayers. Meanwhile, because of the holiday on Friday many families from Jaipur and nearby cities were also seen enjoying outing in the dunes of Pushkar. Meanwhile, the Naga sadhus on Friday morning staged a rally in the town and went to the Pushkar Lake where they took a dip in the water and performed religious rituals. Looking to heavy rush on the occasion of full Moon on Friday, the police was on their heels and put up barricades and check posts on the main roads of Pushkar. Police were seen requesting people to use face masks and maintain social distancing. The cattle fair is already over in Pushkar and farmers on Friday started returning to their homes while farmers from Punjab and Haryana celebrated the announcement of repealing of three recent farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/devotees-assemble-for-holy-bath-on-last-day-of-pushkar-fair/articleshow/87806885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The data includes road accidents, railway crossing accidents and railway accidents. While Madhya Pradesh topped the charts with 43,360 accidents, Karnataka was second with 34,178. UP, the most populous state of the country, accounted for 30,593 accidents, but in terms of deaths, the state was way ahead with 21,156 deaths. followed by Maharashtra at 13,942 and MP with 12,629 deaths. Out of total traffic accidents, road accidents constituted a major chunk. Here again, UP was at the top with 19,037 deaths while the total number of road accidents were 28,653. Again, MP accounted for the highest number of road accidents at 42,398. Interestingly, in terms of the accident-related injuries, UP was ranked way below other states at 8th position. Tamil Nadu had the highest number of accidental injuries with 50,615 cases, followed by MP with 41,784 while UP had 16,069 injured victims. The impact of pandemic-related lockdown clearly reflected in the data when compared to 2019 figures. UP accounted for 30,593 accidents in 2020 but it was 27.8% less than in 2019, which witnessed 42,368 accidents. Countrywide, 2020 witnessed 1,46,354 traffic accidents as compared to 1,81,113 in 2019 and 1,33,201 road accidents in 2020 as compared to 1,54,732 in 2019. Railway accidents witnessed a huge dip at 11,968 in 2020 as compared to 24,619 in 2019. This occurred mainly due to grounded trains during extended lockdowns in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-saw-21156-traffic-accident-deaths-in-2020-highest-in-country-says-ncrb-report/articleshow/87806886.cms||Sandeep Rai

The deceased was identified as Rajya Lakshmi, 45, a housewife from Ashok Nagar in Miryalaguda town. According to Miryalaguda II Town inspector N Suresh Varma, a month ago, Rajya Lakshmi along with her husband Kantha Rao had moved into a rented house in Ashok Nagar area of the town. “Kantha Rao told the landlord at the time of moving into the house that he works for a civil contractor in Miryalaguda,” the inspector said. Three days ago, Kantha Rao had told the landlord that he and his wife were going out of station. The house was locked from outside. “On Friday, the landlord’s son-in-law went to the house after neighbours complained of foul smell emanating from inside. Upon noticing that the smell was from the house, he unsuccessfully tried contacting Rao and subsequently alerted us,” the inspector said. Police broke the lock on the main door and entered the house. They found the body of Rajya Lakshmi on the bed. “The body was decomposed and it was difficult to say if there were any injury marks on it. Things in the house were not ransacked,” the inspector said. Police are trying to locate Kantha Rao. “We do not have any details about him or the family. We are trying to gather more details. The cause of death could only be ascertained once we get the postmortem report,” the inspector said. A case was registered under section 174 of CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-found-dead-in-miryalaguda-husband-missing/articleshow/87807565.cms||---

Consequently, the country's largest company by market value will pull out its application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for segregating the O2C business from itself. The re-evaluation follows RIL's "evolving" energy business play, which includes its recent moves in solar power. It plans to make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing even as it targets to become net carbon zero by 2035. In a media release issued late Friday night, RIL said that, due to the evolving nature of its business portfolio, the company and Saudi Aramco have mutually determined that it would be "beneficial for both parties to re-evaluate the proposed investment in O2C business in light of the changed context". Two years ago, RIL announced that Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL's O2C unit for $15 billion. As part of the deal, Saudi Aramco would get one seat on the board of RIL and the right to appoint its executives in key managerial positions in the O2C unit. But the Saudi Aramco investment got delayed due to the pandemic and its impact on energy demand. The Indian company, however, recently appointed Saudi Aramco chairman and governor of the Kingdom's wealth fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on its board. The engagement over the last two years has given both RIL and Saudi Aramco a greater understanding of each other, providing a platform for broader areas of cooperation, the Indian company's statement read. Analysts interpreted that Saudi Aramco could look at investing in RIL's larger portfolio, including O2C and renewable energy & new materials businesses. The Indian company's facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which accounts for a major part of RIL's O2C assets, is envisaged to be the centre for its renewable energy and new materials play. Like RIL, Saudi Aramco too is pivoting towards green energy. In June this year, RIL announced that it will make a Rs 75,000-crore investment in clean energy over three years. Later, it bought Norway's REC Solar and India's Sterling and Wilson Solar. RIL's Friday statement further said that it shall continue to be Saudi Aramco's preferred partner for investments in India's private sector. RIL and the Kingdom have an over two-decade-old relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from Saudi Aramco for many years and the latter, through its wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF), investing in the Indian company's retail, telecom (Jio) and fibre-optic units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-aramco-to-review-15bn-o2c-investment/articleshow/87809113.cms||Reeba Zachariah

While the Congress leader took the lead in launching protests against the farm laws immediately after they were passed in Parliament in 2020, without a committed support from the opposition parties, he had also waged a lone battle over the land acquisition Law in 2015. It was only after much persuasion that other like-minded parties came around to back the agitation. In the end, both the controversial government moves spurred larger opposition agitation and forced the government on the back foot. Read AlsoRepeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decisionPM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs ofIn the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s surprise announcement on farm laws, the opposition bloc may be eager to push ahead. Though a key sore point for the government that had pitted the farming community against the ruling BJP would now be out of the public debate, much to the latter’s relief ahead of key assembly elections, it may tempt the anti-BJP axis towards greater stridency on other controversial issues that have hitherto remained either untouched or have been handled with soft hands. That raises the possibility that Rahul Gandhi’s hand may now be stronger to nudge the naysayers or the doubting Thomases. Read AlsoFarm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash.The big handicap in the opposition camp has been the divergence over issues to attack the government. Rahul has single-handedly forced the congress, despite in-house reservations, to question the BJP with gusto over Chinese aggression, Rafale scam, handling of J&K, but the rest of the opposition has stayed away from these sensitive subjects which they feel end up benefiting the BJP that quickly paints criticism on them as politicking over “National security concerns”. The coming winter session will reveal if the repeal of farm laws has changed the thinking of the non-congress, anti-BJP parties. Many in Congress believe that the Pentagon report on Chinese occupation and fresh revelations on Rafale purchase call for renewed aggression on the twin issues. Some changes, though, have been evident in recent months. The complete blockading of the monsoon session of Parliament over the Pegasus scandal, was a big departure from how a badly divided opposition had played post-2019 when BJP returned to Lok Sabha with a greater majority and the rivals lost their upper hand in the Rajya Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boost-for-rahul-line-on-street-politics/articleshow/87809114.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

In 2016, the then BJP MP of Kairana Hukum Singh had produced a list of more than 200 families that he claimed had migrated due to the town's "poor" law and order. The issue found a mention in the BJP's manifesto and Kairana became a poll plank in the 2017 assembly election. On Saturday, Shamli DM Jasjeet Kaur said, "The CM has asked to maintain a record of those who have returned to Kairana so that they could be compensated, if required. We will conduct a survey to locate such families." Notably, the CM had visited Kairana a few days ago and met with four families who had left the town after facing alleged harassment by local criminals. One of the families, who had left for Gujarat and returned to Kairana in 2018, said, "I felt honoured when Yogiji met us. He gave us enough courage and told us to live and work without fear."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-cms-exodus-remark-survey-on-to-find-migrated-families-for-compensation/articleshow/87806906.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Continuing his arguments on behalf of farmers on Friday, Rao said that if a man did same thing to another man it would be called cheating but the state government is doing exactly the same in case of thousands of farmers of Amaravati in the guise of a legislation. Describing the state government’s action as palpable arbitrariness, Rao said that the state government persuaded the farmers to give up their lands and entered into a contract by promising something in return through a legislation and it has taken a different stance now to repeal the same legislation. While repealing the CRDA Act, the state government said that it would save the land pooling scheme to retain the land that it has taken from the farmers. However, there was no mention of compensation to the farmers as it is going back on its promise of developing world class infrastructure. If one party is not willing to continue in a contract entered with other party, it has to compensate the latter for the consequential losses that arise from the cancellation of that contract. The state government by keeping the lands all these years and wanting to retain them by saving land pooling scheme, turning away from its obligation of compensating the farmers. This is nothing but gross abuse of power and palpable arbitrariness in exercising the power, said Rao.

Ravi Shankar is to continue his arguments on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/repealing-apcrda-act-was-abuse-of-power-argues-counsel/articleshow/87806905.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Delhi||Amid music and cheers, chorus at Singhu border: Give it to us in writing...||NEW DELHI: The township of tents and tractors that has come up at Singhu border on the national highway, and only expanded over the past one year, is not about to disappear into the blue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s early morning announcement that the three farm laws would be repealed set off celebrations at this camp but the protesters insisted that they wanted the government to put everything in writing, indicating the huge trust deficit that has prolonged the agitation. Their leaders have, of course, elsewhere said that they would like the laws to be actually repealed before they give up this vantage point. On Friday, the farmers were in a festive mood with loud music blaring from tractors and people breaking into a jig. If there had been any bitterness about their clashes with the police and subsequently being put under a virtual siege with layers of barricades and access control, this was not the day to rake that up. They took it as a good omen because it was Guru Nanak Jayanti and their long struggle had borne fruit. Nichetra Singh, 85, was hugging other farmers near his tent. “We braved the cold weather and heavy rain here. We lost our brothers during the protest. But, finally, we have won. We will, however, not leave this place till they don't give us in writing that they have withdrawn the farm laws,” he said. Ajit Pal, 34, standing next to Singh, was flashing the victory sign, posing for photographers. “The past one year has been a golden as well as the worst period for my life. During the protest, I met several people and we all became a family. It was a learning period for me. I was hurt when I saw elderly people sitting and protesting for their rights. I also missed my daughter," he recalled. He said they have won the battle, but if today's announcement turned out to be some kind of political stunt, they could continue their protest till 2025. Meanwhile, a tractor, blaring Punjabi songs, reached near the main stage. Children and youths were dancing on it while sweets were being distributed. People from across the city, including politicians, had reached the site to congratulate the farmers and click selfies with them. Joginder Singh, 64, along with four friends, has been camping here for the past nine months. “It is the victory of democracy and farmers across the country. They have given us immense support,” he said. His friend, Balbir Singh, 65, insisted that they wanted everything in writing before they could even think of moving. Gurmel Singh, 63, who was sitting near the stage and talking to other protesters, said besides their protests, the forthcoming elections too had forced the government’s hands. Yudhvir Singh, a Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader, agreed with Gurmel. “The government should have taken this decision on the very first day of our protest. We lost more than 700 farmers. If they had thought about the well-being of the farmers, they would have never come up with such laws,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-music-and-cheers-chorus-at-singhu-give-it-to-us-in-writing-/articleshow/87807602.cms||Abhay Singh

A letter by Kirankumar Bondar, joint director of higher education, Pune division to the director of higher education has said that a review of all the hostels in Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik was taken and it was seen that all college or university hostels are fit to reopen and the managements have also given their assent. “Hostels in Pune division are all set to reopen as soon as the decision is made. There are four universities in Pune division that have 12 girls’ and boys’ hostels each, and 77 affiliated colleges with hostels with a total capacity of 17,382 students,” Archana Borhade, administrative officer, joint directorate of higher education, Pune division, said. Reopening hostels is necessary because a major chunk of the students studying in Pune university come from outside the city and for them, staying at the hostel is the only viable option as it is cheaper than the private hostels or rooms. Also, since most hostels are either within the campus or nearby, the students also save time and money that they otherwise would have spent on commuting. Lastly, facilities like reading rooms, library and others are available on the campus which is easier for hostel students to access. Hence, the decision on hostels must be taken as soon as possible,” Kuldeep Ambekar, a law student and activist, said. Ambekar added that a letter to reopen hostels belonging to the social welfare department has also been submitted to the district social welfare office as many students belonging to reserved categories get free accommodation here which is a big support for their higher education. “These students come from poor families and they cannot afford to pay huge rent and stay outside. Hence, social welfare hostels must reopen without any further delay. We will protest outside their office if this demand is not met,” he added.  Colleges and universities have reopened but continue to provide lectures in both online and offline modes. Students have not returned to their educational institutions in full strength. Most are expected to come back in early December or when the second term starts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-decision-on-reopening-of-hostels-likely-in-8-days/articleshow/87806901.cms||Ardhra Nair

It was the first such forum organised in the division with two more planned in Nashik and Ahmednagar. The fora conducted online and offline are open to students, parents and teachers and will be organised every two months, Kirankumar Bondar, joint director of higher education, said. Archana Borhade, administrative officer at the joint directorate of higher education for Pune division, said, “In the first programme that was organised in Pune on Wednesday, 227 people participated in both online and offline mode. We had gone through each and every complaint, which we had told them to register online and then clubbed them into different segments. We told them to send their problems beforehand so that we could give appropriate answers. Apart from this, on-the-spot questions were also allowed. The initiative is important because we have all stakeholders on the same platform and the department studies the problem well before answering.” Maximum grievances were about academics such as delay in results, or examination related or online teaching problems, travelling problems, or scholarship disbursal, hostels and so on. “Then there were problems like what to do if one is not 18 and in college but cannot attend physical classes due to lack of vaccination. Many students complained about scholarships, the problems they faced on the web portal when they applied. This will be taken up with the technical team. Also sometimes, students do not link their bank account with their Aadhaar number and that becomes an issue. There were also fee-related issues and we have instructed colleges to take instalments and not force students to pay a lump sum amount,” Borhade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/higher-edu-officials-to-address-plaints-of-pune-division-learners-every-2-months/articleshow/87806907.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Emissions from 11 stars bigger than sun spotted||PUNE: National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) scientists have discovered exotic coherent emission from 11 of the 15 known stars that were nearly 4-6 times bigger than the sun and took 12 hours to four days to rotate. On average, the sun rotates on its axis once every 27 days. However, its equator spins the fastest and takes about 24 days to rotate, while the poles take more than 30 days, according to NASA. The researchers used the upgraded Giant MetrewaveRadio Telescope (uGMRT) to discover emissions in the stars. The first such star was discovered in 2000, four between 2013 and 2020, and eight were discovered in 2021. The astronomers named the stars as main-sequence radio pulse emitters (MRPs). Till two decades ago, when the first such emitting star was discovered, scientists felt that MRPs were a rare phenomenon. But, when NCRA researchers started rigorous work from 2018 onwards, they observed that the phenomenon was more frequent. A research paper describing these new results has been recently accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Lead author Barnali Das developed an optical path and strategised the observations that were timed specifically to watch these stars more frequently which changed the notion that the phenomenon was rare. Das recently completed her Ph D thesis under Poonam Chandra at the NCRA. Das and Chandra have been working on characterization projects of this little-known class of objects. Both introduced ‘MRP’ as a name in 2020 and extensively studied them to understand their properties over an ultra-wide frequency range using uGMRT and the US-based Karl G Jansky Very Large Array telescopes. Their work shows that the radio pulses emitted by MRPs contain vast information on the stellar magnetosphere. The pulsed radio emission from MRPs are the only visible signatures of theoretical models which predict tiny explosions in magnetic massive stars at specific locations in the magnetosphere of the star. “Radio pulses are visible only at certain times, and the phenomenon is mostly observable at low radio frequencies. This is the frequency range where the uGMRT stands out as the most sensitive telescope in the world,” Das said. Chandra said these discoveries are the fruits of an ongoing survey with the uGMRT being launched specifically for solving the mystery of MRPs. “The success of the GMRT programme has revolutionized the notion about this class of stars and has opened a new window to study their exotic magnetospheres,” she added. The astronomers said that the high sensitivity of the uGMRT and its ability to make high resolution images were instrumental in enabling the recovery of the pulsed signal from the different types of radiation coming from space. Combined with strategic observation, it allowed the astronomers to reveal the true nature of these objects. The GMRT is located at Khodad village near Narayangaon. It is an array of 30 fully steerable parabolic radio telescopes of 45 metre diameter, observing at metre wavelengths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/emissions-from-11-stars-bigger-than-sun-spotted/articleshow/87806915.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Farmers rejoice, rue loss of lives during protests||TRICHY/MADURAI: The farming community across delta and the southern districts rejoiced at the Prime Minister’s announcement to repeal the three contentious farm laws. Calling it a massive victory for their unrelenting protests in Delhi and the states including Tamil Nadu, farmers distributed sweets and burst crackers. However, leaders pointed out that many farmers would not have died during the protest had the Union government repealed the laws in the initial stage of the protest itself. All Farmers Organisations Coordination Committee president P R Pandian termed the revocation of the three laws a failure of PM Modi. “The on-going protests in Tamil Nadu will continue till the three laws are repealed in Parliament,” he said. While appreciating the PM, Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Thanjavur district secretary S Vimalnathan said elected representatives in the Union government should unconditionally apologise to the farmers “for demeaning the protests by calling us anti-nationals activated by foreign forces.” Tamil Nadu Farmers Association state general secretary P Shanmugam said the BJP government is responsible for the deaths of over 600 farmers involved in the protest.  The PM’s announcement also brought an end the 39-day-long protests of farmers led by the state president of Desiya Thennindhiya Nadhigal Inaippu Sangam, PAyyakannu. RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangam (BKS) state spokesman N Veerasekaran suggested the Centre take the views of farmers to enact a new law on agriculture. In Madurai, farmers burst fireworks and distributed ladoos at Melur while DYFI distributed sweets at Kalavasal. Madurai district farmers association president S P Elangovan said this was only a partial victory for them as the government had not said anything about the MSP for their produce or privatisation of electricity, which too had been the major demands of the farmers. In a statement, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Dr N Jegatheesan said the implementation of the three laws would have eliminated the govt’s role. Agriculture produce purchases and storage in private hands would have led to farmers being dependent on the private sector due to unlimited storage. Goods would be hoarded and artificial famine would occur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-rejoice-rue-loss-of-lives-during-protests/articleshow/87807596.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Link roads to ease traffic congestion||COIMBATORE: The city corporation has prepared a detailed project report to construct link roads at five places at a cost of Rs 144.80 crore using the infrastructure and amenities fund. The estimate has been prepared for five separate packages. “The works include acquisition and purchase of small land parcels. For instance, the link road near the Fun Mall from Avinashi Road can be connected to Masakalipalayam Road and from there to Kamaraj Road if a small piece of private land is purchased. The road will pass through the 5th Street on PPC Colony to connect Masakalipalayam. It can ease traffic congestion on Avinashi Road, particularly when the flyover work reaches advanced stages. It is estimated that Rs 18.59 crore is required to provide the link,” a corporation official said. Similarly, a link road can be formed to connect Anna Nagar Road from Avinashi Road in ward number 56 if a small portion of land at Varadaraja Mill is acquired. The project is proposed at a cost of Rs 55.54 crore. A link road has been proposed at Rs 45.62 crore to connect Puliakulam Main Road and Rajiv Gandhi Nagar Road in wards 65 and 66. A road project at a cost of Rs 19.87 crore proposes to link Aishwariya Nagar in ward 15 and Maruthamalai Road. Another road linking Nava India-Avarampalayam Road-SNR College Road has been proposed at a cost of Rs 5.18 crore. More than 100 scheme roads were marked in the detailed development plan to developed by the local planning authority decades ago, said R Raveendran of the Residents of Awareness Association of Coimbatore (Raac). “But they never materialised and as a result, many areas in the city have lost crucial links. A commuter should be able to travel in the city without touching the Avinashi Road, Trichy Road and Sathy Road to bring down traffic congestion in the key roads. It requires smaller rings roads within the city, which can be provided by developing link roads. The projects proposed by the corporation is a first step towards it,” he said. The DPR and estimate will be sent to the principal secretary of housing and urban development through commissioner of municipal administration. Works will be carried out after approval is obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/link-roads-to-ease-traffic-congestion/articleshow/87807595.cms||V Devanathan

The Union government announced a special package to AP in lieu of SCS. Though the Union government said SCS is not being given to any state in the country, it is being extended to north eastern states from time to time, claimed Rama Rao.

---||Meerut||How powerful khaps stood behind farmers, aided agitation||MEERUT/MUZAFFARNAGAR: Since September last year when farmers started their protests against the Centre’s new agricultural laws, the powerful khaps -- not only of western UP but also Punjab and Haryana – have been the lifeline of the agitation. They have come together to share the same platform with the single aim to provide full support, from sending tractor trolleys for transport to arranging funds and food round the clock. These khaps ensured that there was no slackness in logistical support at the Delhi borders. In fact, khap leaders kept urging families to make adequate food and shelter arrangements for the agitating farmers at various protest sites. Baba Surajmal of Batisa Khap in west UP said in Shamli on Friday, "No war can be won without logistical support. Khaps have been the lifeline of this movement. After all, it's a matter of sustenance for farmers, and khaps should not be seen as separate from farmers." Jitender Singh Huda of Huda khap, also in Shamli, added, "What RSS is to the BJP, the khap is to the farmers’ movement. It will not be an exaggeration to say that khaps have been the backbone of the agitation, and this bending of the government has rejuvenated them." On September 5 this year, the massive mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar witnessed the unified face of major khaps of western Uttar Pradesh that resolved to "hurt BJP's prospects in the forthcoming assembly elections in the state". Bahawadi Shyam Singh, a Gathwala khap leader who presided over the mahapanchayat, had then said, "The massive participation of Punjab and Haryana farmers, and with considerable representation from states such as Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, has galvanized the peasant community of UP against the farm laws and this fire will spread in entire UP now. The farmer will immensely hurt the BJP with his vote.” Head of Baghpat’s Desh khap, one of the biggest khaps in the region, Chaudhary Surender Singh had gone to the extent of asking local BJP MLAs and MPs to “tender their resignations and stay home”. “They (politicians) have come to power with the help of farmers’ votes, they will need the votes again. Sab hisaab rakha jaayega (everything will be accounted for)." Surender Singh, accompanied by hundreds of farmers, also carried food from Baghpat to the Delhi border in January. Now, more than two months after the September mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnager, these leaders are all smiles following PM Narendra Modi’s announcement that the farm laws would be repealed. They feel that their support to the cause has resulted in a "historic win”. Naresh Tikait, head of the Balyan khap whose outfit Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) led the agitation in UP, said in Sisauli (Muzaffarnagar), "Repealing of the farm laws has saved the honour of farmers. Khaps have played a major role in this achievement. This agitation has united the khaps like never before. All our differences have been ironed out and we stand unitedly behind farmers who have seen much exploitation and neglect in the recent past.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-powerful-khaps-stood-behind-farmers-aided-agitation/articleshow/87806096.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||Pune: 2 senior Ratnakar Bank officials held in Rs 30 lakh bribery case||PUNE: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a regional head of the agri division of the Ratnakar Bank Limited branch in Ahmedabad and its recovery head in Pune in a Rs30 lakh bribery case on Friday. The probe agency said the duo had demanded Rs1 crore for issuing a valuation certificate to the complainant, who along with his 12 family members had applied for an agri term loan. The application was made under the development of commercial horticulture through production and post-harvest management of the horticulture scheme of the National Horticulture Board, for which the government gives 50% of the total project cost limited to Rs56 lakh per project. Due to the non-availability of subsidy, all the agri term loans of the complainant and his family members became non-performing assets (NPAs) and for availing subsidy, a valuation certificate for mortgaged properties was required, the CBI said. “The bribe was settled for Rs30 lakh on negotiation. CBI laid a trap and caught Nimesh Manger, the regional head of the bank, for demanding and accepting the bribe of Rs30 lakh. Later, Saurabh Bhasin, the bank’s recovery head in Pune was also caught. Searches were conducted at five locations including at Ahmedabad, Pune, Delhi at the office and residential premises of both accused,” a release issued by the probe agency stated. “CBI Pune unit was also involved in the operation and arrested Bhasin from his residence in the city around 3pm. He will be produced before the court on Saturday,” said a senior CBI official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-senior-ratnakar-bank-officials-held-in-rs-30-lakh-bribery-case/articleshow/87806923.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Low-pressure and irregular water supply hits Shivajinagar residents||PUNE: Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole and local corporators on Thursday told the civic administration that low-pressure, irregular water supply was inconveniencing residents of the area. On Thursday, the elected representatives held meeting with officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s water supply department and sought urgent solutions. Shirole said he received feedback from residents of various localities during recent visits. “We got to know from citizens that the housing societies in Shivajinagar Gaothan, Apte Road, Prabhat Road, Bhandarkar Road have been receiving low-pressure, irregular supply, while slum pockets like Janwadi, Wadarwadi and Pandavnagar get water at odd hours. Residents say the problems have amplified in the past few years,” Shirole said. Corporators said the residents have complained that the water distribution schedule is not followed properly, often causing shortage. Shirole also said he had seen during his visits that public toilets were getting inadequate water and that the quality of cleaning needs to be improved. “We have discussed all these issues with the water supply department and have asked for concrete solutions. There is a need to increase supply from overhead water tanks as well as coordinated efforts to supply water from SNDT water works and Chatushrungi water works,” he said. Vilas Naik, a resident of Gokhalenagar, said that the area should get water in morning hours at adequate pressure. Residents of Shivajinagar police line said they want the authorities to boost daily supply in the area, while people from Khairewadi and Khilarewadi urged the administration to supply water at adequate pressure. PMC officials said area-wise plans will be chalked out to resolve the issues. “We will be following up the complaints raised by the elected representatives and will come out with a plan. Some issues will require longer planning,” PMC officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-pressure-and-irregular-water-supply-hits-shivajinagar-residents/articleshow/87806929.cms||---
---||Delhi||Repeal of farm laws: All smiles at Tikri border, farmers say they aren’t going anywhere, yet||NEW DELHI: Almost a year after farmers began their protest against the three agri laws, there were smiles all around at Tikri border on Friday. The protesters, however, maintained that they would stay put at the site till the laws were taken back officially in Parliament. “Gurupurab is a bigger celebration for us than the Prime Minister’s announcement. In the past, too, several promises were made but not kept. We will believe the government when the laws are actually taken back. We are happy, but there are issues to be addressed. We have other demands too,” said Ruldu Singh Mansa (70), national president, All India Kisan Mahasabha. Mansa added that while the farmers would go ahead with their proposed march to Parliament on November 29, they would meet before that to decide their future course of action. On Friday afternoon, celebrations were already on for gurupurab and children were singing songs on the stage. Several farmers then spoke about the PM’s announcement. Amrita Kundu (35), a member of Mahila Kisan Committee, said, “Until the laws are withdrawn in Parliament, we can’t be sure of the next step. There are issues that need to be addressed, such as MSP and electricity bill.” Many protesting farmers were seen dancing to the beats of dhol and langar with kheer was served to all. By noon, they dispersed to their tents and trolleys like usual. While some said it was a surprise, a handful said they had expected it. Mansa was onboard a train when he got a call from a mediaperson informing him about the development. “I had gone home for two days to prepare for the upcoming events. My phone started ringing in the morning and has not stopped till now. We are happy, but the movement will continue as other issues have not been addressed,” he added. Advocate Amarveer Singh Bhullar, who has been fighting cases for the farmers, said, “This move was made out of the blue. The PM is still not acknowledging the fact that farmers across the country were united over this. At least the PM accepted that we are farmers, else we were given multiple names, right from being terrorists to Khalistanis and what not.” Baldev Singh Sandoha, Bathinda district president, BKU, said, “The laws should be taken back in the same way they were brought. Until the authorities sit with our leaders and listen to our issues, we are not moving out of here. It’s sad that so many farmers lost their lives for this announcement to be made. We hope the government thinks about them too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-all-smiles-at-tikri-border-farmers-say-they-arent-going-anywhere-yet/articleshow/87807615.cms||Sakshi Chand

All of us in the Congress party had been opposing the laws. For a year now, we have witnessed farmers’ Satyagraha and their martyrdom. Today, the Centre learnt a great lesson that in democracy, one cannot impose decisions just by the virtue of absolute majority (of numbers),” Tharoor told a gathering at Murhu block in Khunti district. He further said, “One should understand that no matter how great the majority is, one has to bow down before the will of the public. Tharoor, who is the national president of Jharkhand Professional’s Congress Committee, is in Jharkhand for a two-day visit and he landed in Ranchi on Thursday evening. On Friday morning, he inaugurated a library in Murhu block, along with a skill development center. In his address, Tharoor harped on the need to develop reading habits and the need for libraries. “Books broaden the mind and open new dimensions of thinking. I urge the people of Murhu to read books at the library and also, take the books home for reading. Jharkhand Professionals’ Congress Committee is building a skill development center here for the farmers and it will be ready when I visit next time,” Tharoor said.

---||Ranchi||Maoists call for three-day bandh in four states||Ranchi: Banned CPI Maoists have extended three-day bandh call beginning November 23 in four states — Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh — to protest against the arrest and alleged torture of Politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, his wife Central Committee member Sheela Marandi and four others of the outfit. The Maoists also protested the killing of 26 “unarmed revolutionaries” in Gadhchiroli in Maharashtra on November 13 and expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers on Delhi borders. The time when the press statement was issued, the Centre was yet to announce recalling the contentious farm laws. Bihar Jharkhand North Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh Simant Regional Committee (BJNCUP-SRC), a Maoist unit under the Eastern Regional Buro of the ultra-leftist party, has described the arrest of Kishan Da and Sheela Di as an act of deceit by insiders. “75-year-old Kishan Da and 65-year-old Sheela Di suffering from multiple ailments were undergoing treatment at an undisclosed shelter from where they were picked up in a joint operation of state police, CRPF, NIA and IB. They were tortured and when their physical condition deteriorated, they were shown to be arrested in transit,” Maoist spokesperson, Manas claimed. Admitting that the arrest of tall leaders of the outfit is an achievement for the Centre and the state government, Maoists have described it as a momentary loss for the revolution. The BJNCUP-SRC in a press communique have shared a brief history of their politburo member who started as a student leader of Communist party of India in the 1960s. “Kishan Da later joined comrade Kanhai Chatterjee (KC) to propagate Mao Zedong ideology. He played a key role in the Naxalbari uprising of 1967 under comrade Charu Mazumdar and later went to Assam to spread communist ideology under guidance of comrade KC. He later came to undivided Bihar and remained active in Dhanbad, Hazaribag and Giridih. He led from the front in adjoining states of Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Tripura,” the statement read. The Maoists have also credited Kishan Da of supporting separate Jharkhand movement and charting out a detailed strategy with Marxist Coordination Committee (MCC) leader A K Rai and Kanhai Chatterjee with the slogan – Jharkhand ko laalkhand me badal dalo (convert Jharkhand into a red zone) to envision a nationwide adoption of communism, starting from Jharkhand. The outfit has also underlined Kishan Da’s role in bringing two revolutionary streams — Marxist Communist Center of India (MCCI) and CPIML-People’s War (PW) under the umbrella of unified CPI (Maoist) in 2004 and supervise the formation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the country. “He neither had a friend nor an enemy in his personal life. Kishan Da was dedicated to the cause of establishing neo-democracy on the foundations of socialism,” Manas said. The banned outfit has also appreciated contribution of Sheela Marandi in organising the women power in the party. “She joined as a child and completed her education within the party. She later founded Nari Mukti Sangh and paved the way for induction of women in the party. It was because of her contribution and dedication that she rose to the level of Central Committee Member (CCM),” Manas said. The outfit has appealed to the administration to treat both the top leaders as political prisoners and ensure their safety, medical care and proper treatment in captivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-call-for-three-day-bandh-in-four-states/articleshow/87806547.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Among the many inspired hands are textile artists Gaurang Shah and Lavina Baldota who recreated these paintings on khadi sarees which are currently on exhibit at the Durbar Hall in Laxmi Vilas Palace. Titled Santati, the exhibition displays a variety of Varma’s paintings on Jamdani sarees and the project, presented by Abheraj Baldota Foundation, is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation and Raja Ravi Varma, the father of modern Indian art. Twenty artists have recreated Varma’s paintings on the Jamdani sarees through intricate Jamdani hand-weave and yarns dyed in over 600 shades of vegetable dye. Each saree took anything between six months and two years to weave. Santati was unveiled on October 1, 2021 at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. “The textile industry of India and the expertise in the field were major reasons for the prosperity of the country in the ancient era. But under the colonial rule, the British destroyed the textile industry in India. Under Gandhi’s Swadeshi movement, khadi production was encouraged, enabling Indians to regain their confidence and dignity through self-reliance,” Shah said and added that these hand-woven khadi sarees are his tribute to Gandhi’s philosophy. It showcases the potency of Khadi in its journey from looms to luxury, he added. Radhikaraje Gaekwad, member of the royal Gaekwad family, too caught a glimpse of the artistic sarees on Friday. “Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad had opened Durbar Hall to people to see an exhibition of Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings 130 years ago. And after years, Varma’s paintings are on display here. Women weavers are usually not seen so it is good to see them being trained and getting opportunity,” Gaekwad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/varmas-paintings-recreated-on-jamdani-khadi-sarees/articleshow/87806831.cms||---

Their families must be given jobs and the cases and FIRs filed against them must be withdrawn at once,” Soren tweeted. In a series of tweets in the morning, Soren also demanded Rs 10 lakh for each farmer who took part in the protests and the immediate resignation of Tomar. He also mocked BJP and called the announcement a laughing stock. “The PM announced to withdraw the black farm laws this morning. The whole announcement is a laughing stock. Now, the entire BJP machinery will jump into promoting the idea that the PM is a well-wisher of the farmers,” he wrote. Congress hailed the announcement as a victory for the party’s stand and the farmers. “The PM had to relent before the will of the Congress party and the farmers, and we are happy about it. The victory shows that our country does not tolerate dictatorship and that democracy is still alive,” Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur told TOI.

JMM also claimed that the Centre has now turned its attention towards the country’s Adivasis and Moolvasis. “By bringing in the forest regulatory authority, they are planning to throw out the tribals from the forests and hand over vast swathes of land to their corporate friends,” Bhattacharya added. The Left parties took out a victory march in Ranchi to celebrate the announcement and distributed sweets to the passers-by. “It is a victory for democracy and a victory of the farmers, students, workers and the intellectuals of the country,” CPI’s state secretary Ajay Singh said. CPM’s state secretary Prakash Viplav said, “This will go down in India’s history as a significant movement. More than 750 farmers died and the Union government left no stones unturned to disrupt the movement. The farmers will retreat from Delhi’s borders only after the laws are withdrawn in Parliament as announced by Modi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-seeks-rs-rs-5cr-each-for-deceased-farmers/articleshow/87806422.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand Mukti Morcha threatens economic blockade against Tatas||JAMSHEDPUR: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Friday threatened to set up an economic blockade against Tata Steel, Tata Motors and other functional units of the Tata Sons if the conglomerate doesn’t agree to their demands within 20 days. Days after leading protests against the Tata Cummins’ proposal to shift its tax jurisdiction to Pune from Jharkhand, JMM lawmakers from Kolhan division warned the conglomerate of the blockade if they did not pay heed to the party’s demands, which includes shifting the headquarters of Tata Cummins to Jamshedpur and hiring adivasi and moolvasi workers in 75% of all its total vacancies. "We are giving a 20-day ultimatum to the Tata group to fulfill our demands, else the party will be compelled to launch economic blockade," JMM’s Ghatshila MLA Ramdas Soren said. The MLA further said that the decision was taken in a meeting of eight JMM lawmakers from Kolhan division on Thursday. At the meeting, which was chaired by JMM vice-president and state transport minister Champai Soren, it was agreed that the raw materials will not be allowed into the factories and finished goods won’t be let out in the economic blockade. “All Tata group companies that are operating in Kolhan, including Tata Steel and Tata Motors, will face economic blockade,” Ramdas said. Champai has also been nominated to speak with chief minister Hemant Soren and seek his intervention into the matter. Speaking to TOI on Friday, Champai said: “The purpose of the agitation is to make sure that the factories operating here should have its corporate office at the same place and adivasis and moolvasis get priority in employment.” He added: "Since we are in the government, it is our responsibility to secure the future of adivasi and moolvasi boys and girls.” While the conglomerate remained silent on the issue, a senior official on anonymity said: "Tata Sons will look into the matter as it is an issue concerning the group.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jmm-threatens-eco-blockade-against-tatas/articleshow/87806485.cms||B Sridhar

Keeping Covid protocols in mind, thousands of Sikhs took part in the birth anniversary function of their first guru, Guru Nanak ji at different gurdwaras. This is the second year, nagar kirtan, which usually traverses through the length and breadth of the Steel City, was not taken out as no confirmation was received from the administration in this connection. Prabhat pheris were taken out by individual gurdwaras in various parts of the city and other areas. Such processions were confined to nearby areas only. Head of Telco gurdwara, Gurmeet Singh, said “akhand paath” and “kirtan” were organised on the occasion, so was “langar” (community kitchen). Women from Thursday were actively taking part to ensure smooth running of the langar. They are following the Covid guidelines formulated by the government while working in the langar, said sources. Many gurdwaras have tweaked their programmes and functions so that the guidelines are followed. Breaking the 20-year-old tradition of holding langar in the evening, Hume Pipe road gurdwara organised it just after noon. On the occasion of Kartik Purnima, a large number of people took a dip in Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers in the city. After taking a holy dip, people distributed clothes, foodgrains and money among the poor at river ghats. Special prayers were offered on this occasion by the devotees. Meanwhile, medical experts have expressed concern over the rise in Covid cases in the district, especially in city areas. On Thursday, the number of positives was 10 and all the cases were from Jamshedpur, 129 days after 10 cases were reported in the district on July 12. Sources said 2,666 people were tested on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/gurparav-kartik-purnima-celebrated-in-steel-city-with-covid-rules-in-mind/articleshow/87806585.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand government schools’ timing changed to improve education quality||RANCHI: The time table of state-run schools has been changed in order to give the teachers sufficient enough number of hours for ‘imparting quality education to the students’. As per the notification issued by the school education and literacy department earlier this month, the new school hours will be from 9am to 3pm between July 1 and March 31 and from 7am to 1pm between April 1 and June 30. Earlier, the timings were from 8am to 2pm between July 1 and October 31, 9am to 3pm between November 1 and March 31 and from 6:30am to 11:30am between April 1 and June 30. “Clear-cut instructions have been issued for ensuring quality education for students. The regional joint director of the department will be responsible for implementing the order in the districts,” state education secretary Rajesh Sharma said. According to the order, Saturdays will be full working days with the second, fourth and fifth Saturdays being used for teaching solely and the second halves of first and third Saturdays being used for extracurricular activities, quiz and music. The move aims to achieve 200 days and 800 hours of teaching for students of classes 1 to 5 and 220 days and 1,000 hours for classes 6 to 8. Earlier, it had come to the department’s notice that the minimum number of teaching hours were not being utilised due to various external factors, including the teachers’ being involved in non-teaching-related work, like polio vaccination-related work and in population census, for instance. Also, some schools did not follow the official time table which also resulted in the lack of utilisation of the minimum number of hours. Now, as per the current order, other departments can engage the teachers in non-teaching-related work only after obtaining the education secretary’s permission. Sharma said that teachers should only be appointed as booth-level officers during elections only if the number of employees assigned for poll-related work from other government departments is falling short of the requisite number. The order further stated that teachers need to stay back for an hour after classes are dismissed for completing non-teaching-related work and for fulfilling the responsibilities of the management committee. Besides the teachers’ involvement in other work, what was also hampering the quality of education was the fact that schools would often remain shut for around 70-75 days in a year due to various reasons, like harsh climatic conditions and festivals, even though the education directorate has approved only 60 days of holiday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-schools-timing-changed-to-improve-education-quality/articleshow/87806470.cms||---

He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today". Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur from Melbourne after his graduation and joined the stir. "Our blood and sweat has paid off," his grandfather said. On Republic Day last year, 75-year-old Hardip Singh Dibdiba had cried himself to sleep. He remembers that evening as if it was yesterday. The apple of his eye, his grandson Navreet, just 25 and back home from Australia after his marriage in that country to a girl he knew, had been killed during violent protests against the farm laws in Delhi, reports Kanwardeep Singh. "There was darkness in our house, in fact in the whole of Dibdiba (a small village in Rampur), he said. "People loved Navreet. He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today. I miss him so much." Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur in UP from Melbourne after completing his graduation in commerce from a university there. He dived headlong into the farmers' agitation. His wife, Mansweet Kaur, 22, stayed back in Australia to finish her masters. She had told him she would join him later. After Navpreet died, the cause of his death mired in conspiracy theories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/granddad-in-up-mourns-farmer-killed-on-jan-26/articleshow/87809181.cms||---

Nishu, now 23, had taken leave from studies to till the land vacated by the menfolk in her family as they sat in dharna at the Ghazipur border. On Friday, as the government proclaimed the nullification of the laws that led to the agitation, Nishu had an announcement of her own to make. She would head back to her classroom. "I am relieved," she said. "Education is important too." Nishu will now be able to complete her post-graduation in physical education from her college in Dehradun. PM Narendra Modi's early morning declaration had taken her by surprise on Friday. "I was preparing to go out to our fields. But we heard the news and huddled back in. Later, we took time off, the women in the family, to celebrate. Papa joined us in the afternoon. It was like a festival. It is a great achievement."  Her mother added, "Modi ji took a year (to take this decision) but at least he listened to us. So, thank you. We are now more than happy to take care of our kitchens as our men will return to the fields." Choudhary, 58, beamed like a baby. "I have four children. Since childhood, Nishu used to accompany me to the fields. When I along with my two sons went to Ghazipur, she held the reins and did a great job. With her and the other women around, I never had to worry about my crops."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-who-tilled-fields-will-now-return-to-college/articleshow/87809183.cms||Sandeep Rai

None of the visits lasted more than three-four days,” said Ravindra Daurleya, a 78-year-old farmer from Meerut who came to the UP Gate protest site in the first week of December last year and has stayed at the spot since then. “This is a do-or-die battle. If we do not fight today, our children will have no future. I was convinced the farm laws were not good for us, so I was determined to see this through. I’m happy that the protests have reached their logical end,” the farmer told TOI, hours after the PM announced on Friday morning that the three agriculture laws will be repealed. During his time at UP Gate, Daurleya developed a special bond with Sheru, a stray who was his constant companion. “Sheru stayed with me all these months and even slept with me in my tent,” he said. Daurleya is one of the few protesters who have been consistently present at UP Gate since November 26 last year, the day the agitation began. They have braved the winter chill, summer heat and the rains to stay put at the protest site with a steely resolve. Ram Kumar Sharma, a farmer from west UP who has been staying in Nithari for the past few years, was a permanent fixture too. “I have been part of the protests since November last year. I am entrusted with the responsibility of attending to the kitchen and distributing food to farmers, which I am doing till this day and will continue doing till the protest is officially called off,” he said. Ramesh Malik, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar’s Kazi Khera, said, “My wife Nira can now heave a sigh of relief. It seems like ages since I’ve been home, but this place has become a second home to me. I had even started growing vegetables by the side of the expressway.” Pintu Biswas from Ghazipur, who is another familiar face at the protest site, had initially come to lend support to the agitation but ended up opening a stall for daily items to cater to the farmers’ needs. “I realised that farmers had to go a long way to buy things in the winter, so I decided to set up a stall where I sold towels and other items. Later, demand grew and I started offering Tikait caps, T-shirts and badges at a reasonable rate. I contributed to the farmers’ cause in whatever little way I could,” said Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/foot-soldiers-who-stayed-put-at-up-gate-for-a-year/articleshow/87808249.cms||Abhijay Jha

Dull as the November sky, it was to be another eventless day for the vanguard with their heels and tents dug in as the battle of attrition with the Centre moved towards an important landmark - a week from now, the protest against the three new farm laws on Delhi's borders will turn a year old. Then, the mobile phones started ringing. One of the first to get the morning's biggest "breaking news" was Bijender Singh, a farmer from UP's Ghazipur district who was in his tent, yet to start his day. At the other end, his son was screeching. "Krishi kanoon wapas le rahe hain (the farm laws are being repealed). Modi ne announce kiya (Modi has announced)," he told a stunned Singh. "I couldn't believe my ears," Singh told TOI. "I cross-checked and when I was convinced that what my son was saying was true, I rushed out to inform others." Soon after, the celebrations began. The sizzle ofjalebis in the langar, a round of crackers, a group dance, bellows of triumph and excited phone calls to family followed. Some drove along the protest site loudspeakers blazing till the border where they were stopped and turned back by Delhi Police. "This too will go soon," yelled a protester, pointing at the barricades. Through the nippy air and the acrid overhang of smog, the warm breeze of victory that swept into UP Gate on Friday when the PM announced that the farm laws would be repealed was lapped up by just 150-odd tired but beaming faces. With none of the farmer leaders around, the moment belonged to the footsoldiers. By afternoon, many of them were on national media, their faces lighting up newscasts on mobile screens as journalists outnumbered protesters at UP Gate. "Jeet" was the word on everyone's lips, but this was a bittersweet win, achieved through sacrifice and months of struggle through the turn of seasons, moods, opinions and politics Balwant Singh, a farmer from Shahjahanpur, said, "We will stay put at UP Gate till the time laws are repealed by Parliament because we can't trust it will happen till then." "A lot has gone into making this year-long protest a success. I remember the day Kashmir Singh from Bilaspur committed suicide at UP Gate (Jan 2). It shook me and others, but we remained determined and succeeded at last," said Manjeet Singh Atwal, a farmer from Uttarakhand. Others said a law on MSP and compensation forfamilies of farmers who died during the agitation remained unfulfilled demands that the Centre needed to respond to. Speaking to TOI over the phone, BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, "The battle is half won. Apart from the repeal of the farm laws, we also want a guarantee on MSP. The agitation has seen so many farmers losing their lives at the protest sites in the past year and we demand that their families get compensation." At the protest site, though, several farmers were relieved they could go back to their families, and not empty handed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-cheer-but-stir-to-continue/articleshow/87809229.cms||---

Sanjay K Jain, chairman, ICC Textile Committee, and past CITI chairman, told TOI that through a notification on November 18, the GST has gone up from 5% to 12% in a lot of textile items, including garments below Rs 1000. Garments over Rs 1,000 already attracts a GST of 12%. “Now, poor consumers will pay 7% extra for their clothing, adding fuel to the inflation. The price of cotton and cotton yarn has already gone up by 25% in recent times. GST in yarn is 5% so input tax credit (ITC) in this case would not help,” he added. According to Jain, the total garments industry is worth Rs 10 lakh crore and out of this, Rs 8.5 lakh crore is from this segment. “MSMEs mainly supply low-end garments, so the reduction in consumption in that segment would be huge as this segment is more price elastic and more working capital requirements will put more nails in this struggling segment,” he added. Jain also argued that GST compliance had grown multifold in the unorganised segment of the industry as at 5% there was no financial gain in evading GST. “However, it is feared that at 12% the unorganized segment will once again go back to old days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/garments-below-rs-1k-to-cost-more-on-gst-jump/articleshow/87807340.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Now, highway contractor damages water pipeline at Peddem during shifting work||PANAJI: Parts of Bardez, including most areas of Mapusa town, went without water supply on Friday after the main pipeline for the area burst at Peddem. This is at least the fourth time in less than two years that the pipeline has suffered a damage as a result of work being carried out by the highway contractor. While on an earlier occasions the pipeline had burst when the highway expansion work was on, this time the rupture took place when the contractor was shifting it. Following repeated damages to the pipeline during the highway expansion work, the contractor had been asked to shift it further away, by the side of the road, to avoid further damage. The contractor had agreed and taken up this work recently. While this work was on on Thursday, around 5.30pm, the pipeline suffered a damage near the Peddem sports complex area. The pipeline is the main channel carrying water from the Assonora water treatment plant supplying treated water to Mapusa and surrounding areas. Huge quantities of water was seen gushing out as a result of the damage. PWD officials said that repair work was taken up immediately on Thursday evening. “Repair work began almost immediately. But to carry out the repairs, water supply has to be shut down and, after this, when water supply chain is put into motion again, there is a backlog in supply of almost 14 to 24 hours. Few hours are required for the pipeline to dry due after the repair,” an official said. Dismayed locals said that they have suffered frequently due to the pipeline bursts ever since the highway expansion work began. “We are already facing a water shortage, with supply provided for only a couple of hours every day. And every time a burst occurs the delay in restoring supply is often prolonged and longer than what is stated officially,” Mapusa resident Sonali Raikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-highway-contractor-damages-water-pipeline-at-peddem-during-shifting-work/articleshow/87807474.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws biggest gain for BJP, setback for ruling Congress in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: Pushed to a corner due to the ongoing agitation against three contentious farm laws for the last over one year, BJP is going to be the biggest gainer from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the Acts as its leadership would at least be able to reach out to the people in its preparations for the 2022 Punjab assembly polls. Though political observers feel that despite the announcement to repeal the laws, the saffron party cannot presume that the aggrieved farmers struggling for over a year would vote for them. “It is 100% advantage BJP. It does not mean that they will form the government in Punjab but at least they can step out to campaign now,” says Panjab University’s political science professor Ashutosh Kumar. The biggest loser from the decision would be the Congress as its main electoral campaign issue was “black farm laws” and many Hindu votes, which earlier used to go to the Congress could now come to BJP’s kitty. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma told TOI, “I don’t want to see this decision from a political point of view but it is obvious if there is a peaceful environment in the state and there is freedom of expression, it will be easy for us to convey our views.” Earlier, there used to be various hurdles not by the farmers but others in the guise of farmers, who wanted to further their political interest, he added. Asked about the possibility of again stitching an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) as Akalis’ biggest demand to repeal farm laws was now addressed, Sharma replied, “I don’t think so. Because we were very clear that farm laws were good for the farmers but we could not convince some farmers and therefore we decided to repeal the laws. But the SAD knew our vision very well and despite that they chose to break the alliance due to political considerations.” He added that earlier being in alliance with the SAD, their hands were tied and they also used to “face the wrath for the incompetence of the state government by just being 17% alliance partner”. But professor Ashutosh sees there is a possibility of BJP’s post-poll alliance with SAD because of the fluid political situation in the state this time. “As of now, BJP can have an alliance with Capt Amarinder Singh or the breakaway factions of the SAD or rebel leaders of various parties on the basis of their winnability to at least establish BJP in the state being a bigger alliance partner. “That is what they have been doing in many states where they were weak like in Assam and Tripura, and BJP has formed governments there,” he added. But he says that for a workable alliance with BJP, Amarinder would have to stick to a maximum of 20 to 25 assembly seats. At the same time, professor Ashutosh warns that one should not underestimate BJP as it has many silent Hindu and urban voters in Punjab as there are nearly 49% Hindus and among them Khatris, Aroras and Baniya have been with BJP and they are hardly concerned with the farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/repeal-of-farm-laws-biggest-gain-for-bjp-setback-for-ruling-congress-in-punjab/articleshow/87808018.cms||Sanjeev Verma

While demanding that the process be simplified, they also sought for monkeys to be declared as vermin. Sattari farmers said that allowing them to kill wild boars would help save 40% of their plantations. “We also want permission to kill monkeys, since they destroy 60% to 70% of our crops,” a farmer from Hedode-Sattari, Ashok Joshi said. He has been actively involved in the movement to declare some wild animals as vermin. Farmers said that monkeys cause greater damage than wild boars and that coconut production has declined drastically in Sattari mainly due to the monkey menace. The Goa government on Thursday issued a notification authorising the deputy conservator of forest to permit controlled killing of wild boars based on farmers’ complaints. Joshi said that while he welcomes the decision he is unhappy with the lengthy procedure. “I demand that the government give farmers direct licence to kill wild boars and monkeys without any procedure. Our plantations will be destroyed while we wait for the lengthy official process to be completed.” Another farmer from Sonal-Sattari, Ranjit Rane reiterated the demand for the procedure to be eased for farmers’ benefit. He added that they are also fed up with monkeys and bisons, who damage crops like coconut, banana, arecanut, etc. “They come in large numbers and we have had to face huge losses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-farmers-want-boar-culling-procedure-eased/articleshow/87807470.cms||Afaq Khan

Himachal Kisan Sabha claimed that the new farm laws were anti-farmer and made it clear that till the withdrawal of these laws through proper parliamentary process, the farmers will not end their struggle. At the same time, the Kisan Sabha made it clear that the struggle for the minimum support price (MSP) will continue. What will be the nature of the struggle and what will be the methods, it will be decided only after the guidelines of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, it added. Rakesh Singha, former general secretary of Himachal Kisan Sabha and CPIM MLA from Theog, said that the government had left no stone unturned to defame the farmers’ movement and a conspiracy was hatched to defame farmers by calling them a terrorist and Khalistani. He said that an attempt was made to divide farmers between Haryana-Punjab, Sikh-Jaat, rich farmer-poor farmer but the government finally had to kneel before the solidarity of the farmers. Singha said that farmers should not forget that the central government is the killer of about 700 farmers,, and farmers should unite and continue their fight for the remunerative price as per Swaminathan Commission report. State president of Himachal Kisan Sabha, Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, said that there are many issues of farmers in Himachal Pradesh on which farmers will have to fight on the lines of the national movement. He said that Himachal Pradesh is yet to get the MSP and the farmers are also deprived of the crops for which the minimum support price has been fixed. He said that regular mandis for the purchase of food grains have not yet been established in the state, and farmers of Kangra and Mand are facing the brunt of this. He said that on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir, the farmers of the state are asking for market intervention scheme (MIS ) for apples.

The middlemen take the benefit and the farmers suffer at present. It was a good law to eliminate this and bring the benefit to the farmer and the Prime Minister tried to convince them. But somehow they were not convinced. So the Prime Minister took back the decision. It is actually difficult to go back on a decision. But the Prime Minister with a big heart went back on it, keeping in mind the wishes of the farmers,” Tanavade said. The PM wanted the see that the farmers prosper. But some people and organisations succeeded in keeping the protest going and overpowering the voices in favour of the farm laws, the state BJP president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/farm-laws-pm-displayed-big-heart-says-tanavade/articleshow/87807503.cms||---
---||Goa||Fear of UP polls made Modi repeal farm laws, says oppn||Panaji: Terming it as a victory for farmers, all the opposition parties on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws is driven by fears of an electoral defeat. Welcoming the Prime Minister’s announcement, political parties said that it is time for BJP to start listening to the people. Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) said that Modi’s announcement sends a signal to the opposition that people’s power works. “BJP has feedback that they will lose the next round of elections very badly in five states, including Goa. It is the fear of losing elections that has impelled the Prime Minister to announce that he has decided to repeal the farm laws,” former Union finance minister and AICC senior election observer P Chidambaram said. Describing Modi as a “dictator in the garb of a democrat”, Chidambaram said that the move to repeal the three farm laws proves that in a healthy democracy, “consultation, discussion and parliamentary debate” is vital. Three weeks earlier, Modi in a speech in Uttar Pradesh said that anybody who opposes the farm laws is anti-national, they are speaking for big farmers and that they will never withdraw the farm laws. “For this stubborn government to today announce that they will repeal the farm laws means that they know that they are losing the next round of elections. This is a lesson for the people. This government does not fear democracy and Parliament. It fears losing elections,” Chidambaram said. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that repealing the three farm laws will be a victory for all people. “Even after being called terrorists and Maoists and subjected to inhumanly oppressive physical and mental force, our farmers have shown India and the world that the arrogance and tyranny of BJP can be and will be eradicated,” he said. He said that a similar unity is required to defeat BJP in Goa. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat also welcomed the Prime Minister’s statements. “After the most insensitive, irresponsible and failed BJP government at the Centre started feeling the heat of people’s anger, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he will withdraw the three anti-farmer laws. This is the beginning of the withdrawal of BJP from across India,” Kamat said. TMC MP Mahua Moitra said that all the opposition parties had consistently urged the Centre to take the laws back. “They criticised us saying that we are anti-national. So many farmers died. The farmers have been protesting for one-and-a-half years through summer and winter. Now when UP elections have come, their brain has started moving,” Moitra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fear-of-up-polls-made-modi-repeal-farm-laws-says-oppn/articleshow/87807510.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||TMC demands CBI & ED probe into CM Pramod Sawant's assets||PANAJI: Releasing documents to prove that chief minister Pramod Sawant has obtained a lease for a stone quarry at Dodamarg, Maharashtra, All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Directorate of Enforcement (ED) into Sawant’s assets. TMC questioned how Sawant was able to obtain a stone mining lease in November 2019. The allegations against Sawant were made by TMC Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra, who launched a two-pronged attack against the state BJP government. Moitra said that Sawant failed to restart mining operations in Goa and also failed to prevent diversion of water from the Mhadei basin by Karnataka. Citing a letter from the office of the deputy regional director of Maharashtra, dated November 7, 2019, Moitra said, “The letter clearly shows that Pramod Sawant, as the chief minister of Goa, got a mine in his name in Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra. But the big question is, where did he get the money to lease a mine?” Maharashtra’s directorate of geology and mining has granted Sawant permission to mine a 1.2ha stone quarry at Talekhol village in Dodamarg-Sindhudurg. “We demand a CBI and ED probe into the source of funds used by Pramod Sawant to secure the mine. I would also like the Prime Minister to order a disproportionate assets inquiry against Pramod Sawant,” she said. TMC said that Sawant managed to obtain a mine for himself, but has done little to restart Goa’s iron ore mines, which have been shut for three years. After taking over as the chief minister, Sawant had said that he will get mining started in three months, Moitra said. On the Mhadei water dispute, Moitra said that Karnataka has started diverting more water than the neighbouring state is supposed to. “Despite winning, most of the water from the basin has been diverted to Karnataka,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-demands-cbi-ed-probe-into-cms-assets/articleshow/87807516.cms||---

Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry conference on Nautical Tourism, Naik said that tourism and hospitality sectors are expected to “definitely rebound to the pre-Covid levels in the next two-three years. “There is a need for Goa to focus on nautical tourism as the way forward,” said Naik. “Goa has a great potential to become a natural marine hub and cater to these high-end tourists on sailing boats.” CII aims to push nautical tourism in Goa in order to give a boost to Goa’s revenue and employment. Panelists at the conference spoke about developing Goa as a home base for cruise vessels, which would lead to the development of ancillary services and attract cruise vessels to the state. Industry stakeholders agreed that this proposition was achievable for Goa but it requires the concerted efforts to improve infrastructure and the regulatory environment. Chairman in charge, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) Jayant Singh said that an accommodative regulatory stance can help drive nautical tourism not just in Goa, but across the country. Tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar urged local barge operators to explore the possibility of converting barges into floating restaurants and to hold events. “There are many people who have become jobless and there are lots of barges lying unutilised and getting rusted. Also we are trying to work out a strategy or a scheme whereby these barges can be utilised for floating events, which will be a new tourism product,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pandemic-blow-blunted-due-to-domestic-tourism-shripad/articleshow/87807525.cms||---

Meena said that he was posted to Goa at the height of the pandemic. He also said that Goa police force faces a shortage of manpower as well as vehicles and modern equipment. Meena will be replaced by I D Shukla. “It was very challenging to work here. I came when the Corona pandemic was at its peak. Policemen were deployed everywhere at the borders and in crowded places and we helped control this pandemic. We have taken action against those violating the guidelines and instructions of the government,” Meena said. He said he has worked during his short tenure in Goa to resolve some long-standing issues. “It is the duty of police officials to take measures for the welfare of the police department. When I joined, I was asked what will you do about promotions. So whenever vacancies were there, I filled them up. At least 1,500 promotions we could give, up to the rank of sub-inspector and inspector,” he said. Meena was posted in Goa for barely sixteen months. “For promotions up to DySP level, the matters are in the final stage. I could take it up with the government vigorously. I have written several letters. We have had several meetings. The matters will be resolved very soon. I hope the government will respond positively to the request of police headquarters,” Meena said. He said the department also faces a shortage of vehicles to carry out patrolling and is also in need of new recruits. “We have taken measures to expedite recruitment as there is shortage of manpower in Goa. Around 2,000 vacancies have been advertised. We have already got sanction for equipment. I have again written asking for 67 vehicles, which are required.,” Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-stint-was-challenging-due-to-pandemic-meena/articleshow/87807560.cms||---

Goa moved from the seventh position in the SDG India Index for 2019 to third place in the third edition of the SDG India Index for 2020–21. Stating that 60 panchayats of the state have implemented the second phase of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), Sawant said the stress has been on creating awareness on water and sanitation. As the state has already been declared as ODF, Phase II lays stress on solid and liquid waste management (SLWM), dry waste management and faecal sewage management. “After ‘har ghar nal’ (tap water to every house), we have now given water testing kits to seven to eight panchayats and trained people to test water (from water bodies) on and equal number of parameters. If the water sample doesn’t pass the test on those parameters, they can complain to the PWD. We are thereby attempting to provide potable purified water,” Sawant said. He said that the government was working at constructing sewerage treatment plants in rural areas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/working-to-top-niti-aayogs-devpt-goals-index-says-sawant/articleshow/87807554.cms||---
---||India||In a first, IITs to hire quota-based faculty||MUMBAI: For the first time since they were set up, IITs have placed advertisements for quota-based hiring of faculty members. The recruitment process, for which IITs had autonomy, has been changed at the behest of the Centre and new deadlines set. Since 2019, the education ministry (then called HRD ministry) has been pushing centrally funded higher education institutions to apply the reservation policy in hiring. This time around, the IITs have deferred to the ministry. Advertisements are out for hiring SC/ST/OBC/ EWS faculty members at all institutes, including IITs. A letter issued by the education ministry in Augustend insists that reservation rules be adhered to and vacancies “especially in the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes” be filled by September 4, 2022. IITs follow a year-long rolling recruitment process and never before has a deadline been set by the ministry. IITs ought to be exempted from reservation: PanelThe time limit poses difficulties due to the paucity of engineering doctoral candidates, more so from the SC/ST/OBC categories — a PhD is the minimum eligibility criterion. Usually in a year, the IITs in metros manage to hire about 35 faculty members, 40 in a good year. “Filling up hundreds of vacancies will be impossible,” said a director. While some institutes have advertised vacancies for a number of specific positions, others have enlisted all the departments where there is at least one unfilled post. “Each IIT has followed its own process. We are all recruiting under the mission mode. But while IIT Bombay has advertised for 50 positions, IIT Madras has advertised for 49. Others like IIT Delhi, Roorkee, Hyderabad, Kharagpur have enlisted departments where there are vacancies,” said a dean (faculty). All advertisements encourage women from the disadvantaged background to also apply. In June 2020, a committee set up to suggest implementation of reservation in central education institutes had said the IITs are institutes of national importance and ought to be exempted from reservation. It said the matter of reservation be left to each IIT’s board and if quota in hiring was to be implemented, the posts of professor and assistant professor be exempted. However, that report is gathering dust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-iits-to-hire-quota-based-faculty/articleshow/87809334.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The leaders will now have to see the modalities of how the protesters are to be dispersed. We are happy that this decision has come on such an auspicious day,” said Harvinder Singh, president of the Gurudwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha at Betim. Devotees from various parts of the state were seen attending the event, offering their respects to their leader, Guru Nanak. “We give him the status of a living God and wanted to be a part of the ‘guru janam din’. Though we did pay our respects at the gurudwara in Betim, we visited Azad Maidan as well, because it is a day of double celebration,” Varsha Gopani said. The Sikh community on Friday observed the 552nd Guru Nanak Jayanti at Panaji by holding a kirtan and langar at the gurudwara. This was followed by a procession to Azad Maidan. “Due to the pandemic, we had restricted entries to the gurudwara last year. The idea to hold the event at Azad Maidan this year was to send a message across Goa that devotees can come here to pay their respect to the Guru Granth Sahib. The message of Guru Nanak must be spread throughout Goa,” Singh said. There were at least 2,000 people at the gurudwara who were allowed to enter in small batches throughout the day. Only 600 were allowed to attend the kirtan, while the rally was led by 250 people who were at Azad Maidan. “Everyone is equal and on a par at the gurudwara, so there is no restricted entry only for believers. We believe in the concept of one God and preach that. The rally was taken out to preach the sermons of Guru Nanak and spread the message of humanity,” treasurer of the gurudwara, Rupinder Singh Kher, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-guru-nanak-jayanti-sikhs-have-2-reasons-to-rejoice/articleshow/87807575.cms||Nida Sayed

Claiming that YSRCP leaders had made wild allegations against his wife, and the Speaker was not letting him make a point, Naidu vowed to step into the Andhra assembly again only after returning to office as CM. In an emotion-filled tone, Naidu vowed to step into the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly again only after returning to power. He wept before reporters, taking several seconds before speaking again. “I’ve never experienced such pain in my long political life,” he said. “So far, I’ve tolerated many insults in the assembly for the sake of the people. But they (YSRC) insulted my wife who sacrificed many things in her life to encourage my public service,” he added. YSRCP leaders said Naidu was smarting from the recent political defeats, having lost a number of bypolls and civic polls, and walked out because he felt embarrassed. They denied attacking his wife. Naidu also said Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, father of CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s, had also humiliated his mother in the assembly.

District officials urged stakeholders to go back to their homes, start a discussion on the salient features of the compensation offer and return to them if they needed clarification. Suri MLA and Birbhum zilla sabhadhipati Bikash Roy Chowdhury said the project once implemented would bring about a sea change in the district’s socio-economic life. “Don’t pay heed to misinformation,” he said. The district magistrate addressed questions and concerns from stakeholders over the job promise made in the compensation offer, apart from land price. At the meeting, Birbhum SP Nagendranath Tripathi said: “All possible arrangements have been thought of. Land survey has been completed and owners of land and properties have been identified so that no anomalies can happen in case of land ownership. A joint team has been formed to resolve any kind of dispute regarding ownership of land and other properties.” The DM also allayed fears over deforestation in the command area. “Afforestation will be done as per law to save nature,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/birbhum-dm-holds-stakeholders-meet-for-deocha-pachami-project/articleshow/87807924.cms||Someswar Boral

Hazari Mondal, from Chargheri of Lahiripur in Gosaba block, left for the Sunderbans forest with son Chitta and neighbour Subhash Mandal on Friday morning. They had anchored their boat on the river bank adjacent to the Jhila forest and were catching crabs when the tiger grabbed Hazari and tried to drag him deep into the forest with its paws, said local sources. Chitta and Subhash used a stick and crab-catching rope to fend the animal off but the big cat fought back, forcing the duo to beat a retreat. The tiger then dragged its prey into the forest. An overwhelmed and helpless Chitta and Subhash returned to their village, where a pall of gloom descended as the news spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tiger-drags-fisherman-away-into-sunderbans-forest/articleshow/87807910.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Can PM Modi give lives back, asks Cong||Kolkata: Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Hannan Mollah, who is a CPM politburo member, described PM Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal farm laws as “a historic victory for farmers”. But he was in no mood to end the agitation until the laws were repealed by Parliament. “It is indeed a historic victory for all of us. However, I am a bit cautious and unwilling to trust this government until and unless these three laws are scrapped on the floor of Parliament,” Mollah said. SKM, he added, would now press for a new law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, among other issues. “We saw how the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act was scrapped in 2014. But no fresh law has been promulgated yet,” Mollah said. West Bengal Pradesh Congress president and opposition leader in Parliament Adhir Chowdhury called the decision a “late realization after so many deaths”. He pointed out that the BJP government had to suspend the three laws’ implementation following a Supreme Court order. “The apex court had stalled their implementation for 18 months. The PM had to repeal the laws today or tomorrow. The difference with others is that he did it after muddying waters. This government has lost its credibility among people,” Chowdhury said. Left Front chairman Biman Bose hailed the protracted farmers’ agitation at the Singhu border. “More than a hundred farmers laid down their lives against the BJP bulldozing farmers with the three draconian farm laws. Can PM Modi give those lives back?” he said after taking out a rally in Jhargram. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra congratulated SKM and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee for their “magnificent victory”. He demanded that the state government should drop similar provisions in the amended state Act immediately. Coordination committee national secretary Avik Saha said the farmers’ victory was “incomplete”. “While the three farm laws are yet to be repealed in Parliament, the struggle for the legal guarantee of MSP for all produce, and the withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Act persists,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-pm-modi-give-lives-back-asks-cong/articleshow/87807929.cms||---
---||Kolkata||This is farmers’ victory, says Mamata Banerjee after repeal move||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday congratulated farmers “who fought relentlessly” against three contentious farm laws, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced their repeal by month-end. She also paid condolences to bereaved families who lost their dear ones in the prolonged agitation. The Trinamool Congress chief had sent party delegations to the Singhu border protest site time and again to show solidarity with the farmers’ cause. Taking to her Twitter handle immediately after the PM’s annoucement, Banerjee said: “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and was not fazed by the cruelty with which @BJP4India treated you. This is your victory. My deepest condolences to everyone who lost their loved ones in this fight.” In November 2020, the CM had written to PM Modi demanding repeal of the farm laws. In January this year, the West Bengal assembly passed a resolution against the laws. Banerjee had also penned a poem for the farmers, highlighting their pain and struggle. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee described the development as “more power to farmers” but linked the decision to “crucial assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, among other states”. He tweeted: “Their long and arduous struggle, their grit and determination against all adversities has shown @BJP4India their true place. This is the real power of dissent in a democracy and I salute each and every farmer for their courage.” Trinamool leaders said BJP could sense the ground under their feet slipping, especially in Punjab and UP, in the run-up to assembly polls. Senior Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said the Modi government had to bow down as it was “losing ground in north India”. “We supported the farmers’ protests. It took more than a year for the Modi government to bow down. There are political reasons,” he said. Party vice-president Yashwant Sinha said: “I attach no noble sentiment to the government for this move. It is a calculated step for the UP elections. For this government, democracy begins and ends with elections.” Trinamool leaders had been in touch with Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders since the beginning, raising the issue repeatedly in Parliament. Farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait and Yogendra Yadav had campaigned against BJP’s anti-farmer stance in the summer Bengal assembly polls. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Shekhar Roy said the repeal decision was a sign of BJP’s fear of defeat in upcoming elections to five states. “Farmers had announced sending representatives each day to Parliament. The decision shows the government is now scared of public outrage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-is-farmers-victory-says-mamata-after-repeal-move/articleshow/87807911.cms||---

India is set to play New Zealand in the third and final T20I of the bilateral series at Eden Gardens. This will be the biggest sporting event in the city, with spectators in stands since the pandemic started. Since March 2020, the city had witnessed only one sporting event with spectators in attendance when the Durand Cup final was played between Mohammedan SC and FC Goa in October. The last time a cricket match was played with spectators at Eden was in November 2019 when India played Bangladesh in their first pink ball day-night Test. "After such a long time, cricket is finally returning to our city and I don't want to miss watching it from the stands. I try to watch every game at Eden Gardens but this time I couldn't manage to buy tickets online. So, I am trying to get one somehow," said Mahipal Singh (34), a businessman, who scampered around searching for a ticket. Entrepreneur Gaurav Ghosh, was also among the fans scurrying for tickets. "I have been calling every friend and club officials begging for a ticket. I am willing to pay something extra, but so far I haven't been able to manage even one," said Ghosh, a Jadavpur resident. The Bengal government has allowed 70% spectator attendance at the ground considering the pandemic. The total capacity of Eden is 68,000. If operated on a 70% capacity range, there is space for 47,600. "Around 1,500 online tickets in the first lot were sold out in 15 minutes last Tuesday. The respective clubs have already picked up 30% of their reserved tickets and so have all life members and temporary members. We are going to have a packed stadium," said Srimanta Kumar Mallick, a CAB official.  The joy of getting a ticket was evident as 34-year-old private firm executive Arpan Mondal stood outside the stadium to collect tickets he had booked online. "It's going to be a historic event and I couldn't miss it at any cost. Over the last few months, I have been watching fans thronging stadiums outside India and missed being on the ground. I am glad I will be among the firsts in the city to be at the stadium again," said Mondal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-cricket-returns-to-eden-gardens-after-covid-break/articleshow/87809375.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The pantry car will continue to serve ready-to-eat (RTE) food items as well. The notification, signed by Railway Board executive director Vandana Bhatnagar, comes a day after TOI reported that hot meals would be back on track this month. “In view of this resurgence of rail travel and easing of Covid lockdown restrictions in eateries, restaurants, hotels and such other places across the country, it has been decided that service of cooked food be resumed and RTEs may also continue. Further, prepaid catering services with opt-out option wil be restored on premium trains,” the notification reads. The IRCTC has already started preparations to reopen its base kitchens. Sources said by next week, the railways subsidiary would likely restore its catering services on board trains like Rajdhani and Satabdi. Following a surge in Covid-19 cases in March 2020, the railways had stopped serving meals and offering bedrolls to passengers. Sources said it incurred losses to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore owing to the suspension of catering services. Friday’s notification stated that an assessment of passenger taste had shown marked preference for cooked meals. The survey suggested only 7-10% passengers bought RTE food while 40-70% asked for cooked meals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/railway-board-oks-return-of-cooked-meals-on-trains/articleshow/87807973.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 40km ‘safe route’ sends herd back to Bankura jungle||BURDWAN: Forest officials of five districts — along with road and railway authorities, police, panchayat members and villagers — created a 40km ‘green corridor’ for a herd of around 60 elephants that finally made its way to Bankura’s jungle in the small hours of Friday, a week after causing jumbo worries for farmers in Burdwan and its adjoining areas. Speaking to TOI, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Debal Roy said: “Between 3.40am and 4am, the elephants crossed Damodar river and safely reached Bankura’s forests.” The district forest departments of East and West Burdwan, Malda, Birbhum and Bankura had mobilised a team comprising four DFOs and several rangers, among others. The team was led by East Burdwan DFO Nisha Goswami. Officials said the 40km route covered the Howrah-Delhi main railway line, the NH-2, two PWD roads and four DVC canals, besides vast swathes of cultivated land across villages. Both railway and highway traffic was suspended to ensure safe passage. Additional principal chief conservator (Southeast Circle) Kalyan Das, who monitored herd movement for the past seven days and also supervised the day’s operation, said driving 60 elephants back to the forests of Bankura was a tall task. “The route is intersected by a busy railway line, a national highway and several canals. Then there are villages and agricultural land. It was a big challenge. We used GPS to map the safest possible corridor. A ranger was deployed at Asansol railway control room to stop train movement once the elephants reached the tracks,” Das said. Galsi OC Dipankar Sarkar said: “We stopped highway traffic near Simnori petrol pump in East Burdwan between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Thursday. All lights were switched off too to ensure the animals weren’t startled.” To make matters more difficult for the team, the herd had several calves, which slowed down its pace of movement. “Some elephants had again separated from the herd. We burnt red chillies; the thick smoke allowed us to herd them back together towards the forest,” Das added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/foresters-map-40km-safe-route-drive-jumbo-herd-back-to-bankura-jungle-after-a-week/articleshow/87807872.cms||Mohammad Asif

While the Centre recently resumed supplies to Covax, it is now also considering allowing commercial exports. The health ministry had given permission to Serum Institute to export one crore doses of Covishield through Covax. India has also resumed supplies to Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh and Iran, almost 8 months after it stopped exports. “Vaccine production is swiftly increasing. The country will soon have a surplus supply. What are we going to do with it if we do not allow exports?” the source said. Thirty crore doses have been delivered in November, whereas only 8.8 crore doses have been administered in the month so far. Bio E’s vax may come up for emergency-use nod in DecIn December, supplies are expected to increase further. Around 31 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin are scheduled to be received in December, while an additional two crore doses of Cadila Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D are also expected by the end of the year. Besides, new jabs like Biological E’s Corbevax are also expected to come up for emergency use authorisation in December. On the other hand, the consumption pattern is not expected to witness any significant rise with over 81% of the adult population already covered with at least first dose. This would also mean the demand for new vaccines will be very limited, unless they are approved and used as a third dose or for use in children. While vaccination is now largely driven by the coverage of the second dose, it will move according to schedule. Around 42% of the adult population in the country is now fully vaccinated with both doses. However, there is still a huge demand for the vaccines in the world, particularly for the jabs manufactured in India as they are likely to be far more cost-effective as compared to those available globally. “There are many countries that are waiting for vaccines. There are 195 countries in the world and only 40 of them have achieved 75% vaccination coverage,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-22cr-unused-doses-govt-may-allow-commercial-vaccine-exports/articleshow/87809601.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Victory comes at the cost of several lives’||KOLKATA: The civil society in Kolkata with intellectuals, activists and academicians, some of whom have spoken directly in favour of the farmers in the past one year and were in constant contact with leaders of various farmer organizations on Singhu border, have hailed the decision announced by PM Narendra Modi to repeal the three farm laws as historic. Yet, they have claimed before each stakeholder in this protest — and every citizen here — that the win has come at a cost. Thrilled in the manner how grassroot democracy has made its voice heard, they have asked the people “never to forget the supreme sacrifices of the farmers, many of whom even died during the protest”. “I am extremely happy today. There were horrific pictures of the struggle that the media had portrayed for the past one year (referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident). Finally, there is relief and victory,” said writer Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay. Pradip Basu, dean of the humanities and social sciences, Presidency University, has been a vociferous supporter of the farmers’ agitation since its inception. “At last, PM Narendra Modi has declared that the three farmers’ laws would be repealed. True it happens to be a decision taken before the elections in UP and Rajasthan along with other states. But there can be no doubt that it is a victory for the people’s movement. A very respectful salute to the over 700 farmer martyrs,” said Basu. Maroona Murmu, professor of history at Jadavpur University and the first Adivasi professor teaching social sciences at a university in Bengal, said it was the farmers’ movement that forced the government to repeal the laws, though hundreds were martyred in the protest. Linguist Pabitra Sarkar said he is relieved after the multiple “sad vignettes” that were coming in from across a few pockets of the country. “Finally, there is relief. But one cannot ignore the fact that the elections are coming and that might have induced the announcement. I wish the Centre tenders an apology for the deaths that have happened in between,” he said. Satabdi Das, an activist who kept in touch with one of the leading voices in this agitation — Harinder Kaur Bindu — said she called up Bindu who assured her she was not leaveing Delhi till the Parliament officially repealed the laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/victory-comes-at-the-cost-of-several-lives/articleshow/87806519.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal agri protest belts hail repeal of farm laws||SINGUR/BURDWAN/NANDIGRAM: PM Narendra Modi’s promise to repeal farm laws came as a fulfilment to Singur farmer Krishna Ghosh who had been organizing Khaser Bheri farmers against the farm laws. It had been a long battle for Ghosh — an organiser of the Kisan Morcha campaigns at Singur. For the past 15 months, along with a few more farmers, Ghosh had been campaigning against the farm laws in the nearby villages. “There cannot be any bigger achievement than this for the farmers in the country. Had the laws been enforced, millions of farmers would have been pushed to sheer desperation leading to massacre,” said Ghosh. As he continued to speak, villagers at Khaser Bheri started to come out with sweets. “When the Kisan Morcha held a rally here, we were not sure of the outcome. But we had faith in the movement that continued to gain strength each passing day,” said Manik Das, another farmer at Khaser Bheri. Farmers at Singur also demanded a law guaranteeing minimum support price for their produce. “We could not get a good price for the potato this year. We can at least recover the cost of farming if there is a guaranteed MSP,” said Sukumar Ghosh of Beraberi village. At Burdwan, the rice bowl of the state, farmers cheered the decision to repeal farm laws. Kartik Ghosh, a farmer at the Simlon village in East Burdwan said: “I have 50 acres where we sow paddy, lentils and potatoes. I was scared of losing my income if the laws were put into force.” Small and marginal farmers were also happy with the announcement. Shyamal Mandal, a small farmer at Daminya village under Raina II has been growing Gobindobhog rice for decades. “We struggle to make a decent margin for the produce each year. We would have been at the losing end had they allowed multinationals to step in,” he said. At Nandigram, another epicentre of farmers’ movement in Bengal, celebrated the day. Bhabani Das, a farmer who had taken an active part in the Nandigram movement, said, “We had fought against the state government for nearly a year. Many were killed yet we did not get swayed. Farmers in Delhi have shown the same grit.” Nanda Patra, another farmer, said: “History repeated itself once again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-agri-protest-belts-hail-repeal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/87806528.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Business||Manipal is in takeover talks with Amri hospitals||Kolkata: Bengaluru-based Manipal Group is still in talks with Amri for a possible takeover of the hospital group run by Kolkata-based Emami, which has diverse business interests ranging from FMCG, edible oil, real estate to healthcare. Manipal Hospitals COO Karthik Rajagopal indicated that it is looking at both the options of a complete takeover of 1,300-bed Amri hospitals or acquiring some of its assets. If materialised, this takeover would make Manipal inch closer to healthcare leader Apollo. Rajagopal was in the city for rebranding of Columbia Asia, which Manipal Hospitals group had acquired earlier this year. “We are still in talks with Amri. The idea was to expand the footprint in the east. But whether it would be an asset-specific or a complete takeover, that is yet to be finalised,” he added. Amri has four hospitals, three in Kolkata and one in Bhubaneswar. Top officials of Emami group could not be contacted for comment but sources close to the development pointed out that the discussion was for the whole hospital business not any particular unit. The three units of Amri (Advanced Medical Research Institute) in the city are in Salt Lake, Mukundpur and Dhakuria. Rajagopal said that with 7,600 plus beds, Manipal is the second largest hospital player now. So, the addition of another 1,300-1,400 beds would take it in the striking distance of Apollo. Manipal had resumed talks to buy the Kolkata-based hospital group for Rs 1,500 crore ($200 million), earlier this year. Initially, a few years back, both the parties had a talk for a possible buyout but it could not be materialised due to differences in valuations. Meanwhile, Manipal had bought Vikram Hospitals in Bengaluru. “In the east, we are definitely looking to expand after Columbia Asia,” he added. Manipal Hospital has a combined revenue of around Rs 4,000 crore and has 27 hospitals across the country. However, hospital business revenue is heavily skewed towards Bengaluru as almost 55-58% of it is coming from its headquarters. Manipal Hospital CEO also added that from October this year 90% of its business is coming from normal operations and not Covid. Incidentally, Columbia Asia Hospitals across the country has been rebranded to ‘Manipal Hospitals’. According to Manipal, With the rebranding and new logo launch, all 27 units of Manipal Hospitals across India, including Columbia Hospitals and Vikram Hospital will be brought under one umbrella.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/manipal-is-in-takeover-talks-with-amri-hospitals/articleshow/87807364.cms||---

The husband of the Bhopal woman, who was raped and murdered by her father in a horrific honour killing, hanged himself at home in Sehore district on Friday afternoon. Just three days ago, he had learnt of the gruesome end of his wife, and never recovered from the shock. His father-in-law was arrested by Bhopal police on November 16 for raping and strangling her out of anger that she had married outside the caste. The woman’s brother was arrested too for his involvement in the crime. He stood guard on the road, around 1km away, to keep an eye on passersby, say police. According to police, father and son had plotted the murder and taken her on a bike to a forest in Ratibad on November 5 on the pretext of burying her five-month-old son, who had allegedly died from pneumonia. There, the father raped and strangled his daughter-in-law next to the body of the newborn and left both to rot in the sun. Till police made the arrests, the woman’s husband didn’t even know that she and his child were dead, said police. Ratibad SHO Sudesh Sehore police registered a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/husband-of-honour-killing-victim-hangs-self-in-bhopal/articleshow/87809411.cms||---

The semester exams will begin only after January 20, 2022, higher education minister K Ponmudi said on Friday. A section of students had been protesting over the past few days demanding that the semester exams be conducted online. The higher education department, along with controllers of examinations from state universities, discussed with 11 student organisations, including the Students Federation of India (SFI) and the All India Students Federation (AISF) regarding their opposition to offline exams. "The representatives of student organisations also wanted offline mode exams. However, they wanted more time to prepare for the exams. They said students have been attending offline classes only for the last two and half months. They have asked for a month's time to prepare for the exams. We have decided to give them two months time," Ponmudi told reporters. The state government would withdraw the cases filed against protesting students, he added. He also said the universities and colleges would finish the syllabus before the start of the semester exams and conduct model exams before the semester exams from January 20. City colleges also welcomed the decision saying it would give them more time to complete the syllabus after the physical classes were affected by the rain holidays. "Due to the prolonged rain holidays, we will be able to complete the syllabus only in the second or third week of December. Students will get more time to prepare for semester exams," a principal from a city college said. Another principal said arts and science colleges would be able to finish the syllabus for first year students too before the start of the semester exams. Earlier, University of Madras planned to conduct semester exams from December 20 and Anna University from December 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/semester-exams-in-all-tamil-nadu-colleges-postponed-to-give-students-more-time/articleshow/87809679.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka may repeal APMC law, but not land act amendment||BENGALURU: Now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that his government will repeal the three contentious farm laws, the Karnataka government is in a dilemma over whether it should follow suit and repeal two of the laws it enacted in 2020. Law minister J Madhuswamy said the government will take an appropriate decision after discussions with the Centre. “When these laws were amended, we did take advice from the Centre. Now too, we will wait for directions from them,” the minister said. The two laws — Karnataka Land Reforms (Second) amendment bill 2020 and Karnataka Agriculture Produce Marketing (Regulation and Development) (amendment) bill, 2020 — were passed in both houses of the state legislature despite protests from opposition Congress and farmer organisations across the state. While the amendment to the Land Reform Act liberalises ownership of farmland and allows anyone to purchase agricultural land, the APMC amendment bill curtails powers of local Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees and allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMCs. Farmer group sets deadlineBuoyed by the Centre’s decision on Friday, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, a farmers’ organisation, set a deadline for the government to repeal both laws. “If these laws are not repealed in Karnataka, we will block all highways in the state on November 26,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekar, convener of the Sangha. However, while Madhuswamy insisted the government will not repeal the land reforms amendment “as it has nothing to do with the Centre’s farm laws”, ST Somashekar, minister for cooperation and APMCs, said the state will wait and see whether the Centre’s decision will affect amendments passed in Karnataka. Another minister said: “The winter session of Parliament begins on November 29 and Karnataka will get clarity by then. If needed, we will take up the issue in the winter session of the state legislature beginning December 13, or we may push it to the budget session next year.” Farmer leaders though were jubilant and claimed they will continue to oppose the laws since they “are anti-farming community”. “If the state government does not repeal the APMC and land reforms amendment acts, then it will face the same kind of pressure the Centre did,” said Kurbur Shanthakumar, a farmer leader. Samyukta Horata Karnataka, an umbrella organisation of farmer associations and unions, said the onus is on the state to repeal the laws. “While the PM and the BJP government at the Centre have said they will repeal them, the BJP government in Karnataka has speeded up implementation of the APMC and land reform laws,” the association said. “We expect CM Basavaraj Bommai to follow in the footsteps of PM Modi and repeal these black laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-may-repeal-apmc-law-but-not-land-act-amendment/articleshow/87809656.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Guwahati||Assam Police ranks third in country in smart policing index of the IPF||GUWAHATI: The Assam Police has ranked third in the country in overall rating in the index for public perceptions and citizen satisfaction in a survey for 2021 conducted by the Indian Police Foundation (IPF). Based on the philosophy underlying the Prime Minister's SMART policing idea, IPF used six competency-based dimensions and three values-based dimensions of trust in the survey. "We believe that these annual surveys would be an ideal strategy to nudge state police organisations to strive for better public perception and trust levels, year on year, by continuously improving their professional competencies and ethical values and thereby, the quality of their service to the people," the survey report published on Thursday stated. The SMART Scores are set on a scale of 1 to 10 and are indicative of the levels of citizen satisfaction, a score of 10 being the highest level of satisfaction. The levels of popular satisfaction with the quality of policing was highest in Andhra Pradesh (8.11), Telangana (8.10), Assam (7.89), Kerala (7.53), Sikkim (7.18), Mizoram (7.14) and Gujarat (7.04) in that order, with an index value of seven or above, 19 states and UTs scored an index value between six and seven, while three states scored between five and six. The survey report adds, "Despite being attacked for insufficient sensitivity, declining public confidence and growing concerns about the quality of policing, a majority of citizens (a weighted average of 66.93%) believe that the police are doing their job well and strongly support the police." Going by the individual indicators for the six competency-based dimension, Assam Police has been ranked at third position in "perception index of police sensitivity", "perception index of strict and good behaviour", "perception index of accessibility", "perception index of police responsiveness" and "perception index of helpful and friendly policing". Only in the "perception index of technology adoption," Assam has ranked eight. Under the three value-based dimensions of trust, Assam Police has ranked third in both "perception index of fair, unbiased and lawful policing" and "perception index of police accountability" but fourth in "perception index of integrity and corruption-free services."  In the "perception score of public trust in the police", the state police force has ranked fourth in the country. Assam Police DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta expressed his appreciation to each member of Assam Police who have been working relentlessly despite myriad challenges in the service of society. "However, there is no room for complacency and we have to go a long way." he said. Mahanta also stated that Assam Police is committed under the visionary leadership of chief minister of Assam to transform itself as a force dedicated to provide reliable, accessible, responsive, technology-driven and trained policing services to the people, a police force that is value-driven, will promote integrity, set standards of conduct, make efforts to reduce corruption, ensure that police discharge their duties with fairness and impartiality and build appropriate accountability mechanisms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-police-ranks-third-in-country-in-smart-policing-index-of-the-ipf/articleshow/87809683.cms||Prabin Kalita

But guess there is more to the exercise than meets the eye. Last month, there was shock and awe when Kamrej police in Surat district found 3,221 bottles of IMFL from a sub jail. Ahmedabad: Liquor worth Rs 73 lakh crushed by road-rollerThree constables were booked under the Prohibition Act. Sections of criminal conspiracy were also invoked for their gesture of hiding liquor stock in a sub-jail. The shocker does not end there. Now one of three constables booked has submitted before the Gujarat high court that of the 3,221 liquor bottles seized from the sub-jail, 1,678 bottles were part of the 25,360 cache of liquor which was destroyed in August end by running a bulldozer following a court's order. The constable has claimed that the police inspector himself had prepared a panchnama of destruction of the liquor.  This has sent alarm bells ringing in the high court and Justice Ilesh Vora has sought a detailed report from the higher authority on the issue of stealing liquor bottles from the muddamal. The petition was filed by constable Pinesh Vithani, who was posted at Kamrej police station. He along with two others – a lok rakshak constable Gulabbhai Karsanbhai and GRD Dhavalbhai Kiritbhai – was booked after Kamrej police inspector raided the sub jail and recovered liquor stock on October13. The police have alleged that since the muddamal room in the police station is small and the quantity of liquor seized in the area is so huge that muddamal is kept in a room in police quarters. But these three accused were stashing liquor bottles in sub jail on the pretext of shifting the muddamal from the police station to the police quarters. The constable has approached the HC for quashing of the FIR and claimed that since he is the lowest in the hierarchy, he has been made a scapegoat. Goods allegedly recovered from the sub jail in which he is implicated is in fact the goods so destroyed under the orders of the magistrate and vide a panchnama dated August 27, 2021 under the signature of police inspector and various other authorities, constable's petition reads and cites the make, batch numbers and quantity of seized muddamal, which was destroyed under court order. He submitted that the Kamrej PI, M M Gilatar, had made a request to the principal civil judge at Kathor court for destruction of 25,360 bottles of IMFL seized during June to August 2020 in 36 different prohibition violation cases. After the court’s nod, the contraband was destroyed in presence of the officers of the prohibition department, the prant officer and PI Gilatar.  The panchnama of destruction bears PI’s signature also. He cited police reports to point out 1,678 bottles bearing seven different batch numbers from the seized goods, which was actually a part of the liquor destroyed in August end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/booze-destroyed-in-letter-by-gujarat-cops-found-in-spirit-in-jail/articleshow/87809678.cms||Saeed Khan
---||India||Denied teacher’s job despite topping merit list, man gets post after 30 yrs||DEHRADUN: In 1989, following an advertisement in a newspaper, then 24-year-old Gerald John applied for the post of commerce teacher at CNI Boys’ Inter College, a government-aided minority educational institute in Dehradun. However, despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he didn’t get the job. In 1990, the Farrukhabad resident moved the Allahabad HC. After Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in 2000, the case was transferred to the HC in Nainital. When he turned 55, the Uttarakhand HC ruled in his favour in December 2020 — ordering him to be appointed in the school as well as a release of Rs 80 lakh as compensation. Of this, John was paid Rs 73 lakh by the Uttarakhand government a few months back but the remaining Rs 7 lakh, which is to be paid by the UP government, is still due. Being the senior-most teacher, John is also the acting principal of the school now. Reminiscing about his long fight, he told TOI that he was quite taken aback when despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he didn’t get the job. “When I asked authorities why I was rejected, I was told the candidate needed to have stenography skills to be selected. Stenography was not mentioned as one of the required criteria in the job listing. I suspected that the candidate who got the job had connived with authorities. Then I took matter to court.” In 2007, a single bench of the Uttarakhand HC ruled against John. He challenged the verdict in Supreme Court. Ex-Union minister and lawyer Salman Khurshid took up his case and fought it for free. “He saw it as a genuine case and it stayed in SC from 2007 to 2010. The court said the case had merit and asked us to appeal for it in front of a double bench of the HC instead of a single bench,” he said. Ten years after the case moved back to Uttarakhand HC, a double bench ruled in John’s favour in December 2020. In January, he was appointed the commerce teacher for classes 11 and 12 at the CNI Boys’ Inter College. In April, after the principal retired, he was also made the acting principal.

The victim, a Bhopal doctor’s wife, was fully vaccinated, as is her husband, who recovered and has been discharged from hospital. The couple tested positive on November 14 and were admitted to AIIMS-Bhopal the next day. The woman, a 54-year old, died in the early hours of Friday. “She had no comorbidities, apart from slight obesity. On November11 and12, she and my brother had a mild fever. They gave their samples on November13 and tested positive on November 14. At the time of admission, she had 70% lung infection. We can’t understand how the infection deteriorated so rapidly,” the radiologist’s brother, who is also a doctor, told TOI. Sources say she had taken her second vaccine dose in February this year, around nine months ago. Bhopal chief medical and health officer Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said, “The patient was fully vaccinated. Details regarding comorbidity are awaited. In the meantime, teams will trace the contact history of her husband as he is a radiologist.” On November 15, Indore reported its first Covid fatality in four months — a 69-year-old, who was fully vaccinated. He had diabetes and hypertension. He tested positive while being treated at a private hospital on November 9 and was shifted to MRTB hospital, where he died six days later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fully-vaccinated-woman-dies-of-covid-in-bhopal/articleshow/87809688.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: Close shave for 14 newborns as fire breaks out in Goalpara hospital||GUWAHATI: As many as 14 newborns had a narrow escape on Friday after a massive fire broke out in a child-care unit at a government-run hospital in west Assam's Goalpara district. The incident took place at Goalpara Civil Hospital. An electrical short circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire. Hospital authorities said the fire broke out around 9.30 am at the special newborn care unit of the hospital following which nurses and other staff there evacuated the babies immediately. Goalpara joint director (health) Nil Madhab Das said the fire was immediately doused before it could spread. He said soon after the fire broke out, the nurses present at the spot broke open a window and shifted the newborns. "All the babies are safe and have been admitted to newborn care units of private hospitals in Goalpara for the time being," he added. Goalpara deputy commissioner Meenakshi Das Nath, who rushed to the hospital, said, "All 14 babies and mothers are safe and shifted to nearby private hospitals. We suspect that the fire broke out due to a short circuit. We have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident and a power audit of the hospital." It is pertinent to mention that on November 10, one ventilator of an intensive care unit (ICU) of a pediatric ward in Assam Medical College Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh caught fire. The fire, which was caused due to a short circuit, was immediately doused and all 10 newborns were moved to another part of the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-close-shave-for-14-newborns-as-fire-breaks-out-in-goalpara-hospital/articleshow/87809723.cms||Mukut Das

The inauguration at India’s first Cleft Leadership Centre was graced by Harnaaz Sandhu, LIVA Miss Diva Universe 2021. Harnaaz said, “Miss Diva Organisation has been associated with Smile Train for a long time and it is my time to take that forward. I believe that it is important for us to spread the awareness that cleft is curable and along with it is important to make the patients feel comfortable. Smile Train has treated more than 6 lakh people with cleft. It is time for people to talk about this, especially those who have been through this and cured, as they need to know it is safe. I believe every smile matters, and their smile is transformed with the cure. Let us spread smiles and awareness together.” The trip for the inauguration also had Harnaaz excited. “This is my first trip to Bengaluru and I was looking forward to it. It is a beautiful city and the people are warm and kind. The city is famous as the Garden City as well as the Silicon Valley of India and I am eager to try out local specialities like masala dosa, idli and vada,” she added. Harnaaz is soon going to represent India at the Miss Universe pageant. “My training for the Miss Universe pageant is going on full fledged. And I am staying calm at the same time as that is the key to success, to stay happy mentally and physically. I am undergoing training sessions for hair, makeup, communication and many other things. I will be flying to Israel soon and I am super excited to make our country proud,” she signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/liva-miss-diva-universe-2021-attends-a-health-camp-organised-by-smile-train/articleshow/87800963.cms||Sunayana Suresh
---||Kolkata||Fried grasshoppers are tasty, but rattlesnakes are boring, says Abhijit Banerjee||In his new avatar as a gourmet cook, Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee has been the flavour of the season. Those used to his work as an economist slicing and dicing data have been treated to delightful visuals of him slicing and dicing onions instead on camera and gracing magazine pages, while holding forth on topics as diverse as Karl Marx and kalonji. Quizzed on how he managed to make it all look so effortless, Abhijit said, “While not exactly on camera, I do this all the time — talking on the phone and chopping onions, without much of a thought.” In a freewheeling chat with CT from Boston, Abhijit was joined by Cheyenne Olivier from France, his family’s au pair for three years who tried out and perfected the recipes that had fuelled Abhijit’s “unlikely ambition of being a cookbook writer”. Cheyenne, who counts Bengali vegetarian cuisine as one of her favourites, has added colour to the Nobel Laureate’s book in the form of illustrations as well. From carrots to crocodile meat, appeasing children to exploring local markets, it was a conversation about all things food. Excerpts: The two of you have been doing a lot of cooking on TV of late. From dal to meat and more. How are you enjoying this stint as celebrity TV chefs?Abhijit Banerjee: This is actually not the first time I am cooking on TV. Some time back I was asked to cook at the JNU canteen and I must admit it was not a great success. CO: Cooking this time was not only fun but extremely easy. Because most of the preparations were done and measurements did not have to be precise. AB: Normal cooking is much more work than what we did on this trip. There are no children under your feet... literally! No other distractions. I didn’t have to think of what to say in my talk tomorrow… Cheyenne also was not busy minding the kids while cooking… you know those are the usual circumstances for us. Abhijit, as someone who has travelled and lived in various parts of the world, how good is your cultural palate tolerance? AB: In America, there is this obsession with eating weird animals. Like rattlesnake or crocodile. All this stuff is boring and not interesting to eat. I have tried it because people say you should eat these in Southern Arizona or Northern Florida. It does nothing for me. I tried fried grasshoppers in China and I liked it very much very much — it was like eating chips, spicy and salt — and the fact that it has protein, I was all for it. It would be great if people would have a lot more insects. There are a lot of insects and they are a great source of protein. In India, people do not get enough protein. There has been a long tradition of eating insects on drier parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra. But it has been suppressed because it is somehow perceived as unclean. I also don’t like tripe. Covid and the lockdown impacted our food choices and changed the way we sourced and cooked food at home. Suddenly everyone was obsessed with food, cooking and sharing on social media and talking about sustainability etc. How did those months affect your relationship with food? AB: When the pandemic first hit us, I was in the US where we don’t really eat out as much. But I was often up at 2 am to find a delivery slot online. You see, there was an obsession with getting things and one would order whatever was available. That imposed a constraint on us while opening up the possibility of making a four-course meal for lunch or a five-course meal for dinner. For the first few months in fact I cooked more than I ever did and better that I ever did as well. And what I have learned was this: cooking with what you have is key. Let me share an example... Once I ended up with nearly 12 kilos of carrots because I paid a hundred dollars to a restaurant supplier for it. I had ordered whatever I could get and ended up with a big bag of carrots. So for the next few days cooking with carrots became critical or else they would go bad. So that was part of the story that other people also had, working with whatever you had, with more time in your hands and less ingredients. It changes the way we think about food. It also exposes you to the fact that there is an enormous supply chain behind what you eat and if that supply chain is disrupted, you end up with 25 pounds of carrots and nothing else. Illustrator Cheyenne Olivier was an au pair for Abhijit Banerjee’s family for three years, during which she tried out his recipes CO: Precisely. At a time when everything crumbled, people held on to food as something that is not only essential but also gives you a lot of pleasure and maybe sensitises you to how food is linked to the environment, economy and even political issues. It showed how much food is embedded in our lives — something intimate that brings pleasure to your everyday life. Did any of the carrot recipes eventually make it to your book Cooking To Save Your Life?AB: Yes it did! Abhijit, you have cooked for a diverse set of people. Who has been the toughest to please?AB: Children! They are candid and not super open-minded about food! The story behind the abstract and geomteric illustrations by Cheyenne CO: I wanted to move away from the over realistic photographs you find in most cookbooks because they are intimidating. When you start cooking and the end result does not look like the photograph you think you may have gone wrong, but it is only because you have perhaps different kinds of material to work with. Every recipe in Cooking To Save Your Life sets up a scene with a particular character and you can almost have a whole story with the character. I used graphic ingredients — square circles, triangles — I chopped them, minced them, cut them to create visual dishes to illustrate the scenes that Abhijhit describes. What Abhijit Banerjee likes to pick up on his trips to Kolkata AB: It may not be entirely legal but I love the Kolai daler bodi (vadi made with urad dal) that you do not get in the US. It is something that you get only in Bengal. It is plain, has a subtle nutty flavour and goes beautifully to a ghonto and is very different from the rich and spicy Punjabi vadis that you get everywhere. And it is part of Bengali vegetarian cuisine which I love. Abhijit’s favourite dishes from IndiaThe Bohra meat soup from western India which also has a Marathi equivalent. Almost like a meat stock that is thickened and spiced up. A masterpiece! From the south of India, I like all the vegetables and stir-fired dishes. And our Brussels sprout recipe is one of them From Bengal, it is the moong dal with cauliflower, which is rich and full of subtle flavours From the north it is the potatoes with seasame seeds that is pure indulgence as it’s an instant pick-me-up with a wonderful combination of sour and bitter with all the earthiness of aloo that is wonderful. But one should not try it too often Abhijeet, in Kolkata, where do you like to shop for fresh ingredients? Abhijit Banerjee: It depends on what I am cooking. Sometimes it’s New Market and Gariahat Market. As a kid, I visited Gariahat often with my grandfather early in the morning. New Market would be more for the exotic stuff and I go there often. l love markets. Even this time, I went to Lake Market just for the experience — the colours are a riot, there is so much richness there! It’s a pity if you have to buy things online when you can go to markets. In fact, a great source of entertainment for us during the pandemic in Paris was to go to a market as often as we could and just stare at the vegetables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fried-grasshoppers-are-tasty-but-rattlesnakes-are-boring-says-abhijit-banerjee/articleshow/87804261.cms||Chandrima Pal
---||Kolkata||Many consider being a recurrent, commissioned composer by multiple orchestras a miracle, says Upamanyu Kar||“The journey of music is breathtaking, adventurous, and is enriched with both lovely and dreadful experiences, as “impossible” is no longer an option to consider”, says Upamanyu Kar, after being invited for his Fifth Orchestral Commission from around the globe. In an exclusive interview with CT, he speaks about his life, inspirations and music. You just got invited for Fifth Orchestral Commission amid the pandemic. How did you go for it?Well, although people might consider it as a “miracle”, I never thought it to be. In fact, in my opinion, nothing is really impossible in life as long as you don’t think it to be “impossible.” For me, it came very naturally, just as I wake up every morning and take a cup of tea, while gazing at the sunrise from my balcony at my rented house in Santiniketan, Birbhum. How does it feel like to be a commissioned composer, that too by orchestras? Isn’t it a very rare opportunity which most composers are able to get?Yes, it is. Everywhere in the world, most composer’s biggest dream is to get their works performed by large ensembles, such as orchestras. And, in most cases, their wishes remain largely unfulfilled because of the composers’ inability to hire musicians and to organise an orchestral concert. When an organisation, an ensemble or an orchestra commissions a composer, they also pay them an honorarium apart from taking all monetary responsibilities for organising the concert. It usually occurs to felicitate a specific occasion, a specialised event or a purpose, and composers who are exceptionally skilled in their art are invited to be commissioned to write music for the said occasion or the purpose. Between 2016 to 2019, I was commissioned by The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra, The Kolkata Youth Orchestra, The Pioneer High School Orchestras (for the first time) and the Indo-European Orchestra (Budapest). This is only my fifth orchestral commission internationally, and at the age of 33, I can say that many more is yet to come. I would repeat, people might consider being a recurrent commissioned composer by multiple orchestras a miracle, that too from India, but I don’t really consider my musical identity any different at all. What are your inspirations? How do you get the energy to be consistent with musical innovation?My inspiration is life itself. I’ve learned to challenge myself to bring out the best version of myself in whatever I do. Most people in our society just survive. But if we wish to live an adventurous life, we must be ready to face the greatest challenges in order to explore ourselves. Once we can fully accept this truth, and learn to take responsibility for every massive failure in life, we can enjoy massive successes, too. We can’t deny the possibilities of being knocked down in life every now and then. For this, I believe that we’ll need to keep the judgement only to ourselves to decide anything which becomes good for our own lives. If we let the judgement be laid down in the hands of an authority, then the biggest problem arrives. In this way, my journey of music has become breathtaking, adventurous, and is enriched with both lovely and dreadful experiences, as “impossible” is no longer an option to consider as long as I want it. How did you feel after being invited for your Fifth Orchestral Commission? Do you consider it an achievement?Honestly, I don’t prefer to call it a very big achievement. Till now, I’ve been developing myself, and as I’m moving towards pursuing my goal and living my life to the fullest, I let my emotions flow very often as I look back for a short while after each success to measure my growth. The musical journey is breathtaking, sometimes as difficult as life-threatening, similar to climbing a mountain with lots of disasters and dangers coming along the way. In the past, I’ve been cheated by my “own” people, who once encouraged me in the journey, tried to later prevent me from achieving the same. Unfortunately, this includes my parents, family members and subsequently, my wife as well. All these betrayals have helped me to become even more confident and determined to take this journey forward; and as I moved on, I found that being emotionally indifferent is the best way to deal with such problems. When I received the invitation, I found myself to be one of the luckiest people once again, to have been able to pave my way through success amid all challenges. The email read, “Over the past month, our orchestra students explored the music of 52 composers, and have now narrowed down our list to those with whom we would like to work. Congratulations, you are one of those composers!” As I went through the mail, I stood in front of the mirror once again, observing every minute detail of the scars, which were just parts of my existence. In my hands, I firmly held the official invitation letter from The Pioneer High School Orchestras, Michigan, to work as a commissioned composer for all four orchestras for their first concert in 2022; I was the only composer to have been chosen from India; as I closed my eyes for a short while, I could recall the memories of my dreams of studying composition abroad getting shattered almost nine years ago, thanks to the betrayal of my parents and family members. I felt the tears that came through, and accepted their existence once again. Then, as I opened my eyes, I found myself standing face-to-face with my inner-self and destiny; firmly, this is just the beginning of my journey of executing the lessons given by my once “parents”, in the highest manner. As I realized that despite each and every betrayal, I have managed to pave my way through success, I recalled my father’s past words, “If you excel in doing music so high, I’ll reward you.” Remembering all the incidents that have happened to my life in the last few years, I smiled indifferently; and thought, am I just flowing like the waters of a river, worshiping all the sounds that come along? Should we still have expectations in life if we wish to make more such ‘miracles’ happen?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-consider-being-a-recurrent-commissioned-composer-by-multiple-orchestras-a-miracle-says-upamanyu-kar/articleshow/87803431.cms||---
---||World||Judge throws out two Malcolm X murder convictions||NEW YORK: A New York judge on Thursday threw out the convictions of two men imprisoned for decades over the 1965 assassination of civil rights leader Malcolm X, acknowledging a gross miscarriage of justice in one of the most high-profile murders in American history.  Judge Ellen Biben granted the exonerations of Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam to a burst of applause from the courtroom, a historic move that amends the narrative behind one of the US civil rights movement's deepest wounds.  "I regret that this court cannot fully undo the serious miscarriages of justice in this case and give you back the many years that were lost," the judge told Aziz and the family of Islam, who died in 2009.  For more than half a century the official record has held that three members of the Black nationalist group Nation of Islam -- which Malcolm X had recently renounced -- shot the iconic leader when he arrived to speak at the podium of a Harlem ballroom.  Aziz, Islam and a third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, were convicted in 1966 -- but historians have long cast doubt on that thesis.  Halim -- now 80 and released from prison in 2010 -- confessed to the murder but maintained the innocence of the other two.  And in 2020, the case was reopened following the release of a Netflix docuseries "Who Killed Malcolm X?"  The 22-month investigation conducted jointly by the Manhattan district attorney's office and lawyers for the two men found that prosecutors, the FBI and the New York Police Department withheld evidence that would likely have led to their acquittal.  Aziz, 83, was sentenced to life in prison in 1966 but was released in 1985. Also sentenced to life, Islam was released in 1987 and died in 2009.  Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said the probe made "clear these men did not receive a fair trial" and apologized on behalf of the law enforcement community for the "decades-long injustice."  "We can't restore what was taken from these men and their families, but by correcting the record, perhaps we can begin to restore that faith," Vance said. After Malcolm X was shot dead on February 21, 1965, Halim was taken into custody at the scene with a bullet wound to the leg.  Aziz and Islam were arrested several days later. Both denied involvement in the assassination and provided alibis for where they were at the time of the shooting.  "The events that brought us here should never have occurred; those events were and are the result of a process that was corrupt to its core -- one that is all too familiar to Black people in 2021," Aziz told the court.  "While I do not need this court, these prosecutors, or a piece of paper to tell me I am innocent, I am very glad that my family, my friends, and the attorneys who have worked and supported me all these years are finally seeing the truth that we have all known officially recognized," he added.  Saying the convictions "deceived and cheated" the public, civil rights attorney David Shanies told the court the two men became "victims of the same racism and injustice" that Malcolm X had battled.  Shanies and the Innocence Project, a nonprofit which has secured the exoneration of hundreds of wrongfully convicted prisoners in the United States, collaborated with Vance's office in re-investigating the case.  - Lingering questions - The wrongful convictions mean the true perpetrators -- who are believed to be dead -- may never be held accountable for killing a towering figure whose teachings still underpin today's struggles for Black rights in America.  The lengthy investigation did not identify the assassins or offer an alternative explanation for the murder.  And key questions remain, namely how did US intelligence, which had long surveilled Malcolm X, not know the leader was under threat or do anything about it?  Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm X became one of the most influential African Americans of the 20th century along with Martin Luther King Jr.  As a young man he fell into petty crime and while in prison became a devout follower of the Nation of Islam, a religious and political organization that advocates Black nationalism.  Upon his release, he changed his surname to "X," symbolic of the original name of his family lost under slavery.  He rose to prominence as a minister and spokesman for the NOI, advocating Black self-dependence and esteem. He also did not shy away from the use of violence for self-protection.  Becoming disillusioned with the group, Malcolm X broke away in 1964, forming the short-lived Organization of Afro-American Unity to continue advocacy for Black rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-throws-out-two-malcolm-x-murder-convictions/articleshow/87807605.cms||---

"We also continue to have serious concerns about Russian military activities and harsh rhetoric towards Ukraine and call on Moscow to de-escalate tensions," White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters.  President Vladimir Putin has issued his own warnings. On Thursday, he said the West was taking Russia's directives not to cross its "red lines" too lightly.  On Friday, the Kremlin said those remarks were a response to provocative actions by NATO including the arming of Ukraine. Ukraine objects to increasing Russian military activity near the 1208 mile (1944 km) border it shares with Russia.  Despite a growing list of disputes, the Kremlin has maintained high-level contacts with Washington and spoken repeatedly of a possible summit between Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden to follow up their initial meeting in Geneva in June, which Putin said had opened up room for an improvement in ties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-and-world/white-house-calls-on-russia-to-de-escalate-tensions-with-ukraine/articleshow/87808330.cms||---

It was the first complete shutdown after the revocation of the erstwhile state’s special status and its downgrading to a Union Territory in August 2019. People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) president Farooq Abdullah, meanwhile, wrote to the President of India demanding a "time-bound judicial probe" into the killing of three civilians in the Hyderpora encounter. "Needless to state that such unfortunate incidents widen the gulf between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the government of India and, therefore, are to be avoided at any cost," Abdullah wrote. The J&K police has denied allegations that it had killed civilians, admitting only that one civilian, Altaf Ahmad Bhat, was killed in the crossfire, while Dr Mudasir Gul, slain in the encounter, was an overground worker (for terrorists) connected to Pakistani terrorist Haidar Bahai of TRF who also was gunned down in Hyderpora. The police claimed that one Amir Ahmad of Banihal /Goolgarh, in Ramban, was also an associate of the Pakistan terrorist who was killed in the encounter on the bypass near Classic Hospital, in Srinagar’s Hyderpora, on Monday evening. Reports from various districts said all shops were shut for the day and private vehicles and public transport remained off the roads. The busy market at Lal Chowk, in Srinagar, was deserted. Hurriyat leader Mirwiaz Umar Farooq issued another statement calling upon the authorities to "return the body of Amir Ahmad Magray", the third civilian killed in the Hyderpora encounter, without delay. Abdullah wrote to the President saying the incident had caused enormous pubic anger. "In this unfortunate incident three civilians got killed in suspicious circumstances," Abdullah said, adding that a judicial probe was necessary "so that true facts are unraveled and brought into the public domain". "We would remind Your Excellency that the administration of Jammu and Kashmir is being run in the name of Your Excellency by the Lt Governor acting as an agent and, therefore, an onerous responsibility is placed on Your Excellency to ensure that the rule of law prevails and the involved erring officials are brought to book and punished under law," Abdullah said in his letter, adding that the body of the third civilian should also be returned to his family for burial. CPM politician Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, too, urged the government to return the body of Amir Ahmad Magray, the third "civilian" killed in Hyderpora, without further delay. Tarigami said it has been proven beyond doubt that Magray was a civilian. "His father Abdul Latief Magray is a state bravery award winner and now his son has been killed and falsely labelled as a militant, which is highly unfortunate," he said. "The least the J&K administration can do is to return the body of Magray so that his family can perform his last rites," Tarigami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shutdown-over-hyderpora-encounter-civilian-killings-cripples-normal-life-across-kashmir/articleshow/87808480.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The three who have resigned are state school education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, health minister and AICC in-charge for Gujarat Raghu Sharma and revenue minister and AICC in-charge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary. Dotasra is a junior minister, while Sharma and Chaudhary are state cabinet ministers. The three resignations increase the vacancies in the Gehlot cabinet to 12. The maximum strength allowed in the state cabinet is 30, going by the 15% cap for a 200-member state assembly. Maken's unannounced visit to Jaipur indicated that the cabinet reshuffle was likely to be held in the next few days. Governor Kalraj Mishra is at present in his home state of Uttar Pradesh and scheduled to return on Saturday afternoon. Maken said after meeting Congress MLAs one-on-one on July 30, some ministers had expressed a desire to work in the organisation instead of the government. Maken said the three ministers had accordingly tendered their resignations to the Congress president, who had accepted the same. Law says the resignations ought to have been tendered to the governor directly or through the Chief Minister. Gehlot had given enough indications in the recent past about Dotasra leaving the ministry. At a teachers' felicitation function held the other day, the CM had said that the education minister's speech at the function seemed like a farewell speech. He said that Dotasra had been requesting the party high command to divest him of one responsibility in keeping with the principle of "one man, one post".

After the payout, the total disbursement will reach Rs 25,114 crore, amounting to 99.6 per cent of assets under management (AUM) as on April 23, 2020, when the fund house announced to shut the schemes, a Franklin Templeton MF spokesperson said on Friday. Under the first disbursement in February, investors received Rs 9,122 crore, while Rs 2,962 crore were paid to investors in April, Rs 2,489 crore in May, Rs 3,205 crore in June, Rs 3,303 crore in July and Rs 2,918 crore in September. "SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd (SBI MF) would be distributing the next tranche of Rs 1,115.55 crore to unitholders across all six schemes," the spokesperson said. The payment to all investors whose accounts are KYC compliant with all details available will commence from November 22, he said. The amount to be distributed to unitholders will be paid by extinguishing proportionate units at the net asset value dated November 18 this year, he added. The payment will be made electronically to all eligible unitholders by SBI MF, which has been appointed as the liquidator for the schemes under winding up by the Supreme Court. In case the unitholders' bank account is not eligible for an electronic payment, a cheque or demand draft will be issued and sent to their registered address by SBI MF. In March, the Supreme Court accepted the standard operating procedure (SOP) finalised by SBI MF to monetise assets and distribute the proceeds to unitholders of the six debt schemes of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund. The fund house shut its six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, 2020, citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market. The schemes -- Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund -- together had an estimated over Rs 25,000 crore as AUM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/franklin-templeton-mf-unitholders-to-get-rs-1115-crore-in-7th-tranche/articleshow/87805156.cms||---
---||World||Pak U-turn on chemical castration for habitual rapists||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has removed a clause from the criminal law bill providing for “chemical castration” as punishment for habitual rapists. Last year, Pakistan president Arif Alvi had approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020 and the Criminal Law (amendment) Ordinance, to provide mechanisms for curbing sexual abuse crimes against women, transgenders and children. The two ordinances had introduced harsher punishments for sex offenders, including chemical castration. On Wednesday, prime minister Imran Khan-led coalition government had hurriedly passed nearly three dozen laws in a joint session of the parliament, including the anti-rape criminal law, from which the penalty of chemical castration was omitted. Parliamentary secretary for law and justice, Maleeha Bokhari, revealed on Friday that the clause was removed due to objections raised by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Pakistan’s constitutional body responsible for legal advice to the government and parliament on religious matters. Article 227 of Pakistan’s constitution guarantees that all laws in the country should be in accordance with the Shariah and the Holy Quran. “The omission of chemical castration clause was made after detailed deliberation by a government committee in the light of CII objections under the guidance of the law minister. We cannot pass any law that goes against these (Islamic) values,” Bokhari said. About the anti-rape bill, Bokhari said the previous law had flaws that hampered the provision of justice to victims, hence a new law had been introduced to ensure swift dispensation of justice. She explained that an anti-rape crisis cell would be set up in every district hospital for rapid medical examination of cases. The punishment of chemical castration for rapists was introduced in last year’s presidential ordinance amid a national outcry over increasing offences and the specific case of a mother of two driving along a major Lahore-Sialkot highway who was dragged out of her car and raped by two men at gunpoint in front of her children. The new anti-rape law, meanwhile, has declared rape and gang rape as non-compoundable offences, where no compromise or settlement is allowed between the parties and a court must give the final decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-u-turn-on-chemical-castration-for-habitual-rapists/articleshow/87808598.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Those who labelled protesters who stood with the Indian farmers as ‘terrorists and separatists’ should apologise: UK MP||LONDON: British Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi has called on "sections of the media and the establishment" who were "busy labelling farmers and those standing in solidarity with them as terrorists and separatists" to apologise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday he would repeal the three central farm laws that have provoked huge protests for the past year. Dhesi was among several Labour MPs, in addition to councillors, British Sikhs and activists, who were thrilled with the unexpected decision, declaring it as a "huge victory" and a "huge U turn". Wolverhampton South East MP Pat McFadden said: "This decision will mean a lot to many in the UK who felt deep solidarity with the farmers protesting in India." "The farmers didn’t deserve to be so mistreated. They have made enormous sacrifices to preserve their way of life and their overwhelmingly peaceful, determined campaign has borne fruit," added Dhesi. British-born Daljit Singh (29), who has organised four kisan sleep-outs outside the Indian high commission in London, at which activists slept in the open air, said his protests would continue and the next one would go ahead in a gurdwara car park in Letchworth on November 27. "We are going to keep protesting until it’s gone through the parliamentary process. There isn’t much trust in the Indian government — they have allowed the farmers to stay there for a year in the cold and spread propaganda against them and we have seen them face water cannon and tear gas.

---||India||Those who labelled protesters who stood with the Indian farmers as ‘terrorists and separatists’ should apologise: UK MP||LONDON: British Sikh MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi has called on "sections of the media and the establishment" who were "busy labelling farmers and those standing in solidarity with them as terrorists and separatists" to apologise after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Friday he would repeal the three central farm laws that have provoked huge protests for the past year. Dhesi was among several Labour MPs, in addition to councillors, British Sikhs and activists, who were thrilled with the unexpected decision, declaring it as a "huge victory" and a "huge U turn". Wolverhampton South East MP Pat McFadden said: "This decision will mean a lot to many in the UK who felt deep solidarity with the farmers protesting in India." "The farmers didn’t deserve to be so mistreated. They have made enormous sacrifices to preserve their way of life and their overwhelmingly peaceful, determined campaign has borne fruit," added Dhesi. British-born Daljit Singh (29), who has organised four kisan sleep-outs outside the Indian high commission in London, at which activists slept in the open air, said his protests would continue and the next one would go ahead in a gurdwara car park in Letchworth on November 27. "We are going to keep protesting until it’s gone through the parliamentary process. There isn’t much trust in the Indian government — they have allowed the farmers to stay there for a year in the cold and spread propaganda against them and we have seen them face water cannon and tear gas. Some people in America have had their OCIs revoked just for protesting and we have all been labelled as anti-nationals. Once it has gone through the parliamentary process, people will go home." British-born Punjabi councillor, Gurch Singh, who started the petition calling on the British government to urge India to ensure the safety of farmer protesters and journalists, which garnered 116,000 signatures and led to a debate in the House of Commons, told TOI he was "speechless".

However, with international destination weddings still mostly off-limits, well-heeled, to-be-wed couples are exploring desi destinations in a big way. From beach and palace weddings to desert, cruise ships, hills, and jungles – the options are limitless, with most venues completely booked till March next year. RAJASTHAN IS THE FRONT-RUNNER, AS COUPLES OPT FOR ROYAL WEDDINGS ‘Natural beauty’ has become an additional factor while choosing a shaadi destination post pandemic, with outdoor and spacious venues being in demand. However, palace weddings have taken the lead, say wedding organisers. Nitin Arora, an entertainment specialist at a wedding and events management company, says, “Weddings in Rajasthan are quite a hit.” In fact, thousands of weddings are scheduled in Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, and Ranthambore from November to March. Vinay R Bantia, who recently organised a royal wedding in Udaipur, says, “Palace weddings mean ‘royal’. Every aspect is looked into – a defined guest list, an impeccable menu with exquisite drinks, and marvelous decor. Most clients who choose a palace as their location our ready to splurge, as the wedding has to match up to the royalty of the venue. Some opt for two to three day functions at palaces, while other choose to only hold their wedding ceremony.” Weddings have become a massive affair againPic credit: Uddipta Bhattacharjee The Escapade Events.CHARTER PLANES TO BOLLYWOOD SCRIPTWRITERS: COUPLES ARE GOING ALL OUT FOR THEIR LAVISH, DREAM WEDDINGSDakshna says, “Couples love experimenting and now that weddings have become a massive affair again, they want something exotic and fancy.” A wedding planner agrees, saying, “To reach these domestic destinations, some parents are booking charter planes. I have clients who have opted for a charter wedding proposal as they add a dreamy touch to the celebrations and the wedding video. And why not? Shaadi toh ek baar hoti hai.” Many couples are also hiring Bollywood choreographers and scriptwriters to write their wedding day speeches, apart from set designers to make the event a truly royal affair. A staff member at a wedding company tells us, “We are also hiring specialists - like sky lantern specialists - who can curate messages in the sky.” <p>When people opt for a destination celebration, away from their city, what they are looking for is an experiential wedding.</p><p><br></p><p>Pic credit:Rashi Entertainment</p>NOT JUST GOA, MAHABALIPURAM AND CHENNAI ECR ARE IN DEMAND FOR BEACH WEDDINGS tooSmall and intimate weddings are on their way out, as people are choosing to go lavish and extravagant on their D-Day. Rajiv Jain, director of a wedding and events company, says, “Lavish weddings are back full throttle. As per our research, apart from Rajasthan, heritage and beach locations are the in-thing right now. When people opt for a destination celebration, away from their city, what they are looking for is an experiential wedding. For instance, people in NCR-Mumbai want to getting married ‘closer to water bodies’. Everyone wants something new and different. Apart from Goa, Mahabalipuram has also become a popular wedding destination.” He adds, “While most venues are fully booked till March, our insights indicate that it’s 2022 that will be the year of weddings.” Dakshna Moorthy N Naidu, MD of wedding event company, adds, “Now that beach weddings have become so popular, is is not just Goa and Kerala that couples are going for.

The incessant rains started on Thursday evening, triggered by the deep depression formed over the Bay of Bengal, throwing life out of kilter in the region. More than 100 persons are feared to have been washed away in separate incidents in the four districts. About seven National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) teams have been deployed to lead the search and rescue operations, besides teams from the police, revenue and fire department. As Cheyyuru river overflowed, water from Annamayya irrigation project spilled over to several mandals in Rajampet assembly constituency and other parts of Kadapa district.  Three AP State Road Transport Corporation buses carrying passengers got stuck in flood waters near Ramapuram in Rajampet mandal. Though fire services rescued most of the passengers and APSRTC staff, 12 persons who were washed away were found dead at various places in Rajampet mandal. Seven bodies were retrieved near Gandluru, three near Rayavaram, while two bodies were found near Mandapalli. About 30 persons from Mandapalli, Akepadu and Nandaluru villages in Rajampet mandal have been washed away and officialhave launched a search operation to trace them. Rail and road traffic between Tirupati and Kadapa came to a standstill as floodwaters damaged railway tracks and national highways at several places along the route.

---||India||China should be in no doubt about India's stand: Jaishankar||NEW DELHI: China should be in no doubt about India’s position on the bilateral relationship and what is ailing it, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in a firmly worded message to Beijing even as military-level talks on the border stand-off remain stalemated and Chinese leader Xi Jinping received a renewed mandate as the unchallenged leader of China. “I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would have experienced, I speak fairly clearly, reasonably understandably (and) there is no lack of clarity so if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Jaishankar told a panel discussion at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum in Singapore. “We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that indicates some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he said. The minister did not indicate any resiling from the Indian demand that ties cannot move towards normalisation as long as the borders are unsettled despite suggestions in some quarters that there may be need for a rethink now that Xi has further consolidated his powers. Referring to other relationships, Jaishankar said the US is today a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions and working arrangements than in the past. “I think this reflects a very different kind of world...” he said. ‘Manner of China’s growing influence is very different’We are moving into a world in a sense, you could say, when the real transitions after 1992 are now occurring,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said. Dismissing as “ridiculous” the notion that the US has been strategically contracting and yielding space to others amidst a global rebalancing of power, he said, “Don’t confuse it with the decline of the US. I think that’s ridiculous.” “It’s clear China has been expanding. But the nature of China, the manner of its growing influence is very different. And we don’t have a situation where China necessarily replaces the US. There are also a lot of other countries, including India, which have come much more into play. There’s been a rebalancing in the world,” he said. The world, he said, is changing. “It is certainly not unipolar and it is not really, really bipolar either. There are many more players. A lot of what we are doing in terms of repositioning, working with countries, (it) is multipolar work,” he said. “In a sense, it is partly a hedging strategy, partly autonomous partnership, often very issue based (as) we work with different countries on different sets of issues,” said Jaishankar. Earlier, countries did not worry too much about the internal politics of its neighbours. “Today, issues of trust and transparency are much more relevant in a data-driven world. So it does matter to me what the character of my partner is, who they are partners with,”the minister further he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-should-be-in-no-doubt-about-indias-stand-jaishankar/articleshow/87808728.cms||---

According to police, some families living on Muslim Street on the banks of Kottaru River used to take shelter in the concrete house belonging to Aslam Ansari whenever there is heavy water flow in the river. On Thursday night, 18 people from five to six families slept in Ansari's house. As the basement of the house got eroded due to continuous exposure to river water over the past few days, a major portion of the house collapsed around 8am on Friday.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka contractors expose rot in public infra projects||BENGALURU: A complaint by Karnataka State Contractors’ Association to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has brought to light the worst-kept secret in state administration — the deep-rooted, institutionalised corruption in how state public infrastructure projects are tendered, awarded and executed. It also highlighted the contractor-politician nexus and extent of kickbacks the state machinery allegedly extracts from contractors. Ahead of the 2018 assembly polls in Karnataka, Prime Minister Narendra Modi branded Congress government led by Siddaramaiah as a “10 per cent commission” government. In 2019, during his Lok Sabha poll campaign in Koppal, he dubbed the then Congress-JD(S) government as a “20 per cent commission government”. Now, going by allegations of the contractors’ association, the commission seems to have risen steeply, in just a couple of years, as it alleged that politicians are demanding 30% cut money to award projects in addition to 5%-7% to clear payments. The association wrote to the PMO on Thursday, alleging deep-rooted corruption. Facing harassment from mins, officials: Contractors’ assnThey to pay alleged ‘advance they’re commis forced - sion’ and then more kickbacks to get payments released after project completion. “We are facing harassment from ministers, elected representatives, officials and others starting from the junior engineer to the minister,” D Kempanna, association president, told TOI. In the past eight years, he claimed about 15 contractors died by suicide because they were unable to clear loans due to delay in payments. Payoffs are institutionalised in Karnataka with only percentage varying between departments and nature of work, alleged Kempanna. Official sources said the complaint to PMO was unexpected as contractors have never dared to go against political bosses and the all-powerful bureaucracy. “We know the consequences we’ll face by making these charges, but we are ready for that and we have solid evidence to substantiate them,’’ said Kempanna. He, however, did not disclose names of politicians and officials who demanded bribes but claimed that corruption exists at all levels, mainly in PWD, water resources and BBMP project works. A retired IAS officer said it’s impossible to win a government contract without paying a commission, irrespective of the party in power. “A strategically placed, high-level official/politician can manipulate the process to select a bidder. What has emboldened them are weak anti-graft watchdogs — Lokayukta and ACB — which earlier had exposed many such scams,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/contractors-expose-rot-in-public-infra-projects/articleshow/87808750.cms||---

According to the recently released Annual Status of Education Report (Aser), 62% children in the state studied using the traditional methods of textbooks, 44% from broadcast and 34% online. The survey indicated that some children used more than one mode for studying. Online classes did not work well in Karnataka. Only 34% studied online -- 41% in private schools and 32% in government schools. The most successful online classes were in Kerala where 91% studied online, followed by Himachal Pradesh (80%). When the survey was conducted in September-October 2021, only 83% students in both government and private schools in the state had their age-appropriate textbooks with them. This was the lowest in India at that time, whereas 98% children in West Bengal and 97% in Kerala had their textbooks. The worst performing states after Karnataka were Uttarakhand (87%) and Bihar and Rajasthan (89%). Nationally, 92% students had textbooks by then. In state, 72% kids have access to smartphones, says edu reportThe department now says distribution of textbooks is 100% complete, according to Made Gowda, chairman of Karnataka Textbook Society. The tender for printing textbooks was called only by July and the delay was expected. Nationally, one of the best performances by Karnataka came in lessons broadcast. There were lessons on Chandana TV and in radio programmes for primary school children, 44% of them followed this. The other states that had solid broadcast lessons were Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Aser report points out that even though the ownership of smartphones had increased in the past one year, accessibility was an issue. In Karnataka, of the 72% schoolkids with access to smartphones, 36% have access all the time, 53% sometimes and 12% no access at all. The access to smartphones in Karnataka last year was only 43% as against 72% this year. About 50% of the children who learnt online last year found it easier the next year. Unlike in 2020, the year 2021 saw children receiving more learning material. While only 82% received the material last year, this year it has gone up to 93% nationally. Around 28% government schoolteachers visited children at home when schools were closed across the country. Karnataka had introduced Vidyagama by which government schoolteachers were to reach out to children near their neighbourhoods in small groups. Private schoolchildren relied more on WhatsApp. Aser 2021 was conducted in September-October 2021 when schools were starting to reopen, among 1.92 lakh households and 11,545 schools through phone calls by Pratham, an NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/62-ktaka-kids-learnt-from-books-during-covid/articleshow/87808751.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Indian IT companies don't provide such long period forecasts. But most have said that customer demand is very strong, and have indicated double-digit growth rates.Cognizant has been lagging it's peers for some years, though its last quarter was relatively good. It said last month it expects to grow at 9.8% for the year ending December. Infosys, on the other hand, raised its guidance for the full year ending March to 16.5-17.5%. This year's growth rates are on top of the relatively low base of 2020, when revenue suffered on account of the pandemic. “We continue to make strong progress in positioning the company for sustained revenue growth and margin expansion," said CEO Brian Humphries in an investor briefing.A large part of Cognizant’s growth will be supported by digital deals, which is expected to contribute 55-60% of the topline by 2024, up from 45% currently. “Digital supports revenue growth, margin goals, increases our relevance to clients, and is core to our employee value proposition,” the company said.Of the total growth, 6-9% would be from organic constant currency CAGR and 2% would come from acquisitions. Cognizant expects to close the year with $18.5 billion in revenue. Margins will also get an uptick, expanding by 20-40 basis points annually. That would mean in a best-case scenario, margin inching up to 17% over the next three years. Cognizant’s margins for the third quarter ended September was 15.4%. In contrast, Infosys expects margins to be between 22-24%.TCS, which does not provide guidance, is also confident of double digit growth in the coming fiscal years supported by what its CEO Rajesh Gopinathan says is a “multi-year technology upgradation cycle that will fuel growth.”The company will deploy 50% of capital (of annual free cash flow) into acquisitions between 2022 and 2024. 25% will go into share repurchases and the remaining into dividend payouts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/will-grow-8-11-till-24-cognizant/articleshow/87808754.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||50% of women suffer from mental stress due to lack of public toilets, says survey||BENGALURU: Earlier this week, Bengaluru-based legal researcher Sneha Visakha’s tweet resonated with almost every woman travelling long distance in a bus. The driver of the interstate bus (Telangana State Road Transport Corporation) she’d boarded decided to stop by the road to relieve himself, while the male passengers followed suit. “Meanwhile, women on the bus apparently don’t have bladders/need to pee/need bathrooms, will probably stay off water all night,” she posted, adding: “The fact that constant dehydration is part and parcel of female travel plans should horrify & infuriate us, except we’ve normalised this so much, no one even notices a problem.” However, TSRTC took note of Visakha’s tweet and issued guidelines to field managers that buses be stopped only at wayside dhabas/restaurants with clean toilets and adequate illumination. The bus operators were also directed to stop at toll plazas to help women passengers. Several women like Visakha suffer distress either due to lack of toilets, or unsafe and unmaintained public urinals. According to a survey conducted by Channamma Kambara, assistant professor, Centre for Research in Urban Affairs (CRUA) at Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC), 50% of women faced mental stress due to postponement of defecation and 47% suffered from upset stomach, while 2% complained of urinary tract infection. She shared the findings during a webinar — Towards improved access and use of toilets in Karnataka: Status and the way forward — conducted by ISEC, Bengaluru on Thursday, on the eve of United Nations World Day of Toilets (observed on November 19). In her study of eight zones across the city (with 1,229 women), and a sample of 587 toilets (35.4 per cent of total toilets in Bengaluru), Kambara found that 97 per cent of women faced safety and privacy issues in toilets (including public, community and e-toilets). These reasons forced almost 30 per cent of them to delay in relieving themselves, while some of the remaining surveyed would choose to relieve themselves in public spaces, threatening their own privacy and safety. “Since most women lacked the ability or agency to modify their sanitation environment, they were forced to tweak their behaviour — like changing the timing of sanitation, limiting intake of food or liquids and withholding defecation or urination when they felt the urge,” she said, adding that 56% of the women found these public toilets did not have doors, forcing them to have company to guard them. Kambara suggested policy changes like gender mainstreaming of sanitation facilities, creating awareness and more pink-toilets/she-toilets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/50-of-women-suffer-from-mental-stress-due-to-lack-of-public-toilets-says-survey/articleshow/87808755.cms||Farheen Hussain

Flipkart is the latest to enter the online pharmacy business after the Tatas bought 1mg earlier this year and Reliance bought Netmeds for Rs 620 crore last year as the pandemic made people order medicines online. India’s largest e-pharmacy PharmEasy, which has filed for an IPO of Rs 6,250 crore, bought Thyrocare Technologies in June to expand its healthtech offerings.“The consumer internet ecosystem in India is growing rapidly as consumers recognise the opportunities and convenience that digital adoption is enabling in their lives. With growing awareness and focus on health heightened by the pandemic, there is a large opportunity and demand for affordable healthcare and ancillary offerings,” said Ravi Iyer, senior vice president and head of corporate development at Flipkart. SastaSundar offers a digital healthcare and pharmacy platform supported by a network of more than 490 pharmacies.

Poornima Ravindra, a school teacher, and her daughter Lakshmi Ravindra, an advocate, were on their way to Kempegowda International Airport in the cab. The two women and the driver, Raghavendra Ural, 45, of Bannerghatta, died on the spot. Police said Poornima and Lakshmi were from Kerala and their family had settled down in Kolkata. Lakshmi went to Kolkata on a holiday and the mother-daughter duo left for Bengaluru to attend a week-long yoga course. The course was supposed to end on Saturday, but the women decided to leave two days earlier and took Ural’s cab to the airport to return to Kolkata. Around 9pm, an SUV driven by MBA student Bharath BR, 22, jumped the median near Chikkajala, flipped in the air, and landed on Ural’s cab that was coming from the opposite direction. Police had to cut open the vehicles to remove the bodies. Bharath and his friend Vikas, 25, who was also in the SUV, sustained severe injuries. According to police, there was heavy rain at the time of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dead-woman-and-daughter-were-in-city-for-yoga-course/articleshow/87808757.cms||---

But now he is travelling in a modest car, thanks to the abysmal condition of the main road linking Rayasandra, where he lives, with Hosa Road which he has to take to get to office. Rayasandra is a densely populated locality in southeast Bengaluru with many apartments and villas. Residents have to take the main road to reach Hosa Road and head towards Electronics City and onward. But the main road is teeming with craters, posing a threat not only to the bones and joints of users, but also the shock absorbers of their vehicles. More than 1,000 people, including schoolchildren, use Rayasandra main road which has been in poor condition for over a year and half now. It takes more than 20 minutes to cross the 1.5km stretch to reach Hosa Road. Residents joke that there is no way they can leave their vehicles behind and walk the stretch as negotiating the potholes calls for a dancer’s skill. The potholes are getting larger and deeper by the day. Continuous rain over the past weeks has worsened things. “We pay tax to the government. I paid Rs 14-15 lakh tax for registration of my new car. Every day, we hear of at least one person falling off a two-wheeler. Things have become really dangerous,” Jonack said. Last week alone, three women met with accidents on the road. “A woman fell off her bike and was injured badly. We rushed her to a hospital. We are not even allowing our children to go outside,” said Ravi Bhavsar, a resident of Jana Jeeva Splendour apartment at Rayasandra. “So often, workers come and dump sand on the potholes and go. But the potholes are back in no time,” he said. Jonack said Rayasandra Residents’ Association approached the BBMP and Rayasandra gram panchayat demanding a solution. Some people have taken to social media and are uploading videos of the bad road. “I had a fall yesterday and suffered severe ankle sprain. Will BBMP take responsibility if something happens to us?” tweeted Swathi Gupta, a resident. Another resident, Kannan, said he started getting backache walking on the road. Shanta Babu, former corporator of Singasandra ward, under which part of the road falls, blamed civic agencies for the mess. “BWSSB started some work but did not finish it. Though we had money, we couldn’t do anything as they would dig up the road again. The road can be fixed once they finish their work,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-brave-craters-on-road-off-e-city/articleshow/87808758.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Five arrested with fake stamp papers worth Rs 63L||BENGALURU: A special investigation team arrested five persons, including a woman stenographer, and recovered fake stamp papers worth over Rs 63 lakh from them. The accused were earlier booked in four cases on similar charges in 2013, 2020 and 2021, while the kingpin, known as Chota Telgi, landed in police custody last year. The suspects are Hussain Modi alias Babu alias Chota Telg of Viveknagar; S Harish, of Basaveshwaranagar; stenographer Seema Shahan Sharif alias Shavar of Bapujinagar; Nayaz Ahmed, of Shammana Garden; Shabbir Ahmed of Vijayanagar. Police commissioner Kamal Pant said they were held in connection with a case at Ulsoor Gate police station in January. Police said hearing of the 2013 case is in its final stages while a chargesheet has been filed in the 2020 case. The papers were fraudulently used to show legal transactions that happened up to 20 years ago or more, when stamp papers were in use. Cops recovered from the accused duplicate seals of sub-registrar offices in the city and places such as Mysuru, Kolar and Bidadi. 2021 case On January 4, Krishna Nayak, sub-registrar at Gandhinagar office, KG Road, filed a complaint against unidentified miscreants for faking stamp papers. The high court, based on a PIL, directed police to form an SIT and probe the matter. The team was constituted in June. “Acting as decoys, our men purchased fake stamp papers from the suspects. Then, obtaining a search warrant from the court, SIT raided houses of the suspects and other places on November 12 and seized materials used for producing fake stamp papers,” Pant said.

The girl, D Sinchana, 19, was from Nisarga Layout in Jigani. She was the only child of Doddaiah who owned a hardware shop in Harapanahalli, Anekal. The accused was Kishore Kumar, driver with a godown in Anekal. Sinchana’s family told police she was first-year student at a private college on Bannerghatta Road. The tragedy came to light when Doddaiah and his wife returned home late evening and found their daughter with her throat slit and Kishore hanging from the ceiling fan. No suicide note was found. “Textbooks and a few notes were found near Sinchana’s body, indicating she was studying at that time,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-stabs-girl-to-death-hangs-himself/articleshow/87808761.cms||---

Nataraj M alleged that Satish R from Chintamani targeted him for getting a special land acquisition officer trapped while he was accepting a bribe of Rs 2 lakh from him recently. According to the FIR, Satish works as a tout for special land acquisition officer Tejas Kumar. However, Satish filed a counter-complaint, alleging Nataraj had attacked him. Satish said he is a farmer and had lent money to Nataraj, who assaulted him when he asked for it. Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) sleuths said they arrested Tejas Kumar, special land acquisition officer, KIADB, when he was accepting Rs 2 lakh from Nataraj in the last week of September. Nataraj said he approached ACB after Tejas demanded more money to move files pertaining to land acquisition. “My land was acquired by KIADB and I approached Tejas Kumar for compensation-related work. I had already paid Tejas Rs 10.5 lakh and decided to approach ACB when Kumar demanded Rs 4 lakh more,” Nataraj told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/whistleblower-farmer-says-tout-attacked-him/articleshow/87808763.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

---||Bengaluru||Set your house in order, court tells BWSSB||Times News NetworkBengaluru: Allowing a petition filed over BWSSB claiming arrears of over Rs 2 crore, the high court sent a stern message to the water utility: Set your house in order. The petition was filed on November 10 after BWSSB demanded the arrears, inclusive of interest, from BBMP for Jayanagar swimming pool. The Palike, in turn, sent a communication demanding payment of Rs 1.9 crore as arrears from PM Swimming Centre, which has been managing the pool since 1996. The private company challenged this, contending that it has not been using water supplied by BWSSB for the past 25 years and whatever arrears were there were cleared by BBMP in 2003 itself. BBMP also claimed that all the dues were cleared in April 2003 and BWSSB had acknowledged this. However, the water utility contended that bills were issued month on month to the petitioner and every bill indicated arrears. Since neither the petitioner nor BBMP paid the arrears, either one has to do so now, BWSSB argued.Justice M Nagaprasanna, after perusing the records, noted that merely sending monthly bills claiming arrears meant little and BWSSB cannot contend after 25 years that they have to be paid, that too by the petitioner. The judge added that the board should have taken action, according to section 75A of the BWSSB Act, at the right time (within 15 days of issuance of bill) by stopping water or sewerage connection to the pool. “The case at hand is one where BWSSB officials should be held responsible for their lackadaisical attitude, having let the arrears grow to mountainous proportions. Since laxity on their part spans around 25 years and some officers who handled this matter would have retired, this court is restrained from directing any disciplinary proceedings against them. But the case should act as an eye-opener for the board to set its house in order and not repeat such glaring mistakes in future,” the judge observed while granting liberty to BBMP and BWSSB to resolve the dispute among themselves. A direction was issued to both entities not to claim arrears from the petitioner for the period prior to 1996.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/set-your-house-in-order-court-tells-bwssb/articleshow/87808765.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: No end to dynasty politics as leaders’ kin throw hat in ring||BENGALURU: Dynasty politics continues to thrive as all three political parties are in the process of fielding relatives of their functionaries in the December 10 council elections from local bodies. JD(S), which is branded as a party of the HD Deve Gowda family, has taken the lead in this exercise. The party fielded Suraj Revanna, son of former minister and Deve Gowda’s son HD Revanna, from Hassan, overlooking functionaries who toiled hard to build it. Suraj filed his nomination papers on Friday. Suraj is the eighth member of the Gowda family to enter electoral politics. Given the predominant presence of JD(S) in the form of members of gram panchayats and urban local bodies — who are voters in these elections — in Hassan, Suraj’s election seems to be certain. The opposition Congress decided to field Channaraj Hattiholi, brother of MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar, from one of the two seats in Belagavi district, and former minister Amaregouda Bayyapur’s nephew Sharangouda Bayyapur from Raichur-Koppal seat. Though the party is yet to officially announce the candidates, Hebbalkar has claimed it has given her brother a green signal to start his campaign. Bayyapur filed his papers on Friday. Apart from these two, the party is also likely to field former minister A Manju’s son from Hassan. Manju had joined BJP ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls protesting Congress’ decision not to field candidates in support of Prajwal Revanna, the JD(S) candidate. Congress and JD(S) were in an alliance then. Promoting dynasty politics is not a new phenomenon in Congress as the party already has several sitting council members from political families who are seeking re-election on December 10. They include Sunil Gouda Patil, brother of senior Congress leader MB Patil, Vijay Singh, son of former CM Dharam Singh, and S Ravi, a relative of KPCC president DK Shivakumar.  The ruling BJP has fielded DS Arun, son of former council chairman and veteran BJP leader DH Shankaramurthy, from Shivamogga, and former CM Jagadish Shettar’s brother and sitting council member Pradeep Shettar (he’s got ticket for the second time in a row). It has also fielded Suja Kushalappa, brother of Madikeri MLA Appachhu Ranjan, from Kodagu. The party is likely to extend support to Lakhan Jarkiholi, brother of former ministers Ramesh and Balachandra Jarkiholi, who is expected to contest from Belagavi as an independent candidate. BJP releases list of 20 candidatesThe BJP central parliamentary board late Friday released a list of 20 candidates who will contest the council polls. The big names include OBC and social welfare department minister Kota Srinivas Poojary and upper house deputy chairman MK Pranesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-end-to-dynasty-politics-as-leaders-kin-throw-hat-in-ring/articleshow/87808766.cms||---

During his visit to TOI office, Bommai had said they will table the bill notwithstanding protests from the Christian community. In his letter, Machado said: “The entire Christian community in Karnataka opposes the proposal of the anti-conversion bill ...and questions the need for such an exercise when enough laws and court directives are in place to monitor any aberration of the existing laws.” He also requested the CM to withdraw the order to conduct a survey of Christian missionaries, institutions and establishments in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/anti-conversion-bill-archbishop-writes-to-cm-again/articleshow/87808768.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Lack of secondary centres choking Bengaluru’s healthcare||BENGALURU: What’s choking Bengaluru’s healthcare system? Insufficient secondary care hospitals and lack of referral from primary to secondary healthcare centres resulting in overburdening of tertiary care hospitals, according to a recent study by the Azim Premji Foundation. The report, ‘Healthcare equity in Urban India’, released on Friday, examines health vulnerabilities and inequalities in cities and terms urban health governance ‘chaotic’. “There is no streamlining of referrals, especially for chronic cases. Every patient lands up in tertiary care centres like Vanivilas or Victoria hospital. Though there are six community health centres in Bengaluru, they are grossly inadequate for an expanding city of Bengaluru with 198 wards,” said Arima Mishra, professor of sociology and public health, Azim Premji University and lead author of the study. The study involving 17 NGOs began in October 2020 and analysed urban health services in Bengaluru, Davanagere, Thiruvananthapuram and Raipur. “We chose a variety of cities to see implementation of urban health services in different areas to understand how different local self governments managed public health services,” said Arima Misra. The report highlights that all institutions classified as ‘District Hospitals’ in Bengaluru Urban district in the National Family Health Survey (NHFS)-4 database are in reality just referral hospitals but yet clustered within core BBMP area. “In NFHS-4, Vanivilas Hospital is mentioned as a district hospital but it is a tertiary maternity and childcare hospital,” said Arima. “The close geographic proximity within BBMP areas of different levels of facilities nullifies attempts at setting up a referral chain, since the public just goes to the facility closest to them, even if it happens to be a District Hospital. For those on the periphery, reaching a higher referral facility means a long trip on Bengaluru’s congested roads, making it safer to simply access a private facility located close by,” says the report. The report says that referral linkages between different levels of care are poorly defined in urban areas. Secondary-level institutions are scarce, resulting in overburdening of tertiary care. Primary and secondary institutions need to be strengthened, so that burden on tertiary institutions decreases. The researchers pointed out that primary health centres were not conducting deliveries, especially in Davanagere and Bengaluru. Overlapping of responsibilities between BBMP and Bengaluru Urban district was also pointed out by researchers. “Bengaluru’s continued expansion is affecting its urban health services,” she added. She gave the example of a mobile health clinic run by the labour department for beedi workers in Davanagere. “That’s a healthcare unit not run by the health department, an example for how accountability gets fragmented,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lack-of-secondary-centres-choking-citys-healthcare/articleshow/87808769.cms||---

In a video uploaded on social media, she said, “I have danced with an artificial limb and created history, making my country proud. But every time I go on my professional visits, I am stopped at the airport, and when I request CISF officials to please do an ETD (Explosive Trace Detector) test for my artificial limb, they still want me to remove my artificial limb and show it to them. Is it humanly possible?” Apologising to Chandran, the CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) tweeted “all our personnel will be sensitised again on the protocols so that no inconvenience is caused to travelling passengers”. This month, CISF has collaborated with disability rights groups and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to make the airport experience for differently-abled passengers hassle-free, without compromising on security. Last month, Sudhaa Chandran said she was left feeling ‘humiliated and disheartened’ CISF TO LAUNCH APP AND HELPLINE NUMBER TO AID DIFFERENTLY-ABLED PASSENGERSCISF officials say, “Representatives from NGOs were invited to share their experiences and put forth their expectations from the CISF aviation security group regarding the facilitation during security checks of differently-abled passengers at airports. They were also encouraged to give suggestions with regard to easing the process of security checks.” Officials add that detailed deliberations took place during the conference regarding the extension of Swarnim Sewa – an initiative launched by CISF aviation security group at Hyderabad airport in December last year – to other airports. The initiative included extending assistance to passengers requiring special attention, like senior citizens, differently-abled passengers, and expectant mothers. This included development of an app, and a helpline number. ‘THERE WILL BE INCREASED FOCUS ON TRAINING AND SENSITISATION OF PERSONNEL’The CISF said in a statement, “There will be increased focus on training and sensitisation of personnel. A periodic review of the achieved targets and way forward will be done every six months.” M A Ganapathy who was then DG, CISF told the NGO participants that all efforts are being made to ensure that passengers with disabilities do not face any problem at the airport. The current security guidelines for frisking differently-abled passengers, as well as their equipment like wheelchairs, prosthetics and others, were introduced by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security following the 2016 Somalia blast where a wheelchair-bound passenger was suspected to have carried out a blast in the aircraft after evading security at the Mogadishu airport. The NGO representatives present at the meet said that while the present guidelines are differently-abled-friendly, security protocols are different at different airports which leads to confusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-sudhaa-chandran-airport-incident-cisf-to-launch-app-for-differently-abled-passengers/articleshow/87808727.cms||Niharika Lal

---||Bengaluru||Odds stacked against Karnataka||Bengaluru: The odds will be stacked against Karnataka when they take on 12-time cha- mpions Railways in the final of BCCI women’s One-Day Trophy at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Saturday. It is a contest which pits the overwhelming favourites and defending champions against a resurgent young unit.Both the teams have taken similar routes to the title round, having remained unbeaten throughout the competition and their semifinals contests being washed out. They advanced on the strength of their superior net run rate. Again, weather which is gloomy and cloud-covered with more rain prediction, will play a decisive factor in who takes home the title. In the event of a no-contest due to the weather, Railways will retain the trophy on the basis of a better run rate. But Karnataka will hope for the rain to stay away and make a match out of the finale. Against a star-studded Railways line-up led by stalwart Mithali Raj, Karnataka have everything to gain. Throughout the tournament the top-order, comprising S Shubha, D Vrinda and G Divya, have consistently delivered leaving the middle-order largely untested. The bowlers have done well too with both their economy rate and wicket taking abilities.The host team skipper Veda Krishnamurthy, a former Railways player said, “I’ve played a lot of cricket with and against most of the Railways players, so I know their game. As a team, we have imbibed a brand of cricket which is aggressive in approach and style. In the final we hope to continue with it.”On countering their fancied opponents, the middle-order batter pointed out, “Railways come into every match with a clear plan, so it is important for us to unsettle them early. It will boil down to seizing the moment and converting the half-chances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/odds-stacked-against-karnataka/articleshow/87808839.cms||---

Promising a new start to agitating farm unions, the PM justified the three laws meant to allow freer trade and introduce contract farming as beneficial to farmers. He lamented that a small section failed to see this fact even when it was as clear as the light of a lamp, but refrained from pointing a finger. "There must have been shortcomings in our own efforts," he said. This was the second significant retreat, not counting the reluctance to follow through with the enactment of Citizenship Amendment Act by preparing the National Population Register, when the PM has retraced steps on a major initiative. In the earlier instance, the government allowed the ordinance to change the Land Acquisition Act to die a slow death. Read AlsoFarm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash.This time, Modi made no bones about the retreat. His address to the nation on Gurpurab, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, seemed a deliberate outreach to the Sikh community in Punjab where farmers have been particularly agitated over fears that a new system of private mandis will sound the death knell for the minimum support price-based procurement. The symbolism was in keeping with the PM's visits to gurdwaras on special days and the decision to open the Kartarpur Sahib corridor - all intended to woo Sikh opinion. "While apologising to countrymen, today I want to say sincerely that perhaps there must have been some deficiency in our tapasya that we could not explain the truth like the light of the lamp to farmer brothers," the PM said after outlining several decisions and measures the government had undertaken to improve income and benefits to the farming community. Read AlsoFarm laws repealed, PM Modi appeals protesting farmers to return home: Key pointsPM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. Addressing the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, the Prime Minister said the three laws were for the benefit of farmersUrging agitating farmers to return to their homes, he promised a fresh start, saying once the laws are repealed, a committee will study zero budgeting farming or natural farming, scientifically changing crop pattern, and most significantly, make MSP more effective and transparent. The panel is to include Centre, states, farmers, agricultural scientists and economists. While the announcement of the rollback was viewed in the context of the upcoming elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, BJP sources emphasised the decision reflected concern over the long-running agitation having an adverse impact of reviving separatism in the border state of Punjab and providing a handle to Khalistanis and Pakistan. Read AlsoSeat-sharing with BJP 110% on: CaptainThe repeal of the farm laws has brightened the possibility of BJP tying up with Congress rebel and former CM Captain Amarinder Singh's Punjab Lok Congress, thus upending the equations of the coming assembly polls in the state. "The plan for seat-sharing with BJP will be worked out 110%, and farmersThe Prime Minister defended the aims of the legislation, saying that they were introduced as part of a campaign to improve the condition of farmers, particularly small ones who need to be empowered and get the right price for their produce as well as more options. Such support was vital for some 10 crore farmers who tend to holdings of less than two hectare. "For years, this demand was continuously being made by farmers, agricultural experts, agricultural economists and farmer organisations," he said. He has previously accused the opposition of double speak over reforms that previous governments have also called for. "Today is the auspicious festival of Guru Nanak Dev ji Prakash Parb....This occasion is not to blame anyone. On this day, I have come to tell you, the whole nation that we have decided to withdraw, repeal the three farm laws. We shall complete the constitutional process of repealing the three laws in the upcoming winter session at the end of this month," the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister said that for years, farmers of the country, agricultural experts of the country and farmers' organisations of the country were continuously making these demands. "Earlier also many governments had brainstormed on this. This time also there was discussion in Parliament, brainstorming took place and these laws were brought up. In every nook and corner of the country, many farmers' organisations welcomed and supported it," Modi said and expressed his gratitude to the organisations, farmers and individuals who supported it. He said four-pronged measures on seeds, insurance, market and savings were taken to help farmers. "Along with good quality seeds, the government also connected the farmers with facilities like neem coated urea, soil health card and micro irrigation," he said.

---||Patna||Workshop on PFMS today||PATNA: The vice-chancellors of different universities, along with the principals of colleges who have been the beneficiaries of development grants under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) would be trained in the revised public financial management system (PFMS) at a workshop on Saturday. The daylong workshop, being organized by the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) at A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, would hold detailed deliberations on operating institutions’ accounts in PFMS under the revised procedure. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and higher officials of the education department and BSHEC would address the participants. BSHEC vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha told this newspaper that as many as 74 higher education institutions of the state, including 12 universities and 62 colleges, have received grants under RUSA in phase I and II. They are supposed to submit their utilization certificates before the allotment of grants under RUSA in phase III. As the Union finance ministry has recently made some changes in the PFMS system for the functioning of all schemes sponsored by the central government, the officials of higher education institutions would be apprised of the revised operating system. Grants under RUSA are sanctioned by the Centre in a 60:40 ratio, he said. BSHEC is the nodal agency of RUSA grants in the state and higher education institutions are the implementing agencies. The workshop will apprise the participants with the latest parent-child arrangement in the PFMS system, Jha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/workshop-on-pfms-today/articleshow/87806431.cms||B K Mishra

Pawar himself assured workers that the opposition would be made to pay for every day and every hour that Deshmukh spends behind bars due to the extortion allegations. While addressing party workers at Lakadganj, the former Union aviation minister said it was not his opinion but this was expressed by Pawar himself. “Nobody should think that a big vacuum has been created in Deshmukh’s absence.” Stressing that the Katol MLA was a key person in the NCP family, Sharad Pawar said he missed him badly in this visit to Nagpur. “Today is the first day in many years that I came to Nagpur, and Anil Babu is not here with me. We have been working together for many years, but this had never happened before. In Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Wardha, he was very much in charge of empowering the party workers,” he said. The NCP chief earlier cancelled his Wardha and Yavatmal tours due to official reasons, according to NCP city chief Duneshwar Pathe, who was with the senior politician at Wadsa in Gadchiroli. Slamming the BJP for misusing central investigation agencies to target Maharashtra ministers to destabilize the three-party government, Pawar showed glimpses of his good old days during a fiery speech. He said the opposition would be made to pay for every day and every hour that Deshmukh spends behind bars, and NCP workers would not forget this humiliation till they teach a befitting lesson to them. “When you have power, you need to handle it carefully and respectfully, with feet firmly on ground. Else, those (BJP) who lost it, resort to intimidating tactics like harassing and defaming others. The central government may conduct any number of raids on us, but the voter would punish you and never let you come back to power.” Taking a dig at local BJP leadership, the former Union agriculture minister said after losing power, some unscrupulous elements are sending a list to senior leaders in Delhi for action and accordingly central agencies are targetting them. “After switching sides, senior leader Eknath Khadse and wife were summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). As nothing could be done to MP Sanjay Raut, his wife was targeted. Similarly, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s sister was harassed after the government failed to indict him. Minister Hassan Mushrif’s home was raided but nothing was found.” Flaying Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, the veteran politician said even as the prices of essential commodities sky-rocketed, it was busy targeting and harassing opposition leaders. “I recently visited Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur district, where farmers were fighting for their rights for over a year, including senior citizens and women. Similar protests are happening in other states like Rajasthan and Haryana. However, the NDA government does not have time to listen to the grievances of those who feed the nation. It’s leaders are piling up miseries on the farmers and common citizens, and there is a need to teach them a lesson. Calling on workers to work under Patel’s guidance in strengthening the party’s base in Vidarbha, the four-time chief minister said the change would begin from Nagpur and spread across Vidarbha. “I was a bit sceptical of workers morale while arriving in the city in Deshmukh’s absence. But looking at your enthusiasm, I am sure that any misuse of power would not deter you in standing behind the party. With all your hard work, we have formed the MVA government under CM Uddhav Thackeray. Our aim is to provide a stable government that will take Maharashtra to prosperity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pawar-patel-promise-deshmukh-as-minister-again-soon-oppn-to-pay-for-every-hour-behind-bars/articleshow/87787653.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

There is no justification for speaking anything special over this issue.” Responding to a media query on his arrival from Delhi at Patna airport, Nitish said, “The Union government had framed the three farm laws. It was the Centre’s decision. But today the PM has announced to repeal the farm laws in the coming session of Parliament. The PM, in his speech, very clearly stated that he took the decision in the interest of farmers, but could not make all people understand his motive, hence he was withdrawing the three laws... The PM has explained everything. There is no need of speaking anything special over this issue.” On being asked that the three farm laws were withdrawn keeping in mind the forthcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and other states, Nitish said, “People keep expressing their views. But today, the PM himself explained everything. Everything is clear. However, the leaders of opposition parties are free to express their views.” When asked about some opposition leaders’ comments like “ego of Modi has been broken” and “it is a victory of people/ farmers,” Nitish said, “People have right to express their views. Hence, they will keep expressing their views.” When pointed out about RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s statement that there is a need of a similar agitation to put pressure on the Centre for caste-based census, the Bihar CM said he was not aware what Lalu has said over the issue. “I had no talk with him (Lalu). Lalu’s son and other leaders of his party had met me. We (leaders of all political party) had met the PM with the demand of caste census. The Centre took its decision. But, I categorically said the leaders of all political parties (in Bihar) would sit together and take a unanimous decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pm-has-explained-everything-on-farm-laws-nitish/articleshow/87806467.cms||Madan Kumar

A study carried out jointly by botanist and zoologists of M S University has revealed the presence of 54 species of birds belonging to 32 families that are using 28 species of trees spread over nearly 29.4 acres in this residential area. The study was aimed to highlight the bird diversity of Pratapgunj, which has low disturbance and high tree count, and acts as a good refuge of birds. Avian survey techniques and citizen science/ citizen survey technique was used for data collection for the paper titled ‘Conservation importance of trees as urban green spaces: A case study of birds in Pratapgunj residential area, Vadodara’ authored by Tanaya Ambadkar, Geeta Padate from MSU’s Zoology department and Prof Arun Arya, former HoD of Botany. “Birds are known to effectively indicate quality of habitat in an area. Most of the resident bird species are observed to breed successfully in the area,” the study states. Two migratory species — Rosy Starling and White Wagtail — are observed in good numbers apart from two other species of Alexandrine Parakeet and Black-headed Ibis, which are classified as ‘near threatened’ in IUCN red lists. When compared with the IUCN list that indicates global population trends of bird species, the Pratapgunj area has seven bird species with decreasing trend, nine with increasing trend, 28 having stable global population and ten species whose trend is not known. Three stripped palm squirrel, gray langur, Indian grey mongoose, Indian flying fox and Asian house shrew are commonly found mammals in the area. And reptiles like - oriental garden lizard, spectacled cobra, Indian rat snake have also been recorded. There are 28 species of trees including 16 fruiting species in Pratapgunj which shares its boundaries on two sides with M S University campus and on one side with the Sayajibaug public garden which extend the green habitat for birds. The most remarkable feature of the area is its stretch comprising 75 Ashoka (asopalav) trees, all of which are more than six decades old. “The residential area being old has still retained several large trees along its internal roads which makes the area green and a good habitat for birds,” the study adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/birds-find-a-cosy-home-in-vadodaras-urban-sprawl/articleshow/87806580.cms||Prashant Rupera

A large number of devotees from Nepal and Mithilanchal region reached Simaria to take an early morning dip in the holy river. Kundan Kumar, a cultural activist and resident of Bihat village near Simaria Dham said, “According to a rough estimate over two lakh people took a holy dip by Friday afternoon.”  Begusarai Sadar SDO Ramanuj Prasad Singh said that like every year, this year also people turned up in a large number. “The district administration had made elaborate arrangements to ensure that the devotees are safe and have a spiritually fulfilling experience. Barricades were put up at various points and an elaborate traffic plan was prepared to control the movement of vehicles. A large number of police personnel, teams of the State Disaster Response Force and local divers were deployed at the ghats to ensure the safety of the devotees,” he added. Saroj Kumar, associated with various sports organization said that this year, there was no traffic congestion between Barauni Zero Mile and Simaria Dham owing to the construction of four-lane road. This saved the devotees from a lot of hardship faced during previous years. Raju Giri, a devotee, however, lamented that this year the district administration denied permission to organise the ‘Kalpavas mela’ , a long held religious tradition, according to which the devotees stay on the bank of the river at Simaria in thatched hutments during the entire Kartik month. “The Kalpavas, spanning over a month, usually culminates into Kartik Purnima event making it a spiritually fulfilling experience," he said.  Elsewhere, at Sigma ghat, a group of priests from Varanasi performed a special ‘aarti’ on the eve of Kartik Purnima on Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thousands-take-dip-in-ganga-at-simaria-dham/articleshow/87806551.cms||---

The victim’s mother, while talking to reporters in Navsari, said that the institution officials took no action despite knowing about the brutality inflicted on the girl. “I came to know that my daughter had informed the institution officials about the incident. But unfortunately they didn’t take any action. They should have informed the police or our family. Why didn’t they? When my daughter told them that she wants to leave Vadodara, why didn’t the officials make any arrangements to send her back home?” questioned the victim’s mother. The victim was undergoing fellowship training at the institute for the last two years. The victim’s mother added that she was satisfied with the police investigation and demanded that those behind the crime should get the strictest punishment. Meanwhile, the police have again started investigating the role of autorickshaw drivers in the crime. Sources informed that few officials of the institution where the girl worked are also under police radar. Cops are questioning autorickshaw drivers whose mobile phone was active near the crime spot when the girl was attacked.

Mittal, an Indian citizen, who lives in a flat in Mayfair, London, was declared bankrupt by the London high court on June 19, 2020 after failing to settle a judgment debt against him of 139 million pounds (Rs 1,390 crore), which led to Moorgate Industries UK — to whom he owes the debt, which arose from a guarantee he provided — presenting the bankruptcy petition. Paul Allen of specialist business advisory firm FRP, who was appointed by the secretary of state as trustee in the bankruptcy of Mittal on June 29, 2020, took Mittal to the insolvency & companies court in June this year, seeking suspension of his discharge from bankruptcy, which should have automatically taken place after one year. An interim suspension of the discharge was made on June 17, 2021. At the final hearing on Friday, Allen’s barrister Tony Beswetherick told the court that during the initial year of his bankruptcy Allen had made multiple requests to Mittal to allow forensic experts to access Mittal’s electronic devices such as his laptops and smartphones and requested a second interview with him But he kept getting responses from Mittal’s solicitors, saying “we are taking instructions”. He said Mittal had displayed a “clear and flagrant non- compliance with his duties”. “We say this is a very serious case of deliberate non-compliance.” The focus of the trustee in bankruptcy is to realise the assets of the estate and distribute those realisations to its proven creditors. Bankrupt individuals must co-operate with the trustee and provide them with the information they ask for. Mittal’s barrister James Gibbons made no admissions regarding the merits of the suspension application but sought to get the case dismissed on a technicality, arguing that the papers were not served on Mittal according to the rules and he was not given adequate notice of the application, nor was he given adequate notice to file his evidence. Although Mittal successfully got an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) approved by 75% of the value of 20 creditors at a creditors’ meeting on October 26, 2020, he is not able to annul his bankruptcy order, since Moorgate is challenging the IVA in the courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/court-reserves-ruling-on-mittal-bankruptcy/articleshow/87807527.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Booster shot demand rises, hospital body to appeal to govt||KOLKATA: There is increasing anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) who received their vaccines almost eight months ago about their waning immunity. They are keen to get the booster shot, some hospitals and the Association of Hospitals in Eastern India (AHEI) are planning to make an appeal to the government for a third vaccination for them. Before vaccination, every hospital had anything between 20%-40% of their healthcare workforce getting infected by Covid. After vaccination, the infection rate reduced drastically. “Before the inoculation drive, about 230-odd HCWs in our hospital got infected. Post vaccination, despite greater exposure because they dealt with the second wave surge, only about 40 HCWs got infected and most of them did not need hospital care,” said Sudipta Mitra, Peerless Hospital CEO. Times ViewIt makes a lot of sense to give some sort of extra protection to healthcare workers. They are the ones who are most exposed to the virus, even though vaccination may have reduced the number of serious cases and deaths.The inoculation drive was launched on January 16 and, by March-end, a good number of HCWs had been fully vaccinated. “Now, eight-nine months after the second dose, many apprehend a severe infection due to dipping antibody level. That is why there is a demand for a booster dose,” Mitra said. At CMRI Hospital, around 10 HCWs are currently infected. All have received both doses. However, none has severe infection and all of them are being taken care of at home. “We had 100-odd HCWs infected during the first wave, before the vaccination. But after inoculation, we hardly had anyone getting infected. However, over the past two weeks, we have started getting a few cases of infection among our healthcare workforce,” said Simmardeep Gill, CEO CK Birla Hospitals. In some hospitals, doctors and nurses have appealed to the management to raise the booster shot issue with the appropriate authority. “From about 40% before the vaccination, the infection rate among HCWs in our units have come down to less than 5% after vaccination. In fact, none of our HCWs dealing with severely infected patients got infected after they got both doses,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east), Narayana Health. Some hospitals and the Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) are now planning to make an appeal so that the government rolls out the booster dose for the vulnerable, starting with the HCWs. “We have had only six fully vaccinated HCWs getting infected in the past six months. But there is anxiety about depleting antibody level and, hence, many are keen on the booster dose,” said Subhashis Datta, general manager operations at Ruby Hospitals. AMRI officials said the infection rate among the fully vaccinated HCW group across the three Kolkata units has came down drastically to just about 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/booster-shot-demand-rises-hosp-body-to-appeal-to-govt/articleshow/87807188.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The police were informed at 4.15am. Ajit Yadav, the child’s father, tried to cover up the matter by promising to bear all treatment expenses of injured Vicky and clandestinely rushed him to a couple of private hospitals, which refused to admit him. Then he took Vicky to the PMCH where the doctors declared him dead at around 3.30am, Ram Krishna Nagar police station SHO Jehangir Khan said. One Pinku Kumar (23) and his maternal uncle Pappu Yadav (42) were involved in celebratory firing in the party using countrymade pistols. The SHO said Vicky received injury in his head by the shot allegedly fired by Pinku. He said Pinku and Pappu are Ajit’s neighbours. Police said a video of Pinku dancing with the pistol in the party has also gone viral. He said Vicky had lost his parents in childhood and was brought up by his maternal grandfather Dayanand Singh at Pipra. Around 250 guests had gathered at Ajit’s residence where dancers and DJ were hired for the guests. “At least two to three crucial hours were lost in an attempt to cover up the incident, otherwise the man could have survived,” the SHO said. He said police visited the crime spot in the morning and found bloodstains at several places. “Vicky’s grandfather has lodged an FIR against Pinku, Pappu and Ajit. They are evading arrest,” he said. The SHO said the body was cremated after autopsy at PMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-in-celebratory-firing-at-a-birthday-party/articleshow/87806401.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Friday issued an advisory, making it mandatory for all hotels, banquet halls and dhabas to install CCTV cameras so that their footage could be obtained in case of any complaint. All SDOs, SDPOs and SHOs have been asked to keep watch on celebrations being organised at banquet halls and hotels and take immediate action against violators of liquor law. Agarwal will hold a meeting with hotel and restaurant authorities on Monday in the presence of IG, DM and SSP of Patna and ask them to ensure effective implementation of the prohibition law. Representatives of about 100 hotels, lodges and banquet halls are expected to attend the meeting. “All these venues will be asked to get a signed declaration on a printed proforma that none of their guests, even from other states or countries, would consume liquor during the get-together. Hotel managements would also have to keep watch on their staff, including waiters, to ensure that they do not serve liquor to the guests,” Agarwal told this newspaper. He also asked the authorities concerned to put up hoardings at all important chowks, crossroads and other places making people aware of the prohibition rules. These hoardings will also bear the toll-free number 15545/18003456268 for sharing information on production, storage, sale and consumption of liquor.

---||Pune||Devotees throng gurdwaras to celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti||PUNE: Guru Nanak Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the first Sikh guru and the founder of Sikhism, was celebrated with great fervour on Friday at various gurdwaras in Pune as well as in Pimpri Chinchwad. Footfalls at many gurdwaras were the highest in the last two years. Around 50,000-60,000 people turned up throughout the day at Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar in Camp. Mohindev Singh Kandhari, the PRO of the gurdwara, said, “We started distributing langar, comprising dal, rice, sabji, roti, accompanied by special festive preparation of kheer, from 11am and continued throughout the day till late at night. The crowd enjoyed the kirtan sessions by artists, who came from Amritsar and Delhi.” A representative of a gurdwara in Khadki said it was the busiest day for the institution sine the pandemic began, and the footfalls almost matched the pre-Covid numbers. “We always go to the gurdwara together as a family. After offering prayers, we meet friends and relatives there and sit down for langar. However, since senior citizens are discouraged from visiting crowded places, I and my husband decided to pray at home,” said Ramnik Kohli, a resident of Lohegaon. Manmeet Singh, a resident of Lullanagar, said, “The highlight of the celebration is preparation of different types of halwas made from sooji , carrot, wheat, almonds and jaggery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/devotees-throng-gurdwaras-to-celebrate-guru-nanak-jayanti/articleshow/87806942.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Once, we get clarity from the state authorities, the zoo will be reopened. Covid norms and guidelines will be followed for entry of citizens visiting the zoo,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, the Pune Municipal Corporation’s additional commissioner. According to PMC officials, the decision to restart the facility was not been taken due to the lockdown. Zoo officials said they were demanding the facility be restarted as all other facilities have opened. “Precautionary measures can be taken to start the facility. The PMC will make the declaration about it after due diligence. The zoo management has put forth its demand to the PMC to reopen the facility from December,” a senior official of the zoo said. According to zoo’s data, nearly 7,000 to 12,000 people used to visit the facility every day. The number was high during the weekends. According to the zoo’s data, it has nearly 440 animals of 63 different species. A total of 25 staff members directly get in touch with these animals. They include zoo keepers and veterinary doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/katraj-zoo-may-reopen-next-month/articleshow/87806948.cms||---

This is the first time that such a huge crowd will be turning up at Eden since the pandemic and cops have suggested that CAB appeals to spectators to arrive around 5pm, at least two hours before the match starts. Both CAB and Kolkata Police held internal meetings on Friday and took a few decisions. Cops have increased parking space, stretching from Gangasagar grounds till the Basketball grounds to enforce social distancing. “We have kept two categories of parking stickers — green and pink — for those parking opposite Eden Gardens and a portion of the Bangabasi grounds. All other stickers have been done away with. We are aware that a larger number of spectators will be using private transport and, hence, we have made arrangements accordingly,” said joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey. Officers said they will not let too many people inside at one go. “The instruction is that people will enter in batches. This has to be followed even if the match starts. We are asking everyone to reach early. We also have a few plans for dispersal,” said an officer. Sources said they have discussed the plan with CAB. “We will have an adequate presence inside and outside the stadium. We are not reducing our numbers from the usual IPL fixtures even through the crowd could be smaller,” said a source. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said each officer in charge of the stadium has been briefed about a specific role. While CAB president Avishek Dalmiya was unavailable for comments due to the multiple meetings, CAB officials said all government norms related to Covid will be followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/early-entry-more-parking-space-focus-on-crowd-mgmt/articleshow/87807203.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||RIL, Aramco will re-evaluate investment in oil-to-chemical business||MUMBAI: Reliance Industries (RIL) and Saudi Aramco have decided to “re-evaluate” the latter’s proposed $15-billion investment in the Indian company’s oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. Consequently, the country’s largest company by market value will pull out its application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for segregating the O2C business from itself. The re-evaluation follows RIL’s “evolving” energy business play, which includes its recent moves in solar power. It plans to make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing even as it targets to become net carbon zero by 2035. In a media release issued late Friday night, RIL said that, due to the evolving nature of its business portfolio, the company and Saudi Aramco have mutually determined that it would be “beneficial for both parties to re-evaluate the proposed investment in O2C business in light of the changed context”. Two years ago, RIL announced that Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL’s O2C unit for $15 billion. As part of the deal, Saudi Aramco would get one seat on the board of RIL and the right to appoint its executives in key managerial positions in the O2C unit. But the Saudi Aramco investment got delayed due to the pandemic and its impact on energy demand. The Indian company, however, recently appointed Saudi Aramco chairman and governor of the Kingdom’s wealth fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on its board. The engagement over the last two years has given both RIL and Saudi Aramco a greater understanding of each other, providing a platform for broader areas of cooperation, the Indian company’s statement read. Analysts interpreted that Saudi Aramco could look at investing in RIL’s larger portfolio, including O2C and renewable energy & new materials businesses. The Indian company’s facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which accounts for a major part of RIL’s O2C assets, is envisaged to be the centre for its renewable energy and new materials play. Like RIL, Saudi Aramco too is pivoting towards green energy. In June this year, RIL announced that it will make a Rs 75,000-crore investment in clean energy over three years. Later, it bought Norway’s REC Solar and India’s Sterling and Wilson Solar. RIL’s Friday statement further said that it shall continue to be Saudi Aramco’s preferred partner for investments in India’s private sector. RIL and the Kingdom have an over two-decade-old relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from Saudi Aramco for many years and the latter, through its wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF), investing in the Indian company’s retail, telecom (Jio) and fibre-optic units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-aramco-will-re-evaluate-investment-in-oil-to-chem-biz/articleshow/87808138.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||RBI’s proposals restrict e-loans to regulated companies||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s proposed e-lending norms will impact many digital lenders who take on credit risk while distributing loans for others as these arrangements may be banned. The regulations, which stop short of bringing under the RBI umbrella entities that facilitate lending using technology, want to do away with non-lenders providing guarantees for loans. While this reduces systemic risk build-up through off-balance sheet lending by unregulated players, it still leaves a grey area for unregulated entities to operate as distributors. The RBI report notes that banks have lent Rs 1.1 lakh crore through digital mode, while NBFCs have advanced Rs 23,000 crore through this route. Most of these are in the form of unsecured personal loans for a couple of thousand rupees. But these have a short tenure and result in a high portfolio churn. According to a report by Macquarie, while many digital lenders will be hit, Paytm is safe as it does not engage in lending arrangements where it provides a first loss default guarantee (FLDG) to the actual lenders. “The report recommends that all fintech loans must be reported directly to credit bureaus. It also prohibits credit risk-sharing between fintech and banks/NBFCs in the form of FLDG agreements,” said Macquarie Capital associate director Suresh Ganapathy in the report. He added that while Paytm is in the clear here as it plans to act as a pure distributor for consumer loans, several players in the fintech industry for whom this is a norm will be severely impacted. While the RBI aims to ban fintech platforms, determining which guarantees are for credit risks might be tricky as all lenders seek a certain level of indemnity from service providers. “Even where FLDG arrangements are not there, lenders do have an agreement with the distributor to indemnify them from any loss caused by the action of the agent or the employee. This does not mean that the distributor is taking on credit risk. The challenge will be in distinguishing such clauses from a default guarantee,” said Sandeep Srinivasa, founder of microlending startup Red Carpet. “The proposals will demolish many existing loan sharks and curb unfair practices. Moreover, the recommendation for digital lenders to provide a key fact statement in a standardised format, including the annual percentage rate, will give a better perspective to borrowers about the high percentage rate they are willing to bear,” said Gaurav Chopra, founder & CEO of IndiaLends, and founding member of the Digital Lending Association of India (DLAI). In 2019, a high-level committee on micro, small and medium enterprises headed by former Sebi chairman U K Sinha had recommended loan service providers (LSPs). The Sinha panel had said that the regulator must create this new category of LSPs, which will be an agent of the borrowers. The LSPs offering individualised advice should act in borrowers’ best interest, respecting fiduciary duties of disclosure, loyalty, and prudence. Similarly, lender agents like direct selling agents (DSAs) and brokers should be required to disclose conflicts that compromise their impartiality, such as incentives from lenders to market higher-priced loans over others, and clearly break out the fees they add to the loans. However, the proposal for loan service providers was not taken up. “The RBI report has suggested that web aggregator of loans products be subjected to discipline and code of conduct. Regulating aggregators would have been a positive for the industry as this still leaves entities to operate outside regulation,” said another digital lender who did not want to be named. Signzy Tech co-founder & CEO Ankit Rata said, “Currently, the industry is seeing many unregulated digital lenders operating in the space who do not even have basic KYC checks in place. We believe that if the recommendations are passed, it will not only help protect consumers but also restrict breaches of data privacy while curbing fraudulent transactions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-proposals-restrict-e-loans-to-regulated-cos/articleshow/87807816.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Colleges start fee refund for cancelled admissions||KOLKATA: Colleges have started the process of refunding fees to candidates who have cancelled their admissions to undergraduate courses after securing admission in another college or university. Colleges have asked candidates who want to cancel their admission to submit a written application with payment details and date of cancellation. Some colleges have even sought explanation from these students for holding back the seat before ultimately deciding to cancel. According to University Grants Commission norms, students who cancelled their admissions before October 31 will get a full refund. Anybody cancelling their admission after that will have to take a deduction of Rs 1,000 as processing fee. At Maulana Azad College, candidates must submit the application for refund by November 30, principal Subhasis Dutta said. Candidates seeking refund of admission fee will have to write all the details about their admission and submit them at the entry gate of the college along with attested copies of bank challans, admission cancellation receipt and a cancelled cheque. The college has also requested the students to mention why they held back the seat for so long before cancelling, but this will not affect the fee refund. Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, too, has started the process of refunding admission fee. “The students have mailed us the details. We are making the refunds,” said college principal Asok Mukhopadhyay. Students scored high marks in all the board examinations this year on the basis of various computation methods that were used as examinations could not be held due to the second wave of the pandemic. At the time of application to undergraduate courses, students applied to multiple colleges and in different subjects, including those they weren’t to keen to study. As a result, seats in most colleges got blocked and students who actually wanted to pursue those subjects had to wait till the others cancelled their admissions. The education department had to extend the deadline for admission to undergraduate courses multiple times because colleges could not fill up their seats. Some colleges have again opened their admission portals to invite fresh applications to fill the vacancies. “Since the government waived application fee, students applied to several colleges and subjects. That locked our seats. Towards the end of September, almost 20% seats were vacant when students finally started cancelling admissions. Thankfully, the government extended the deadline and we could fill up some seats,” said a principal of a government college who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-start-fee-refund-for-cancelled-admissions/articleshow/87807180.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Leader of opposition in the state legislative assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, cornered the state government on the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. Soon after the Jharjharpur incident came to the notice of the RJD leader, he tweeted, “There is complete administrative anarchy in the state. The law and order machinery has virtually collapsed and people have been left to fend for themselves.” Tejashwi alleged that criminal activities have gained alarming proportions in Madhubani during the stint of the incumbent SP Satya Prakash, who has close connections in the corridors of power. He further alleged that loot, murder, kidnapping and rape have become a routine affair in Madhubani. “Yet he continues to enjoy his posting in the district,” the RJD leader said, adding that ‘everybody is aware of ‘Nalanda model’. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra on Friday squarely blamed Nitish, who also holds the home portfolio, for such a sorry state of affair. “This is virtually the climax of lawlessness in the state. The incident shows how police have become ‘nirankush’ and ‘arajak’,” he said. “The police have shirked from their prime duty and responsibility. Imagine the situation when the police go amok. How they will behave with common people when judicial officers are not spared,” he added. Referring to the murder of an RTI activist-cum-journalist in Madhubani, Mishra said the accountability of the erring police officers should be fixed in such serious offences. The police have failed to arrest the real culprits, he lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oppn-netas-corner-cm-over-assault-on-jhanjharpur-adj/articleshow/87806546.cms||Ramashankar

Visitors were seen clicking selfies in and around the gurdwara. General secretary of Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee, Sardar Indarjit Singh, said the number of devotees could be between 18,000 and 20,000. “They are mainly from Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The Sikh devotees are happy with the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor because Guru Nanak Dev ji had spent 17 years of his life in Kartarpur and even worked as a farmer,” he added Sardar Daljit Singh, superintendent of the prabandhak committee, said, “Chief Justice of Patna high court Sanjay Karol, IAS officer Harjot Kaur and many other dignitaries reached the gurudwara and offered prayers to the first Sikh guru. Trilok Singh of Delhi, Gurmeet Singh of Dehradun and Indarjit Singh Fakkar participated in bhajan-kirtan.” Singh said it being the day of Kartik Purnima, hundreds of Hindu devotees who reached the Ganga ghat for holy dip also offered prayers at the gurdwara and joined the langar. In the evening, the Hukmnama of Guru Granth Sahib was read out to devotees. Since the Patna DM had directed the prabandhak committee to follow Covid protocols, several gurdwara officials were seen advising people to maintain distance and wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/thousands-offer-prayers-at-gurdwara-on-prakash-parv/articleshow/87806411.cms||VK Tripathi

As per the earlier schedule, SA-1 was scheduled to be held from December 1. “In view of circumstances explained by the State Gazetted Headmasters Association, Hyderabad and Telangana Recognized School Managements Association (TRSMA), Hyderabad, the issue of re-scheduling of SA-1 has been examined and it is decided to reschedule the exams from December 14 to December 20,” read a circular from DSE. The DSE, vide a circular, directed the district education officers in the state to take necessary action to conduct the SA-1 for class 1 to class 10 students on the said dates. According to TRSMA members, the exams have been rescheduled as most of the schools are yet to complete the syllabus. “It’s been only two-and-half months since students started coming back to physical classes after a gap of more than one-and-half years. It’s taking more time to complete the syllabus as teachers have to start again from basics so as to ensure that students understand various topics,” said S Srinivas Reddy of TRSMA.

There was trace rainfall on the outskirts, but the mostly cloudy conditions made the day humid with relative humidity reaching around 60-90% in many locations in the city on Friday evening. The humidity coupled with no rainfall resulted in marginally higher real-feel temperature in Pune on Friday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at IMD-Pune, told TOI that the city/district reported 6-7 okta clouds with moderately high humidity levels on Friday. “The light rain forecast stands for the city due to the prevailing systems. Rainfall evaded Pune till Friday evening due to the direction and speed in which the weather systems (that were to cause the rains) were moving,” he said. A well-marked low-pressure area over east-central Arabian Sea, with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 5.8 km above mean sea level, has been affected weather in the state. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over the same region in the next 24 hours. The trough from the cyclonic circulation associated with the above system from east-central Arabian Sea to west Madhya Pradesh across north Maharashtra also persists. Kashyapi said that the systems are likely to cause light rains, thunder, and lightning activity in parts of the state, especially south Maharashtra, till November 23. Light thundershowers in Pune have still not been ruled out, he said. “Rains and cloudy weather are likely to recede from Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune city/district, after November 23. By November 25, the city may see a drop in night temperatures,” he said. Pune, which recorded a day temperature of 30.4°C and a minimum temperature of 21.5°CC on Friday, would see the latter dipping to 19°C around November 25, as per the IMD forecast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rainfall-elusive-cloudy-skies-up-humidity-in-city/articleshow/87806957.cms||---

The transactions happened between 1.30am and 1.50am on November 16. After confirming with the bank, the sexagenarian on Thursday filed a complaint with the Dattawadi police. The complainant told TOI he came to know about the fraud in the morning. “I received four messages from the bank about the debit of the money from my bank account,” he said. The complainant said that by using the details of his credit card, the fraudsters first transferred Rs 12 lakh to a company. “My credit card is linked with my bank account. After they reached the credit card limit, the crooks transferred Rs 8 lakh from my bank account to my credit card,” he said. He said they also transferred amounts from his fixed deposit in the bank to his savings account, and subsequently to the credit card. “In total, I have lost Rs 21.11 lakh to the fraudsters,” he said. The complainant said he did not receive any OTP for the transactions. He never shared any details to unknown person. “The transactions happened when I was asleep,” he said. Inspector Vijay Khomane of the Dattawadi police told TOI, “Prima facie it was a case of card cloning. The complainant claimed he did not share any details with unknown persons.

The institute will also be creating a digital repository of the traditional artifacts to trace the design evolution of the Ojha craft. Deepak John Mathew, department of design, IIT-H, along with his team, has conducted a design intervention workshop on Dhokra crafts of Ojha Gonds of Adilabad as a part of an ongoing project ‘Tangible and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Telangana’ supported by Science and Heritage Research Initiative Programme, Design Innovation Centre and Institutional Innovation Centre, IIT-H. The workshop focussed on training the younger generations of the Ojha community in the traditional Dhokra crafts under the supervision and training of the master craftsman who was chosen from the Ojha community. Traditionally, the artifacts were majorly created for the ritualistic purposes of the Raj Gonds, which is a part of the intangible cultural heritage of the Raj Gonds of Telangana. “We define IIT-H as Inventing and Innovating in Technology for Humanity. Preserving Dhokra using the design concept and encouraging future generations to sustain it fulfills our motto. IIT-H also has a rural development centre to uplift the rural livelihood with the aid of technology,” said BS Murty, director, IIT-H. The institute will be creating a digital repository of all the artifacts created in the workshop by using photogrammetry and 3D digital printing which will be useful for the researchers for further studies as well as for the visitors from all over the world to get insights into the cultural heritage of the Raj Gonds and associated communities and their traditional practices. The digital museum is being intended to preserve the traditional artifacts with the non-destructive methods where the original artifacts will remain with the community and 3D printed artifacts will be served to fulfill the knowledge sharing purpose on the cultural heritage of Telangana at the global level, where the museum can be visited virtually from anywhere in the world, an IIT-H release read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-endeavour-aims-to-preserve-dhokra-craft-digital-repository-of-artifacts-to-trace-design-evolution/articleshow/87807637.cms||---

Around 3pm on Friday, Shripal was seen sitting inside his truck accessories shop, but there were no customers. “For the last one year, my business has been suffering. I used to earn Rs 5,000-10,000 daily, but now my sales are a mere Rs 400-500 per day,” he said. Shripal said he would welcome any decision that would end this protest and the farmers leave the border. “My family is dependent on the shop,” he added. Dinesh Kumar was seen standing inside a car accessories shop and talking to other shopkeepers. “I used to sell ice cubes and slabs earlier, but after the protest started I lost my customers. It is a welcome step by the Prime Minister as it will help us in reviving our business,” he said. Shyam Singh, who works in a cloth store near the protest site, said, “If the roads are opened, then the public will come to our store to purchase clothes.” A few meters away from the cloth store there were small garages. In one of them, Dinesh was playing cards with the mechanics and other shopkeepers. “I remember there was a time when we were extremely busy handling customers, selling oil and repairing vehicles. Now, we have hardly any work, so we spend time playing cards,” he said. “In the past one year, I had only heard that various meetings were going on and some solution would come to end the stir, but nothing happened. How can I believe any announcement now? I have also heard that the farmers will continue their stir till the government scraps the laws in Parliament,” added Dinesh. Other garage owners and mechanics said the situation would change for them the day the protesters leave the border. Satender Singh, a petrol pump owner, said he was suffering loss since the agitation began. Asked whether he was happy with the government’s decision, he said he would be happy only when his business picked up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shopkeepers-and-traders-hope-to-resume-business/articleshow/87807646.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||Crackdown starts in Kolkata: 10 app cab drivers fined, 33 under lens||KOLKATA: Ten app cab drivers have been fined by traffic police in the past week for demanding a higher fare or behaving rudely with customers. Thirty-three others have been identified and are likely to be called to the police headquarters at Lalbazar. As police could not fine app cab drivers for refusal due to certain techno-legal constraints, they were penalizing drivers for being rude or asking for extra money, said an officer. The police action comes in the wake of multiple complaints from app cab passengers against drivers, who demand more than the fare or refused to report for the ride. Very often, drivers call up riders after bookings are made to ask about the destination, just like metered cabs do when hailed down. Many of them also want to know about the mode of payment. If the destinations are not to their liking or the mode of payment is not cash, many of them refuse the ride but they decline to cancel the bookings as that would draw a penalty. In certain complaints, riders said seven-eight drivers had cancelled trips, leaving them stranded for prolonged periods till a driver finally obliged. Police said they had also received complaints about drivers charging extra. “We are telling app-cab drivers that they cannot misbehave with riders. Those guilty are being identified, cautioned and even prosecuted,” a police officer said. Senior cops had earlier advised aggrieved passengers to take screenshots of their bookings and report refusals. Since then, cops have been swamped with complaints, which are being forwarded to the special raid section. Kolkata Traffic Police said it was seeking help of its legal cell on how to book refusal cases by public transport aggregators. In Hyderabad, the Cyberabad Police threatened aggregators with abetment charges if they declined to disclose the details of refusal cases. Police in Kolkata also plan to ask all app cab aggregators to share their cancellation policies. “We will ask about the permit provisions. An app cab is not like a normal state carriage, which can be flagged down on the road. It is booked through an app service, where app cab companies are not even owners of the vehicles. Hence, they enter into a contract with multiple clauses with their driver partners. Once we have studied the documents, we will ask app cab companies how they intended to address the issue and then spell out our measures,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crackdown-starts-10-app-cab-drivers-fined-33-under-lens/articleshow/87806967.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Trichy||Trichy: Solution in sight for Melapudur railway subway’s inundation woes||TRICHY: Facing strong criticism for poor maintenance of the railway subway at Melapudur in the city, the state highways department has initiated a permanent solution to prevent rainwater from inundating the subway. Two additional high-power motor pumps were installed in the subway that can even displace sludge in a short span. A new minor drain is also being built to prevent run-off water from entering the carriageway. Connecting Gandhi Market and Chathiram bus stand with Trichy central bus stand and railway junction, Melapudur subway is heavily used by the residents. However, even during a mild rain, it gets inundated with knee-level water as the run-off water from adjoining high-level localities storms the subway. Although the subway has six motor pumps to drain rainwater, officials said that time consumption was high. Citing inundation, cars and two-wheelers skip the subway, only to cause severe traffic congestions in other parts of the city including Cantonment and Palakkarai. It is in this backdrop that the highways department installed two high-power motor pumps costing Rs 7 lakh each. “The newly installed pumps with 100 mm diameter pipes can even suck the sludge and silt from the subway along with the rainwater. Within an hour, the pumps can remove the stagnated water,” a senior official with the department told TOI. This is the first time that the department has installed such ‘sludge’ pumps in the city. As the number of motor pumps has increased to eight now, officials said traffic snarls due to flooding will be streamlined. The subway has a well on either side to store the drawn rainwater from where the surplus will be discharged to drains. “We will also construct a small drain along the walls of the subway so that water seeping from the adjacent areas will be diverted to the sump. The carriageway will remain dry,” the official added. As the surplus water from adjacent areas was seeping into the carriageway, the subway gets slippery causing two-wheelers to skid. The small drain constructed will prevent the condition, the officials claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/solution-in-sight-for-melapudur-rly-subways-inundation-woes/articleshow/87807636.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||India||Farm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'||NEW DELHI: Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash. Reforms are now more likely to be pursued at the state level, with BJP governments expected to take the lead, but the effort to bring about market integration will be hurt in the absence of uniformity. Moreover, with farm reforms now likely to move in bits and pieces, the pace might be slow for those farmers who actually stand to benefit in the short to medium-term. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament."No government will now dare to bring much needed comprehensive reforms in the farm sector in the coming 50 years and majority of the farmers would now remain poor," Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee on contentious farm laws, told TOI. Read AlsoFarm laws repealed, PM Modi appeals protesting farmers to return home: Key pointsPM Narendra Modi on Friday announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. Addressing the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, the Prime Minister said the three laws were for the benefit of farmersCalling the decision "quite unfortunate", Ghanwat, president of the Swatantra Bharat Paksha (political arm of the Maharashtra-based group Shetkari Sanghatana), said, "This (move to repeal) is the most regressive step by PM Modi as he chose politics over farmers' welfare. If the government had to repeal it, why would it wait for so long?" Government sources, however, drew a parallel with the abandonment of the land acquisition amendments in 2014-15 and said solutions were found through state-level changes. They said the reforms had in any case been stayed by the Supreme Court and the agitation was only creating more doubts. Ghanwat, who was on his way to Delhi, said he would meet other two members of the Committee -Ashok Gulati and P K Joshi - on Monday and take a call on making the report of the panel, submitted to the SC in March, public, saying those recommendations may help the new committee which the PM said would be set up for looking into different aspects of farming and issues relating to minimum support price (MSP). Officials in the agriculture ministry and other advocates of reforms too think the process would now get into the mode of the past practices of forming one after another panel without actually any result.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-govt-will-dare-to-bring-full-reforms/articleshow/87808895.cms||Vishwa Mohan

At least 3,000 delegates — film enthusiasts and industry personalities — will converge in Panaji for Iffi 2021. The number of delegates on ground has been curtailed to be able to maintain Covid protocols. However, besides the 3,000, a few thousand will watch the screenings, masterclasses and other events virtually, as Iffi 2021 is being conducted in a hybrid format. Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur will inaugurate the festival. “We have put up a huge set as an attraction for the opening ceremony,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday evening, after reviewing the opening ceremony preparations at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium. “Goans and guests coming from across India and abroad will be able to participate in an amazing festival of a massive scale this year. It is the first international event being hosted by Goa, since Covid. We will host the event following all Covid protocols and norms. It is a challenge that our entire government machinery has accepted.” The previous Iffi was delayed and held in January 2021 in a muted manner, due to the raging pandemic at the time. Only around 300 guests are expected to attend the opening ceremony on Saturday afternoon. “The 52nd Iffi has many new things to offer. There were many challenges as Iffi is being held amidst a pandemic. Yet, efforts were made to get the biggest global films to the Iffi platform. It will also be the first time that the BRICS film festival will take place parallel to Iffi,” said Thakur, after arriving in Goa on Friday evening. Minister of state for information & broadcasting L Murugan will also be present at the opening ceremony. Renowned Indian actress and MP, Hema Malini, will participate in the opening ceremony, as she will be presented with the Indian film personality of the year 2021 award at the event. Lyricist and chairperson, CBFC, Prasoon Joshi, will be handed the same award on the closing day of Iffi. “Due to Covid, our seating capacity for the opening ceremony is limited, but Goans should not get disheartened. We have to follow SOPs and guidelines, so they may enjoy the festival from home. They can participate in the festival later, over the next eight days,” said vice-chairperson of the Entertainment Society of Goa, Subhash Phaldesai. The entire eight-day event is being hosted at a cost of nearly Rs 28 crore, pitched in both by the Centre and the state. Following the inaugural ceremony, the Spanish language film ‘The King of all the World’ (El Rey de Todo El Mundo), directed by Carlos Saura, will be screened as Iffi 2021’s opening film at Inox. Among the other invitees at the opening ceremony are Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, Ritesh Deshmukh, Genelia Deshmukh, and Shraddha Kapoor. Iffi this year will showcase over 300 films from across the globe. Filmmaker Karan Johar and television personality Manish Paul will host the opening event. Iffi will feature 148 films from about 73 countries in the international section with about 12 world premieres, about 7 international premieres, 26 Asia premieres and around 64 India premieres. The festival received 624 films from 95 countries this time, up from 69 countries in the previous edition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iffi-goas-1st-intl-event-since-covid-starts-today/articleshow/87807651.cms||---

Other than sharing the statements of Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda, most of the party leaders, MLAs or MPs refrained from expressing their own views/comments on social media.TOI called up party leaders, but they either didn’t respond or refused to comment on the subject. None of the BJP state leaders had an inkling of the PM’s move; they all learnt of it only when the announcement was made at 9 am from Delhi.Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, Kailash Choudhary who has been leaving no stone unturned to count the benefits of farm laws, chose to get away from the media in Jodhpur by stating, “Modi ji’s move is in the interest of the nation and the farmers”. He had a busy day on twitter accusing the Gehlot government of poor power connections, greeting Union minister Kiren Rijiju on his birthday etc. When it comes to the major announcement on farm laws, he retweeted or forwarded the tweets of Modi, Shah, Nadda and the official Twitter account of BJP, but did not offer his comments. BJP state president Satish Poonia who was on the fore batting for the three farm laws did offer his comment in the form of one ambiguous tweet. Throughout the day he forwarded the tweets of his central leaders on the subject. He extensively travelled across the length and breadth of the state calling the farm laws ‘masterstroke by Modi’ ‘game changer for farmers’ or ‘doubling farmers income’ didn’t come up with his one-liners in support of the repeal. Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari makes five tweets related to the zero budget farming committee on MSP announced by Modi but had nothing to say on the repelling of the Act. Other leaders like leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria and deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Singh Rathore were largely silent. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-leaders-largely-mum-on-pms-move/articleshow/87807649.cms||---

The accused had touched the child’s cheeks and chest. While he claimed he had bumped into her by mistake after he slipped on the road and had apologised, the child and her mother told court that when they protested he had said, “Ha, kiya to kiya.” Refuting his defence, special judge H C Shende said, “Every woman has inherited bashfulness and she knows the difference between such an intentional act of molestation and the act of an innocent person, and act out of a mistake. Certainly, the victim felt ashamed and realized his act was intentional.” The court also observed that since there was no enmity between the child and the accused, it did not find any reason to disbelieve her testimony.  “There was no reason for the informant (mother) and victim to create a false story against the accused for filing a baseless FIR and put their character at stake, and invite humiliation from society,” the court said. Special public prosecutor Geeta Malankar cited evidence of six witnesses, including the child and her mother, to seek his conviction. The mother and daughter told court that on March 11, 2019, at 7.45pm, when they were about to enter a shop, the accused came from the front and molested the girl. The mother pushed him away, shouted at him and sought help from people at the spot. They caught the accused and beat him up. The mother and another person who she knew from the crowd took the accused away from the mob. They went to the police station and an FIR was lodged. The accused was taken in custody. While sentencing him, the court said the gravity of the offence was more since the incident took place in a public place. It said there was a need of giving adequate punishment to send the true message to such persons who are taking disadvantage of innocence of such victims. The accused was also fined Rs3,000. The money if recovered, will be paid to the child as compensation.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan’s own agri bills still pending with governor Kalraj Mishra||JAIPUR: Rajasthan was among the few states that introduced its own bills to counter the Centre’s three farm laws to protect farmers’ interests. The Essential Commodities bill 2020, the Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services bill 2020 and the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce bill 2020 — were passed by the Rajasthan assembly last October. The bills were designed to either nullify or provide viable options to farmers against the provisions of the Centre’s farm laws. The state bills are, however, pending with governor Kalraj Mishra, before they would go to the President for his assent. Sources said that the repeal of the three controversial farm laws would make many of the provisions in these bills irrelevant but still, the state would push them since they have certain provisions safeguarding the interests of the farmers. Following Congress’ Central leaders’ direction of exploring the legal routes to counter the farm bills, Punjab and Rajasthan moved three bills for the same. “Gehlot has been pushing Mishra for the bills to be moved to the President in almost all of his visits to the governor house since last October,” said a source at the governor house. The main provision of the bill which was played by the Congress leaders is granting farmers a farming agreement that will be valid only if the price of the product is equal to or greater than the prevailing minimum support price. “The provision of imprisonment of 3-7 years without penalty if any person or corporate harasses the farmers,” reads the bill. The bills invited sharp reactions from Central government which had accused Gehlot government of crossing the line of cooperative federalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/states-own-agri-bills-still-pending-with-guv-mishra/articleshow/87807643.cms||---

They are now hiring couriers who tie drug packets on their legs and use public transport such as buses to move from one city to another. In the recent past, police have made arrests in various districts including Bhilwara, Chittorgarh and Jodhpur in which the smugglers were found concealing the packets in their legs. CID-CB wing, Narcotics Control Bureau and the district police in Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Jalore and Jodhpur are continuously working to crack down on the smugglers. “On Wednesday, our team caught a man who had tied opium packets on his legs and thighs. He was intercepted and arrested while he was moving in a bus. He was nabbed with 1kg of opium,” said an officer of Bhilwara police on Thursday. The accused was nabbed by a team of Rayla police station area. “Based on a specific input, thus we raided a bus in which we found Leeladhar Sharma with illegal possession of 1kg of opium,” said a senior officer. According to an estimate by Bhilwara and Chittorgarh police, at least two dozen such cases were cracked by them. “They use this trick to evade arrest.

However, they said protest will continue till farm laws were formally repealed in the parliament and a law was passed to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce.They stated that it was a victory of democracy and farmers, a one-year-long movement, and a defeat of dictatorship. In a statement, the Rajasthan wing of Samyunkt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stated it will wait for the announcement to take effect through appropriate parliamentary procedures. "If this happens, it will be a historic victory for the farmers’ movement that has been going on for a year. However, around 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The stubbornness of the central government is responsible for these avoidable deaths, including the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre," it stated."SKM also wants to remind the Prime Minister that the farmers’ movement is not just about repealing the three black laws, but also ensuring legal guarantee of MSP for all agricultural produce. This important demand of the farmers is still pending. Similarly, the Electricity Amendment bill is yet to be withdrawn," the statement issued by Sanjay Madhav added.Rajasthan’s peasant leaders, such as Rajaram Meel, Ram Pal Jat and Himmat Singh, also welcomed the decision of the Centre, but emphasised their demand to ensure a legal guarantee of MSP for agricultural produce. Convenor of Hanumangarh’s Grameen Kiaan Majdoor Samity (GKS), Ranjit Singh Raju, said, "This is a victory of democracy and the defeat of dictatorship. This is a good sign for the whole country. We will continue our protest till the farm laws are repealed in the Parliament and a gazette notification is issued in this regard. Laws should be framed respecting the sentiments of the people of the country."Ram Pal Jat of Kisan Mahasabha said, "This is a huge victory of the farmers’ long movement. The Prime Minister should legalise MSP now. Regardless of the pressure under which he (the PM) made this announcement, this is in the right direction. The fact that he said the laws would be repealed in the next session of parliament can’t be disbelieved." Another farmer leader, Himmat Singh, said, "The protest at Shahjahanpur will continue till the farm laws are repealed in Parliament and MSP is legalised. Also, this is a victory for the movement and all those martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for this struggle." Rajaram Meel, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said, "They (government) succumbed under pressure because they (BJP) knew they would be defeated in upcoming elections (Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and other states)."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unions-hail-decision-say-stir-over-msp-to-continue/articleshow/87807656.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The transfer order was issued on Thursday night following a complaint lodged with the civic body’s solid waste management department by a manager of a commercial store. In his complaint, the store manager alleged that the KMC official had demanded money for collection of garbage from the store and when refused, dumped waste in front of the store. According to a KMC official, the civic top brass took the complaint seriously and decided to transfer the overseer to a borough located in the southern fringe. However, the owner of the store was also asked to pay requisite fees as applicable for collection of wastes from a commercial establishment. According to the KMC board of administrators member overseeing the civic body’s solid waste management department Debabrata Majumdar, though the matter was serious, it was a stray case and a section of the traders or businessmen was to blame for inviting troubles. “Instead of paying requisite fees for collection of wastes to the civic body’s coffer, a section of traders insists on making payments to individual officials who oversee the garbage removal of a particular commercial zone. We won’t spare our errant employees, we shall also keep a vigil over the owners of commercial establishments who won’t pay the fees to the civic body,” Majumdar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-shunts-solid-waste-overseer-seeking-bribe/articleshow/87806979.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore Medical College Hospital doctors remove needle from girl’s neck||COIMBATORE: Doctors of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital gave a new lease of life to a 19-year-old girl by removing a 7.5-cm-long sewing needle from her neck. The girl was brought to the hospital a fortnight ago with self-inflicted neck injuries. “Though she was treated for the wounds, the girl complained of neck pain. A scan revealed presence of a sharp foreign body. The needle had penetrated trachea and passed through c4-c5 vertebra and located close to an artery. It was no less than a miracle that it dodged vertebral artery and neural foramina. Had it puncture the artery, she would have died within minutes,” head of the department of ENT Dr Ali Sulthan told TOI. Doctors discussed the case and decided to conduct a surgery a week ago. “It was a challenging case given the location of the needle. It was closely abutting right vertebral artery, which carry blood to the brain and spine and right neural foramina, which is a critical structure in the spine that contain nerve roots,” the doctor said. A team consisting of Sulthan, ENT assistant professor Dr M Nallasivam, Neurosurgery HoD Dr Venkatesh, associate professor of neurosurgery Dr Anandha Shanmugaraj, Anesthesiology HoD Dr Kalyasundaram and anesthetist Dr M Sathya conducted the surgery. “The process of removing the foreign body was complicated. The latest C- arm x-ray helped us to locate it,” Sulthan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-docs-remove-needle-from-girls-neck/articleshow/87807661.cms||---
---||Jaipur||A victory of democracy & defeat of arrogance: Gehlot||Jaipur: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to repeal the three controversial farm laws on Friday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot termed the development a “victory of democracy” and “defeat of arrogance”. Gehlot claimed that the Modi government has taken this decision out of panic in view of the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.“The announcement of repealing all the three black agricultural laws is a victory of democracy and defeat of the arrogance of the Modi government. This is a victory for the patience of the farmers who have been agitating for the last one year,” Gehlot tweeted.“I bow to all the farmers who sacrificed their lives in the farmers’ movement. This is the victory of their sacrifice,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Friday morning announced that the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year. While talking to reporters at the Rajasthan Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters, Gehlot said that the Centre has failed to understand the sentiments and the farmers of the country and remained arrogant, due to which the farmers’ movement continued for a year and hundreds of farmers were killed. “In Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister himself will camp for three days. To win the election, the PM himself and his national president JP Nadda, former chief minister Rajnath Singh and Union home minister Amit Shah, have been entrusted with the responsibility of booth management there. Today’s decision is also being taken after looking at the Uttar Pradesh elections,” Gehlot said. He said, “Guess from this, how much panic is there among them. Due to this panic, they had to make a decision today.” Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra said Congress has always stood by farmers and will continue to stand by them. He claimed that the arrogance and dishonesty of the BJP and its Central government has been ‘exposed’.Dotasra said, “They should apologise and fulfil their promises, including doubling the farmers’ income. This is what democracy is, but there is no hope from them.” Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot also called it the victory of farmers. Pilot tweeted, “After a long struggle, farmers have won today. The government’s arrogance had to bow before the voice of truth and justice raised by the peasant power and the three anti-agriculture laws had to be withdrawn. Farmers have written history by shedding their blood, through renouncement and sacrifice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/a-victory-of-democracy-defeat-of-arrogance-gehlot/articleshow/87807664.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Scientists of IFGTB develop eucalyptus, punnai clones||COIMBATORE: The Institute of Forest Genetic and Tree Breeding (IFGTB) at RS Puram here has developed two clones of eucalyptus hybrids that would grow 10% more than the best eucalyptus clone available with the institute now. The new clones are the result of several years of research by a team of scientists led by D Rajasugunasekar. They worked with interspecific hybrids from three different species - eucalyptus tereticornis, eucalyptus camaldulensis and eucalyptus grandis - to develop the new ones. Rajasugunasekar said while they had developed 11 clones so far, this was the first time they developed hybrid clones through a means of controlled pollination. “The clones are developed from known father and mother tree species, technically called as full-sib selection.” Another group of scientists led by R Anandalakshmi has, meanwhile, developed six new clones of calophyllum inophyllum, commonly called as ‘tamanu’ or ‘mastwood’ or punnai tree (in Tamil). The trees are cultivated for their fruits that contain high oil content. They are used for skin treatment. While the tree variety from unimproved seed source could yield up to 4.3kg fruit per tree per year, the improved variety could yield up to 6kg fruit. “Punnai is an environmentally friendly tree, which serves as a good bioshield on beaches, grows in varied soil types and supports apiculture and agroforestry. It is a beautiful tree for urban forestry and it can be grown along roadsides and highways,” Anandalakshmi said. The new punnai clones have 50% more oil content than the normal ones and starts yielding in six years, which is two years earlier than the normal ones. One litre of pure punnai oil could fetch Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000. C Kunhikannan, director, IFGTB, said the variety releasing committee of the Indian Council of Forestry and Research Education approved the clones on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/scientists-of-ifgtb-develop-eucalyptus-punnai-clones/articleshow/87807668.cms||---

Kumar said that the tourism department has already issued a work order to a private firm to revamp the Santa Monica jetty, and a similar effort is on to upgrade other jetties in the state so that they can be used for passenger commute and tourism. Kumar also announced that the state government has approved the notification of the Goa tourism board, which will have equal representation from the tourism industry. He said that the first meeting of the board is slated for early December. “There are various authorities who are involved in managing the affairs of the jetties in the state, we have captain of ports, tourism department and fisheries department. We are looking to have a policy which will regulate the affairs of tourism-related activities on these jetties. It will be notified soon,” said Kumar, speaking at a conference on nautical tourism organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry. Kumar said that the upgradation of the Santa Monica jetty, which is being done through private participation, will take close to two years. “There are a few jetties which are there either underutilised or unutilised... we need to ensure that these jetties are utilised to the maximum possible extent,” said Kumar. He said that inputs provided by CII and stakeholders from the tourism department are being incorporated in the tourism master plan and the tourism policy. “We have also been able to get the approval of the government for notifying the Goa tourism board, an industry-driven policy and program which will cater to the development of tourism in the state of Goa,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jetty-mgmt-policy-for-tourism-devpt-set-to-be-notified/articleshow/87807667.cms||Newton Sequeira

Vimala Chorotiya, Nita Kalsekar and Bani Debnath wanted to take a happy selfie outside Mulund tehsil office on November 18 but rain played spoilsport. Two months ago, the victory signs of this trio leapt off newspapers when Bombay high court directed the Maharashtra government to disburse a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the women whose husbands, Santosh Kalsekar, Govind Chorotiya and Vishwajit Debnath, had died while cleaning a septic tank in a housing society in Govandi in December 2019. While the women received the first installment of Rs 1.25 lakh immediately after the verdict, Rs 8.75 lakh came after two months. Thrilled on receiving the cheque, Chorotiya wanted to freeze the jubilant moment in a selfie. “But the sky was overcast, the photos came out dark,” said Chorotiya (38), a Kurla resident who called up all who helped her through her two-year battle to express gratitude. Among them was a retiree, Kishore Parikh, who had been sending her Rs2,000 each month to help her pay her daughters’' school fees. “He congratulated me but said that he would continue to send me money,” said Chorotiya, who deposited her cheque on November 20. “One tension is over, but the real fight begins now,” said Chorotiya, hinting at a criminal case the trio is pursuing against the management of the housing society in Chembur where their husbands died.

---||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput drugs case: Rahila Furniturewala gets bail, court says no material on trafficking||MUMBAI: Granting bail to Rahila Furniturewala over nine months after her arrest in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) drugs case connected to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, a special NDPS court this week held there is no material at all disclosing her prima facie involvement in financing, illegal trafficking and harbouring of offenders. The court also pointed out that no contraband was seized from her. “The investigation is over and the chargesheet has been filed. In such circumstances, nothing can be achieved by keeping the accused behind bars for an indefinite period. The majority of other accused, having more serious allegations, have already been released on bail. In such circumstances, the present accused is also entitled to be released on bail on the ground of parity,” said special judge D B Mane. Bandra resident Rahila was accused of purchasing one gram MDMA (commonly known as ecstacy) from alleged jailed peddler Anuj Keshwani for her friend in January 2020, for which she allegedly paid him Rs 6,000. The prosecution alleged that during investigations, Keshwani disclosed Rahila’s name. The FIR in the case was registered last year. Rahila was arrested in the case on February 4 this year. She was also booked in a separate drugs case involving Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law, Sameer Khan. Rahila has been granted bail in the other case too. In the Rajput related case, arguing for bail, her advocate Taraq Sayyad said she has been falsely implicated. The defence further submitted that no contraband was seized or recovered at her instance and there is no evidence connecting her to Keshwani and the alleged deal. It was also submitted that his statement was not admissible as evidence. The prosecution strongly opposed the bail plea. It was alleged that she also approached Keshwani offering him ganja and CBD at the rate of Rs 1,800 per gram on behalf of another accused. The prosecution said this showed that she had conspired to finance illicit traffic and harbour offenders, procure, possess, sell and purchase, transport, import inter-state, export inter-state and was involved in dealing in ganja. The court said there was no specific allegation about Rahila harbouring anyone. “There is no material at all disclosing the prima facie involvement of present accused in either financing illegal trafficking and harbouring the offenders. In such circumstances, the rigors of Section 37 of NDPS Act is not applicable to the present accused,” the court said. Under Section 37, no accused under Section 27A for trafficking and harbouring offenders or offences involving commercial quantity can be given bail unless the court is satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is not guilty. — Rebecca Samervel||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rahila-gets-bail-court-says-no-material-on-trafficking/articleshow/87808606.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Farmers and agriculture activists are demanding an immediate solution to the burning issue as well as a clarification on the procurement of parboiled rice. Paddy procurement has been slow in the state owing to untimely rains and 90% of the harvest is yet to be procured. “There is confusion on what the Centre and the state government are saying. The state government is taking about the paddy procurement of the rabi season, while the BJP state unit is talking about the delay in paddy procurement in this season. Both are avoiding uncomfortable questions, but farmers are in despair,” agriculture scientist GV Ramanjaneyulu said. The Centre said on Thursday that it was verifying the state’s request for extra procurement this season, but did not mention anything about parboiled rice in the coming season, but asked the state to limit supplies. Farmers are also concerned about switching to other crops. “The government is now urging us to move to other crops, but we cannot do so because thorough conversion takes a lot of time,” said Mohammad Gouse, a farmer from Narayanpet. Finance minister T Harish Rao urged centra government to purchase parboiled rice from Telangana. He said the state government will buy rainy season produce and that arrangements have been made. “But the Centre must buy 90% of total production of paddy from Telangana in the same way that it does from Punjab,” he said. He alleged that the Centre was adopting double standards. “We will expose their duplicity. Procurement is delayed this season due to continuous rainfall and paddy has not dried up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-in-state-cagey-about-procurement-of-parboiled-rice/articleshow/87807682.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A call on pulling down the security apparatus will be taken only on the basis of the crowd and intel inputs. Senior officers TOI spoke to said so far no instructions had been issued and the deployment would continue. “Most farmer leaders are in Punjab for gurupurab. We were already in talks with them due to the upcoming event on November 26, when it’s the anniversary of their movement, as well as the call given by them for a march to Parliament on November 29,” said a senior officer. “Since the Prime Minister’s announcement, the status of the scheduled events might change, so we are waiting for the leaders to return and their governing body to meet and tell us their decision to decide the future course of action,” added the officer. Rakesh Asthana, Delhi Police commissioner, had earlier stated that the decision to remove barricades at the Ghazipur and Tikri borders was taken to send out a positive message after talks with farmer leaders and UP and Haryana cops. The farmers’ protest had caused road closures, making interstate vehicular movement difficult for people. “After holding talks with farmer leaders and UP and Haryana police, it was decided to open the borders and create a positive atmosphere,” Asthana had said. Delhi Police had been apprehensive about the law and order situation at the borders after the Republic Day violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-to-assess-situation-keep-security-intact-at-the-borders/articleshow/87807694.cms||---

The figure included issuing of around 19,600 certificates by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in its four zones, 11,320 by the east corporation in its two zones and 24,000 in the north corporation’s six zones. Though around 70,000 vendors were identified by the three civic bodies during the phase I survey, which was completed on September 30, the applications of many vendors have been put on hold as they could not submit all documents or had other lapses. “We had identified 20,000 vendors in east Delhi, but zonal offices found some issues such as correction in addresses, names or shortage of documents in many cases,” said an official. An SDMC official said, “Now that the Delhi government has extended the survey till December 7, the zonal teams have started coordinating with the vending committee members to cover the rest.” In north Delhi, the civic body will resume the survey from early December. “We are expecting to have around 40,000 vendors in six zones,” said Yogesh Verma, former leader of House at the north corporation. The corporation is mostly handing over the certificates to vendors visiting the zonal offices, added Verma. “This is done to avoid delay and give the certificates to the right person.” By month-end, the corporation may depute licensing inspectors to dispatch the remaining certificates. The deliberative wing even held public events to distribute certificates. SDMC, however, is mailing the certificates through postal services, standing committee chairman Col (retd) B K Oberoi. “We spoke to the commissioner and it has been agreed that a copy of the certificate will also be given to area councillors for reference and distribution by next week,” he said. “This will also help area representatives to figure out people who are not covered so far,” Oberoi pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corporations-issue-vending-papers-to-55000-in-phase-i/articleshow/87807731.cms||Vibha Sharma

Vehicles moved at snail’s pace and drivers had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to make it through the crossroads owing to the heavy traffic.  With state transport buses not plying because of the ongoing strike by a section of MSRTC employees, people travelling to to various parts of the district and state had to take cabs and other private transport.  Much of the chaos was caused by cabs, private buses and other private vehicles stopping and parking haphazardly at Dwarka junction to pick up passengers. Most of these passengers were headed towards Mumbai, Sinnar, Shirdi, Pune, Malegaon and Dhule. A police constable said that after the number of vehicles started increasing at the junctions, additional police personnel were sent there to streamline the flow of traffic. “However, the constables summoned were still insufficient in number as most personnel of the city police were assigned for security at the recruitment examination of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police scheduled from 3pm to 4.30pm on Friday,” the constable said. Other policemen said that owing to the arrangement for the exam, most traffic junctions had poor police deployment. DCP (Zone 2) Vijay Kharat said a force of close to 1,000 personnel, comprising a DCP, 2 ACPs, 14 PIs, 65 PSIs, 743 constables and 120 women constables, had been deployed for security for the exam. The arrangement was for 30 centres in the city where approximately 13,800 aspirants took the test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traffic-chaos-reigns-on-nashik-roads-dwarka-junction-worst-hit/articleshow/87805696.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Firefighting system goes kaput, blaze at Vile Parle mall injures 2||MUMBAI: In yet another instance of negligence, a fire at Vile Parle’s Prime Mall on Friday morning, that could have been doused easily to avert a major mishap, flared up and injured two people due to non-functional fire fighting system inside the structure. Located in the busy Irla Market lane, the mall has shops selling electronic items and mobile phone service stores. The injured include a fireman who was involved in the fire fighting operations. Fire brigade officials said a notice would be served to the mall shortly. Times ViewIn virtually every big fire in Mumbai, the fire-fighting equipment of the building — be it a residential tower, hospital, office complex or mall—was found to be non-functional. Periodic fire drills, regularly updating of safety manuals and inspection of fire-fighting apparatus in high rise buildings must not remain only on paper. The fire brigade must therefore be strict on compliance and take stringent action against violators.The blaze erupted on the first floor of the ground-plus-three storey structure around 10am when business for the day had not begun full fledged. The fire brigade rushed 16 fire engines, 11 water tankers, ambulances and its turntable ladders to the site. It took the fire brigade over three hours to cover the blaze from all sides to ensure it does not spread further. The injured have been identified as Mubasir Mohammed, 20, who was admitted in Cooper Hospital and fireman Mangesh Gaonkar, 54, who sustained minor injuries and is under treatment. A senior fire brigade official said their aim was to control the flames from spreading. “However, the fire fighting system, although present, was not functional thus hampering our operations. It being a completely air conditioned premise, there was not adequate ventilation available initially and we had to try to make arrangements for allowing the smoke to be let out. Also, anticipating that there was a lot of inflammable material inside the premises, we were very cautious to cover the fire from all sides as quickly as possible,” said an official. Dhaval Shah of the Lokhandwala Oshiwara Citizens Association said the fire brigade made the right move by immediately restricting traffic movement in the area. “Irla Market lane, where the mall is located, is very congested. Had the fire taken place during the evening hours, it could have been a disaster considering the high vehicular and pedestrian movement in the area. Besides, the hawkers that occupy almost one whole lane add to congestion. The administration should be strict in case of fire fighting systems not working in such commercial structures as it puts the lives of many people who visit them at risk,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-firefighting-system-goes-kaput-blaze-at-vile-parle-mall-injures-2/articleshow/87808644.cms||Richa Pinto

A sizable number of students, along with the examiners travel via MSRTC buses to the exam centres. Dr Ajit Pathak, the varsity’s controller of examination, told TOI, “Despite problems in availability of the buses, the attendance of the students in the practical exam has been over 98%, which is extremely noteworthy. Similarly, the examiners too travelled to the assigned colleges located either in their home districts or other districts to conduct the examination although the MSRTC buses are unavailable.” Over 45,000 first, second and third year health science undergraduate students and over 1,000 examiners are involved in the practical exams that started from November 8, the day the MSRTC staffers went on strike. The exam will continue till the end of this month. The practical exams are underway for several courses like allopathy, homoeopathy, ayurveda, dental, nursing, speech therapy, physiotherapy etc. The varsity’s examination department has been overseeing the smooth conduct of the practical examination under the guidance of the new MUHS VC, Lt Gen (Dr) Madhuri Kanitkar (retd) and the registrar, Kalidas Chavan. The MUHS examination department has set a deadline for completing the summer 2021 UG health science examinations by the end of this month as it was delayed due to the pandemic. The theory examination has been completed last month. Insiders of the varsity said they were apprehensive about the smooth conduct of the practical examination as both the examinees and examiners would face problems while commuting due to the MSRTC strike. “We had to alter the dates of only a handful of practical examinations as the examiners could not make it to the exam centre. But the majority of the exams were conducted as per schedule without any hiccups,” said Pathak. Meanwhile, MUHS has announced the schedule for the winter 2021 theory postgraduate medical examination for courses like MD (all specialities), MS (all specialities), MSc (Microbiology & Med Biochemistry). The exams will be conducted between November 20 and November 26.

---||Hyderabad||Paddy procurement goes at snail’s pace in Telangana||HYDERABAD: The farmers in Telangana are a worried lot as procurement of paddy is going at snail’s pace. Of the over one crore metric tonnes of Vaanakalam paddy targeted to be purchased by the government, less than 15 lakh metric tonnes have been procured till date. The slow pace of procurement is resulting in the farmers selling their paddy directly to either the rice millers or the traders in the private market at a much lesser price than Rs 1,960 per quintal MSP. The farmers associations have blamed it on the state stating that the government is intentionally slowing down the paddy procurement to wash its hands off the huge task. As if this was not enough, there is a delay on the part of the civil supplies department officials to deposit money into the bank accounts of the farmers for the paddy purchased from them. Sources said Rs 2,300 crore worth paddy has been procured from nearly 2 lakh farmers but less than 50,000 farmers got money into their bank accounts. One reason for delay is failure on the part of officials to host the details of the farmers on the online procurement management system (OPMS). All India Kisan Congress vice president M Kodanda Reddy charged TRS of not being committed to buy paddy. “Government has announced that it will procure every grain of paddy only to keep itself in the good books of the farmers. It knows that a farmer cannot wait for a long time and will sell his paddy to private merchants even at a lesser price, ” he alleged. Telangana rice millers association president Gampa Nagender said rice mills in the state have capacity to store another 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy as on date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-procurement-goes-at-snails-pace/articleshow/87807735.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two youths kidnap bizman, murder him to avoid arrest; accused held||NEW DELHI: Two men in their early 20s have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a businessman for a ransom of Rs 1 crore and then killing him to avoid arrest. The accused have been identified as Tanveer Alam and Mohammed Sharif, residents of Kishanganj in Bihar who worked in Paharganj hotels. After receiving a call about a body lying at Jawalapuri in west Delhi, a police team reached the spot where the cops from Kosli near Haryana’s Rewari were also present. The deceased was identified as Yogesh (32), a resident of Rewari who ran a Safal store in Paharganj. His father said Yogesh had left home for Delhi on November 16. In the evening, his wife, Anjali, received a call from his number. Claiming that he had abducted Yogesh, the caller demanded that Rs 1 crore be delivered near Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid, the father said. Yogesh’s family reached the local police station in Kosli and came to Delhi with a cop from Haryana Police while the caller kept calling for the ransom. The relatives reached the mosque around 2am on November 17, but the caller asked them to come to Dilli Gate and then to Daryaganj. Finally, they were asked to stand in front of an ATM booth on the main road. The cops caught one of the men, later identified as Alam, who came to collect the ransom while Sharif managed to escape. Alam allegedly said they had murdered Yogesh as he knew them. The accused took police and Yogesh’s relatives to B9, camp number 4 in Jawalapuri from where the victim’s body was recovered. A case was registered at Paschim Vihar (west) police station. Yogesh’s mobile phone and a key of the room where he was murdered were recovered from Alam. The accused allegedly said he and Sharif used to work at different hotels in Paharganj, but were fed up with their meagre earnings and poor living condition. A few months ago, they made a plan to kidnap someone for ransom to turn their fortune and zeroed in on Yogesh after overhearing that he had a lot of property in Haryana. The accused were aware that Yogesh would come to Delhi from home on November 16. They bought a rope and two pieces of cloth to tie him up and managed to take him to their rented accommodation in Jawalapuri. The accused reportedly claimed that they strangled Yogesh to death even before making the ransom call as he tried to escape after refusing them to pay and also threatened to expose them before police. Meanwhile, police also caught Sharif on the basis of Alam’s information. Both are remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-youths-kidnap-bizman-murder-him-to-avoid-arrest/articleshow/87807737.cms||---

Justice Rekha Palli recently issued the notice on the petition and listed the matter for further hearing on December 3, when the court will examine if there is a necessity for passing directions for filing of the counter affidavit. The petition submits these 61 petitioners and their families were illegally evicted from Gol Market in central Delhi in 2010 and in compliance with an October 2011 order of the authorities they are staying at a community centre, which is a shelter home and awaiting rehabilitation. It said the eligibility of petitioners for rehabilitation was established and full payment has been made to the authorities for rehabilitation under a 2015 policy of Delhi government, according to which the eligible families will get ownership rights over the allotted apartment. The plea also challenged a 2020 December circular issued by the ministry under which all the vacant and under-construction houses constructed under the erstwhile schemes — Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and Rajiv Awas Yojana — be available for affordable rental houses for urban migrants and poor. The petitioners submitted that even though they were entitled to be allotted flats by DUSIB and the ministry as part of the rehabilitation scheme, they have not been allotted the same on account of the December 2020 circular of the ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-rehab-of-61-families-whose-shanties-were-removed/articleshow/87807750.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Dirty message to fiancée is not an insult to her modesty: Court||MUMBAI: Observing that sending “obscene messages” to a woman one is going to marry cannot be termed as insulting her modesty, a sessions court acquitted a now 36-year-old man, 11 years after he was booked for cheating and raping her under the false promise of marriage. The court held that sending such messages in premarital period may delight and give the feeling that someone is close enough to understand one’s emotions. “If at all those are not liked by the other side, it has discretion with it to convey its displeasure to the other side, and the other side generally avoids a repeat of such a mistake. The purpose was to put up his expectation before her, to arouse her with similar feeling of sex, which may give happiness even to her, etc. But in no way those SMSs can be said as were sent to insult her modesty,” the court said. The woman lodged an FIR in 2010. The couple had met on a matrimonial site in 2007 and tried to marry despite opposition. The mother of the accused was against the match and refused to let him stay in either of the homes after the proposed marriage. In 2010, the man broke up the relationship. Acquitting the man of rape charges, the court said every breach of promise to marry cannot be termed cheating or rape. The court said the accused was was in relationship for more than two years, had initially taken a house on rent and later renovated a flat belonging to his family. “He had even been to Arya Samaj Hall with mangalsutra but it was the quarrel on the ground of stay after marriage and thereafter, by getting tired of his indecisiveness and getting surrendered before his mother’s wish and failing to handle and tackle the problem stood before him in proper manner, he came back. But it is certainly not the case of false promise of marriage. It is the case of failure to make substantial efforts,” the court said. It said it was not necessary for the woman to have allowed the accused to have sex with her prior to marriage. The court said she opted for it, believing blindly that they would marry, even though she was aware of opposition. “Even after respecting emotions of the informant (woman), respecting her fighting for justice for 11 years or more, this court is of humble opinion that this is not a case which would show that the offence of rape has been committed,” the court said. The parents of the accused were also booked in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dirty-msg-to-woman-one-is-to-marry-not-an-insult/articleshow/87808970.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ahmedabad||No new roads damaged in 3 years: AMC chief to Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar filed an affidavit in the Gujarat high court and claimed that no new roads have been damaged in last three years. He has asserted that he and his subordinates have diligently followed the court directions to improve city road quality, smoothen traffic movement, creating parking facilities and stop stray cattle nuisance on public streets. The commissioner was ordered to file an affidavit by the court in response to a petition accusing the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) of not fully complying with court directions issued in 2018 on a PIL filed after city roads were badly damaged in the 2017 monsoon. His affidavit reads, “So far as the new roads falling within defect liability of three years are concerned, none are damaged in last three years and so far as repairing work is concerned, it is periodically addressed by concerned engineering department.” He has attributed the marked improvement of road quality, the claim that is under challenge in the petition, to AMC’s decisions taken after the HC directions to maintain roads in good condition. He stated that the city has 2,580km of roads, of which 200km roads can be absolutely resurfaced or reconstructed every year considering finance and priority. He, however, also clarified that he has little say in clearance of projects related to roads which was mostly above Rs 30 lakh. This is because he has powers to finalise tenders up to Rs 30 lakh, and beyond this a nod from the standing committee is needed. Kumar claimed that various initiatives were undertaken like appointing six project management consultant to monitor on day-to-day basis the road construction and maintenance, request to the government to expeditiously finalize the Town Planning schemes to “achieve ultimate goal to have good quality of roads within city limit with proper checks and balance”. AMC also constructed and resurfaced 10 roads by using waste plastic material, but this was not found feasible. The commissioner also stated that for last three years, AMC holds meeting with all Road Opening (RO) agencies and planning for the whole city is finalized in advance so that digging of new roads can be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-new-roads-damaged-in-3-years/articleshow/87807101.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NGT lens on old polluting vehicles||KOLKATA: The NGT eastern regional bench of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) gave top priority to the phasing out of old polluting vehicles, both commercial and private, especially those below the standard of BS-IV. The NGT’s observation came in the wake of a petition filed by environment activist Ankur Sharma in connection with the plying of 13 commercial vehicles without permit and valid PUC certificate. The bench observed that the exemption to BS-III compliant vehicles is an antithesis of the environmental law and a licence to pollute the air — which is detrimental to the health of people — in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. All considerations override environmental health and sustainable development principle as well as the precautionary principle, which are now accepted as part of Article 21 of the Constitution. In pursuance of the orders of NGT dated August 11, 2016 and May 26, 2017, non-BS-IV transport vehicles registered outside the jurisdiction of Kolkata and Howrah were not allowed to remain in the city after seven days. An exemption has been allowed to BS-III compliant inter-regional stage carriages that ply on designated routes and enter the city during specified time schedules. Similarly, an exemption has been allowed to BS-III compliant All-Bengal Contract Carriage registered outside Kolkata, which carry passengers to the city only on contract as per the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the bench observed. It is high time for the state to ensure that the public transport vehicles below BS-IV are phased out rapidly and that only BS-VI vehicles ply. A committee was constituted by the transport department regarding the phasing out of old commercial vehicles following the Vardhaman Kaushik Judgment. From March 2020 onwards, the committee could not meet regularly due to the pandemic. The committee needs some more time to submit its findings and recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-lens-on-old-polluting-vehicles/articleshow/87807092.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

We will never find them. Our attempt is to reach as close to 100% (as possible),” said a senior DHS official. Two months ago, chief minister Pramod Sawant had declared that by October-end, the eligible population would be fully vaccinated, but subsequently, the deadline was pushed to November 15. The health official said that it is not possible to give an exact date by when the entire eligible population will be fully vaccinated, as plenty of people took their first dose recently, and their turn for the second dose is yet to come. Every day, 400-500 people are vaccinated with their first dose; they are either those who earlier declined to get vaccinated, or reached eligibility now. Last month, the DHS had announced that about 2.1 lakh people were yet to take their second dose even after the completion of the 12-week gap, but the officer said that the figure was erroneous. The actual number is around 75,000, he said, adding that due to technical errors, names of many vaccinated persons reflect as unvaccinated. “Since last month, many of them may have been fully vaccinated, as every day, an average 5,000 people are getting their second dose,” he said. After it came to their notice that many were not taking their second dose, the DHS started a drive, and the help of civic body members and others was taken to reach out to people in their respective areas. As of Thursday, Over 9.8 lakh people were fully vaccinated, and 2.66 lakh have received their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goal-is-to-get-as-close-to-100-as-possible-dhs-official-on-vax-drive/articleshow/87807777.cms||---

Demanding all farmers who died during the protests be declared martyrs, a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the families of each of those who died and government jobs for their kin, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said the decision to take back the laws was forced on BJP by its fear of losing the upcoming state polls. “It has also been proved that Narendra Modi and his government only work for elections and it was the fear of losing elections that forced you to take this step,” Singh said after paying tributes to the farmers who had died during the protests. Referring to the PM’s speech of Friday, Singh asked what he was doing when farmers were being targeted with tear gas, when they were barricaded using spikes and made to feel like residents of an enemy territory and when they were being lathicharged. He also hit out at the government for setting up a panel on MSP saying that would mean that the issue would be put in cold storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-declare-farmers-who-died-martyrs/articleshow/87808276.cms||Neha Lalchandani

She has also asked for a law to be brought in for minimum support price. “The year-long protests by farmers, who braved the cold, heat and rain to stand against the three farm laws that were forced on their heads by the central government have finally brought some result.

With this, Pench now has 308 species of birds, as a survey years ago had led to bird experts identifying 164 species. The area of Pench was 257 sq km when the first bird survey was done identifying 164 species. Last November, when the first bird week was being celebrated, former field director RS Govekar had signed an MoU with Central India Bird Academy (CIBA), Nagpur, to conduct a fresh survey. As per the MoU, the CIBA team identified whether Pench was a habitat for endemic forest owlet, studied breeding of Malabar hornbills, and water birds at Navegaon Khairy and Totladoh reservoir, and capacity building of field staff. Over the last year, the CIBA team led by Dr Anil Pimplapure, Nitin Marathe, Jayant Wadatkar, and Gajanan Wagh conducted workshops to sensitize the staff. A WhatsApp group was created involving field staff, who used to post pictures of birds recorded in the tiger reserve. The CIBA team used to identify them. This helped the staff enhance their knowledge about the birds. All the bird species found in all the seasons were recorded and the list was released in the just concluded bird week. Deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Rahul Gavai said, “A similar MoU for a rapid survey of birds and their habitats has been signed with CIBA for Bor Tiger Reserve (BTR) and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pench-adds-144-bird-species-to-its-checklist/articleshow/87807129.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No drug recovery: Minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law; moves Bombay high court to quash NCB case||MUMBAI: Sameer Khan, son-in-law of state cabinet minister Nawab Malik, has filed a petition before Bombay high court seeking quashing of the drug seizure case filed against him in January by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Khan’s petition stated that the chemical analysis report of a forensic laboratory said the recovery of contraband from him is “negative” and hence, no offence is made out. He added that the criminal case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act is thus not maintainable and must be quashed. Khan claimed that the case against him is “frivolous, bogus, concocted and farcical”. A special NDPS court had recently granted Khan bail, after nine months in custody. Khan’s petition said the NCB stated that it had received information about ‘some suspicious parcels’ received at Universal Couriers and Cargo office to be sent abroad and that they contained contraba-nd drugs. A raid was carried out on January 9, and packets containing ganja weighing 70gm, 265gm and 3.5gm were allegedly seized. NCB then carried out a raid at the house of a co-accused and allegedly recovered four big cartons, two small packets and four white sacks containing ganja. The co-accused mentioned Khan’s name and he was summoned. Khan said he appeared before the NCB and his statement was recorded. He was arrested on January 13 for various offences, including the serious Section 27A of illicit trafficking of drugs and conspiracy under the NDPS Act. His petition said: “It is pertinent to note that the alleged statement of the petitioner [Khan] is exculpatory [involving the removal of blame fr-om someone] in nature as the Supreme Court had said that statements recorded by NCB officials would not be admissible as evidence by itself... Admittedly there is no recovery of contraband at the instance of the petitioner or from his person and therefore the charge u/s. 20 (B)(2)(C) [possession of intermediary quantity of cannabis] is not made out.” The petition also claimed that the chemical analysis report negates the presence of any contraband and specifically notes the presence of ga-nja in only one out of 18 samp-les. “It is pertinent to note that the sole sample which tested positive was drawn from the contraband weighing 7.5gm,” it alleged, adding that even according to the NCB’s own case and the statements recorded and relied upon by the agency, the alleged contraband recovered was at the instance of the co-accused and intended for personal consumption. He added that from the rest of the samples, 11 of 18 tested negative for the presence of any contraband and therefore the prosecution’s allegation that a commercial quantity of contraband was seized fails. Besides, five samples were found to be only “vegetative part of the cannabis plant” and do not fall within the ambit of the NDPS Act, Khan claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-drug-recovery-maliks-son-in-law-moves-high-court-to-quash-ncb-case-in-mumbai/articleshow/87808678.cms||---

Though NGT has not imposed the fine on the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) yet, the bench made the recommendation of the committee a part of the order. According to the expert committee report to the bench, the total damage due to ground water and pond pollution was worth Rs7.30 lakh per month while the cost of air pollution was calculated at Rs1.26 lakh per month. The study was conducted by the senior scientists of WBPCB, CPCB and NEERI on February 25 and 26.  The estimation is done on the basis of total release of heavy metals on soil due to leachate and gives a value of probable damage by this. Environment activist, Subhas Datta, the petitioner of the case, said, “The bench has made some significant observations of the expert committee as part of its order.” The recommendation included ensuring advance demarcation and declaration of a buffer zone of no new habitation for up to 500 meters. The seepage of leachate from the dump site should be managed as per SWM Rule 2016. Proper drainage and pumping of the leachate to its treatment unit must be given special attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tribunal-pegs-dhapa-green-damage-at-rs-9l-per-month/articleshow/87807113.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

With the Opposition coming down on the government after Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew the three farm laws on Friday, Singh said that Yadav’s politics was only about himself and not about the common man. “First, he said that we should talk to farmers. When some farmers could not understand our point of view, the PM took a sympathetic view of the situation and decided to repeal the three laws but instead of appreciating that, Akhilesh is making useless comments on it,” he said. The minister asked why, if Yadav claimed to be a genuine well-wisher of farmers, was it that as soon as the Yogi government came to power, then loans of Rs 36,000 crore were waived for 86 lakh farmers? Why was it that cane farmers had to be paid dues pending since the SP government, that purchase of wheat, paddy and sugarcane was low during the SP regime and why sugarmills were shut down, he asked. “Akhilesh has no moral right to raise questions about the Yogi government which had cleared record dues of Rs 1.46 lakh crore to sugarcane farmers. The welfare of farmers is a priority for the double engine government of the Centre and the state. With schemes like Per Drop More Crop, Har Khet Pani, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report for MSP, adding more crops to the ambit of MSP etc, our government has shown resolve to improve the condition of farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhileshs-politics-is-about-self-goals-not-people-bjp/articleshow/87808288.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier T-Works had worked with Srija and her mentor Augustien, who approached T-Works though the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC), for making her innovation market-ready. T-Works helped Srija scale up the production of the biodegradable pots, called biopots, that are made from dough using groundnut shells. T-Works helped Srija conduct experiments to identify the right ratios of ingredients for the dough and optimal shape for the biopots. These biopots are an eco-friendly alternative to the black plastic bags commonly used in nurseries for growing saplings. T Works had designed and developed a biopress 4T machine that can manufacture 6,000 biopots per shift per month. The machine can also be modified to produce up to 50,000 pots per month per machine in one shift. GE Appliances will assist in setting up a small-scale domestic enterprise for manufacturing the biopots in Gadwal district as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative. GE Appliances will be funding the plant and machinery to generate employment opportunities for local rural communities.

---||Chandigarh||Mohali MLA bats for need based changes policy||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: With assembly elections drawing close, promises made in the Congress manifesto in the last elections are being taken up. Former Cabinet Minister and MLA from Mohali Balbir Singh Sidhu assured that he would hold a meeting with Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to notify the need-based changes policy. With population increasing, need based changes are the need of the hour, he said. During the last elections, then Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that if voted to power, the Congress would implement need-based changes policy for houses and allow construction of first floor in commercial booths and bay shops. Sidhu made these promises while releasing a 34-point election manifesto for the February 14 Mohali MC elections. “Soon, I will be holding a meeting with CM Channi to press for notification of the need-based changes policy so that benefits can be extended to residents. I had already had a word with the CM on this issue and he has invited me for detailed talks,” he said. The policy draft was approved in-principle by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in 2016 but there has been no progress since then. Sidhu said, “The Congress is committed to the overall development of the state. Here in Mohali, it is my duty to deliver on promises. Till date, we have delivered maximum by getting city bus service, grants for MC to be used for development works and improving the condition of roads. Soon, we will get a local bus stand for Mohali,” he said. Despite earnest promises, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has so far failed to notify “need-based changes” in houses and commercial buildings in various sectors of Mohali. Sources in GMADA said the request to allow changes in the basic provision of area pertaining to floor area-ratio (FAR), height, basement and covering of balconies has been accepted but with riders that allottees concerned would get a map approved as per PUDA building rules after obtaining structural stability certificate from an expert. The parties will have to deposit a requisite fee (which is yet to be decided) as per the additional FAR. Allottees opting for one-time payment will be given some discount, otherwise GMADA may also accept the payment in installments, said an officer. Residents will only be allowed need-based changes if the alterations do not threaten the structure of buildings and not disturb residential area of neighbours. For this, residents will have to furnish an undertaking saying that they would be solely responsible for any loss to the neighbours due to any previous or future construction and would be liable to compensate the neighbours for it, said sources. The official also made it clear that no concrete construction would be allowed under need-based changes but soft structures like aluminium glazing or glass may be acceptable. Residents had demanded that independent houses be allowed to construct second floor and owners living on the ground floor of LIG, HIG, MIG, and super MIG houses be allowed construct an extra room. Changes already made must be taken on as it is, where it is basis. Recently, GMADA has given interim relief to 784 flat owners of MIG-super housing society association by deferring action on building bylaw violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mla-bats-for-need-based-changes-policy/articleshow/87807124.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Ahmedabad||GST revised: Apparel to cost 20% more in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: As the Union government announced a revision in GST rates on all types of garments from 5% to 12%, a range of apparels and made-ups are set to get costlier by at least 20%. In the recent revision, a range of other textile goods including man-made fibre, man-made yarn, all types of fabrics, dyeing and printing job work, will now attract 12% GST. “Consumers will now have to pay 7% extra for their clothing — adding fuel to the inflation fire for clothing. With cotton and yarn prices going up by an estimated 60% in the past one year, apparel have anyway become costlier,” said Sanjay Jain, chairman, textile committee, Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC). “This will have a dual effect on both consumers as well as micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Demand will take a hit as consumers of low-end garments are more price elastic. This will have an adverse impact on MSME manufacturers whose working capital requirements will also increase,” Jain added. At a time when raw material prices are already running high with cotton, yarn as well as MMF yarn being costlier, jacking up of GST rates on textile goods and garments will further make apparel expensive. Manufacturers have raised concerns over losing costcompetitiveness to manufacturers in Vietnam and Bangladesh for international orders. “As raw materials are costlier, the finished product prices have already been increased. An increase in GST will further add to this cost and manufacturers will lose out on their cost-competitiveness to other counterparts, in the international market. Large retailers have already shifted sourcing to Vietnam and Bangladesh, who enjoy free trade agreements and therefore are able to offer lower prices,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat State Council. The GST rates on man-made fibre and yarn have also been revised to 12%, making synthetic and rayon textile and apparel expensive. However, industry players are rejoicing the normalising of tax structure. “The synthetic value chain had an inverted duty structure with fibre attracting 18%, yarn 12%, fabric 5%, garments below Rs 1,000 per piece 5%, and garments above Rs 1,000, 12% duty. This used to result into accumulation of a huge amount of input tax, and obtaining refunds was a concern. However, with uniform tax structure, these challenges will be ironed out,” said Pramod Choudhary, past president, Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council (SRTEPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-revised-apparel-to-cost-20-more/articleshow/87807127.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Victory of farmers & democracy over ego, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Congratulating the farmer community for their relentless historic protest which compelled the Centre to announce the rollback of the three ‘black farm laws’, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said on Friday that the government may bring back the laws once the assembly elections get over. He described the development as “Ahankaar ki haar … kisano aur loktantra ki jeet” (Victory of farmers and democracy over ago). “BJP is eyeing the vote of the farmers and not bothered about their well-being. The government should bring in a law on MSP, but it will not because they (BJP government) are not interested in the prosperity of farmers. These farm laws were drafted in favour of corporate houses,” he said as an e-banner with “Saaf nahi hai inka dil, chunav baad phir layenge bill (Their intentions are not clean, they will bring the farm bill again after polls),” written on it as a couplet fluttered in the backdrop. Addressing a press conference in October, Akhilesh had announced that the BJP was planning to withdraw the farm laws in wake of the assembly elections in UP and Punjab and would bring it again after the polls. “The BJP governments in UP and at the Centre were rattled by the unprecedented support that SP got recently by farmers and people of Purvanchal and decided to repeal the black farm laws” he said, adding that they may introduce the bill again after polls. “Ye sirf vote ke liye dhokha hai (This is only a gimmick for votes),” he said. Akhilesh took a jibe at the manner in which the government asked farmers to overlook the stalemate that continued on the issue on farm laws. “What about the families of hundreds of farmers who died during protest, can that be forgotten,” he asked. “The manner in which ministers insulted the farmers, the (Union) Cabinet should take responsibility for it and the government must resign,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/victory-of-farmers-democracy-over-ego-says-akhilesh/articleshow/87808300.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The survey will begin on November 22 and officials will track down the owners and send the bills to their homes. If a person refuses to pay on time, his or her house connection will be discontinued. In the city, around industries with 4,000 water connections out of which 2,000 have been disconnected and 2,000 are still connected. Connected ones are easy to track, but for the disconnected ones, PHED officials have to find out how many of them haven’t paid their bills. PHED additional chief engineer Manish Beniwal said, "We have to find out the pending bills and their owners as many factories and industries were shut down during pandemic. Their owners are still living in the city. We will track them and give them the bills. If they pay it on time it is ok. Else, we will discontinue their house connections." PHED will start a campaign from November 22 to recover water bills pending in the Jaipur region. Bills worth more than Rs 100 crore are pending with the public and various government departments. Also, many water bills are pending for the last 10 years. During the campaign, people will be given an option to either pay the bills on the spot when officers go to collect it or their water connections will be disconnected within a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/phed-to-recover-water-bills-from-owners-of-non-functional-factories/articleshow/87807131.cms||---

Roshan Shinde was riding back home when the accused attacked him when told to take a turn and move his vehicle after they were about to collide. Vile Parle police arrested Noor Naseeruddin Shaikh (22), a cargo loader, who attacked Shinde with a knife he had carried along. When Shinde was riding from Sahar to Vile Parle (E) at 11.50pm both stopped their vehicles head-on near Sahar Classic building on Sahar Cargo Road, and had an argument when the victim told him to move ahead instead of blocking his way. This enraged Shaikh, said Vile Parle police senior inspector Alka Mandve. Shaikh, who escaped from the spot, was arrested within few hours and was booked for attempt to murder. If found guilty he can be sentenced to life. Shaikh charged at Shinde after pulling out a knife he had kept in the bike’s luggage box. “Shinde was attacked on the shoulder, chest, hands, and abdomen. Shaikh and Shinde are known to each other as they were from the same locality some years back and were not on good terms. Shinde’s condition is stable. He got stitches for the cuts,” said Mandve. Shaikh was arrested after Shinde’s friend Akash Salvi (23) gave police his details. Shaikh was tracked down at Sahar based on information provided by Salvi. Police recovered the weapon used in the crime. “Shaikh claimed Shinde abused him and told him to go ahead, which enraged him,” police said. Police are collecting information on whether Shaikh has a criminal history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-biker-attacks-old-foe-with-knife-many-times-in-road-rage-case/articleshow/87808696.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Electric vehicle sales surge nearly tenfold in October||AHMEDABAD: With fuel prices surging and state and central governments rolling out sizable subsidies on electric vehicles, an increasing number of buyers in Gujarat are moving to green mobility. The sale of electric vehicles shot up nearly 10-fold from 149 units in October 2020 to 1,621 units during the same month this year, according to the data compiled by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). These units include cars, twowheelers as well as three-wheelers. Even during the recently concluded Navratri-Diwali festive season, 2,471 electric vehicles were sold across Gujarat — up 846% against the 247 sold during last year’s festive season, suggests FADA’s data. The prices of CNG, petrol, and diesel are among the key reasons for the shift towards EVs, according to automobile dealers. “Even CNG prices have increased over the past six months or so,” said Pranav Shah, the chairman of FADA’s Gujarat region. “This increases the cost of ownership and maintenance of a vehicle. Therefore, over the past four to six months, the shift towards electric vehicles has been visibly good across segments.” Shah added: “Moreover, over the past two to three months, the government as well as civic authorities have announced significant subsidies on electric vehicles.” Over the past three months, Tata Motors consecutively sold at least 1,000 EVs per month. The automobile giant’s passenger vehicle manufacturing plant in Sanand makes one of the two electric car variants launched by the company. Vivek Srivatsa, the head of marketing, passenger & electric vehicles business unit, Tata Motors, said: “With rising demand for EVs, we have seen the penetration of vehicles grow at a fairly good rate.” Srivatsa added: “The recent surge in fuel prices could be one of the reasons for the spike in EV sales.” Srivatsa went on to say: “But customers are gradually making a shift towards EVs as they enjoy the seamless driving experience and also get the benefit of low ownership cost from a long-term perspective.” The Gujarat Electric Vehicle Policy, 2021, provides for subsidy of up to Rs 20,000 on EVs in the two-wheeler category, Rs 50,000 for three-wheelers, and up to Rs 1.5 lakh for cars. Over and above this, even the central government has extended subsidies under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles (FAME)-II. The amount of subsidy is based on the battery capacity. “Subsidy is one of the biggest factors that has made electric vehicles much more affordable,” said Dishank Chhabaria, branch head, Gujarat, Ather Energy. “For our two-wheelers, a clear subsidy of Rs 63,500 is available to customers which is definitely a good deal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ev-sales-surge-nearly-tenfold-in-oct/articleshow/87807143.cms||Niyati Parikh

This lot will have a capacity of 680 cars. Due to the Covid pandemic, the plan was delayed as tenders had been floated in 2018. The agency will get environmental impact assessment study and clearance for the project. Already, there is a multilevel parking near the new OPD, which has a capacity of 600 cars and is always filled to capacity. Around 20,000 vehicles need parking in PGI. Sources said that parking may be started this year. “This is the only institution in the city to have two multi-level parking spaces in one campus. Due to the daily overflow of patients and their attendants, it is difficult to find parking space. As most of the parking is required for OPD patients, parking in that area will be convenient,” said an official in the PGI administration. With expansion of the institute, where new centres are being constructed, there will be more vehicles on campus. “At any given point of time, most of the vehicles are parked along the roadside within the institute as there is no space in the public parking. Sometimes, it takes more than 30 minutes to find a parking slot,” said the relative of a patient. Also, there is a plan to make six additional parking slots to accommodate more vehicles. Besides the people, doctors may also face a problem. “Often, we have to walk a lot as we do not find place in the faculty parking. In fact, those who stay on the campus must cycle or walk so that those who come from far off places get space to park,” said a faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-have-another-parking-lot/articleshow/87807134.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Chandigarh||PGI resident suffering from depression due to workload sent home on leave||Chandigarh: A resident doctor in the city’s prestigious Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research was sent home on leave after she was evaluated to be suffering from depression due to workload in the institute. The woman doctor, who is attached with the department of neurosurgery, was sent to her hometown in Lucknow after counselling. In the absence of a job manual thar defines job profile of the resident doctors at PGIMER, many resident doctors often face such workload-related depression, feel doctors in the institute. Three months ago, Dr Sandeep Yadav of the same department had alleged harassment and left the institute. However, at the time top officials at the institute had explained the doctor’s move as inability to withstand work pressure. As the neurosurgery department is the most demanding, the residents are often working round-the-clock. “There are 28 resident doctors in the department and this is too low for the flow of patients pouring in the emergency,” said a faculty member. “We also teach the residents to stay polite with the patients, but it is practically impossible to spend more than four hours in the emergency where the corridors are also clogged with patients on trolleys,” he added. As per the data available from the PGIMER, most of the resignations by doctors have been in the surgery branches. In 2018, seven DM (Doctorate of Medicine)/MCh (Master of Chirurgiae) students had resigned, including two from the paediatric surgery department. In 2019, there were three resignations, including two by surgeons. In 2020, the number of resignations declined to one but this number rose to three resignations again this year. The association of resident doctors had been demanding the PGIMER authorities must formulate the job manual like New Delhi’s AIIMS since the last two years. However, there has been no progress yet. “Once this manual is prepared, the residents on duty who do the job of supporting the PGIMER staff in their absence cannot be held accountable for patient negligence,” said a resident doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-resident-suffering-from-depression-due-to-workload-sent-home-on-leave/articleshow/87807154.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Worst Diwali in a decade for Gujarat auto dealers||AHMEDABAD: As the intensifying global semi-conductor shortage has amplified production shortage in the automobile sector, automobile dealers witnessed the worst festive season in a decade. From Navratri to Diwali, the 42-day festive season reported an overall de-growth of 18% in car and two-wheeler sales, suggests data by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), which terms this as the worst sale in decade. Against 2.32 lakh vehicles including cars and two-wheelers that were sold during the Navratri-Diwali festive season of 2020, merely 1.91 lakh vehicles were retailed during the same period this year, according to FADA. Two-wheeler sales declined 15% whereas car sales showed a steeper fall of 32% during the said period. Explaining the trend, Pranav Shah, chairman, FADA, Gujarat, said, “Two-wheeler demand failed to pick up due to increased cost of ownership of two-wheelers and high fuel prices. Moreover, with more people working from home and educational institutions not functioning, the number of new two-wheeler buyers went down.” According to him, the loan rejection ratio increased from 8% last year to 15% this year in case of two-wheelers. “The moratorium for automobile loans was temporary. Lower income groups who could not repay loans due to income shortfall have bad credit scores, due to which their auto loan applications were rejected,” said Shah. Car sales remained slumped due to supply constraints triggered by the semiconductor shortage, which led to a dramatic increase in waiting periods for cars, as high as 8-9 months. “The waiting period for certain fast-selling models has increased dramatically. This is especially true for electric vehicles and CNGrun vehicles. People are preferring electric vehicles and customers are ready to wait as well,” said an Ahmedabadbased dealer. Dealers said that long waiting periods were a deterrent over the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/worst-diwali-in-a-decade-for-auto-dealers/articleshow/87807156.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Lucknow||Will BJP reap benefits of repeal in Uttar Pradesh elections?||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement for the repeal of three contentious farm laws is likely to have a major impact in the politics of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the two states going to polls early next year. While the BJP may make a comeback in the contest in Punjab, its dilemma over the impact of the farm laws in UP will also be over for now. Live updates: Govt repeals farm lawsThe impact of the farmers’ agitation was primarily visible in western UP as the region happened to be the native place of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait and Naresh Tikait. Since the Tikaits come from the Jat community, most of the Jat farmers also stood behind the BKU leadership. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament.Though discussions on the issues of farmers are common in UP and Bihar during, before and after the elections, they have never come out as a consolidated votebank. Even farmers get affected by the caste divide and politics which ultimately positions them in favour or against a party, or a candidate, at least in UP and Bihar. Read AlsoFarm laws: Modi move may change Punjab poll equationsNEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's announcement of the repeal of the three farm laws may change the electoral temper in poll-bound Punjab. Until the PM went on air, the three laws seemed set to be one of the themes which would have defined next year's contest in the Congress-ruled state. Congress rebelThis is where the BJP’s Jat politics was getting affected ahead of UP assembly polls. Not only Tikaits, even parties like the Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) – which primarily thrives on Jat support base – was also trying to cash in on the protest against the farm laws. Read AlsoFarm laws: Boost for Rahul line on 'street politics'?The decision of the Modi government to rollback the three farm laws is reminiscent of the BJP regime’s wilting under pressure over its proposed amendments to the land acquisition Act, and is likely to strengthen the Rahul Gandhi line of argument that the opposition needs to pick issues against theAccording to BJP leaders, farmers’ protest had undoubtedly given a new lease of life to the RLD, a party which had been losing confidence and Jat votebank ever since Jayant’s father late Chaudhary Ajit Singh grew old, and the BJP, after Muzaffarnagar riots, penetrated deep into the Jat community. Riding on the Modi wave, BJP had bagged all the 17 seats from the region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.  In 2017 UP elections too, the party won 60 out of 80 assembly seats in west UP. However, BJP registered a slight dip in the number of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party shared seven seats between them leaving BJP with only 10 out of 17 seats. “Even then, the BJP managed to get maximum Jat votes in its favour. Since the Jat community is vocal in nature, it is not easy to keep them in good humour all the time,” a BJP leader told TOI. The farmers’ protest added to the woes of the BJP as Naresh Tikait and Rakesh Tikait, under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, managed to create a buzz in west UP and Terai region. Read AlsoRepeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decisionPM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs ofParties like RLD pounced on the opportunity and rallied behind farmers to win back Jat support. “The common refrain among RLD workers in west UP was ‘Krishi kanoon to bahana hai, Jayant Chaudhary ko jamana hai,” a BJP leader claimed. Talking to TOI, RLD spokesman Rohit Agrawal said, “Now, it has been proved that RLD was on the right track by standing with the farmers. We have not been talking about Jats or Gurjars but bhaichara (brotherhood),” he added. As the 2022 UP assembly election will be the first after the demise of Chaudhary Ajit Singh, Jayant faces the tedious task of cementing his position and saving the RLD’s vote base. According to political analysts, the “floating” Jat voter, who was a bit confused over the farm law and was mulling to switch loyalty, would now be able to make up his mind. They said the repeal of farm laws will not only be a matter of concern for RLD but also for other opposition parties as they had been rallying behind the farmers to create a perception among voters that the BJP was working against their interests. Former journalist and BJP spokesman Avinish Tyagi, who is also a native of west UP, termed the PM’s decision as “far-sighted”. However, Congress leader Surendra Singh Rajput claimed that the fear of losing the elections forced the PM to repeal the farm laws. “Farmers and youths can see the intentions of the BJP and would not fall in the trap. The government should also guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) to farmers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-bjp-reap-benefits-of-repeal-in-up-elections/articleshow/87808323.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Gehlot was reviewing the corona and seasonal diseases situation at his residence on Friday. He said sampling should be increased across the state, especially, in those areas where cases of infection were increasing. He said considering the experiences during the second wave and the nature of this virus, the strategy of re-testing, tracking, and tracing should be implemented strongly. He said it was necessary to stop the infection at the primary level. The chief minister said a letter will be written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to allow booster doses. He said booster doses were being administered in about 35 countries of the world and it was necessary that to save people from the third wave. He directed that emphasis should be given to fogging for preventing dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. Medical minister Raghu Sharma said wherever Covid positive cases were being reported, mobility of the people should be curbed. Secretary, medical and health, Vaibhav Galaria, during his presentation, pointed that number of active cases had gone up to 95 and said instructions had been given to increase the number of sampling to 25,000 per day. He said random sampling was being done in malls, schools and markets along with genome sequencing at the lab located at SMS Medical College to identify the variant of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-booster-jabs-for-people-with-low-immunity/articleshow/87807164.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Travel in wheelchairs to identify concrete obstacles on pavements, says Delhi high court to to SDMC staff||NEW DELHI: Zeroing in on concrete ramps encroaching public pavements in colonies, Delhi high court has said these prove to be a “harrowing experience” for children and elderly. In a unique experiment to ensure the usability of footpaths, the court has asked engineers of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to travel on wheelchairs in a south Delhi colony to identify obstacles. Justice Najmi Waziri said the corporation’s “executive engineer/assistant engineer/junior engineer shall traverse the entire colony’s footpaths on a wheelchair without any aid or assistance from anyone. This will test the efficacy of SDMC’s efforts to make the streets and footpaths user-friendly”. The court also pointed out that concrete ramps damaged trees that needed breathing space around them and directed that all concretisation beyond the road and the walking-paths laid by the corporation/PWD “shall be removed from the earth, no matter how deep the concrete”. Freedom of movement is a constitutional guarantee and “it should not be hemmed in by the lack of requisite civic amenities”, the court noted. “Citizens need to be empowered and facilitated in the enjoyment of their constitutional rights for which provision of basic civic amenities is essential, like a safe and secure neighbourhood, tree-lined avenues and footpaths, where an endeavour of a leisurely stroll is actually a pleasurable exercise and not an obstacle-dodging, harrowing experience.” It added that ramps “discourage walking to neighbourhood shopping centres, to community-bonding cultural events and for leisure-time in colony parks. Instead, people would use motor vehicles, adding to the city’s ever-burgeoning traffic congestion and unmitigated air pollution. So, it all starts with taking care of the neighbourhood trees and greenery and ensuring that the footpaths winding through the tree shaded avenues are obstacle-free”. The directions came while taking stock of steps taken to deconcretise trees in Vasant Vihar. It directed SDMC to place photographs of each stretch “so repaired, restored and made user-friendly, showing the before and after scenario”. On ramps, the court cited agreement by all stakeholders that removal of encroachments “will facilitate movement in the colony of the elderly, children and the wheelchair-bound”. Petitioner Bhavreen Kandhari has highlighted failure of civic bodies to monitor the wanton concretisation of sidewalks and other constructions on public land, leading to drying up of tree roots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/travel-in-wheelchairs-to-identify-concrete-obstacles-on-pavements-hc-to-sdmc-staff/articleshow/87807167.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Law in drain, worker forced into manhole in Chandkheda||AHMEDABAD: An AMC contract labourer was made to descend into a manhole late on November 17, Wednesday, in Chandkheda. A video recorded by a member of Manav Garima Trust, an organization championing the rights of sanitation workers, shows a few workers standing at the mouth of a manhole while their colleague is lowered into it. The video shows that the worker, clad in shorts and a vest, has no safety gear besides a harness attached to a rope. “Our member recorded this incident late on Wednesday night on the road opposite Tulsi Residency in Chandkheda,” said Parsottam Vaghela, the director of Manav Garima Trust. “Our member told the AMC contractor’s men that making workers enter a manhole is a criminal offence. However, they did not listen.” He added: “This is a clear violation of Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.” The Act prohibits states and Union Territories from employing workers for manual cleaning of sewers and drainage lines. In July 2019, a writ petition was filed by Manav Garima Trust over workers’ safety. In response, the Gujarat government had submitted to the Gujarat high court that the state’s civic bodies have been directed to ensure that no person is asked to enter manholes for cleaning. The government had also submitted that nodal officers will be appointed in all civic bodies to ensure adherence to safety guidelines. The officers are supposed to initiate criminal proceedings for violations of the guidelines. M P Parmar, the AMC-appointed nodal officer for the Chandkheda ward, said that he was not aware of the incident. “Members of Manav Garima Trust have informed us about an incident. We will definitely look into it and take action if we find that any law was violated,” said Ahmedabad city’s nodal officer Manish Shah. “Despite all these laws, civic authorities in the state have mostly outsourced the work for cleaning sewers and drainage networks,” Vaghela said. “Civic authorities wash their hands off once they give away a contract. Due to such negligence, workers lose lives.” On August 26, two tribal labourers were asphyxiated after they were made to enter a sewage line in Bopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/law-in-drain-worker-forced-into-manhole-in-chandkheda/articleshow/87807174.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Goa||Goa airport runway goes dark after tech snag, flights delayed||PANAJI: There were some nervous moments at Goa International Airport on Friday evening after the runway lights suffered a technical snag and the lone 2.3km runway went dark. Flight operations were disrupted for a short while, and at least one flight was diverted to Mumbai as a precautionary measure. The Indian Navy’s electrical team conducted a full inspection of the electrical circuits and ensured that the lights were back before nightfall. “During the ongoing runway work, there was a technical snag around 4pm. The runway lights were restored by 5:05pm,” said a naval officer. The Navy had issued a NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) at 4pm warning airlines about the glitch and the expected disruption in flight operations. The airport at Dabolim operates out of the naval air base INS Hansa, and the aerodrome is managed by the Indian Navy. Due to the technical snag, departing flights reported delays ranging from 10 minutes to 90 minutes. IndiGo flight 6E-5402 from Delhi was diverted to Mumbai while en route to Goa. Goa airport director Gagan Malik said that the Navy’s air traffic control had informed airport authorities as soon as the technical snag was detected. “There was a technical snag during the ongoing runway repair works, and as a preventive measure to check all the circuits, the runway lights were switched off as the navy’s electrical team undertook a thorough inspection of the circuits on a war footing,” said a naval officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-airport-runway-goes-dark-after-tech-snag-flights-delayed/articleshow/87807836.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Lucknow||Change of heart for fear of defeat in Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra||LUCKNOW: Terming the central government’s decision to repeal the farm laws a “U-turn”, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday said the change of heart was due to the fear of defeat in assembly elections. “The PM has sought an apology from the nation on the issue of farmers… He has announced to repeal the farm laws but people of the country are not naive. They are aware that elections are round the corner and circumstances are not in favour of the BJP. Therefore, he is asking for an apology now after the death of over 600 farmers,” Priyanka, who was in Lucknow, said. Reminding the people that the farmers were addressed with terms like ‘andolanjeevi’, ‘goonda’, ‘aatankwadi’ and ‘deshdrohi’, she questioned the PM’s silence when such disrespect was shown to farmers. “What was the PM doing when farmers were being labelled as ‘andolanjeevi’ and ‘aatankwadi’? Why was he silent when the farmers were cane charged and when they died during the course of agitation,” she asked. Referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, she said: “While he remained ignorant to the pain and plight of the aggrieved families, he continued to keep the minister, whose son is accused in the case, under his wings.” Priyanka raised doubts over the intention of the government but expressed happiness over the fact that it finally realized that there was nothing more important than the farmers of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/change-of-heart-for-fear-of-defeat-in-polls-priyanka/articleshow/87808328.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Addressing the gathering during foundation laying of Rs 3,240 crore Arjun Sahayak, Bhawni and Stauti irrigation projects for Mahoba, Hamirpur and Lalitpur, Yogi said the basic facilities like potable water “remained a dream” for the region for years after Independence. “It was in 2014 that the country got a leadership under PM Narendra Modi who pitched for holistic development of farmers, youth, women and poor and gave thrust to development in backward regions, including Bundelkhand,” he said. He lauded the Narendra Modi government at the Centre for lending thrust to the development of hitherto parched region. The CM said not only development projects like Bundelkhand expressway were initiated, but irrigation and potable water under Har Ghar Yojana was also being fast-tracked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-gave-thrust-to-devpt-in-bkhand/articleshow/87808334.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Sackings continue, MSRTC to hire 2,000 fresh recruits||MUMBAI: With the employees’ strike entering its 23rd day on Friday, the MSRTC suspended 297 more workers, taking the total number of suspensions to 2,776, and terminated the services of 238 daily-wage workers, an official said. And to tide over the employee crisis, the management has decided to hire fresh recruits for the posts of drivers, conductors and clerical staff on daily-wage basis to operate its fleet of buses lying idle at 250 depots across Maharashtra. Sources said that over 2,000 drivers and conductors are likely to be recruited soon. “Most of them will be from our earlier waiting list of candidates who will have to agree to our new terms and conditions and work during crisis situations,” said a senior official. The MSRTC had issued termination notices to 2,296 daily wage drivers, conductors and few other staffers for not reporting to duty despite being called on an emergency. The state transport corporation will also sign fresh contracts to hire 500 buses with drivers, who will operate them on ‘wet lease’, to ferry over a lakh commuters across Maharashtra. The private vehicles will operate on the lines of Lal Pari—the standard non-AC bus of MSRTC—and charge normal fare, an official said. Transport minister Anil Parab said there was no proposal to “privatise” MSRTC at the moment, but they will study the transport corporations of other states to explore solutions. “... this(privatisation) too is an option, but there is no proposal as of now,” said Parab. The minister further said that they have appealed to the workers to resume work and that the government is open for discussion. “As a government, we have to consider the inconvenience faced by the general public too,” said Parab. On Friday, the MSRTC operated around 150 buses across the state ferrying 3,500-4,000 commuters, sources said. The strike is likely to continue over the weekend, while scores of protesters from the 250 bus depots are likely to converge in Mumbai for a ‘show of strength’ protest by Monday, sources in the unions said. Union leader Shashank Rao said that workers will continue to be on strike till the key demand of merger of the MSRTC with the state government is accepted. The Bombay high court will hear the contempt petition matter on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sackings-continue-msrtc-to-hire-2000-fresh-recruits/articleshow/87808996.cms||Somit Sen

The 71-year-old, who visited 26 countries in the last16 years with his wife Mohana Vijayan (69) using the money they saved from their small teashop, succumbed to a cardiac arrest on Friday morning. The couple, who inspired many people to achieve their travel goals despite financial constraints, had recently visited Russia -- one of Vijayan's dream destinations. It was their first international trip since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. It was also the first international tour in which their children and grandchildren accompanied them. The couple was planning to head next to Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia. Mohana, wife of K R Vijayan, breaks down when his body was brought to their house at Gandhinagar in Kochi on Friday eveningThe duo had shown to the world how people could fund even world trips with their meagre earnings. They have been running the Sree Balaji Coffee House at Gandhinagar in Kochi for nearly 30 years and they found money for their trips by saving Rs 300 a day. Vijayan’s passion for travel began in his childhood when his father took him on short trips. He began travelling on his own when he grew up. His first destinations were mostly within Kerala like Munnar and Wayanad, and later he started exploring other states. The trips turned even more exciting when wife Mohana became his travel companion over four decades ago. The couple became international tourists in 2007 with a trip to Israel. Since then, they have visited the UK, the US, France, Austria, Egypt and the UAE, among other countries. They took loans whenever their savings fell short for a journey and worked overtime to repay them. “I always wanted to see the world with my own eyes rather than through videos or travel stories of others. And when it happens with my beloved wife, it is even more beautiful. Money will not be a problem if we are determined to travel and are really passionate about it,” Vijayan had said once. Later on, when they hit the headlines, many travel agencies started sponsoring them on trips. Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra had offered to sponsor one of their trips in 2019 after hearing their inspirational story. The pandemic, however, affected their travel plans after a 2019 trip to Australia and New Zealand. Vijayan was also planning a Singapore trip to inaugurate a travel agency there that made him its brand ambassador. The couple had also brought out a book of their travel stories -- Chaaya Vittu Vijayanteyum Mohanayudeyum Loka Sancharangal (The World Trips of Vijayan and Mohana by Selling Tea). Besides Mohana, Vijayan is survived by daughters Sasikala V Prabhu, Usha V Prabhu, sons-in-law Jayaram P Pai, Muralidhara Pai and grandchildren Arun, Amritha and Manjunath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/globetrotting-tea-seller-vijayan-bids-adieu/articleshow/87807183.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition hail withdrawal of farm laws||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, opposition leader VD Satheesan and other leaders lauded the farmers for maintaining the tempo of the protests until the Centre decided to withdraw the controversial farm laws. “The year-long farmers’ protest has finally triumphed. Indian farmers have scripted one of the brightest chapters in the history of class struggles. Salutes to the martyrs, farmers and organisations who fought with unmatched resoluteness and undying spirit,” Pinarayi Vijayan tweeted. In a further statement, the chief minister said that it was when the farmers realised that their very existence is in danger that they rose in protest. In the protest that lasted for almost a year, 700 farmers became martyrs. Their martyrdom did not go in vain, the chief minister said. The farmers protest is a tight slap on the face of Sangh Parivar agenda of dividing the people to enforce corporate interests, he said. The Centre had to kneel before one of the biggest protests witnessed by the 21st century, said Satheesan. More than the late realisation at the doorsteps of elections to two major states, it cannot be believed that the Prime Minister or the Sangh Parivar forces have any sincerity towards the farmers of the country. The farmers have won over an undemocratic government that would do anything with their brutal majority. This is the victory of democracy, he said. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that the Centre withdrew the laws for fear that it cannot withstand the wrath of farmers. This achievement was scripted with the blood and sweat of lakhs of farmers. Maintaining the Gandhian method of protest even after falling prey before bullets is something which is unparalleled, he said. Congratulating the farmers, he said that the Centre and the state will have to reduce the fuel prices also before such protests by the people. The farmers gave a befitting reply to the Centre’s move to impose the corporate agenda, while also trying to divide the farmers, said CPI leader and All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) national secretary Satyan Mokeri. He said that it was after the failed efforts to divide the farmers, who stood united, that the Prime Minister finally apologised to the farmers and announced withdrawing the laws, he said. He said that the Prime Minister has not yet said anything about minimum support price and clarity is needed in such matters. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said that the decision of the Centre to give up before the farmers is an indicator of hope for the country’s democracy. He said that the downfall of Narendra Modi has begun from the farmers’ protest land and it will soon spread across the country. The farmers’ protest reminds of the historical fight put up by the country’s public against British rule, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pinarayi-opposition-hail-withdrawal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/87806362.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Only 3% of questions raised by corporators on bad roads in Mumbai: NGO||Mumbai: All major political parties had promised a pothole-free Mumbai in their 2017 BMC election manifestos, but till date, only 3% of the questions raised by the elected representatives were on bad roads, found a recent analysis by NGO Praja Foundation. This, despite Mumbaikars registering 17,908 pothole complaints from 2017 to 2021. The maximum citizen complaints were about sewerage (75,915), but only 6% of the questions posed by corporators across party lines were on the issue. Also, almost all parties had promised better solid waste services in the run-up to the 2017 civic polls, but 40% of the complaints received by the BMC till date are on garbage not collected. With the BMC elections scheduled early next year, Praja Foundation analysed the manifesto promises of the major political parties—Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party—and compared them with deliberations, specific manifesto points and citizens’ complaints related to those points. The NGO’s survey, while tracking the complaints and deliberations, found that some of the most common citizens’ complaints have not been successfully deliberated upon by elected representatives. In the period from 2017-21, the BMC received 34,129 complaints about unauthorised hawkers, but only 6% of the questions raised by corporators were on the issue. “The disparity between complaints filed and questions asked by corporators reaffirms the importance of deliberation of citizen-specific issues,” Milind Mhaske, director of Praja Foundation, said. The NGO’s analysis also showed that 14% of the questions asked by corporators in civic meetings were on renaming roads, chowks and buildings in the city. For the 2022 BMC elections, Mhaske has called for target-wise manifestos to be released so that citizens too can analyse the targets achieved before the 2027 polls. “Despite promises to resolve issues related to potholes, water supply and unauthorised hawkers among others, deliberations on them have not been adequate,” said Mhaske. “The overall proportion of questions asked by political parties on issues related to potholes was only 3%. Parties should therefore set targets and ensure that the manifestos align to achieving these targets by creating programmes around the same,” he suggested. Nitai Mehta, trustee of Praja Foundation, said, “Before civic elections, parties develop their own manifestos that outline the objectives of their candidates for the upcoming corporators’ term, based on which citizens elect their representatives. The manifesto, among other things, includes action plans and promises to provide civic wants and needs as well as solve various service delivery related issues that citizens face on a regular basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-3-of-questions-raised-by-corporators-on-bad-roads-in-mumbai-ngo/articleshow/87808702.cms||Richa Pinto

Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Guru Purab or Prakash Utsav is one of the most sacred festivals in Sikhism and it marks the birth anniversary of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. The celebrations began on Wednesday with kirtans organised at gurudwaras. The main programme was held at the Gurudwara Gurunanak Darbar Shingada Talao. “The celebrations began 48 hours before the occasion, which included 48-hours of non-stop recitation of Guru Granth Sahib known as Akhand Path,” said Balvinder Singh Chaudhary, the treasurer of the Gurudwara. “This year, the celebrations were carried out after a gap of two years. We ensured that the people followed the Covid norms in the interest of the public,” said Chaudhary. However, programmes like Nagar kirtan – a procession that is held every year on Guru Nanak Jayanti day, was not organized this year owing to the Covid restrictions. Kirtan by Bhai Joginder Singh Ji and Bhai Jagir Singh Ji (Dehradun Wale) were also held on special occasion.

Panchal and Sheth called an ambulance and took the two to the Asarwa Civil Hospital. Both Shaikh and Ajmeri have been admitted to the trauma centre and are said to be stable. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) city person and spokesman advocate Shamshad Pathan alleged that right-wing groups were behind the attacks. Pathan said the two men were attacked after the attackers asked their names and this was a hate crime. He said AIMIM will give a memorandum to the DGP asking that a complaint of attempted murder be lodged. Sabarmati riverfront (west) police registered a case of causing grievous hurt, and the FIR does not mention it being a hate crime. Sabarmati riverfront (west) police inspector V M Desai was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-men-knifed-by-six-on-riverfront/articleshow/87807185.cms||---

Of the total 7,583 sanitary workers (both permanent and daily wagers), 17% work with other departments, with most of them assigned to corporators and working as domestic helps. Another 7% are engaged in cleaning choked sewerage lines, reveals data procured from the BJP ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Most of the 17% sanitary workers deployed in other departments are being used as personal help by corporators and officials. Data procured from NMC revealed that 7,583 sanitary workers have been deployed with the solid waste management (SWM) department to sweep around 4,400km roads in corporation limits. However, as many as 1,297 have been attached with other departments, while around 525 are engaged in cleaning choked sewage lines across the corporation limits. Most of the workers attached with other departments are working as personal helps either with corporators or at the homes of senior NMC officials. NMC’s fire and emergency services department also has 70 daily wagers, who work with them as helpers, assigned to it by SWM. According to the data, the highest number of sanitary workers engaged for other works are from Gandhibagh zone. Under this zone, out of 957 sanitary workers, around 214 are engaged for other works. It is followed by the Lakadganj zone. Of the 732 sanitary workers deployed for sweeping works, 154 are doing non-sanitation works and 71 are working for cleaning drainage lines. The situation is no different in Dharampeth zone. Here, of the 828 sanitary workers deployed for sweeping of roads, 147 were attached to different departments, and 55 are being spared for cleaning choked sewers. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said the prime responsibility of sanitary workers should be sweeping roads, and blamed redeployment of workers to other places on the freeze in recruitment by the state government. “Due to lack of staff, many sanitary workers are being deployed in other departments,” he said, refusing to comment further. Senior Congress corporator Sandip Sahare said many corporators use sanitary workers for personal works. “In the past, the misuse of sanitary workers for personal works had been raised in the general body meeting. But in vain,” he said. “This was one of the reasons Nagpur city fails in Swachh Bharat rankings. In last ranking, the city had secured low points for unclean streets in former mayor Nanda Jichkar’s ward,” he said. Activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “The working hours for sanitary workers are from 6am to 2pm. However, hardly any sanitary worker is seen sweeping the road before 8am.” “We need to increase field working hours and strict monitoring, which will significantly reduce manpower requirement and our roads will also look cleaner. We are also falling short on co-ordination between garbage sweeping and garbage pick-up,” he said. “We often see in social media, so many NGOs conduct road cleaning activities and claim to collect huge amounts of waste. If road cleaning by sanitary workers is regular, then how do these NGOs collect such a huge amount of waste?” Chatterjee said. “Most importantly, we must accept modern technology, gadgets and change according to the times, considering the cost benefit economics. Failure in implementation of award winning wristwatch concept is very disappointing. We must agree that we are falling short in proper manpower management and supervision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/almost-17-sanitary-workers-working-as-domestic-helps-for-corporators/articleshow/87807201.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They also lit earthen lamps on the banks of the river. To avoid snarl-ups, traffic was diverted, with security arrangements already in place to prevent any untoward incident. The mela area was divided into nine zones and 32 sectors, officials said. With All India Sikh Conference president Gurucharan Singh Babbar writing to the DGP that Prakash Utsav will be celebrated by the organisation at Har-ki-Pauri, where 464-year-old Gurdwara Sri Gyan Godri was demolished decades ago, officials barricaded the area, dividing it into a separate zone to ward off any trouble. At gurdwaras in different parts of the city, shabad kirtan was performed and langars (community kitchens) were organised. The festival began on Devutthana Ekadashi (the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) of the Hindu month of Kartik, which is considered auspicious as gods rise on the day) and concluded on the 15th day (Kartik Purnima). At Shantikunj, Tulsi-Shaligram marriage was solemnised by Gayatri Banamala Mandal, a social organisation. Tulsi plants were distributed and schoolchildren, dressed as Radha and Krishna, performed on the occasion. Meanwhile, local traders had a field day, with their business picking up after a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/12-lakh-pilgrims-take-holy-dip-in-ganga-at-har-ki-pauri-on-kartik-purnima/articleshow/87806365.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mullaperiyar tree felling: IAS body backs Bennichan Thomas, to seek review of suspension||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The IAS association has thrown its weight behind principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Bennichan Thomas, who has been suspended from service for issuing orders permitting Tamil Nadu to fell trees from baby dam in Mullaperiyar. It is reliably learnt that the association that met here on Thursday, passed a resolution in support of Thomas and has also decided to request the government to review his suspension. Sources said that the suspension of an upright officer has adversely affected the morale of the all-India service officers. The association members are also likely to meet chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to request him to revoke the suspension of the officer. The government has already instituted an inquiry in the matter. Interestingly, the move by the IAS association has come at a time when forest service officials are upset about one of their members being made a scapegoat by the government, despite records showing that the order permitting felling the trees was issued with the knowledge and involvement of two senior IAS officers. “Instead of passing a resolution now, the IAS officials involved in the matter should have done their share properly and informed the government about what happened in the chain of events that led to issuing such an order, including owning up their role in the matter. Not doing anything when an honest officer was made a scapegoat and passing a resolution now is sheer hypocrisy,” said an IFS officer on conditions of anonymity. The political executives and the secretaries of water resources and the forests and wildlife departments claimed that they neither had any knowledge about nor any role in issuing the order. However, the records prove that senior officials, including additional chief secretary (water resources) TK Jose who is also the additional chief secretary (home and vigilance), and principal secretary (forests and wildlife) R K Sinha, had clear knowledge of the subject, and had even assured Tamil Nadu that the request to fell the trees is being processed. Last week, the IFS association members met the chief minister, and submitted a memorandum requesting the government to revoke the suspension of Thomas. Meanwhile, the IPS association is remaining silent in the matter as one of its senior members, G Lakshman, has ended up being suspended from service last week for colluding with fraudster Monson Mavunkal. Sources said that it might not be the right move to come up in support of a fellow all-India service officer, when its own member has been suspended, even though Lakshman’s suspension has a legitimate reason unlike in the case of Bennichan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ias-body-backs-bennichan-to-seek-review-of-suspension/articleshow/87806384.cms||KP Saikiran

However, as hospital admissions continue, doctors feel this will be certain, more or less, only after December. “We are keeping our fingers crossed that this low positivity continues. After the festive season as well, the numbers have not increased,” said a public health expert. It has been only two weeks since Diwali got over. At the same time, as immunisation has been enhanced, severity levels have dipped. Presently, 20 patients are admitted in various Covid authorised hospitals in the city. Out of these, six are on ventilators. The weekly positivity rate is 0.22% The active cases are 27, while the recovery rate is 98.7% “There can be a few peaks here and there, but not a major surge if one goes by the current trend since the past few months,” said a public health expert. Since November till date, 44 cases have been reported with an average 2-3 new cases a day. “But we have to wait until the end of next month till we are able to vaccinate all the adult population here. The antibodies level is above 75% in the overall population while first dose coverage is more than 100%,” said an official in the UT health department. Doctors do not warn of any more variants even though there are some countries and states in the country which are seeing a rise in the weekly positivity after the festivity. “That is why we still need to follow Covid-appropriate behavior as there are no travel restrictions now,” said a doctor in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pandemic-turning-into-endemic-guess-experts/articleshow/87807199.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Ahmedabad||Pandemic, Taliban forcing mafia to clear drug caches in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The recent seizures of some of the biggest drugs haul in Gujarat cannot be mere coincidence but that happened because the drug mafias had earlier could not clear the drug loads as there were restrictions of movement across the globe due to the Covid-19 pandemic and later the Taliban took over power in Afghanistan — the major manufacturer of the opium. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were restrictions in travel and transportation due to which mafias could not send the drugs by individual couriers as they earlier used to. Earlier, these drugs mafia used to send small time couriers with the drugs weighing merely in few grams or kilos,” said an agency officer. When the situation was a bit normalised post the pandemic, Taliban took over the power in Afghanistan in August this year. Due to this, the drug mafias are in a hurry to clear their stock fearing fear confiscation of the heroin stock by the Taliban and the drug lords may also face the prospect of summary execution if caught by the Taliban. Not just in India but other countries have been witnessing the big hauls of the drug seizure, said officers of different agencies. This situation also pumped in prodigious quantities of the drugs, mainly heroin, in India. In September, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had seized 3,000kg heroin from Mundra port in Kutch. On September19, the Gujarat Anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had seized 30kg heroin with seven Iranian crew members in a mid-sea operation. That drugs were also sent in desperation by an Iranian drugs mafia Imam Baksh. Later on November 15, the Gujarat ATS seized 120kg drugs worth Rs 600 crore from Jinjuda village of Morbi and so far nabbed seven members. The drugs consignment was sent by an alleged Pakistani drugs Mafia Zahid Baloch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pandemic-taliban-forcing-mafia-to-clear-drug-caches/articleshow/87807202.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Nashik||Centre must ensure foodgrain MSP round the year: Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse||NASHIK: State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said the Centre must ensure that the mechanism to give the minimum support price for foodgrain is active throughout the year and is not limited to certain months. Bhuse, state civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal and farmers’ organisations felt that the PM’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws was a “victory for the resolute farmers, who had put up a brave fight against the Union government.” The important demand of the farmers’ movement is the enactment of a central law guaranteeing a fair price for all agricultural commodities and all farmers. “The government has not said anything about this. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), Kisan Sabha and like-minded organizations will hold an immediate meeting to study all these developments and announce the necessary decisions,” said Ajit Navale of SKM. Farmers organisations and other political parties gathered at the statue of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar in Nashik city to celebrate.  Bhuse told TOI, “Had the Union government made this decision earlier, the lives of the farmers, who died in the agitation, would have been saved.” Bhujbal said the prolonged stir had forced the Centre to withdraw the laws. “The farmers in the country, by continuing with the agitation for about a year in a peaceful manner, have set an example. The government had to repeal; though it may have happened after a series of defeat in elections and some upcoming elections,” Bhujbal said. The farmers from Nashik had joined the agitation in December last year, when about 2,000 farmers went to Delhi to express their solidarity with the agitating farmers. Raju Desle, the state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, said the government should quickly draw up rehabilitation plan for the families of about 700 farmers who died in the agitation. The issue does not end with the Prime Minister seeking ‘forgiveness’ of the farmers. The kin of the farmers, who died during the agitation, should be given Rs 50 lakh as ex-gratia and even a government job to one relative,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/centre-must-ensure-foodgrain-msp-round-the-year-agri-min/articleshow/87805709.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Farmer groups welcome historic victory, demand law on MSP now||Mumbai: Farmers groups in the state greeted the repeal of the three farm laws with processions in different parts of the state, but said the real victory would come when the Centre passed a law assuring minimum support price (MSP) for crops. “We welcome the repeal of the anti-farmer and pro-corporate laws. This is a victory of a historic farmers agitation,” said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha. “Besides the repeal, the Centre should fulfil our demand for a beneficial minimum support price for crops and farm produce. It should also withdraw the amendments in the Electricity Act,” said Ajit Navle of the farmers union, Kisan Sabha. The Maharashtra government should also withdraw its draft farm laws that the Kisan Sabha has demanded. The amendments had been tabled in the state assembly session in July and opinions had been sought on the draft. Unions have argued that the draft laws only make minor changes in the repealed Central laws. “Farmers will not stop raising their voices until a law guaranteeing MSP is passed,” said Raju Shetti from the Swabhimaani Shetkari Sanghatna. Shetti who had tabled two Private Members’ Bill in the Parliament in 2018, said, “I had introduced a bill to guarantee remunerative prices for farm produce. It is time to re-introduce the bill with some relevant modifications,” Shetti said. “It will ensure whether or not the produce is sold inside the Agricultural Produce Market Committee or outside, and to government or private entities. Farmers will get remunerative prices without worrying about the artificial price drop or frauds carried out by private entities,” he added. “Maharashtra had reformed farm laws beginning in 2006, but it did not improve the economic condition of farmers,” said Kishor Tiwari, from the Vidarbha Janandolan Samiti who is in the Shiv Sena. He said that the decision on repealing the laws had a lot to do with the upcoming polls in UP and Punjab. “We always welcome elections because at least then, some pro-farmer announcements are made,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farmer-groups-welcome-historic-victory-demand-law-on-msp-now/articleshow/87808999.cms||---

The tourist accommodation facility at the reserve, which can house 60 people at a time, was inaugurated on Friday by state food and civil supplies and consumer protection minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also the district guardian minister. The reserve is popular for sighting blackbucks, hyenas, foxes and wolves. Opening the facility for tourists, Bhujbal appreciated the role of the villagers in encouraging the forest department to carry out various projects while maintaining an ecological balance. “The villagers here are cooperative and hence the forest department has taken steps to strengthen tourism here. This, in turn, will help the economy of the region,” he said. The facility at the Mamdapur reserve was set up at a cost of about Rs 40 lakh and more development is expected there. Committees have been set up in the area for the conservation of wildlife and various facilities have been provided to the citizens of the area, Bhujbal said. Assistant conservation of forest Sujeet Nevse said the tourists visiting the sites will be provided with tents and bicycles and allowed to go on nature trails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mamdapur-reserve-to-offer-dorms-tents-for-tourists/articleshow/87805729.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||Char Dham priests divided over contesting polls||Dehradun: With state government yet to take a call on the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act, priests and their organisation remain divided on the issue of contesting the upcoming assembly polls in Uttarakhand due early next year. While some senior priests are in favour of fielding candidates on 15 seats of the Himalayan state, another section opines that the focus should be on "opposing the board and protesting against it till the time the Act is repealed". Krishna Kant Kothiyal, president, Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, a body representing the teerth purohit (priest) community, had on Thursday announced that the priests, in protest against BJP government’s decision to create a Devasthanam Board, would field candidate from 15 assembly seats of Uttarakhand. "If the Act is not withdrawn by BJP government, we will field our candidates. We will speak with opposition parties and convince them not to contest from these seats. We want a direct fight with the BJP and crush them by a convincing margin," Kothiyal told TOI. When told a section of the teerth purohits were opposed to the idea, he said, "Some people may have changed their mind and have started supporting BJP government but I am not doing so. It is clear that either the BJP takes back the Devasthanam Management Board or we will enter the political arena." On the other hand, Brijesh Sati, spokesperson, mahapanchayat, said, "Our work is to perform religious rituals and help pilgrims and not to field candidates in assembly elections. Teerth purohits have their presence in 17 assembly seats but it does not mean that we will enter the political arena. It may be the view of an individual but not the organisation." Another teerth purohit Umesh Sati said for past 23 months, the priests have been protesting against the board. "It’s been 23 months since we have been fighting for the cause. Amid all this, a statement was made by few individuals on contesting elections. We strictly criticise the statement and distance ourself from it. We are a non-political organisation and the body was formed to oppose theboard. We do not want to derive any political mileage out of it," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-priests-divided-over-contesting-polls/articleshow/87806382.cms||---

The BJP group party leader in the BMC, Vinod Mishra, in a letter to the BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal said that the asphalt and mastic ready-mix plant owners colluded with each other and rigged the bidding process. Mishra claimed he had already cautioned the civic body about this.“Even before the financial bids can be opened, it was decided whom the tenders are going to be bagged by and I have a list of these names too. Due to the restrictive and arbitrary condition of undertaking with asphalt and mastic plant owners, a cartel has been formed by them and their crony contractors. I therefore request the BMC to cancel all these seven Tenders of Reinstatement of Trenches,” said Mishra. He added that the BMC must order a strict, independent and fair inquiry into the matter which he termed to be a scam because it is a criminal conspiracy and ‘loot of public money’. Corporators have been suggesting that the BMC remove the condition of undertaking of bidders with asphalt & mastic plants in all future tenders to avoid Cartelization. The BMC said that the tendering process is still ongoing and the rules would be followed. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-alleges-cartelisation-in-bmcs-trenching-tenders/articleshow/87808711.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Allowing the plea of an IAS officer for inter-cadre transfer, the high court said, “the right to meaningful family life, which allows a person to live a fulfilling life and helps in retaining his/her physical, psychological and emotional integrity would find a place in the four corners of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Therefore, when the state unreasonably denies a request of an employee seeking inter-cadre transfer, it impinges upon such person’s right to demand respect for his/her family life.” A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh agreed with the woman IAS officer’s contention that denial of her request for inter-cadre transfer by West Bengal government has resulted in an infraction of her right to family life. “The fact that such rights are recognised as a part of human rights clearly emerges upon a perusal of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. A plain reading of Article 8(1) of the Convention discloses that every individual has the right to insist that the state respects his/her private and family life, home and correspondence,” the high court pointed out. The bench rejected WB’s opposition to her transfer and noted that her request was declined without a cogent reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-to-family-life-hc-allows-plea-for-inter-cadre-transfer/articleshow/87807219.cms||Abhinav Garg

The teen was with two friends and the parlour owner saw one of them allegedly taking milk from a crate outside his shop. The man chased the kids in his car and injured the teen, according to the complaint. The victim’s 40-year-old mother, a Narol resident, filed the complaint on Thursday. She said that at about 5am her son was on a gearless two-wheeler with his friends. She said that they were on their way to play cricket. The woman said that not long after her son had left home, the security guard of her society told her that the owner of the parlour was beating her son. She rushed to the parlour and found that her son had been injured on hands and legs and was bleeding. Cops aware of the case said it appears that one of the boys had emptied milk pouches from the crate into the storage compartment of the two-wheeler. The woman said that the kids ran away from the scooter after spotting the parlour owner. According to the complaint, the man first threw stumps at the kids and then chased them in his car, injuring the teen. The teen stated that he and the other boys were then taken to the parlour where two other persons beat them with stumps. The woman said that she called the 108 ambulance service and her son was taken to hospital. Narol police has registered a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code against the parlour owner, including 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons) and 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life).

The court was hearing the petitions filed by five police personnel challenging their transfer orders from Palayamkottai Central Prison in Tirunelveli district to Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai. According to the petitioners, a remand prisoner P Muthu Mano was murdered by the other inmates in the prison on April 22. While the accused prisoners were arrested, the authorities who were on duty and responsible for security of the prisoners, were placed under suspension. Following this incident, the authorities transferred the petitioners on administrative grounds. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that they were not at all on duty on the occurrence date and were not responsible for the said incident. However, the state submitted that since Palayamkottai Central Prison being a caste sensitive place, the prisoners have been segregated and lodged in separate cells. Even though the petitioners do not belong to any sensitive sector, they have the habit of spreading malicious information and creating group clashes between two core sects of prisoners, as well as the prison staff. In order to avoid more complications and for security purposes and transfer orders came to be passed, based on a discreet inquiry report. Justice D Krishnakumar observed that a perusal of the transfer orders shows that it was passed on administrative grounds, however, in the counter affidavit, it is stated that the orders were passed based on the discreet inquiry report. The judge concluded that the orders are in violation of the principles of natural justice, since the orders are contrary to the clarification letter issued by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-tn-to-issue-guidelines-for-clarity-in-transfer-matters/articleshow/87807852.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the court relies on the medical certificates for taking certain decisions on the applications filed before this court. If such false certificates are issued, this court may not be in a position to rely upon them. It is the duty of the medical council to eradicate such a type of impression created by few doctors, the judge said while dismissing the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Gopinath, who was arrested by the Thanjavur district police for possession of ganja in February. Taking into account the Covid-19 pandemic, the special court granted interim bail to the petitioner on the same day for three weeks and directed him to surrender before the trial court on March 29. Since the petitioner failed to surrender, the court issued a warrant against him and the police had registered another case. Subsequently, the petitioner filed petitions before HC seeking anticipatory bail in both the cases. He produced medical records stating that he was hospitalised for two months after he sustained a fracture in his leg in a major accident. The petitioner also produced a medical certificate from a doctor. Since the medical certificate stated that it was only for leave purposes, the judge directed the authorities to inquire about its genuineness. When the judge was informed that the certificate issued by Dr C Balaji was false, he recommended disciplinary action against the doctor. The counsel for the council informed that disciplinary action would be initiated against the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-tells-med-council-to-ensure-docs-dont-issue-false-certificates/articleshow/87807848.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Lucknow||Airline exec helped in boarding of passengers with fake passport, held||Lucknow: The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (UP ATS) arrested a customer care executive at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi on Thursday. Ajay Ghildiyal, a native of Saharanpur, was arrested for facilitating illegal entry of Bangladeshis and Rohingyas into India. He would get their Indian passports made using fake Hindu identities and then send them abroad. Two of his aides, Sameer Mandal and Vikram Singh, were arrested on November 11 in the same case. IG ATS Gajendra Goswamy said that during questioning, Vikram had disclosed Ajay’s name. “Vikram had claimed that as an airline employee, Ajay would facilitate the boarding of these passengers with fake passports and visas at the airport. These documents had been prepared by gang members Sameer and Vikram,” said Goswamy. Ajay had been employed with the airline since 2016. He would also help in boarding of deported persons at the airport by taking money from agents. “For this, Rs 15,000 was charged per person, this money would be divided among employees of the airline,” said Goswamy. Ajay had met Vikram and gang member Gurpreet in 2020. So far, Ajay has conspired to send 35 to 40 people to Spain, Britain, and other European countries for money. Names of other associates at the airport have also come up, said ATS, which has 10-day police custody of Ajay for interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/airline-exec-helped-in-boarding-of-passengers-with-fake-passport-held/articleshow/87808358.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 60 students allotted CBSE exam centre 25km away||Mumbai: As many as 60 Class X students of a CBSE school in Malad have been allotted centre for the first semester board examinations in Parel, a distance of around 25 km. The students will have to travel to the KMS English School in Parel for the first semester board exams. While minor papers have commenced from November 16 and 17 for class 12 and 10, the major papers will begin from November 30 and December 1 for class 10 and 12. Parents of the Billabong High International School students have written to the CBSE regional office in Pune for a change of centre. “To travel 25-30 km during exams is insane in Mumbai’s traffic,” said a parent. A school spokesperson said they have spoken to the CBSE authorities who assured them that the centre would be changed to INS Hamla in Malad. The admit cards with the changed centre would be issued by Monday., the spokesperson said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-60-students-allotted-cbse-exam-centre-25km-away/articleshow/87808722.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He remembers that evening as if it was yesterday. The apple of his eye, his grandson Navreet, just 25 and back home from Australia after his marriage in that country to a girl he knew, had been killed during violent protests against the farm laws in Delhi. "There was darkness in our house, in fact in the whole of Dibdiba (a small village in Rampur)," he said. "People loved Navreet. He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today. I miss him so much." Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur in UP from Melbourne after completing his graduation in commerce from a university there. He dived headlong into the farmers' agitation. His wife, Mansweet Kaur, 22, stayed back in Australia to finish her masters. She had told him she would join him later. After Navpreet died, the cause of his death mired in conspiracy theories, his body was sent to Rampur and the autopsy done by a panel of three doctors. The report mentioned “shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem head injury”. However, the doctors also noted that "brain matter had spilled out of an everted wound near the right ear". The Dibdiba family claimed that the wound was the result of a bullet shot at him while he was driving a tractor. Dibdiba "collected evidence" and moved the Delhi high court on February 10, contesting the official version. He maintains to this day that his grandson was "murdered". The case is pending. But this agitation, he said, was also about thousands of other farmers. So Friday's turn was welcome. “Our blood and sweat has paid off. I lost my grandson, but nearly 700 families lost their kin too.” Some distance away, in Lakhimpur Kheri, relatives of farmers killed in Tikunia on October 3 when four of them were allegedly mowed down by a convoy of cars led by Ashish Misra, the son of junior Union home minister Ajay Mishra, the government’s decision has come "too late". Jagdeep Singh, son of Nachhatar Singh, 60, who was one of the farmers crushed by one of the SUVs, said, “Several lives would have been saved had the government realised this a bit early. We are mourning, but we are happy for the larger cause. My father’s fight against the farm laws is won but we will carry on our battle for justice until those responsible for the Kheri deaths are sent to jail.” Next door, it was a father who was grieving. Satnam Singh said, "Lovepreet Singh was just 19 years old when he was killed. My son was a student and always used to take time out to protest peacefully against the farm laws. How can one ever fill such a vacuum? If only the government decision had come before (the incident at) Lakhimpur Kheri." Jasbir Singh Virk, national president of the Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan, said, “Every person who lost his life while protesting will be remembered and recognized as a martyr of the movement. We fought together and forced the government to withdraw the laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/at-dibdiba-a-grandpa-grieves-in-kheri-a-father/articleshow/87806397.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Girls online have hacks against patriarchal wall||Ahmedabad: Some were from small towns, from both rich families and extended households. Some were in the first year of college while others were studying for boards. But what connected these teenage girls from across India participating in a study was their engagement with social media and the internet. The study titled “Good Girls Don’t Go Online: Unpacking the Quotidian Playful Resilience Influencing Girls’ Social and Digital Engagements” tracked a group of girls for one year. The aim was to understand their online usage patterns, the issues they faced, and how they dealt with them. The study was published in the latest issue of International Journal of Communication. Its authors are Kiran Bhatia. University of Wisconsin-Madison, US; Payal Arora, Erasmus University, Netherlands; and Manisha Pathak-Shelat from MICA in India. The researchers argued that the majority of the girls, first-time social media and internet users, cleverly dodged social conventions to get online and experience the cyberspace. If they didn’t have a smartphone or a computer, they took help from their friends. If they didn’t find good Wi-Fi connection, they bribed their way into their parents’ connections. If they had snoopy family members, they requested their friends to cut them out of social media posts. “We term it playful resilience — they won’t openly rebel or oppose, but will find ways out of the situation,” said Prof Pathak-Shelat, a faculty member at MICA. “It’s primarily the patriarchal mindset which assumes that if the girls are allowed to have a smartphone or access to the internet, they may encounter bad influence or become victims of predators.” The professor added: “But we argue that the reality is different and they do experience it, albeit differently.” City-based experts said that the internet has indeed created issues in many families. Falguni Patel, coordinator of Abhayam 181 helpline, said that after the pandemic, the service recorded a spike in complaints involving girls and smartphones. “The parents believed that the girls started spending more time with their gadgets and also developed friendships,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girls-online-have-hacks-against-patriarchal-wall/articleshow/87807237.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Mumbai||Repeal of farm laws a face-saving tactic ahead of key polls: Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: The Centre has decided to repeal the three farm laws because it feared electoral losses in the upcoming UP and Punjab polls, said NCP chief Sharad Pawar. A view echoed by Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Ashok Chavan. The MVA leaders welcomed the repeal and saluted the farmer’s agitation. The state BJP said the Prime Minister was forced to repeal the laws which would have benefited farmers, because he was left with no option. “There will soon be elections to UP and Punjab. People in the villages will ask questions on the farm laws and their leaders will have no answers. That’s why this decision was taken by the Centre,” said Pawar. He said he saluted the farmers for their peaceful agitation and pointed out that the farm laws had been pushed through parliament with no consultation. “Farmers had been agitating for a year but the government did not even talk to them,” said Pawar. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the decision was motivated by “political fear” with the BJP feeling the ground slipping under its feet in UP and Punjab, where elections are forthcoming. “The PM should apologise to the family of 700 farmers who lost lives, and announce monetary relief. He should also withdraw all cases against farmers, including cases registered for violence at Red Fort,” he added. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the decision to repeal showed, “the strength of the common man of the country and what he could achieve.” Saluting the farmers who lost their lives in the agitation, he pointed out that the MVA government had opposed the farm laws both in the cabinet and the state assembly. “In future, before drafting such laws, the Centre should consult opposition leaders and the organisations in order to avoid such a setback,” Thackeray added. “The Centre and the BJP should apologise for the atrocities against the protesting farmers. They insulted the farmers by calling them terrorists and anti-national. A union minister’s son crushed farmers under his car,” said Congress leader and PWD minister Ashok Chavan. State Congress chief Nana Patole said the party would celebrate Kisan Victory Day on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state BJP said the Centre was forced to repeal the farm laws because it was left with little choice. “The PM was forced to repeal the farm laws, which would have brought prosperity to the farmers, with great sadness because he was left with no option,” said state BJP president Chandrakant Patil. “Ordinary farmers backed the farm laws but a group of farmers created disturbances and held others to ransom,” he added.

The stench from the tonnes of garbage piled up overpowers the fragrance of flowers being sold in very unhygienic conditions. About a quarter of the perishable products, including flowers, leaves and the plastic bags that they come in end up in the garbage dumps of the market regularly. The agricultural marketing committee, which is in charge of the maintenance of the market, set up a recycling unit similar to a micro composting unit on its premises. However, it is in a shambles now and nothing from the piles of biodegradable waste that collects is recycled. “We didn’t mind the uncleared garbage during summer. This year we were kept out of the market due to Covid restrictions, but now we are fearful that we would fall sick in these conditions,’’ said Jayakumar, a retail flower trader. S Ramachandran, president of Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Malar Makkal Nala Sangam, says mosquito menace and stench from the garbage have become unbearable. Since the market has opened after a long time, the garbage was affecting their business.  Officials from the AMC said they were taking all efforts to clear the garbage with the help of Madurai corporation. Six tonnes had been cleared in the last few days and the entire dump was expected to be cleared in a day or two. “It was the monsoon that hindered the cleaning process and now the corporation officials have agreed to give us more vehicles to carry the garbage,’’ said sources adding they had not found the micro composting unit viable and hence it was shut down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/garbage-piles-turning-into-health-problem-in-madurai-flower-market/articleshow/87807856.cms||---

Livestock and poultry farmers have been advised to keep their animals safe and indoors. “Because of possible formation of a trough near the latitudes of Goa, rainfall activity is likely to increase. Heavy rainfall exceeding 64.5mm to 115.5mm of rainfall in 24 hours is very likely at one or two places over Goa on November 20,” the IMD said. Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning are very likely to continue over Goa up to November 22. Short intense spells and winds of speed around 40kmph are likely over both districts. Light to moderate rain and thunderstorm activity with a much lesser spatial distribution is likely to continue over Goa up to around November 25, the forecast stated. “The clouding and rainfall activity may affect sowing or agriculture land preparation during this period,” the IMD advisory read. It advised farmers to avoid nursery sowing and sowing of cowpea on November 20. “In already sown fields they can provide proper drainage to remove excess water. Also, avoid transplanting of vegetable seedlings on that day due, clean the drainage channels to avoid water logging,” the department said. For animals, farmers were advised to store sufficient fodder and feed, provide clean drinking water, provide curtains at both sides of poultry houses or add overhang of four to five feet to avoid direct entry of rains into sheds and conduct frequent checking of litter material. Citizens have been asked to avoid open areas, fields, taking shelter under tall trees or structures during thunderstorms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-warns-farmers-of-heavy-rainfall-advises-against-sowing-seeds/articleshow/87807889.cms||---

Vasavan told a meet-the-press programme organized by the Calicut Press Club on Friday that the department could take action only on the basis of a probe conducted by the department. “We cannot take action on the basis of statements made by K T Jaleel or allegations raised in press conferences. We can take action only if authentic documents come up before us. Till now, we have not received any complaint pertaining to the allegations that you are mentioning about,” the minister said. He added that Jaleel had told him that the documents he had presented at a press conference were received from the income tax department which had conducted an inquiry into the allegations of irregularities in the bank. The cooperative department had issued orders to look into the allegations against the bank but it was stayed by the court. The government has now issued the order the third time after vacating the stay, the minister said. Jaleel had raised serious allegations against A R Nagar Cooperative Bank saying that huge black money and illegal transactions have been unearthed in the bank in the random examination conducted by the IT department. The minister said that both the UDF and LDF should jointly oppose the moves by the central government against the cooperative sector and alleged that IT department was making unwanted interferences in the sector with the aim to destroy the sector. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had publicly pulled up Jaleel for demanding an enforcement directorate (ED) probe into the alleged irregularities in AR Nagar bank. CPM had also conveyed the party’s displeasure to Jaleel over raising the demand, which it feels would lead to ED meddling with the cooperative sector, especially when Centre was trying to intervene in the sector which has been a preserve of state governments. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cant-take-action-based-on-allegations/articleshow/87806406.cms||---

SHO, Imaliya Sultanpur, Rajesh Singh said the accused told the police that he got married in May this year. “He claimed that he often used to spot his wife talking to someone over the phone during late hours. He said his wife also remained out of the house for long,” Singh said. He claimed that he once saw his wife with a man, Mohit, in an objectionable position. “He initially ignored the matter but soon became a butt of jokes among his relatives and villagers. He discussed the matter with his father after which they decided to eliminate Mohit,” the officer said. “The duo called Mohit for a meeting at Golapur-Sitapur turn on Wednesday where they slashed his throat with a sharp-edged weapon. They then tied the body to his motorcycle and hit it with a tree to make it appear as an accident,” said Singh. Mohit’s postmortem examination report on Thursday revealed it to be murder. Mohit’s kin also informed the police that he had received a call from the accused.

The murder came to light after a video of the deadly attack on the victim, Gopal, 50, a painter of Mela Kadayanallur, by the duo was recorded by a youth from the ceiling of a house and circulated in social media.Preliminary inquiry revealed that Gopal had misbehaved with a 14-year-old girl around 4 pm on Friday. An hour later, the girl’s relatives attacked him with a big stone and a stick. While a man tossed him all over the place and threw the stone on his head, the woman attacked him with a log. Two youths who were chatting on the terrace of a nearby building recorded the fight on their mobile phones, assuming it to be a brawl between two men.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Security firm’s ex-CEO named in Rs 1 crore con case can fly abroad||MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) has permitted Niraj Gul Bijlani, who quit Topsgrup Security Services Ltd in 2018 as its CEO, to travel to Dubai in a 2020 case filed against him for alleged siphoning off of Rs 1.17 crore from the company. The HC suspended a lookout notice issued against him in a case registered by the EOW of Mumbai police. The complaint against him was filed by the company, alleging that Bijlani had siphoned off the amount as the group’s former CEO. Bijlani, in his petition before HC, argued by senior counsel Vikram Nankani along with advocate Ishwar Nankani, said he worked at the company as a “consultant’’ and submitted his relieving letter where the company’s finance director had appreciated his “dedication and sincere efforts put in building the company’’ during his nine-year tenure. His petition seeking quashing of the lookout circular said he resigned since the co-mpany had “defaulted in statutory dues” and payment of his salary. The HC noted that he challenged the circular on various grounds and also that “it is entirely unwarranted as the petitioner has been extending co-operation; and the right of the petitioner to travel abroad is being curtailed”. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai opposed his plea, saying a forensic audit has been done and the report will be received in a week. She said the probe may be concluded in 6 weeks. On a plea by Nankani, the HC permitted Bijlani to travel to Dubai from November 17 to December 22 on a work commitment after observing that a grievance of the EOW that he is not cooperating does not appear to be present. The permission is to Bijlani and not to his family members, said HC. Pai sought, and the HC agreeing imposed, a condition that he has to inform the EOW three days before leaving India and inform his return date and he will submit surety amount of Rs 1.17 crore. Bijlani was present in court and has to remain present before the high court on December 22, the next adjourned date.

All key political parties — BJP, Congress and AAP — are waiting to know their rival candidates to reveal their cards. Only after the dates are announced, they can start their preparation and plan things because they feel that matching wards with suitable candidates is significant. “Since the MC election will be contested on faces besides issues, we want the candidates of our rival parties to be announced so that we can plan things accordingly. Moreover, candidates will be decided as per the wards and their popularity among people,” a senior leader of a political party said. All the political parties are eyeing the Punjab and Haryana high court and election commission, hoping the date will be announced by next week. Since the entire election process has to be completed by December 31, the role of the commission will be crucial in this exercise. All political parties have, however, completed their internal exercise to select candidates. On the one side, where Congress has received around 200 applications against 35 municipal wards, the BJP has also received applications through their district presidents. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has also completed its exercise in this regard. Till date, only Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) is the party, which has announced its candidates. The SAD issued its list of the nine candidates, out of total 35 candidates for the MC election. Since the SAD has tied up with the BSP in Chandigarh for the first time, their seat sharing has also been decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-poll-date-delay-keeps-parties-tense/articleshow/87807239.cms||Deepak Yadav

Sidhu made this announcement during a recent public meeting in Mohali. He said he would demand separate land for the bus stand at a centralised place. “We will request the CM for directing Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) to allot land for setting up of the bus stand. I will press for the old bus stand site to be revived for the new one as it is the central place and most suitable for residents,” he said. Sidhu said, “The Baba Banda Singh Bahadur bus stand was good for nothing and served no purpose for the welfare of Mohali residents as it was located at the farther end of the city. A bus stand must be approachable.” Mohali mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu in a recent MC house meeting announced private bus service route in Mohali. In the first phase, the MC is to press six local buses under its dream project of a city bus service. The MC has approved the project to run 25-seater low floor CNG buses. He said, “This service is especially for poor people and the fare of these buses will not exceed Rs 10 per passenger inside Mohali jurisdiction.” MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said for the first phase, the MC has approved eight bus routes to ply six buses. Garg said, “For the first phase we have got eight bus routes approved for which six buses will be pressed into action by January 1. We have already called for the tenders on build operate own basis. Passenger tickets will be provided by the MC but will be distributed by the private operator.” Garg added that MC will also allow space for advertisements on the buses to get more revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-ask-cm-to-give-mohali-separate-bus-stand-mla/articleshow/87807243.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

On Friday, several villagers, mostly women, came out on the streets to protest against alleged police atrocities. Villagers alleged that innocent people were detained and tortured by police. Nearly 35 people were detained by police, they claimed. So far, four policemen, including the SHO and the police outpost in-charge, have been transferred for failing to make a breakthrough in the case. A woman among the protesters claimed, “We were sleeping in the night when two policemen barged into our house by jumping over a wall. They said they were searching for someone. We are scared as almost every man of the village is in their custody.” Another woman alleged, “My husband was taken into custody and thrashed. Later, he was found to be innocent.” Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit SP, told TOI, “The villagers had gathered on a link road outside their village after they were misinformed that police were arresting the young men. They returned home after we assured them that no action would be taken against anyone who is innocent. We have not tortured anyone in police custody. We are close to cracking this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/pilibhit-rape-murder-case-villagers-protest-against-police-atrocities/articleshow/87806410.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Effects of better law & order now evident in UP||Law and order is the hallmark of any governance. The perception of one’s safety is so critical and treasured that it calls for no further elaboration. It is reflected not only in a victim-oriented policing approach or evidence-based delivery of police services but also in the sense of freedom one desires to enjoy. It is imperative to have the freedom to avail equal opportunities. Having a facilitating environment to take initiatives, to achieve and grow without any inhibitions or fear are some of the other necessary attributes one covets for. These are, therefore, the minimum expectations that any able governance must ensure. The recently released data by National Crime Record Bureau for the year 2020 shows some of the remarkable facets of a state like Uttar Pradesh in this context. This prompts one to really take it as a case study, partly to understand the truth and partly to reassess the ‘policy on policing’. One of the litmus tests of a strong Law & Order grid in a democratic set up is the safety of women. If we take the figure of crime against women, the national average is 55.9 per lakh population. UP, however, has a rate much below the national average at 45.1, whereas figures of the states such as West Bengal, Rajasthan, Odisha, Telangana are much higher at 76.2, 90.5, 95.14 & 112.9, respectively. Though the statistics in itself cannot be an absolute yardstick but to initiate an analysis, such data are important and reflective of the character of governance. Observers have seen a better equilibrium in UP in the recent years. A further micro analysis of NCRB data shows that the cases of blatant assault on women with the intent to outrage their modesty have gone down in UP at @ 3.5 per lac population. This is much lower when compared with other states. UP has reportedly also recorded the highest conviction rate in cases related to crimes against women and cyber-crime in the country as per NCRB. This has been made possible due to several steps taken to check crime against women which include UP-122 India App, night security cover scheme, women helpdesks and pink booths besides the enforcement of relevant criminal laws. Also, the hyper activation of cyber cells along with enhanced public awareness programmes was a timely act. UP Police has gone through multiple ups and downs. It has, however, proved its mettle when the right leadership is provided at the apex level in terms of an appropriate policy and congruent support. The outcome in the present era is reflective of the role and goal clarity of those at the helm of affairs. The doctrine of ‘Zero tolerance towards Crime & Criminals’ upheld by the Chief Minister is quite evident right to the cutting-edge level. Not only the ‘Mafia Raj’ seems to have shrunk to its lowest ebb but, even the second and third-line criminals have been largely neutralized within the ‘Rule of Law’. The ensuing sense of security has opened vistas for development too in terms of investments. UP`s economy has reportedly doubled from Rs 11 lakh crore to Rs 22 lakh crore in the past four years. It is glaringly manifested by the infrastructural development in the state including the new institutions, both in health & education sectors. Development has its own positive impact on the Law & Order Grid. Both are complimentary as well as supplementary to each other. The top man at the helm of affairs enjoys a clean image with respect to his integrity and enforces the same down the line. Wiser and concerned leaders would like to create an oasis of statesmanship rather than otherwise. Yogi Adityanath has rapidly adopted technologically empowered governance tools that are free from any biases. This ensures a professional outcome. UP model reflects upon the visionary view to policing in terms of a holistic approach. Police Commissionerate system is one of the visionary steps taken by the CM in this regard. He is seen to have emerged as a committed leader with a fast-rising learning curve. That he holds a respectable stature in various circles has generated a positive response in the form of a strong Law & Order grid. Leadership impacts! The behavioral change in police is also very prominent. It is indeed satisfying to observe the humane side of policing whether it is the Kanpur Police Commissioner or a SHO ready to outreach the harassed senior citizens or women in distress in real time. It speaks volumes that the police as the first responder have moved closer to the community. Nature thrives on mutual synergy of all its sub-elements and we are all a part of this. Hence, the way we imbibe Nature becomes our Culture. So, for our long-term sustainability there is no rule other than the rule of ‘Holistic-Sustenance’.

Data of Delhi Prisons till October this year accessed by TOI showed that more than 1,35,000 mulaqats were held between inmates and their family members. It included over 74,000 physical visits. “In all, 61,164 online mulaqats were also held where relatives interacted with inmates through videoconferencing,” the data showed. Over 50,000 people visited Tihar, followed by 18,050 at Mandoli and 5,867 at Rohini. “While 36,298 online mulaqats were held at Tihar, there were 13,944 meetings at Rohini and 10,922 at Mandoli,” showed the data. Mulaqats were stopped on April 5 due to the second Covid-19 wave and they resumed on July 19. From January to March last year, more than 90,000 mulaqats were held in the pre-Covid period. Later, after the pandemic gripped the country, the meetings were stopped on March 19, 2020. “Steps were taken to control the disease. Mulaqats resumed again in October last year,” an officer said. From August to December last year, 30,262 mulaqats were held of which 9,452 were online and 20,810 offline. Before the pandemic, inmates met their relatives twice a week and three members were allowed to meet them. When the pandemic began, inmates were allowed to make phone calls only to their relatives for five minutes twice a week,” said the officer. After resumption, inmates were allowed one mulaqat in a month. In February this year, it was changed to one mulaqat per week. However, during the second wave, meetings were stopped again. “When it resumed, we allowed two mulaqats in a month,” said the officer. Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said currently active cases were nil, but they had not let their guard down and all precautions were being strictly followed. “Before any mulaqat, a visitor has to go through a Rapid Antigen Test. The maximum number of visitors in the mulaqat hall has been kept at half the cabins available. We regularly sanitise mulaqat windows on both sides,” he added. Visitors without face masks are not permitted inside the prison complex and all inmates have to wash their clothes received from their families members during mulaqat before use. “The timings for registration of mulaqat is from 7.30am to 11.30am on all days, except Saturday, Sunday and gazetted holidays,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-covid-curbs-eased-over-74k-turn-up-to-meet-inmates-in-10-mths/articleshow/87807240.cms||Abhay Singh

Taking a dig at political leaders who had earlier insinuated that "Khalistani elements" had "infiltrated" the agitation, Jadon said, "The same netas later got scared after their image took a beating ahead of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab." Jadon also demanded that the Narendra Modi-led government should condole the death of farmers who died during the long-drawn protests. “The government should also provide monetary compensation and jobs to families of those who died protesting. And, cases registered against farmers for supporting the protest should be withdrawn,” he said, adding the agitation will continue till the government provides legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). Jadon said, “This a is victory of farmers, and this victory is dedicated to the more than 600 of us who have died in the interim. It is dedicated also to the tribals, women and workers from different spheres who became a part of this movement," Jadon said."The sudden announcement to repel the three black laws certainly comes due to the impending elections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/those-fighting-farm-laws-were-real-farmers-not-terrorists-bkus-jadon/articleshow/87806417.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Chandigarh||JBT teacher recruitment scam: Serve notice through newspapers, says SC||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Hearing the JBT and TGT teacher recruitment scam, the Supreme Court objected to re-issuance of notices to aggrieved teachers. The administration said notices could not be issued to such a large number of teachers due to various reasons. The court said that instead of issuing notices to every teacher, public information should be published. The court has fixed December 17 as the next date of hearing in the case. Sources said the education department conducted a written test for the recruitment of 1,150 JBT and TGT teachers in 2014. Appointment letters were issued to these teachers in 2015. The paper was leaked from a printing press in New Delhi three days before the written test for recruitment, after which Chandigarh police registered a case on July 29, 2016 on the basis of a Punjab Vigilance report. The administrator then formed a committee headed by the finance secretary, which submitted a report to the administrator cancelling the recruitment. A case was registered against about 50 teachers working in government schools of Chandigarh due to this scam. Out of 1,150 teachers, about 600 were working in government schools of Chandigarh while the rest have quit. The administration had sacked these teachers on May 30, 2018. Hearing the case on Friday, the court said that notices had to be issued to all the parties involved in the scam, which were not issued. Earlier, the CAT and the High Court had ruled that it was wrong to remove teachers whose names were not included in the FIR in the teacher recruitment scam. The matter could not be proceeded further as the notice was not served in some cases. To overcome the problem related to service of notice to the large number of candidates, the Apex Court has directed that notice be served to everyone via Punjabi Tribune and The Tribune newspapers as the education department, Chandigarh is unable to track the addresses of a few teachers. The court informed all the parties that on the next hearing, the case must be proceeded further under any circumstances. The next date of hearing has been fixed on December 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jbt-teacher-recruitment-scam-serve-notice-through-newspapers-says-sc/articleshow/87807246.cms||---

While the police arrested hostel warden Archana for allegedly luring the girls into the act, the protest was withdrawn late in the evening after talks held by Dindigul range DIG Vijayakumari and revenue officials.College correspondent P Jothimurugan was the AMMK candidate for Dindigul parliamentary constituency in 2019. Inquiries revealed that he owns a nursing, a catering and an arts and science college in the district besides holding prominent positions in sports bodies. At least one victim is said to be aged below 18 years while most of the others are older, said V Nicholas, Childline district coordinator, who inquired with the protesting girls. He quoted the students as saying that the warden would ‘canvas’ and send a group of 10 to 15 girls to another college owned by the correspondent in a MUV around 10 pm. In the dark, the students were asked to dance to songs in a manner that pleased the correspondent, after which he abused them. The students were then dropped back in their hostel around 3 am. It is learnt that the girls were lured into the trap or silenced with the promise of good marks in the examinations, timely placement in good hospitals or attractive jobs in the entertainment industry.Dindigul district superintendent of police (SP) V R Srinivasan told TOI that a case was registered against the correspondent and the hostel warden under a few sections including Pocso Act based on the complaint lodged by one of the students. “The warden has been arrested and search is on for the other accused,” he added. The incident came to light after the college management along with the district legal services authority held a sexual abuse awareness programme on the college premises on Saturday. On Friday morning, the students resorted to road blockades near the college and on the Dindigul - Palani road and made multiple calls to the Childline helpline number 1098. Earlier in the evening, the students temporarily suspended the protest based on an assurance by the police that the correspondent would be arrested by 6 pm. As it did not happen, they resumed the blockade. The protest was withdrawn after talks were held by the DIG of Dindigul range, Vijayakumari, and revenue officials. AMMK general secretary TTV Dinakaran issued a statement later in the night removing Jothimurugan from the basic membership of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dindigul-nursing-students-flag-sexual-abuse-block-roads/articleshow/87807887.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Repeal of farm laws victory of farmers, democracy: Rawat||Dehradun: Terming it a huge victory for farmers, who refused to budge even an inch and fought hard for the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat on Friday said "the repeal of the "black laws" is the victory of democracy and sustained fight of farmers who remained united through the long haul." Attacking the Modi government, Rawat said fear of defeat in the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is behind the withdrawal of the farm laws but "it will fail to make any impact and the BJP will not get any mileage from the issue. People are now well aware of their intentions". Remembering those who lost their lives during the agitation, the former CM said, "I request government to acknowledge the contribution of those who sacrificed their lives during the protest. They should be given the status of martyrs." He did not fail to mention that Rahul Gandhi was among the first politicians to raise the issue and take out a tractor rally in Punjab to express solidarity with the protesting farmers. Rawat was surprised that the law was framed even without consulting the farmers. "What is the point of having a law when the people who are associated with the sector do not want it. The farmers were never in favour of the three farm laws but it was forced on them. We need to appreciate their determination and patience. They camped for months at Delhi borders, braving the tough conditions. Their never give up attitude forced government to bow before them," he added. When told to reply if the move would benefit the BJP in the upcoming polls, Rawat said, "The damage has already been done and it is too late. It was the fear of being wiped out in the elections which made them take the decision. Let me remind my friends in the BJP that the farmers have fought for the cause and emerged victorious. It is the Union government’s defeat."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/repeal-of-farm-laws-victory-of-farmers-democracy-rawat/articleshow/87806413.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Woman used as honeytrap to ‘loot’ bizman of Rs 3.3 crore, 3 of her aides held in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Two women are among three arrested on Thursday for allegedly blackmailing and extorting Rs 3.3 crore from a businessman from Kolhapur. One of the two women was used as a honeytrap to falsely implicate the 64-year-old businessman and blackmail him in a fabricated case of sexual assault, the police said. Even after the businessman paid up, the threats to get him arrested continued with a video of him with the 42-year-old woman, Monica Bhagwan alias Dev Choudhary, who “played victim”. Monica is wanted by the police. Her accomplices who have been arrested — fashion designer Lubna Wazir alias Sapna (47), Anil Choudhary alias Akash (42) and jeweller Manish Sodi (41) — helped Monica in the extortion and blackmail, said officials of the police. In 2019, the businessman was in Mumbai and had put up at a five star hotel in Andheri. Sapna, Anil and Monica who had struck up a friendship with him met him at his suite. The police said that Sapna and Anil hurriedly left the hotel, leaving Monica in the room with the businessman, saying they had to rush out urgently for some time.. This, said the police, was part of their conspiracy. Just as they returned, Monica partly undressed and lay on the bed. “As per plan, Sapna started to shoot a video of Monica in the state of undress with the businessman around. Sapna started to yell about a sexual assault on Monica,” said an officer. The businessman claimed innocence but the three threatened to call the police. “They demanded Rs 10 crore to settle the matter,” added the officer. A series of extortion threats followed. The police said that the businessman ended up paying Rs 3.25 crore over a period of time. The extortion continued until recently, said the police. Recently, they demanded Rs 5 crore, and threatened to upload the video on social media. “The businessman got suicidal and told his son to take care of his business,” said an officer. Due to his “unusual” behaviour, his son enquired what the matter was. The businessman told the son who approached the police. The police have recovered Rs 29 lakh, seven phones, gold worth Rs 9 lakh and two cars from the accused. The three were arrested while accepting Rs 17 lakh from the businessman, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/woman-used-as-honeytrap-to-loot-bizman-of-rs-3-3cr-3-of-her-aides-held-in-mumbai/articleshow/87807251.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ashok Gehlot ministers Raghu Sharma, Harish Chaudhary, Govind Singh Dotasra quit ahead of cabinet rejig||JAIPUR: The much expected cabinet reshuffle has gathered momentum with three ministers in the Ashok Gehlot government tendering their resignations to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. Congress in-charge for Rajasthan Ajay Maken revealed this to the media upon his unexpected arrival in Jaipur on Friday night. The three ministers who have tendered resignations are school education minister and PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, health minister and AICC in-charge for Gujarat Raghu Sharma and revenue minister and AICC in-charge for Punjab Harish Chaudhary. Dotasra is MoS, while Sharma and Chaudhary are cabinet ministers. With their resignations, the vacancy in the Gehlot cabinet has increased to 12. The maximum strength allowed in the state cabinet is 30, going by the 15% cap rule in the 200-member state assembly. The unannounced visit of Maken in Jaipur indicated that the cabinet reshuffle is likely to be held in the next few days. Governor Kalraj Mishra is at present in his home state of Uttar Pradesh and scheduled to return on Saturday afternoon. According to sources, even the CM came to know of Maken’s visit only at the airport when he (Gehlot) returned from Banswara. Maken told reporters that after meeting Congress MLAs one-on-one on July 30 some ministers had expressed a desire to work in the organisation instead of the government. Maken said that the three ministers had accordingly tendered their resignations to the Congress president, who had accepted the same. According to law, the resignations ought to have been tendered to the governor directly, or through the CM. Gehlot had given enough indications in the recent past about Dotasra leaving the ministry. At a teachers’ felicitation function held the other day, the CM had said that the education minister's speech at the function seemed like a farewell speech. He said that Dotasra had been requesting the party high command to divest him of one responsibility in keeping with the principle of "one man, one post". A day earlier, Gehlot had said that the party would accommodate Independents and BSP-turned-Congress MLAs in the cabinet reshuffle for supporting the Congress government during the crisis created by BJP last July. Former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and his 18 MLAs had rebelled against the Gehlot government then. After the high command’s intervention, Gehlot will have to accommodate Pilot loyalists in the reshuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-ministers-sharma-chaudhary-dotasra-quit-ahead-of-cabinet-rejig/articleshow/87807892.cms||---

The woman, who claimed to be a foreigner on a visit to India, concocted a story about being caught carrying “excess cash” and claimed that she had to “bribe officials at the airport” and asked Gonsalves to help him with the money required for the same. Gonsalves, a resident of Ambernath, lives alone while his sons stay abroad. He lodged a police complaint on Thursday. In April, he had received a call from a woman, who identified herself only as Idath from the United Kingdom. She claimed that she had found Gonsalves’s number from the dating app. After that call, the two started to chat with each other. On May 24, he got a fake call from a woman who claimed she was calling from Mumbai airport and said that Idath had to pay a penalty. What led Gonsalves to believe this fake caller was the next call which he got from Idath who corroborated the version of the person who claimed to be an airport official. “Gonsalves has said that Idath was sobbing hysterically about having to pay the money. She told him to pay up on her behalf and promised to return the entire amount.” He paid up Rs 4.8 lakh, but later found Idath’s number switched off. Even the number of the “airport official” was not reachable. On receipt of his complaint on Thursday, the police said they are trying to track down the account to which the money had been sent. —Pradeep Gupta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-76-year-old-goes-on-blind-date-with-foreigner-duped-of-rs-4-8l/articleshow/87807283.cms||---

BJP state president K Surendran would inaugurate the protest programmes planned in Kozhikode on Sunday. He would also address the protest programmes at Palakkad on Saturday. Other leaders would lead the protests at the district headquarters. Kurien said BJP had declared support to the anti-K-rail protests from the start and would continue to oppose the government plan. “K-Rail is not a project that would provide any help to the poor.

---||Mumbai||Another Mumbai hospital says won’t waste vax, to give booster shots to staff, seniors||MUMBAI: A day after Bombay Hospital announced free jabs for all, Powai’s L H Hiranandani Hospital has decided to administer booster shots to its healthcare workers and the elderly if it fails to exhaust vaccine stocks within two months. The hospital, which currently has 10,000 shots of Covishield costing nearly Rs 63 lakh, said administering booster shots would be more prudent than throwing away vaccines. India still doesn’t have a policy on booster shots, although many in Mumbai and several other cities have skirted CoWin to take a third dose. It remains a hotly debated topic with the US, Israel and several countries in Europe administering booster shots already with studies showing waning antibody levels after full immunization. “Giving booster shots would be inappropriate and CoWin will not accept it till there is a national policy,” Dr N K Arora, chief of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI), told TOI. “We will have a clear national policy on boosters in the next two weeks. They mustn’t get impatient,” he said. Private hospitals in Maharashtra are holding more than 40 lakh doses and have few takers. Hiranandani’s stand comes a day after Bombay Hospital, which has 17,000 doses, became the first in the city and perhaps in the country to give free vaccines for all through donations from two organisations. On Friday, around 228 people availed of the free shots. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of Hiranandani Hospital, said even though their vaccine stocks have a shelf life till May 2022, they have decided to start using it for booster shots after 60 days. “We would prefer to wait and watch for two months or so, as we cannot rule out the possibility of a rush of people waiting to complete their second jab. After that if stocks remain, we will start giving it as free booster shot to our hospital staff and outsiders, such as elderly people,” he said. He added the hospital believes it is a better alternative to tossing doses in a bin once they reach expiry. Interestingly, not many are willing to follow Bombay Hospital’s suit or take a decision on giving boosters yet. “We are waiting for the national policy on a third shot,” said the head of a private hospital. Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital concurred that most hospitals are eagerly waiting for the booster policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-another-hosp-says-wont-waste-vax-to-give-booster-shots-to-staff-seniors/articleshow/87808730.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Nishu, now 23, had taken leave from studies to till the land vacated by the menfolk in her family as they sat in dharna at the Ghazipur border. On Friday, as the government proclaimed the nullification of the laws that led to the agitation, Nishu had an announcement of her own to make. She would head back to her classroom. "I am relieved," she said. "Education is important too." Nishu will now be able to complete her post-graduation in physical education from her college in Dehradun. PM Narendra Modi's early morning declaration had taken her by surprise on Friday. "I was preparing to go out to our fields. But we heard the news and huddled back in. Later, we took time off, the women in the family, to celebrate. Papa joined us in the afternoon. It was like a festival. It is a great achievement." In the photo from December 2020 is also an older woman in red salwar kameez. She is Nishu's mother Mukesh Devi, a feisty 56-year-old. And though not in the frame that day but present in the slushy patch of land were Nishu's aunts and her younger sister. The women had taken over the 10-bigha farm of patriarch Jasveer Choudhary. "I became famous but the camera did not capture the other women with me that day," Nishu said. Her mother added, "Modi ji took a year (to take this decision) but at least he listened to us. So, thank you. We are now more than happy to take care of our kitchens as our men will return to the fields." Choudhary, 58, beamed like a baby. "I have four children. Since childhood, Nishu used to accompany me to the fields. When I along with my two teenage sons went to Ghazipur, she held the reins and did a wonderful job. With her and the other women around, I never had to worry about my crops."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/girl-who-took-over-dads-farm-during-protests-will-head-back-to-college/articleshow/87806435.cms||Sandeep Rai

The court of additional sessions judge, Ahmednagar, M R Natu, heard the matter on Thursday and pronounced its verdict on Friday. Ahmednagar superintendent of police Manoj Patil confirmed that the court has granted bail to the doctor and three nurses. “Police do not require their further custody. Our investigations are on. We will summon them during the course of investigation if needed,” he said. The Ahmednagar police had arrested Dr Vishaka Shinde and the three nurses, Sapna Pathare, Asma Sheikh and Chhana Anant, on November 10. The Ahmednagar police had arrested Dr Vishaka Shinde and three nurses saying all four were supposed to have been at work in the ICU at the time of the incident but were not present. The police had slapped sections 304 & 304-A of IPC against them. Speaking to TOI, Dr Shinde’s lawyer, Yohan Makasare, said the judge heard all four bail applications together. “I told the court that Dr Shinde has been working as a resident at the civil hospital, doing her internship as part of her post-graduation in orthopaedics. She was not a state government employee on its payroll. She had paid Rs 2 lakh as fees for doing her internship at the hospital,” he said. Makasare said the court has ordered the four to pay a personal bond and surety bond of Rs 25,000 each with one or more sureties. “Besides, they will have to co-operate with the police in the investigation and cannot leave the Ahmednagar revenue division without the court’s permission. They are expected not to tamper with the prosecution witnesses in any manner,” he added. The state health department had terminated the services of Sheikh and Anant and suspended Dr Shinde along with the district civil surgeon, Dr Sunil Pokharna, and another medical officer, Dr Suresh Dakhe. A few days ago, the government had revoked Dr Shinde’s suspension as she was not on the payroll of the government. The medical fraternity of the civil hospital has welcomed the court’s verdict. The hospital’s doctors had stopped their OPD services ever since the arrests were effected. “The police had acted hastily based on the CCTV footage. They should have waited for the probe team that the state government has set up to submit its report before proceeding with any legal action,” said a senior medical officer of civil hospital, Dr Prasad Saigaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hospital-blaze-court-grants-bail-to-doctor-3-staff-nurses/articleshow/87805758.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Delhi||South Delhi Municipal Corporation sets January 31 deadline for 3 parks for children||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has fixed January 31 as deadline for completing work on three children parks in New Friends Colony, Dwarka, and Mayapuri. Waste and discarded material, including scrap from vehicles, tyres, fibre and seats from old swings, etc, are being used to make recreational parks. At New Friends Colony, play equipment, gazebos, sitting area, toilet blocks, office and even the entrance are being made out of 12 discarded shipping containers received from a public sector undertaking, Container Corporation of India Limited, under its CSR activity. The park has been levelled and the play equipment is being installed. The park is being developed on a 2-acre plot in Ishwar Nagar and will be opened to the public by December end, said a senior SDMC official. “The play equipment will excite and engage children while checking their physical strength and capacity to solve puzzles. For example, the colourful structure of double wall-holla and zigzag ladder on artificial mountains will be a challenge for kids,” said a south corporation official. The Woodland Adventure Park in Dwarka Sector 19 is partly complete and the work is held up due to funds constraints. The facility is spreading over 2.5 acres. Officials said that facilities like rope and rock climbing, tree decks, and mechanical rides had been provided. “These will be a woodland adventure park for kids up to 14 years of age. We are expecting to complete work here by mid-January,” said the official. In west Delhi, a 2.6-acre plot has been obtained near Mayapuri from the DDA and the process to convert it into a children’s park from the dumpyard will start soon. “We have plans to use old and discarded tyres in maximum numbers to create a playing facility. An in-house team has been formed to work upon the discarded tyres after painting or refurbishing is properly. We will also be using fibre so that the kids won’t get hurt,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-sets-jan-deadline-for-3-parks-for-children/articleshow/87807261.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Vaigai dam’s level touched the 69.42 feet mark against its maximum level of 71 feet. Hence, 3,834 cusecs was discharged into the river adding to the existing flow which saw the churning flood waters entering Madurai city in the afternoon. In the morning, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan asked people living near the banks of the river to move to safer places saying that the water passing through Peranai was 10,000 cusecs and was expected to increase to 11,000 cusecs. The causeway at Yannaikkal was flooded and water flowed over it with force. People started gathering near the causeway as soon as they saw the river in spate which prompted the authorities to erect barricades to keep them from crossing over. The river which usually flows on a small stretch touched both its banks due to the sudden flood situation. Police and revenue officials cautioned people against attempting to enter the river for taking photographs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rain-ceases-but-vaigai-in-spate/articleshow/87807891.cms||---

The SSP announced a reward of Rs 20,000 for the police team that nabbed the alleged cow slaughterer. He told TOI that a policeman was injured while rushing to nab the accused and that Asgar received a bullet injury in his leg due to police firing. The police also recovered one-and-a-half quintals of meat, countrymade pistols and implements used for chopping meat from the accused.

---||Rajkot||Oil millers fret as groundnut farmers wait for better selling price||Rajkot: With the groundnut farmers adopting a wait and watch strategy to get better price for their produce, the Saurashtra oil millers have become anxious. This is mainly because the oil millers are finding it difficult to procure the required quantity of groundnut to fulfil the rising export demand from Africa and China. Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA), the apex body of oil millers in Gujarat, claimed that farmers were selling their crops a per their needs and waiting for the prices of the commodity to come up. The oil millers are eager to buy because they do not have last year’s carry forward stock. Last year’s groundnut oil export was five times higher than normal because of crop failure in China. This year too, there are a lot of inquiries from African countries and China. Praful Desai, an exporter of peanut and groundnut oil said, “Every year in November I buy stock as per my requirement from the market. But this year I am finding it difficult to get the quantity that I require as the arrival in the market is lower.” The Rajkot Market Yard which is considered Gujarat’s groundnut trading hub too has seen low groundnut arrival after the Diwali break. Atul Kamani, president of Rajkot Market Yard Traders Association said, “About 3.5 lakh bags (30 kg of each) have arrived in the market for auction after Diwali break. Nearly 80% of buyers for the stock were oil millers. The price for 20kg groundnut had dipped to Rs 950. But with the rising demand for export, the prices rose and got stable at Rs 1,150/20kg.” Meanwhile, the government has also started registration to procure groundnut at minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,110 per 20 kg. According to SOMA’s estimate, groundnut production in Gujarat was expected to reach 34.4 lakh tonnes during the current Kharif season. Though the crop suffered damage due to delayed rains and later due to excess downpour at the end of monsoon, the production is expected to be nearly the same as last year. This is because the groundnut sowing this year was in 20 lakh hectares against 16 lakh hectares the previous year. Kishor Viradiya, president of SOMA said, “Those farmers who have sown both cotton and groundnut are first selling cotton because of the good price they are getting. Farmers who have sown only groundnut are also not selling the entire crop as they are waiting for a better price. This has been the trend for the last five years. Farmers are currently selling their crop as per their needs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/oil-millers-fret-as-groundnut-farmers-wait-for-better-selling-price/articleshow/87807192.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Khotkar refuted the allegations and said that the entire transaction is on record and he purchased shares in the sugar mill after taking a loan. He told TOI, “I am not the owner of the sugar mill. I just own shares worth Rs 70 lakh there.” Khotkar claimed that a controversy is being created on the behest of a BJP leader, who considers Khotkar a big challenge in the next general elections. He further said that if Somaiya wants, he may purchase the entire mill and its land for Rs 100 crore. Somaiya said, “After the sugar mill came into existence in 1986-87, a total of 9,000 shares worth Rs 20,000 each were given to the farmers. The outstanding loan of a bank in the year 2007 was Rs 11.42 cr. The bank was forced to auction the mill and in 2012, bids were invited.” He further said, “Despite the ready reckoner of the mill’s land being Rs 70 cr, it was ‘managed’ to undervalue it, and the mill along with land was given a reserve price of Rs 42 crore.” Somaiya further alleged that the 100 acres worth Rs 940 crore that the state had given on lease has been usurped by Khotkar. The entries made on the revenue record have been challenged and the matter is being heard before Jalna additional collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rs-100cr-fraud-by-khotkar-somaiya/articleshow/87805783.cms||Mohammed Akhef

She underwent treatment at Dahod and Vadodara and was finally discharged after her condition turned stable with minimal oxygen requirement. Geeta Dharmik, who had lost her father in April had gone to Bhopal for his last rites on April 23. That trip was the beginning of her long journey with ailment after Dharmik started feeling unwell upon her return on April 25. Her husband Trilok Dharmik, a railway employee, said that Geeta stayed in home quarantine and gave her sample for a RT-PCR test. However, her oxygen levels went down on May 1 and she also started having fever and had to be rushed to the Dahod railway hospital. “Later, her tests also confirmed Covid infection,” said Trilok. Geeta was doing well for the around three days, but her condition deteriorated on May 5 and she was admitted to a private hospital in Vadodara on May 7, where she was kept till May 23. “We decided to shift her back to Dahod as she only needed oxygen therapy and all other treatment had been done,” said Trilok. Geeta was brought back to the railway hospital in Dahod. Here, she was kept on a ventilator for two months and then for another month on a BiPAP machine. Even after this, she remained on high oxygen requirement. Trilok said that about a month back Geeta’s oxygen requirement went down significantly and she needed only 1 to 1.5kg oxygen. “She regained her health to what she had been before the infection. Doctors decided to discharge her on Friday,” he said. Geeta still needs oxygen support, but can stay off it for 10 to 15 minutes. “We can manage with an oxygen concentrator now. A gas cylinder has been kept as a spare at our residence,” said Trilok, adding that her lungs were yet to recover completely and with time she may not need oxygen support at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-slayer-returns-home-after-202-days/articleshow/87806686.cms||Sachin Sharma

Choudhary was arrested for allegedly duping a Gurgaon resident on November 11. The SIT had registered one more cheating case of Rs 6 crore against Choudhary on the complaint of a former district revenue officer of Haryana for excluding his name from a cheating FIR. In the meantime, the income tax department has sought details of assets of Choudhary from the police to investigate his disproportionate income. Police had also sent a communication to the enforcement directorate (ED) to investigate the matter. The SIT sleuths had identified 45 properties of Choudhary and his family members of worth around Rs 150 crore in Chandigarh, Mohali, Kharar, Ludhiana, Zirakpur and Nayagaon.

The protesting nurses demanded that the government not hold mega vaccination drives on Sundays and also reduce the timing till 5pm. “We are working for the mega Covid-19 vaccination drive and are also going for door-to-door duty every day. This is taking a toll on us. We are ready to work hard to provide Covid-19 vaccination for all but it is unfair to give us unreasonable targets and pressurize us,” said K Chinnaponnu, Madurai district secretary, Tamil Nadu Village Health Nurses Association. “Other department officials are not providing us the support we need consistently. We are also continuously enduring verbal abuse from public who tell us not to force them to take the Covid-19 vaccine. This is greatly affecting our mental health. The state government has said that vaccination is a choice and not mandatory but are putting pressure and threatening us to achieve vaccination targets,” said a VHN. “We are not asking to relieve us from Covid vaccination duty. We just need some breathing space. Let the public also have some accountability for not taking the Covid-19 vaccine,” said another nurse. The other demands included promotion in five years instead of 33 years and 50% quota for CHNs for promotion to district maternal and child health offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nurses-hold-protest-against-high-workload-due-to-vax-duty/articleshow/87807896.cms||---

Muraleedharan was talking to reporters on Friday after visiting the family member of the BJP follower, Koppara Biju who was allegedly murdered by SDPI activists, at Manathala, near Chavakkad recently. The relatives of Biju are telling me that the police are threatening them, rather than proceeding against the accused, Muraleedharan alleged. Meanwhile, the Union minister also visited the house of Sanjith A, an RSS who was hacked to death by allegedly by SDPI men, at Elappully on Friday. He alleged that the state government is trying to scuttle an investigation by National Investigating Agency (NIA) on the brutal murder of Sanjith at Kinassery on Monday in broad daylight. “The state government wanted to keep the investigation with them to help the culprits escape the law. If the case is handed over to NIA, it will definitely probe it and bring the culprits to book. The police are in the know about the culprits in this heinous crime but not arresting them as they want them to go scot free.” The recent murders at Manathala and Palakkad indicate that SDPI activists are becoming increasingly emboldened to commit violent acts. Their target is not just a single party, but members of all parties are becoming victims of their attack, he alleged. “This is happening because the LDF government in Kerala is supporting religious terrorism and the police instead of taking action against such fundamentalist forces are threatening those who oppose them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/islamic-terror-spreading-in-kerala-alleges-union-min/articleshow/87806484.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, though present in Lucknow, will join the event from Saturday. While inaugurating the conference, Shah appreciated the role played by security forces during the Covid-19 pandemic. He stressed on better coordination between state police and other central agencies, while urging delegates to focus on quick implementation of suggestions discussed during the meet. Shah emphasised on the need to zero in on security-related issues, including coastal security, left-wing extremism, narcotics trafficking, cyber-crime and border area management.  He hailed the hybrid format of the conference as directed by the Prime Minister and observed this would help in better dissemination of cutting-edge proposals. He emphasised on reforms at police stations for effective policing. Police chiefs of states and union territories and director-generals of central armed police force were present at the police headquarters at Lucknow. Around 350 officers attended the session virtually from Intelligence Bureau offices in various states and union territories.

---||Delhi||Until next year? Stubble burning season nears end||NEW DELHI: The farm stubble burning season is drawing to a close, with fire counts in Punjab and Haryana starting to decline. The daily farm fire count came down from over a 1,000 a few days ago to 285 in Punjab and 67 in Haryana on Thursday, according to images from Nasa’s VIIRS-SNPP satellite. Delhi’s air quality, however, remained “very poor” for the third consecutive day on Friday with the air quality index at 380. A late monsoon withdrawal and frequent rain had kept the farm fires low in the first few weeks of October, but the number saw a steep rise in November and even surpassed the figures of the past few years. An analysis by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) on the trend of farm fires in 2021 as against 2020 shows that the combined daily count of Punjab and Haryana crossed 3,000-mark in the last week of October last year. This year, it touched 3,000 in the first week of November. L S Kurinji, programme associate of CEEW, said, “This year, Punjab and Haryana reported over 84,000 farm fires, the highest since 2016. The cumulative number of farm fires in Punjab and Haryana observed a marked spike from just 20,723 until October 31 to 84,513 till November 18. However, he added, the fire count “has started to decrease as we approach the Kharif season’s end”. Over the past two days, the cumulative daily count stood at less than 1,000 farm fires as opposed to the daily peak of 3,000-6,000 at the start of November, Kurinji pointed out. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was 3% on Friday. “While the farm fires usually subside by mid-November, a delay of four-five days is noted, especially in Punjab, this year. This slight shift in the trend can be attributed to the delayed harvest on account of late monsoon withdrawal,” he observed. Gufran Beig, founder project director of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said, “If the wind direction and transport-level wind speed are favourable, the low fire counts can also impact Delhi’s air.” However, experts emphasised the focus should now be on controlling other sources of pollution. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “Farm fire is an episodic problem around this time of the year. The daily fire count will become negligible soon. Now the focus has to be on aggressive control of local pollution in the entire NCR to prevent more smog episodes this winter. Also roll out the strategies for round-the-year action.” According to SAFAR, Delhi’s air quality is likely to improve to the lower end of “very poor” or “poor” from Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/until-next-year-stubble-burning-season-nears-end/articleshow/87807286.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Aurangabad||HC issues notices to Centre, 6 others over CNG pipeline issue||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court has directed notices to be issued to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (P&NG) and six other respondents in response to a PIL filed by four lawyers, raising objection to the way the work of installing a 24-inch CNG pipeline — connecting Shrigonda in Ahmednagar district with Aurangabad city — is being carried out. The notices are returnable on November 29 when the matter is slated for next hearing. The Rs 2,000-crore project, being executed by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited’s (BPCL) subsidiary Bharat Gas Resources Limited (BGRL), is part of the larger Dahej-Vishakhapatnam CNG pipeline project. It has a junction at Shrigonda from where a 175-km-long pipeline will connect with Aurangabad city that is expected to get household piped gas connections in the next two years. “The counsel (for the petitioners) submits that the laying down of the CNG pipeline has not been done in accordance with the norms and because of that one person has already lost life. The pipelines are not being installed five feet below the ground. Thus, nuisance is caused,” the HC division bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice RN Laddha said on November 15 while asking all respondents to file their written response. Apart from the ministry of P&NG, BPCL, BGRL, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad district collectors, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) are the other respondents. The four petitioner-lawyers, who hail from Nevasa in Ahmednagar district, have pleaded through their counsel Ganesh Gadhe that as per norms the CNG pipeline should be laid at least five feet below the earth’s surface, but at several places it is being laid between one to three feet under the ground. The debris of road digging work alongside the highways and roads controlled by the NHAI and MSRDC are posing serious threat of accidents to motorists, they claimed. The work of laying down CNG pipeline is not in accordance with the standard technical norms set by the BGRL, which specifically mentions that the steel gas pipe should be laid underground with a minimum clear cover of 1.2 meter, the petitioners pleaded. Due to non-implementation of this specific norm by the contractor carrying out the work, it has become a threat to life of surrounding residents in the form of hazardous substances, the petitioners said, citing that explosion and gas disaster caused by accidents cannot be ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-issues-notices-to-centre-6-others-over-cng-pipeline-issue/articleshow/87805785.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Special public prosecutor, POCSO Act, Basant Singh Saini said the girl, daughter of a farmer from Kanth area of Moradabad, was on a visit to her maternal grandparents’ house in Amroha when she was abducted. Ali knew the girl as she was a neighbour at the village. According to police, Ali came to the minor’s maternal grandparents’ house and told them that the girl’s mother was sick and asked her to come home. He had been sent to fetch her. He took the girl with him. The girl’s father arrived a few days later and found her missing. He approached local police as he was unable to find her. He filed a complaint against Ali. It took police seven months to locate and rescue the girl. The accused was arrested and sent to jail.

---||Mumbai||Smallest ward of Mumbai clocks zero Covid cases for 9 straight days||MUMBAI: The city’s B ward, the smallest of the 24 civic wards, has posted a big achievement: nine consecutive days without registering a single Covid-19 case. Though it has a small population of roughly 1.5 lakh, it encompasses congested parts of Mohammed Ali Road and Dongri, and P D Mello Road and the docks. This area with a poor hospital network (except for state-run JJ Hospital), high floating population and inadequate sanitation has the best Covid-control index. In November so far, it has enjoyed 13 days of zero tally. The last cases (2) were registered on November 10 though civic officials insist that at least 700 people are tested here daily. “B Ward has had cases in single digits for some time now. In fact, it has the lowest proportion in the city’s 7.6 lakh tally,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Since the Covid pandemic began in March 2020, the area has registered only 4,121 cases so far. Another official said people’s exposure to the virus must have been high due to cheek-by-jowl living conditions. “But it seems to have led to herd immunity here,” he said. Congress MLA Amin Patel remembers the pandemic began on a bad note here. While the overall Covid mortality has been around 1%, the area initially saw a 10% mortality. "Almost 10% of positive cases in the ward would pass away,” said Patel. But the all-round panic along with public health measures of sealing and isolating patients helped check the initial spread, he said. The change in B ward’s pandemic profile prompted officials to conduct an internal study. “The economic profile of the area is poor. Houses are close to each other and congested with no cross ventilation. In some areas, windows open into windows of neighbouring buildings,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The area also has many illegal constructions that don’t observe basic civic rules. Kakani ordered a study into why wards B, C and M East, despite having huge slum pockets with poor living conditions, had the lowest Covid numbers. “We thought it could be some underlying disease condition or exposure to a previous virus that was leading to some immunity, but the team couldn’t come up with any scientific reason for it,’’ he said. Local civic officials and social activists say public health measures such as roping in more community health volunteers and using local influencers helped during the first wave. During the second wave, the focus has been on vaccination. B ward’s civic in-charge Dhanaji Herlekar said the ward had 13 and one ‘zero’ tally days in October and September respectively. “We are aggressively working towards vaccinating maximum people. So far, we have managed to vaccinate 95,164 people,” said Hirlekar. Vaccine drives have been held in madarsas and community centres. “We also held many sessions for women only,” said Hirlekar. B ward’s medical health officer Dr Sandeep Gaikwad said, “We roped in local people who knew the area well as most of our staff didn’t live locally,” he said. The two groups worked well in explaining the need to test, quarantine or get vaccinated. “Those who died during the early days were persons with co-morbidities. Deaths are extremely low now,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/smallest-ward-of-mumbai-city-clocks-zero-cases-for-9-straight-days/articleshow/87808749.cms||Richa Pinto

Pimpri Chinchwad commissionerate had received a total of 21,000 applications for filling up the posts of 720 constables. As many as 80 examination centres from Aurangabad district, including 71 from Aurangabad city, were shortlisted. Due to the candidates’ failure to check the updates about examination centres, several students, who had reached Aurangabad, ended up at the wrong centres. On learning about it, Pimpri-Chinchwad’s assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Naik-Patil and senior inspector Madhukar Sawant brought the matter to the notice of senior officers. Police vehicles were used to take the candidates to the correct centres. More than 1,100 policemen and officers, including 500 from Aurangabad city, were deployed for the examination bandobast. Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta also asked the authorities to grant extra time to the candidates, who had reached the centres late. Sawant said, “An N-4 Cidco examination centre was changed due to lack of facilities on November 14. The candidates were sent text messages, email and fresh hall tickets, but some of them failed to check the updates and ended up reaching this centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-recruitment-candidates-get-help-to-reach-exam-centres-extra-time-for-test/articleshow/87805801.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The protest by the state transport utility employees in Kolhapur entered day 12 on Friday over their demand of merging the MSRTC with the state government. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers’ association, said, “We are protesting silently, but the state government is trying to humiliate us by one way or another.

Welcoming the decision of the Centre to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Shetti said they shouldn’t have been drafted at all. Shetti, who had tabled Private Members’ Bill in the Parliament in 2018, said, “I had introduced two bills — loan waiver to farmers and guaranteeing remunerative prices for farm produce. Now that the farm law that aimed to do away with the MSP system has been repealed, it is time to re-introduce the Private Members’ Bill. Farmers will get remunerative prices without worrying about artificial price drop or frauds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-will-raise-voice-till-msp-a-reality/articleshow/87805789.cms||---
---||Lucknow||After repealing 3 farm laws, PM Narendra Modi in Bundelkhand slams opposition’s agriculture politics||LUCKNOW/JHANSI: Hours after he announced repeal of the three farm laws, which were at the epicentre of a raging farmers’ protest for a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose parched Bundelkhand to tear into Opposition parties, accusing them of pushing farmers into a quandary to cement their very foundation. “Kisanon ko samasyaon mein uljhana hi kuch rajnaitik dalon ka aadhar raha hai. (Entangling farmers in unsurmountable problems forms the foundation of their politics)," Modi said, while addressing a gathering after inaugurating Rs 3200crore Arjun Sahayak, Bhawni and Ratauli and Majgaon irrigation projects from Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh. The projects would benefit not only Mahoba, but also Hamirpur and Lalitpur. PM’s remark marked his pointed counter-offensive at the Opposition, which sought to corner BJP for taking the decision vis-à-vis repealing farm laws in view of ensuing assembly elections in various states, including politically crucial Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. He slammed the Opposition for running a government of ‘parivarwadis’, who kept farmers in perpetual penury. “They make announcements in the name of farmers, but not a penny reaches them," he said, highlighting how Centre’s flagship PM Kisan Samman Nidhi managed to distribute Rs 1.62lakh crore to small and marginal farmers in the country. “Ye (opposition) samsyaon ki rajneeti karte hain aur hum samadhan ki rashtra neeti karte hain (Opposition does politics over problems, we do the politics of solutions)," he said, stressing that his government took steps to facilitate farmers on various fronts, including providing them quality seeds, helping them sell their produce in the open market, raising MSP of various crops, including pulses and initiating a national mission for making the country self-reliant in production of cooking oil. Modi squarely accused the Opposition of turning once fertile Bundelkhand into a parched region, triggering exodus of villagers. He said, people who ruled Delhi and UP for years did not spare a chance to impair the region. “Forests and other key resources of the region were handed over to the mafia,” he said. “In logon ne Bundelkhand se saath jaisa bartav kiya usey yahan ke log kabhi bhool nahi sakte. (People of Bundelkhand can never forgive or forget the apathetic attitude of former regimes),” he said, admonishing the previous government for swindling funds for their own “personal interest and for benefit of their families” while leaving the poor to struggle for a drop of water. “Everyone knows the truth. Only ‘commission and loot' prevailed in implementation of projects and schemes,” he said in an apparent reference to massive funds pumped into Bundelkhand, but without result. Modi categorically pointed out how false promises in the name of installing tubewells, hand pumps and constructing ponds and lakes were made without making people aware about the plunging ground water-table. “The government of ‘parivaarwadis' kept people of Bundelkhand thirsty, but the double-engine government of ‘karmyogis’ provided tap water supply to 30 lakh people in last two years,” he said, citing a host of initiatives taken by the BJP government for women and poor. The PM also cited the Arjun Sahayak project, which was left languishing for years. “It was only after 2014 that the Centre sought records of such projects. We discussed with then UP government about this project, but nothing happened," he said, terming the previous SP regime as “Gunehgaar of Bundelkhand” (Villain of Bundelkhand), which was not interested in completing irrigation projects. He asserted it was only after 2017, when BJP came to power in UP, that the project was fast-tracked. “Woh UP ko loot kar nahi thakte they...aur hum kaam karte karte nahi thakte hain (They were not tired of looting UP, we don’t tire working),” he said, adding the Centre and the state government were trying their best to resolve problems of Bundelkhand. Asserting that the laying of Bundelkhand expressway and UP Defence Industrial Corridor would open new vistas of employment for the youth, PM stressed the region also had vast potential for religious tourism to boost growth of the region and the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-oppn-pushed-farmers-into-quandary-to-cement-pol-foundation/articleshow/87808406.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||High spirits for booze business licence flood Telangana with cash||HYDERABAD: It was a day records were broken in terms of liquor licensing auction for 2021-23. The state saw 67,841 applications pour in, with 121 applicants jostling for a single shop in Madhira town of Khammam. While each shop in the state received an average of 24 applications, the excise department earned more than the estimated revenue of almost Rs 1,400 crore in just few days as application fees. Majority of applications came from districts of Khammam and Mahbubnagar, which share a border with Andhra Pradesh. For 2,620 stores across the state, Khammam district alone received over 10,000 applications. In terms of individual stores, the second highest number of applications were received for a shop located in the same Madhira town, with 119 people seeking a licence. “We are equally surprised. True to its name, both shops in Madhira town had so many applicants,” said an excise official. Three other shops in town received more than 90 applications. On the final day of applications, Thursday, a whopping 37,152 applications were filed until late hours across the state. Officials credit the significant number of applications to two key factors. First, many people from Andhra Pradesh applied since the government is selling booze directly to people without providing individual permits. “The Telangana government also campaigned on improved margins for retailers on liquor sales, which resulted in many people filing applications at the last minute, and there was no limit on the number of applications submitted by each person.” officials said, about the second reason. During the last auction, 48,000 applications were received making this times figures a huge increase. Interestingly, a shop in Mortad village in Nizamabad district was the only one that received a single application. The number of applicants in each auction has been increasing, officials said on Friday. The application cost in 2017 auction was only ₹1 lakh, garnering ₹498 crore income; which increased to ₹968 crore in the 2019 auction and Rs 1,208 crore in 2021. From the 2019 auction, application price was raised to ₹2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-spirits-for-booze-biz-licence-floods-t-with-cash/articleshow/87807295.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

It was ‘Dev Deepawali’, the Diwali of Gods, in Kashi, the permanent abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Annapurna. Amid the unique merger of heavenly and earthly with religious fervour, the city also witnessed the modern paraphernalia like shows of hot-air balloon and musical laser during the Dev Deepawali, which is celebrated a fortnight after the festival of Diwali on Kartik Purnima. The reflection of illuminated riverfront in the river and floating diyas in the stream created a mesmerizing world from the beholders. The grand Ganga Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat and the riverfront beauty were also watched by the crowds of people from boats as well as ghats. For Hindus, the Kartik month is believed to be one of the holiest months. It holds great importance in Hindu culture. Hundreds of ‘akashdeeps’ (sky lamps) are hung in baskets at the top of bamboo poles along the ghats particularly at Panchganga Ghat in the evening during the month. It is believed that these lamps brighten the way of ancestors on their annual visit to the earth. According to tradition, Lord Vishnu wakes up from his slumber of ‘charutmas’ on Prabodhini Ekadasi. During the five day from Prabodhini Ekadasi to Kartik Purnima, the ghats witness the morning bathers, who stop at Bindu Madhav temple for the darshan of Lord Vishnu. Kartik Purnima is one of the biggest bathing festivals, when lakhs of devotees take holy bath in the Ganga. Thousands of devotees from far-off places started thronging the ghats since Thursday afternoon, and with the daybreak they started taking dip in the Ganga. After bathing they offered prayers to the deities. A sea of devotees was seen along the ghats. Elaborate security and traffic arrangements were made for the convenience of people and visiting tourists and VIPs. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also witnessed the grandeur of Dev Deepawali last year. “The Dev Deepawali festival has become a global event today after the participation of the Prime Minister last year,” said UP minister Neelkanth Tiwari, adding that the state government has been actively supporting the festival since 2018. “Before 2018, there was no support of the government in such an event,” he said and added that with a beginning from Panchganga Ghat in the past, today the festival is celebrated at all ghats. The government set a target to illuminate the riverfront with 12 lakh earthen lamps on the ghat steps for which 120 committees were formed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/majestic-ganga-ghats-light-up-as-kashi-celebrates-dev-deepawali/articleshow/87807293.cms||Binay Singh

The water level reached 2,399.70ft at 7pm. One shutter of Cheruthoni dam was lifted up to 40cm on Thursday in the wake of opening of the spillway shutters of Mullaperiyar dam. A KSEB dam safety official said that the water level was slowly increasing in the Idukki reservoir. “The present rule curve for Idukki dam will end on Saturday and the new rule curve will be applicable from midnight onwards. As per the rule curve fixed by the central water commission, from November 21 onwards the orange alert level will be 2,401ft, red alert level will be 2,402ft and upper rule level will be 2,403ft,” said the official. According to the KSEB officials, the shutter of Cheruthoni dam would be closed soon after the rule curve changes. The closing of the shutter also depends on the rainfall in the catchment area, said an official. For the last 24 hours, the rainfall in the catchment areas of the dam was very low and it was 1.8mm. The power generation at Moolamattam power plant is at maximum level and it generated 17.171mu on Friday. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu closed one more spillway shutter of the Mullaperiyar dam and the height of another shutter was reduced to 10cm after the water level in the dam decreased. The officials on Thursday opened four spillway shutters after the water level rose to the rule curve level of 141ft on Friday morning. Later, TN closed two shutters. The water level declined to 140.90ft at 7pm on Friday. The new rule curve will come into effect at Mullaperiyar dam from Sunday onwards. The new upper rule curve till November 30 is 142ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/slow-rise-in-water-level-of-idukki-dam/articleshow/87806495.cms||---
---||Meerut||Scenes of celebrations with gur, laddus & impromptu jigs around tractors in west UP, U’khand||Meerut/Muzaffarnagar/Agra/Rudrapur/Roorkee: After months of protesting against the three contentious farm laws, farmers in parts of western Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand burst into a frenzy of celebrations following PM Narendra Modi's announcement to repeal the three laws. Jaggery (gur) and laddus were freely passed around and there were scenes of impromptu jigs around tractors to the tune of ragini songs and the beats of drums. While the farmers celebrated their "victory", many maintained a cautious approach. "It took a year for the government to make this decision. Farmers suffered a lot. They didn't deserve this kind of treatment," said Jitender Hooda, a farmer in Shamli. Another farmer, Naveen Pradhan, from Meerut, said, "A huge burden is off the shoulders of farmers. But they paid a heavy price to achieve this. We've sacrificed hundreds of our brethren during the year-long agitation. The government should not try to take credit for this so-called 'benevolence'. It was their mistake and they had to rectify it." Rakesh Dhankad, also from Meerut, said that “the decision was taken out of electoral compulsion." Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar said, “We welcome the decision. On Guru Nanak Dev ji's birthday, we are now on the threshold of victory - of truth and patience." In Agra, many also said that the PM should provide monetary help to the families of those who died during the agitation. Family members at the Kasganj house of Lakhvinder Singh, 60, who fell ill near Ghazipur border and died soon after on January 22, were still in mourning. His brother Satnam Singh said, “Over 700 farmers, including my brother, lost their lives. The PM did not utter a word in their memory.” Interestingly, the members of the ruling party who were advocating the "goodness of the agri laws" till a day ago, now sang a different tune. BJP's west UP vice-president Manoj Poswal said, "Modi ji took this decision in public interest to free ignorant farmers from the clutches of political opportunists." Meanwhile, the farmers of the Terai region, also known as the 'rice bowl of Uttarakhand', were elated. They assembled in Jaspur, Kashipur, Gadarpur, Rudrapur, Kichha, Nanakmatta, Sitarganj and Khatima towns to distribute sweets and burst crackers. "It is a huge relief for the people of the Terai region. It's a win for farmers and the labourers," said Tejender Singh Virk, president of the Terai Kisan Mahasabha, who was critically injured in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 and is still undergoing treatment. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said the protesting farmers would wait till the laws are repealed in Parliament. "We don't trust this government. They never stood for our cause," added Karm Singh Padda, BKU's state president. While Sahab Singh, district president of BKU (Chadhuni), said that "we will continue our peaceful protest till we get the official papers."

Show cause notices have been issued to NMC staffers for recovering Rs10 from beneficiaries for printing out the vaccination certificate. TOI had on November 18 reported the civic body had opened and was operating a vaccination centre in storeroom at New Chopde Lawn at Awasthi Square in West Nagpur, violating the guidelines of Covid-19 vaccination drive. Taking serious cognizance of TOI’s report, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi directed officials to visit the centre and do the needful. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar visited the centre and directed officials of NMC Mangalwari Zone to close the centre. “We have shut down the centre. Staffers working at the centres have now been engaged in door-to-door survey and vaccination. Mangalwari Zone is planning to restart the centre in a hall in the same area in next few days,” he said. Dr Chilkar admitted the centre was not operating as per guidelines of the government. The centre was operated from a tin-shed room, which was a makeshift facility for storing materials used for decorating and hosting functions at the lawn. As per government guidelines, waiting hall, registration arena, another room for vaccination and third one for observation of beneficiaries for 30 minutes are mandatory at every centre. NMC had not displayed any banner or board highlighting it as its centre. But Chopde had displayed a banner, which was also a violation of model code of conduct in place for MLC elections. The banner highlighted the centre along with the BJP party symbol, pictures of Chopde and other leaders. Collector R Vimala said, “A team visited the lawn. Banner was found removed.” TOI had also reported Rs10 was being charged to beneficiaries at the centre for printing out of certificate. Dr Chilkar said it was also a violation. “Show cause notices have been issued to staffers working at the centre.” Chopde was also sending messages in social media groups every morning, saying Covishield was available free of cost at New Chopde Lawns from 11am. Though the centre was run by the civic body, the messages had no mention about the NMC or government providing free vaccine facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-shuts-vax-centre-in-storeroom-of-bjp-netas-lawn/articleshow/87807308.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Two metro trains will be kept as reserve. These two metro trains will remain parked in the depot. There will be a total of eight metro trains designated for the nine-kilometre priority. At present, two metro trains are available. Both are parked in the depot. One of them is also being used for carrying out trials under the supervision of RDSO. A third metro train got dispatched from Gujarat on Friday night. It will reach here in industrial city after a couple of days. By the end of December, the remaining metro trains will arrive. Metro trains are being readied in Gujarat from where the trains will be dispatched for Kanpur via road route. It then takes six to seven days to reach here. Metro train coaches started arriving in Kanpur in September. In September and October, two coaches of the train had arrived. The three coaches saffron-coloured metro train can accommodate over 974 passengers. Kanpur Metro trains are state of the art infrastructure and once services are rolled out commercially, people will get the latest and modern metros for commuting. While the work on the priority corridor is nearing completion, the construction work for the underground metro station at Naveen market is also in progress. It will take at least one year or even more to construct the underground stations between Chunniganj and Nayaganj. Meanwhile, on Friday evening, the metro trial was carried out by the RDSO. The trial was carried out between IIT and LLR. The trial was done at different speeds. The speeds at which the metro was run was 50km/hour, 70km/hour and 90 km/hour. The launch of the Metro trial was done by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on November 10. The trials started immediately after the launch. The trials will go on for four to six weeks before the services are commercially launched - most probably by the end of December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/six-metro-trains-to-run-on-9km-long-iit-motijheel-priority-corridor/articleshow/87807311.cms||---

Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said an average person in Delhi burns unnecessary fuel for 25-30 minutes a day and the campaign seeks to eliminate this practice. Launching the second phase of the campaign at the ITO intersection on Friday, Rai said, “The ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, which had been running for the past one month, has been extended for 15 more days. This marks the second phase of the campaign, which will run till December 3.” He added, “On an average, a person in Delhi crosses 10-12 intersections or traffic signals in a day, for which even a rough waiting time of two minutes per intersection amounts to 20-25 minutes of unnecessary fuel burning. This rough figure for the large population of Delhi is a significant contributor to the pollution in our atmosphere. Keeping this in mind, the objective of this campaign is to prevent people from polluting through their vehicles while waiting at red lights. By doing this, there will be a significant decrease in unnecessary fuel burning, as a result of which the pollution levels in Delhi will be brought down. Hence, this campaign in its second phase aims to further reduce vehicle pollution.” Commenting on the repeal of the three farm laws, Rai said this is a huge victory for the farmers’ movement. “This is such an arrogant government that it left farmers unaided on the roads in summer, winter, rain, and saw many get martyred. The central government was not ready to listen to anyone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/red-light-on-gaadi-off-drive-enters-second-phase/articleshow/87807314.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Healthy move: Telangana likely to increase Aarogyasri coverage to Rs 5 lakh soon||HYDERABAD: In a significant step towards providing free and high-quality healthcare to people, the state government is expected to increase the Aarogyasri coverage from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. A formal directive is expected to be issued soon. According to sources, the state administration is currently soliciting inputs from the state’s network hospitals and experimenting with various possibilities. They added that the decision, to enhance the cover, was taken keeping in mind the fact that the cost of basic treatment too has increased in recent years. This has pushed many people into seeking additional debts to meet their medical expenditures. “Therefore, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has proposed raising the coverage limit to reduce the load on people,” a top source said. According to insiders, the enhanced limit will also be beneficial if more than one member takes ill in a year. Aarogyasri currently covers 1,020 forms of treatment, while the Ayushman Bharat Yojana of the Central government covers 1,668 treatments. After strong opposition to the Centre’s demand to apply their healthcare system, the Telangana government implemented the scheme this year. The state has now integrated both schemes. Both schemes share 1,020 treatments, while the central scheme also includes 646 schemes. Aarogyasri covers 79 lakh people, while Aayushman Bharat Yojana covers an additional 30 lakh families. But sources said that several large hospitals are refusing to accept patients insured by the scheme due to delay in payments. Network hospitals have also often complained to the state government about late payments. “If the payments are not too far behind schedule, many hospitals will take patients under the system,” said the manager of a network hospital, adding. “It is true that broadening the coverage will greatly benefit patients. So, we will do our best to provide the best service possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/healthy-move-t-likely-to-increase-aarogyasri-coverage-to-rs-5l-soon/articleshow/87807298.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s maha dharna led to repeal of farm laws, says TRS||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) said party president K Chandrasekhar Rao’s dharna on Thursday was one of the reasons for the repeal of three farm laws by the Centre. “The (Narendra) Modi government feared that situation was going out of its hand. If the farmers’ protest spreads from north to south and KCR takes the lead, it would be difficult for them,” ministers S Niranjan Reddy and G Jagadish Reddy and MLA Balka Suman said at a press conference here on Friday. Soon after the Prime Minister’s announcement that the government would repeal the farm laws, the TRS hailed the decision and said it was a victory of the entire farming community and those fighting against the agri laws over a year. The party also demanded compensation to those who lost their lives in the protests. Party working president KT Rama Rao tweeted, “The power of people is always greater than the people in power.” Party MLC K Kavitha said in tweet: “A historic victory for our farmers. My humble tributes to the martyrs for their supreme sacrifice.” Finance minister T Harish Rao said farmers have proved their commitment and strength through their dharnas and hunger strikes on the farm laws. Telangana Rashtra Samithi MPs Kotha Prabhakar Reddy, Ranjit Reddy, P Ramulu, Manne Srinivas Reddy, M Kavitha and Venkatesh Netha said the Centre should announce ex gratia to the farmers who died during protests. “There was momentum at the Centre after KCR’s dharna at Indira Park. Several CMs of the states have decided to follow KCR on the farmers-related issues,” the MPs said. The party organised celebrations at Telangana Bhavan and Gun Park where party MLAs Danam Nagender and Maganti Gopinath took part. BJP political strategy behind move: DasuDasu Suresh, national working president of national BC welfare association, said Modi government’s decision to cancel the three controversial farm laws, calling it willpower of 62 crore farmers.

---||Patna||Bihar: EOU raids premises of suspended CO, unearths disproportionate assets||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the state police on Friday raided three premises of suspended circle officer of Koilwar, Anuj Kumar, after registering a disproportionate assets (DA) case against him. The EOU has found frequent money transfers in two bank accounts of Kumar’s wife from business establishments existing only on papers. The CO was earlier accused of conniving with sand smugglers. He was suspended by the state government along with 40 other officials, including two IPS officers, in June this year for allegedly turning a blind eye to illegal sand mining and smuggling. The FIR against Kumar was registered on Thursday following which the EOU procured search warrants and conducted raids at his rented accommodation at flat number 303 in Block-C of Vamika Enclave in Jagdeopath, Patna, paternal residence at Narhat Laugh village under the Sirdalla police station area in Nawada and his in-laws’ residence in Durga Shankar Road, Gaya. EOU sources said Kumar’s approximate disproportionate assets were calculated to be nearly 52% more than his total income from all known sources. “His total income from all sources, including salary, was Rs 80 lakh,” a senior EOU officer said. He added Rs 20 lakh had been deposited in two separate bank accounts of Kumar’s wife even though she is a housewife and has no source of income. “Most transfers were made from 2019 onwards when Kumar was posted in Koilwar,” the officer said. EOU authorities said they found around Rs 5 lakh in two bank accounts of Kumar. “The total value of his movable and immovable properties is estimated to be Rs 44 lakh. However, immovable properties are undervalued in deeds. They might be of worth a few crores in actual market price,” another senior EOU officer said. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said Kumar’s ill-gotten money probably came for hawala transactions and real estate in form of cash. He added several valuable items, including household goods, cash and jewellery were probably removed from the premises of Kumar which the EOU raided on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-premises-of-suspended-co-unearths-da/articleshow/87807323.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: 30 years after being rejected, teacher gets appointment and Rs 80 lakh||DEHRADUN: In 1989, following an advertisement in a newspaper, then 24-year-old Gerald John applied for the post of commerce teacher at CNI Boys’ Inter College, a government-aided minority educational institute in Dehradun. However, despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he did not get the job. In 1990, the Farrukhabad resident moved Allahabad high court (HC). After Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in 2000, the case was transferred to the HC in Nainital. Finally, as he turned 55, the Uttarakhand HC ruled in his favour in December last year -- ordering him to be appointed in the school as well as release of Rs 80 lakh as compensation. Of this, he was paid Rs 73 lakh by the Uttarakhand government a few months back although the balance of Rs 7 lakh, which is to be paid by the UP government, is still due. Being the senior-most teacher, John is also the acting principal of the school now. Reminiscing about his long fight, John told TOI that he was quite taken aback when despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he did not get the job. “When I asked authorities why I was rejected, I was told the candidate needed to have stenography skills to be selected. Stenography was not mentioned as one of the required criteria in the job listing. I suspected that the candidate who got the job had connived with authorities. That’s when I decided to take the matter to court.” The case made little progress until 2000, when it was shifted to the newly-functional Uttarakhand high court in Nainital after. Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh. In 2007, a single bench of the Uttarakhand HC ruled against John. He challenged the verdict at the Supreme Court. Here, former union minister and lawyer Salman Khurshid took up his case and fought it for free. “Khurshid saw it as a genuine case and since both of us are from Farrukhabad, he did not take any fee. The case stayed in SC from 2007 to 2010, when the court said that the case had merit and asked us to appeal for it in front of a double bench of the HC instead of a single bench. Ten years after the case moved back to Uttarakhand HC, a double bench ruled in John’s favour in December 2020. In January this year, John was appointed the Commerce teacher for classes 11 and 12 at the CNI Boys’ Inter College. In April, after the principal retired, he was also made the acting principal. “The high court ordered that I should be given around 60% of the salary I would have earned since 1989. That came to around Rs 80 lakh. Had I worked, I would have received a total of Rs 1.25 crore,” he said, adding that the fight was worth it, since he will now receive pension once he retires at the age of 60 in 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/3-decades-after-man-denied-teachers-post-despite-topping-merit-list-he-gets-the-job-plus-rs-80l-compensation/articleshow/87805815.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kochi||Ernakulam authorities plan more festivals in rural areas of post-Covid period||TS.Sreemol KOCHI: The festivals, which used to be concentrated in the city, are moving to rural areas in the post-Covid period to leverage local economy and encourage morale of residents in Ernakulam. The district is going to witness many festivals, which will last for days, next month. It has been decided to conduct festivals in Vypeen and Cheranelloor and discussions are going on to conduct another one in Kolencherry. The folklore festival in Vypeen will be held between December 1 and 31. While Cheranelloor festival, which will focus on culture and tradition of Kerala, will be held between December 21 and 31. The festival in Kolencherry will give thrust to Kudumbashree works and the value-added products they make. The date of the festival is yet to be decided. The Vypeen festival will see around 50 artists from across the state making graffiti on a 25-km stretch from Goshree Junction to Munambam beach for the first 15 days. The next 15 days will witness performances of various folklore art forms of Kerala at various venues. The festival will also include local cuisine using marine products, musical programmes in memory of Mehboob and products related to fishing, which is the traditional vocation of people in Vypeen. The festival will be conducted in eight panchayats falling under Vypeen constituency. “The festival is part of promoting tourism in the area to encourage people in the post-Covid period. Support for folklore art forms and artists in Kerala and making beaches in Vypeen part of cultural centres are some of the objectives of the festival,” said Vypeen MLA Unnikrishnan. While Cheranelloor festival will be held in the panchayat limit alone by setting up a shopping village near Varapuzha bridge. “We will set up traditional houses of tribespeople in Kerala with the support of the forest department in the shopping centre along with other products used in the state many years ago. We create an opportunity for people to come out and enjoy the festival mood,” said panchayat president K G Rajesh. The festivals are conducted in association with the district administration, tourism department and private agencies. In Kolencherry, Kunnathunad MLA P V Sreenijan has discussed the possibilities of conducting a festival with Kudumbashree officials. “We are planning to conduct the Kudumbashree festival in five venues. Their competitions will be held and food counters will be set up at various places as part of the festival. Officials will give a detailed report on the festival this week,” said Sreenijan. “These festivals are aimed at reviving the local community. Earlier, we used to celebrate such festivals along with other celebrations like Onam. But due to the pandemic, such festivals could not be conducted in the last two years,” said DTPC secretary in-charge Abilash Kumar T G.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-plan-more-festivals-in-rural-areas-post-covid-period/articleshow/87805810.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Forest department stays felling of trees at Chimbel||PANAJI: The proposed felling of 30-odd trees at Provedoria’s old age home at Chimbel, which had evoked fresh protests recently from villagers and activists, has been stayed by the forest department. The permission to fell the trees had been granted by deputy conservator of forest and Provedoria, which runs the old age home at Chimbel. The felling of trees was scheduled on November 17. A controversy has arisen over the location of the new old age home – to be built from central government funds at the historic site – after Provedoria chose the site on the western side with a green patch instead of demolition of the old building.  After Chimbel villager Brian Gonsalves filed an appeal, seeking to quash the permission for felling of the trees, conservator of forests stayed the felling and fixed a hearing on the plea on December 2. The Provedoria authorities have also decided not to go ahead with felling of the trees on the basis of advice from higher authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forest-dept-stays-felling-of-trees-at-chimbel/articleshow/87807971.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC faces loss as cos’ plan user change of plots in Empress Van||Nagpur: Adding fuel to a controversy, two private companies are trying to change user of its industrial plots in Empress Van under section 37 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act under provisions that would require them to pay lesser amount of premium. If this happens, the cash-strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will incur financial loss like what had happened in other cases in the past. Controversy had erupted couple of years ago after NMC proposed to construct road from Empress Van by felling 380 trees. Maharashtra State Textile Corporation (MSTC) is supposed to construct the road as it owns the industrial layout in Empress Van. Even as funds yet to be received from MSTC, NMC has started road construction after issuing tender and appointing a private contractor. Trees have been cut down followed by execution of works like laying storm water drain, levelling the land for road etc. Activists including advocate Ankita Shah had alleged the civic body was doing this to benefit three companies that have purchased sprawling plots in the layout. A couple of years ago, Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Orange City Garment Park and Acharya Shree Vidyasagar Garment Vyapari Welfare Society had purchased plot nos 1, 2 and 8, respectively, from MSTC. The companies have proposed commercial projects on the plots whose user is industrial. It requires change of user from industrial to commercial. Last year, Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP and Orange City Garment Park had submitted an application with urban development minister Eknath Shinde seeking user charge under section 37 of the MRTP Act. Under this provision, companies will have to pay 5% of ready reckoner value of the plots. The state government and NMC will get share of 50% each. The urban development department (UDD) directed the NMC to submit details. NMC said user change under section 37 of MRTP Act cannot be permitted but there is provision of change in user from industrial to commercial under clause 10.3.3 of Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) under which 20% premium is required to be paid. NMC is yet to receive reply on this. It has come to fore that the two companies recently sent letters to MSTC and forwarded copy to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari seeking user change under section 37 of MRTP Act recently. Confirming this, director in Royal Sandesh Business Park LLP, Ramdeo ‘Rammu’ Agrawal, told TOI that some traders have come together and procured the plots. “We proposed the project to ease congestion in Itwari, Gandhibagh and adjoining areas. It is in larger interest of the public and city. We are seeking user change under section 37 of MRTP Act which is well within the law and permissible. We will have to follow whatever decision is taken by government and NMC,” he said. There are trees on two of the three plots. The area too has more trees that are under threat due to development of commercial complexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-faces-loss-as-cos-plan-user-change-of-plots-in-empress-van/articleshow/87807345.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

T-Hub startup Paymatrix worked with Muthoot Pappachan Group (also known as Muthoot Blue) to identify cost-effective digital customer acquisition channels for their financial products such as gold loans, personal loans and MSME loans, among others. Muthoot Pappachan Group has been working to ramp up its digital presence and lending capabilities by partnering with fintech startups. Paymatrix, in lieu of their lowcost customer acquisition channels, was seen as an effective customer acquisition engine for their products and as a result Paymatrix also secured an investment from Muthoot Pappachan Group (also known as Muthoot Blue), which has picked up 54% stake in the company. In fact, for T-Hub there have been over 75 cases of corporate interactions with startups to solve business challenges. Similarly, Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited (formerly JUSCO) partnered with Bengaluru-based AI startup Road-Metrics, that was a part of one the corporate innovation programs at T-Hub, to help them maintain the roads in Jamshedpur city in an efficient manner. Using RoadMetrics’ AI-based solutions, the company’s utilities & road maintenance team were able to save money on early detection and prioritise stretches of roads that needed immediate attention with detailed location information for potholes and other early stage surface degradation. Another blockchain and AI startup StaTwig got connected to GMR Group at the beginning of the pandemic and is now a vendor for GMR Cargo. StaTwig deployed a Blockchain technology-based solution for tracking and monitoring of vaccine shipments handled at the Hyderabad airport’s cargo terminal. Blockchain solution, ‘VaccineLedger’, gave visibility on aspects such as location, product quality and safety of vaccine shipments to both vaccine manufacturer and buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/corporates-collaborate-with-startups-to-boost-innovation/articleshow/87807327.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi air pollution: How colour codes hold key to enforcement||NEW DELHI: With the national capital facing an air emergency, the Delhi government’s transport department is carrying out an awareness drive regarding installation of colour-coded fuel stickers in cars. The department also came out with its plans to empanel manufacturers of retrofitment kits for converting 10-year-old diesel and petrol vehicles into electric ones. Sources said that the objective is to sensitise vehicle owners about the need to get colour-coded fuel stickers at the earliest, but enforcement drives would not start at the moment. The department on Friday issued a public notice stating that the installation of chromium-based hologram stickers is mandatory as per Supreme Court’s order dated August 13, 2018. Diesel-run vehicles need to have an orange fuel sticker on the windshield and petrol and CNG-run vehicles need to have light blue stickers, which helps identify the fuel used in a vehicle from a distance during pollution-related enforcement drives. Vehicles registered from October 2, 2018 come affixed with colour-coded fuel stickers at the time of registration. Officials said that though vehicles registered in the last three years have these stickers, not many owners of vehicles registered prior to this come forward to get these affixed. Vehicle owners can get these fuel stickers affixed on the windshield by approaching their vehicle dealers. According to the amended MV Act, a vehicle without the sticker can be fined Rs 10,000, which has been compounded to Rs 5,500. However, sources said the department doesn’t plan to start special enforcement drives against vehicles without fuel stickers immediately. Officials said that the aim behind the notice is to create a sense of urgency as there has been undue delay by vehicle owners to get fuel stickers despite the Supreme Court’s order three years ago. In a move that would help reduce vehicular pollution and give a further push to electric vehicles in the capital, the Delhi government on Friday issued a notice for empanelling manufacturers and suppliers of approved electric retrofitment kits. These kits would be used to convert diesel and petrol vehicles with conventional internal combustion engines (ICE) for pure electric operation with retrofitment of approved pure electric propulsion. The manufacturers and suppliers of the kits will provide the information about the make and models of vehicles to which electric propulsion kit can be fitted, along with the range in kilometres of the kit on a single charge. ‘Type Approval’ certificates received from approved testing agencies would also have to be submitted by the applicants looking for empanelment. Senior transport department officials said that this move would be particularly beneficial to owners of more than 10-year-old diesel-run vehicles and more than 15-year-old petrol-run vehicles, which are not allowed to ply on Delhi’s roads. The retrofitment of these vehicles would mean that their owners would be able to use these for a longer period instead of just selling these at very low rates or even as scrap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bad-air-how-colour-codes-hold-key-to-enforcement/articleshow/87807334.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Under a scheme floated by the Centre, a total of 157 new medical colleges would be set up in three phases in 27 state-Union Territories in the country under the central scheme with funds sharing of Centre-state 60:40, and North East/special category states in 90:10 ratios. In a statement released by the Centre in October, out of the 157 medical colleges that have been approved since 2014, a total of 63 of them are functional and have started taking admissions. According to the reply received under the RTI, the maximum budget of Rs 2,467 crore has been released for Uttar Pradesh, while Rs 263 crore has been alloted for Maharashtra, including Rs 113.4 crore for phase-I and Rs 150 crore for phase-III. No funds have been allotted for two medical colleges in phase-II. “Maharashtra contributes maximum GST and tax revenues to the central kitty. Its population is the second highest in the country but compared to other BJP-ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat, the state is being given a step-motherly treatment,” said RTI activist Prafful Sarda. According to the RTI reply, the highest number of medical colleges, 27, have been allotted to Uttar Pradesh. Sarda said it is being done by the Centre keeping in mind the crucial UP elections due in early 2022. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh told TOI, “It is true that our state has been given a very small share but we are pursuing the central government to allot us more funds so that we could improve health facilities in rural, backward, Naxal-hit and aspiring districts of Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-got-just-rs-263-cr-funding-for-medical-colleges-rti-activist/articleshow/87805832.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Students, who stepped out from school after almost one and a half years, were excited to learn something new. “I was very excited seeing sculptures from different periods including early historic and Megalithic periods. I got to learn about Kakatiya sculptures and Uma Maheswara sculptures,” said Sreeja B, a student who took part in the heritage walk. Another student, B Abhiram, said that he learned to identify different sculptures and like sculpture of Sun God. “The sculptures are made of different rocks. Some of them are light grey, some are dark grey, and there were sculptures in peach colour as well,” he said. The walk was organised as part of the ‘World Heritage Week’ celebrations by G P Birla Archaeological, Astronomical and Scientific Research Institute along with India Tourism, Government of India and INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art, Culture and Heritage), Hyderabad. This is the first event of World Heritage Week. The organizers said that due to the pandemic they had limited registrations. “We divided students and two teachers into one group. Students were really excited as this is their first outing after the pandemic struck. They learned how to identify sculptures, what kind of stones they are made of and the origin of the sculptures,” said Anuradha Reddy, convener, INTACH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heritage-week-students-explore-sculptures-dolls/articleshow/87807319.cms||---

Tax dues of two airport buildings since 2016-17 come around Rs 1.3 crores, according to the dues list published from Chackai ward. Tax dues of around 131 units of KSRTC bus terminal complex at Thampanoor go above Rs 1 crore. The main building of the government secretariat owes the corporation Rs 56 lakhs between 2016-17 and 2021-22. Ten other units under the secretariat also record dues around Rs 20 lakhs in past five fiscals. Cash strapped Thiruvananthapuram Development Authority (TRIDA) seems to top the tax defaulter list. TRIDA’s due to corporation for a single building in Palayam is Rs 1.58 crores. Around 295 units under TRIDA owe corporation tax dues between Rs 10,000 and Rs 3 lakhs. Nearly 100 buildings owned by TRIDA owe the corporation tax dues well over Rs 10 lakhs as it is the top defaulter of tax dues as per the list made available for the Medical college area. Corporation authorities hinted that fresh notices will be served to all these buildings after the mandatory time-period of filing appeal against the dues is over. In 2019, the city corporation prepared the list of tax defaulters among government buildings following re-assessment of all the state government buildings in the city as part of issuing fresh demand notices under new tax regime. The process had posed challenges for the revenue wing as they came across government buildings which had not received building numbers for decades. Under the new tax regime, office buildings are assessed at a rate of Rs 80 per sq.m Over 700 buildings and around 1,000 building numbers were identified by the revenue wing in 49 wards in 2019. The arrears of government buildings in terms of property tax had swelled to Rs 50 crores as per corporation estimates. Four wards in the city have over 30 government buildings. TRIDA, KWA and SAP were found to own the highest number of buildings in various wards. Central government buildings which had defaulted on service charges were also listed in 2019. As per the norms, 75% of property tax shall be levied as service charge from central government buildings. The corporation council had earlier considered the pending arrears from the central government buildings; however, many of these arrears had to be written off as it was calculated over four decades or more. The revenue wing had earlier carried out an inspection of the central government buildings following an audit report which slammed the corporation for not identifying the buildings owned by the central government and for not having an exhaustive list of such buildings. In a communication sent to the corporation, the audit department invoked section 235[5] of Kerala Municipality Act which says that in the case of properties exempted from property tax, the corporation is entitled to claim the cost of services covered by service taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/government-buildings-are-major-defaulters-in-corps-tax-dues-list/articleshow/87787382.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has planned five modern fish markets at a cost of Rs 19.4 crore. Two are already functional. The decision was taken keeping in mind several factors including the necessity of hygiene and how sale of fish on the streets was disrupting traffic. The additional benefit will be that all varieties of seafood will be made available at modern fish markets. Two of the modern fish markets at Nacharam and Kukatpally have already started functioning. Works are near completion at two fish markets at Begum Bazar and Mallapur. Another fish market, proposed at Narayanaguda market, at a cost of Rs 4 crore will open soon, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/five-modern-fish-markets-planned-in-city-to-cost-rs-19-4cr/articleshow/87807350.cms||Sunil Mungara

Overwhelmed by the reduction of theft cases by 79% in comparison to the pre-pandemic days of 2019, the RPF observed that their diligent implementation of the ‘meri saheli’ scheme to protect women travelling alone in trains is likely to have contributed in keeping a check on the thieves targeting passenger belongings. In 2019, there had been 768 cases of thefts till October. During the pandemic lockdown, the cases had dwindled to 137 as mostly empty trains were plying till October 2020. Though there is a rise in cases of thefts — 161 — this year till October in comparison to the last year, passenger belongings remained safe even though the frequency of trains had increased. RPF’s senior divisional security commissioner Ashutosh Pandey said RPF had been attending to solo women passengers in 16 trains under the ‘Meri Saheli’ scheme which included three originating from Vidarbha. “The RPF in ‘Meri Saheli’ team would spend time talking with such women. The RPF also had to click photographs to maintain records. The increased presence of police in trains seems to have helped in reducing theft cases,” he said. Pandey also said long-distance trains not stopping in in smaller stations like Ajni, Itwari, Narkhed, Pandurna etc also helped. “Most thieves prefer to board or get off at nondescript stations where surveillance is less. Access control during Covid checking also helped,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/railways-scheme-for-women-safety-reduces-theft-cases/articleshow/87807332.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Spraying ops on to control ‘dieback’ in neem: Officials||Hyderabad: With complaints flooding in from various parts of the city — and from across the state — about neem trees drying up due to ‘dieback’, a fungal disease, the forest department officials have said spraying chemicals is the only remedy to control drying of neem trees. With thousands of trees affected, people have been asking about possible remedies. Forest divisional officer (FDO), flying squad, Ranga Reddy, Maqsood Mohiuddin said, “Take 1gm of carbendazim 50% WP and mix it in one litre of water, followed by 3gm of copper oxychloride in three litres of water. Spray this after seven to 10 days on the neem trees with tractor mounted sprayers,” said Masood. Certain procedures have to be followed during spraying operations to control dieback effectively said officials. These include spraying between 3pm to 6 pm in a phased manner to complete whole area. The operations have to be taken up over four to five days. There must be a power shut down while spraying operations are in progress. In case the neem trees are located on premises of educational institutions, then spraying operations must be taken up when children are not around, said forest officials. Explaining the effects of dieback, the FDO said, “Tender leaves of neem trees turn brown and started drying. The trees die within a short period of three to six months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spraying-ops-on-to-control-dieback-in-neem-officials/articleshow/87807359.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Nagpur||SC-appointed committee to study farm laws may make report public||Nagpur: The decision to repeal three farm laws has left members of the Supreme Court-appointed committee disappointed. They are considering the option to make the report, which was submitted before the Apex court in March, public. Following a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the laws, the SC had appointed a three-member committee to study the laws. The panel, which was formed on January 12, had submitted the report on March 19, a day before the deadline. “The report was supposed to be made public during the next hearing scheduled eight weeks later. However, the hearing did not take place. While we raised concerns over the report not being released, the government has repealed the laws itself,” said Anil Ghanawat, the president of Shetkari Sangathana — a farmers’ outfit in Maharashtra — and a member of the committee. Ghanawat said he was heading to Delhi to meet other members of the committee. They plan to meet on Monday and take a decision to release the report. “Since the laws itself have been repealed, there should not be any legal issue in doing so,” he said. The other members of the committee are Pramod Joshi, the director of South Asia Food Policy Research Institute, and Ashok Gulati, the former chairman on committee on agriculture costs and practices. Gulati said he has no idea about the plan to release the report. “The committee has done its job and submitted the document to the court. Now since the laws itself have been repealed, the report has no relevance,” he said. Without divulging much details, Ghanawat said the committee had made recommendations on all the three problematic laws. The major stress was on making the Essential Commodities Act more liberal. “Under the law, stock limits would be imposed if rates of perishable produce went up by 100% of the last five years’ level and for non-perishable items it was 50%. We had mooted to do away with the stock limit or increase the ambit of price rise,” he said. There were similar measures to make the other two laws more trade and farmer friendly too, according to Ghanawat. Dinesh Kulkarni, the organization secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, which is the farm outfit of the Sangh Parivar, said, “We also want a law to guarantee a basic remunerative price for farmers under all circumstances. This can be in the form of a mandatory MSP.” A press release by the Sangh said Friday’s decision is a right move “for avoiding unnecessary controversy over the issue”. “However, the stance by the so-called farmers opposing the laws will lead to a loss in the long run. The laws would have brought benefit to the small and medium farmers,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-appointed-committee-to-study-farm-laws-may-make-report-public/articleshow/87807366.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Patna||Bihar: 2 cops held for assaulting ADJ, admitted to DMCH||PATNA: Ghoghardiha police station SHO Gopal Krishna and sub-inspector (SI) Abhimanyu Sharma were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting ADJ-1 Avinash Kumar inside his chamber in Jhanjharpur sub-divisional court in Madhubani district earlier in the afternoon. However, the two were admitted to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for treatment as they had been thrashed by the lawyers and court staff after the physical assault on the ADJ. Sources said the police tried to submit a petition before the Jhanjharpur court on Friday that both the accused SIs could not be produced before it after arrest as they were undergoing treatment. Sources, however, said the court accepted the copy of the FIR against the accused SIs but refused to accept the petition for inability to produce them. The ADJ had lodged an FIR against the duo with Jhanjharpur police station after the incident. Meanwhile, both the SIs recorded their statements before police in the Darbhanga hospital on Friday and alleged that the judicial officer and a few others inside his chamber abused, humiliated and even thrashed them first. All senior police officers avoided to say anything on the issue. They were not even clarifying officially that whether the two police officers had been arrested or not. TOI tried for an official statement of ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Singh Gangwar on the issue, but he disconnected the call. Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar, who was in Madhubani on the second consecutive day, only said police were following all legal procedures on the basis of FIR registered by the judicial officer. “Both SIs are undergoing treatment at DMCH for their injuries received from thrashing. The DM and SP will send a report on the Thursday incident to senior authorities soon,” the IG added. A senior police officer from Madhubani said both the SIs could not be produced before court on Friday as they were taken to hospital after falling seriously ill late Thursday night. Meanwhile, Bihar Judicial Services Association secretary Ajit Kumar Singh strongly condemned the incident. “I have nothing much to say as the Patna high court has already taken suo motu cognizance of the incident. I believe the matter would be taken to its logical conclusion with redressal of all grievances,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-2-cops-held-for-assaulting-adj-admitted-to-dmch/articleshow/87807368.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Pune||12 companies show interest in riverfront devpt project||Pune: Twelve companies have expressed interest in Pune Municipal Corporation’s riverfront development project, designed along the lines of the Sabarmati riverfront development project. Tenders worth Rs360 crore for the first phase were issued in October. The project faces opposition due to increased cost by around Rs 2,000 crore. Activists and environmentalists have red flagged the project on the grounds that it could cause floods. They also claimed cost-escalation was done without proper public consultation. The tenders were issued on Wednesday. Work will begin five years after it was announced. “The response to the tender was very good. Twelve firms have shown interest. The final figure will be known after a fortnight, when the deadline lapses,” said Mangesh Dighe, a senior PMC associated with the project, said. He said PMC was hoping that even more firms show interest in the project. Though the consultant for the Sabarmati riverfront project has designed this initiative, the Pune project will have its own identity. As per the tenders, the first phase will be carried out from Sangam Ghat to Bund Garden. The work includes beautification of the banks, cycle tracks, beautification of Naik island. Boating activity is also proposed in this phase. The proposal also states that greenery will be developed on the tracks to maintain the temperature. The total project is to be completed in 11 phases. “Environmentalists and experts have raised alarms about this initiative. If the authorities go ahead with the project against the public will, we may explore legal options. The matter may be taken to court,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-companies-show-interest-in-riverfront-devpt-project/articleshow/87807974.cms||---

Authorities said police teams have carried out searches at the office of the academy as well as at the residences of the office-bearers. Though nothing substantial has been found, pamphlets as well as leaflets calling for a bandh have been seized. Nanded range’s deputy inspector general of police Nisar Tamboli said, “Multiple teams have been formed to arrest suspects, including these three members, identified for their alleged role in violence.” The officer said police teams have also been fanned out of town to track the ones who have allegedly fled Nanded after the police launched a crackdown against those involved in violence. The stone-pelting and violence on November 12 in Nanded left eight policemen injured and several vehicles damaged. Police also registered four offences against 60 identified and around 240 unidentified suspects caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras as well as other footage while committing violence. Additional SP Vijay Kabade told TOI, “After verifying their specific role, we have so far arrested 69 accused and the number is all set to increase in coming days.” The officer added that with the help of CCTV footage, a strong case is being built up against the rioters. “After the organisers of the bandh made a written representation to the tehsildar, the mob was dispersing, when suddenly a group of youths started heading back to the collector office, but were stopped by police. They then resorted to stone pelting,” said Kabade. To bring the situation under control, police ended up firing 50 rounds of hand pump action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-launch-manhunt-for-3-raza-academy-members/articleshow/87805859.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He praised the PM for respecting the essence of dialogue in democracy. “Initially, many believed the laws could play a key role in doubling income of farmers. However, when farm organisations came out in protest, the government tried to hold dialogue with them. Maybe, there was something lacking on our part that we failed to explain our point of view to farmers. Honouring dialogue in a democracy, PM announced withdrawal of three farm laws and the setting up of a committee on minimum support price,” the CM said. Earlier, while attending Guru Parab celebrations organised by Naka Hindola gurdwara in Lucknow, he said, “Krishi kanoon chahe jaisa bhi raha ho, loktantra me iski awaz ansuni ni kar sakte. Aapsi samvad se hum iska samna karenge. (Whatever may have been the farm laws, it’s our duty to hear the voices of people in a democracy. We will deal with it through dialogue)," he said.

In a press communication released by CC spokesperson Abhay on Friday, the rebels described November 13 as the “most sorrowful day in the revolutionary history of Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra”. The rebels have vowed to take the battle ahead and prepare “more cadres like Teltumbde from among students, dalits and oppressed classes”. The press release was also circulated on social media in Gadchiroli. TOI too has a copy. According to senior police officials, the Maoists have for the first time not levelled any allegations regarding the encounter or questioned its fairness. The Maosists have confirmed the death of Teltumbde much to the relief of security forces who have collected DNA samples too for scientific identification. Cops had earlier sought assistance from surrendered Maoists to identify Teltumbde. SP Ankit Goyal said security forces will remain alert during bandh which is likely to impact Gadchiroli and parts of Gondia. “Forces will follow standard operating procedures (SOP) to thwart the bandh call,” he said. The SP refrained from commenting on other contents of the press release which mentioned “contributions and sacrifice” of Teltumbde and his team. Maharashtra government had announced rewards of Rs51 lakh for the C-60 jawans for killing the elusive Teltumbde who had a reward of Rs50 lakhs on his head and around 63 offences against him. In the press release, the CC has vowed to fight till the end to complete the “unaccomplished task” of the rebels who were killed in the 10-hour long gunbattle close to the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. The press note also mentioned that the rebels had fought till end to save Teltumbde who was also the in-charge of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. TOI had earlier reported how Teltumdbe’s body guards had fought to death before the C-60 jawans could gun down the top rebel leader. The press communication also mentioned the “courageous sacrifices” of Teltumbde’s bodyguards like Bhagat and Yogitha. As per the press release, Bhagat had been with Teltumbde for the last eight years. Yogitha worked as his “personal assistant” managing the computer-related tasks. The CC has also conformed deaths of its other members like Ramanna, Chintan da, Haribhushan, Amber da and Saketh in different encounters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoists-call-bandh-in-6-states-to-pay-homage-to-27-killed-in-encounter/articleshow/87807360.cms||Soumitra Bose

We will be seeking only a judicious tariff hike for the next control period starting from April 2022, the board said. “KSEB will file a tariff revision petition based on new tariff regulations issued by the state electricity regulatory commission. The board will be seeking a judicious tariff hike. It would be impossible to foretell the rate of tariff hike as it comes into being through a judicial process. The new tariff petition is expected to be submitted before the commission by December 25,” said authorities. Meanwhile, consequent to government directive and approval from the power regulator, KSEB has issued an order enhancing the free consumption ceiling for BPL category consumers from 20 units/month to 30 units/month.

---||Kanpur||India now working towards self-reliance in defence sector: PM Narendra Modi||JHANSI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that India which became known as an importer of arms has now adopted the mantra of “Make in India, Make for the World” to turn the country self-reliant in the defence sector. At an event in Jhansi in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the PM formally handed over the Light Combat Aircraft (LCH) designed and developed by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to the Air Force chief, drones and UAVs built by Indian start-ups to the Army chief, and the DRDO-designed and Bharat Electronics Limited-manufactured advanced electronic warfare suite for naval ships to the Navy chief. He said that a lion’s share of spending on procurement of weapons from the defence budget will be done on indigenously designed ones in time to come in line with the country’s policy of self-reliance in the crucial defence sector. The PM was here on the concluding day of the three-day Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv, ‘Jhansi Jalsa’, which coincided with the 193rd birth anniversary of Rani Laxmibai. He addressed a limited gathering of 750 people from the precincts of the historic Jhansi Fort with the backdrop of the fort contour from where the Rani had jumped with her horse Badal while fighting the British force. He also laid foundation and inaugurated a number of projects worth Rs 3,425 crore, including a Rs 400 crore Bharat Dynamics plant to make propulsion system for anti-tank guided missiles, in Jhansi node of UP Defence Corridor. Modi said that the defence ministry has already released a list of 200 such equipment and weapons which would be purchased only from within the country. “The new warfare weapons and equipment manufactured in the Jhansi node of Defence Industrial Corridor (DIC) will not only help firm up the security of the country, but will lend a strong impetus to the ‘Atmanirbhar’ campaign envisioning self-reliance in the crucial defence sector,” he added. “The corridor will sow fresh seeds of development in the region and turn it into a new investment destination. Bundelkhand region known for valour and courage will now be known for strategic growth,” the PM said. Modi further said, “We were once famous as an arms buyer country. But with our new mantra ‘Make in India’ and ‘Make for the World’, India will now export defence equipment to the world and in this Jhansi node of UP Defence Corridor will play an important role. In this, MSMEs are also going to play an important role and also generate employment at the local level.” Modi said that the history of India’s freedom struggle would have been different if the brave 19th century queen of Jhansi, Rani Laxmibai, had military logistics which matched those of the British. The PM was cheered by the audience chanting ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ slogans a number of times. The entire programme was focused mainly on women as a number of girl cadets were present among the audiences as well as on the fort and even during conducting the programme. Notably, during her recent visit Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Chitrakoot and Lalitpur, where she had announced a number of benefits for the women and girls if Congress party comes to power along with distributing tickets to 40% of women. While starting his speech in the local Bundelkhandi dialect. Modi said that I bow to the land of valour of Rani Laxmibai and Jhalkaribai and said, “I congratulate all the people of this region as your ancestors too were part of the forces of Rani who fought against the British. He termed the region as ‘Kranti ki Kashi’.” He further said, “I feel lucky that I represent the birthplace of Rani that is Kashi and have the opportunity to serve it. I bow to both the places from here.” While mentioning Chandelas, Bundelas, Ala Udal, Modi said that this region has produced a number of leaders in history. He further said that already girls are being admitted in many of the sainik schools and very soon these schools will churn out many Rani Laxmibais. Praising defence minister Rajnath Singh and his team along with UP government under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for organising the event, Modi said, “This Utsav will go a long way in the development of defence corridor and Bundelkhand making it a fertile land for producing equipment for national defence.” He also praised the innovative ideas of Jhansi MP Anurag Sharma. Before reaching the rally ground, Modi visited the Jhansi Fort where he unveiled a plaque of Rani Laxmibai and witnessed the ‘beating the retreat’ ceremony. The PM was accompanied by UP Governor Anandiben Patel, Rajnath and Yogi. In addition, CDS Gen Bipin Rawat along with chiefs of Navy and Air force were also present.

All these projects are expected to help in solving the serious and persisting drought situations causing irrigation problems for the farmers of Bundelkhand. Addressing a rally in Mahoba, Modi said, “For the first time, the people of Bundelkhand are seeing the government working for their development. Previous governments did not get tired of looting UP but we do not get tired of working.” The Prime Minister further said that the resources of the region were handed over to mafias by the previous governments. “Those who ruled Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for a long time left no stone unturned to ruin this region. It is no secret how jungles and resources of this region were handed over to mafias. Now that bulldozers are being used against these mafias, some people are making a hue and cry,” said Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pm-india-now-working-towards-self-reliance-in-defence-sector/articleshow/87807373.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Kolhapur||In special drive, 76 homeless people given jabs by Kolhapur Municipal Corporation||KOLHAPUR: As many as 76 people from Kolhapur city, who are homeless and lack valid documents, were vaccinated during a special drive conducted by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Friday. An arrangement of registering people without valid identity documents have been added on the CoWin portal. The KMC had carried out a survey of people who do not have an Aadhar card or any other identity proof. During this survey, the authorities searched for people living at the bus stand and railway station. They also searched the shelter homes and approached social organisations to help the civic body reach to such homeless people. “Henceforth, we will continue vaccination of such people. They need to be vaccinated since they come in contact with large number of people every day. They need to be protected as they are more vulnerable in comparison to others,” Amol Mane, vaccination nodal officer of the KMC, said. Meanwhile, around 17,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district on Friday. The district administration has a tough task ahead to complete the first dose vaccination of all eligible beneficiaries by Saturday as directed by district guardian minister Satej Patil. However, it is unlikely to meet the deadline since 85% beneficiaries have received the first dose and in a day vaccinating the rest of the population is a daunting task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-spl-drive-76-homeless-people-given-jabs-by-kmc/articleshow/87805874.cms||---

The firm’s general manager, Sandeep Raizada, submitted before the steering committee of NMC’s transport department that it could deliver only four e-buses by February 2022. However, the panel headed by chairman and additional commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena directed the department to impose ₹16,800 fine per day for the failure to abide by the agreement to deliver e-buses. TOI had highlighted that NMC gave an ultimatum to the firm to deliver 40 electric buses by November 15, or it would start levying 0.1% fine per day against its performance guarantee amount. Sources said Meena expressed anguish over the firm’s inability to maintain date for e-buses delivery. So far, NMC has extended the deadline to deliver the e-buses at least five times. Every time, the firm has failed to meet its promise and now it is seeking more time to deliver only four e-buses by February 2022. The committee, however, expressed doubt over the firm’s demand for a new deadline as it may miss that too. Sources pointed out that the firm’s delay in delivering e-buses is hampering Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari’s dream of NMC operating only eco-friendly buses, by replacing all diesel buses. Sources also said that receiving e-buses before February is a must for NMC as it will have to scrap 150 standard buses, which are at the end of their lifespan. The steering panel also directed operational manager of Aapli Bus service, DIMTS, to conduct an audit of standard buses. According to transport department officials, the JNNURM buses are in a bad shape. Apart from procuring these 40 e-buses with the help of Rs18 crore sanctioned by the central government under Phase-II of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle), NMC will also get 15 electric buses from NSSCDCL (Smart City). The panel also directed both private firms providing conductors to the Aapli Bus fleet to increase their manpower. Against a demand of 1,000-odd conductors, the firms are providing only 850 conductors. The shortfall of manpower is affecting city bus service on many routes. Meena has given a fortnight’s time to the firms to increase manpower. Decisions of the steering committee will now be reviewed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/evey-trans-unable-to-deliver-40-e-buses-demands-fresh-deadline/articleshow/87807372.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The MHWF SOP grants special dispensation for administration of the second dose of Covishield vaccine prior to the prescribed time interval — after 28 days, but before 84 days — to eligible persons intending to undertake international travel for educational purposes, for joining employment in foreign countries, etc. Sawaikar pointed out to Mandaviya in his letter that upon the expiry of the time limit of the SOP on October 31, a large number of eligible persons, particularly seafarers, are unable to undertake international travel. “Goa, like many other states of India, has a large diaspora and NRIs, which include seafarers. It has come to light that there was a time limit imposed in the MHFW SOP up to August 31, 2021, which was subsequently extended till October 31, 2021, but thereafter there has been no extension,” Sawaikar said. He urged Mandaviya to extend the validity of the MHFW SOP. The special dispensation SOP issued in June was available to three categories of people — students who have to undertake foreign travel for the purposes of education, persons who have to take up jobs in foreign countries, and athletes and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending the Olympic Games held in Tokyo in July-August. A competent authority was mandated to be designated by the state/UT governments in each district for according permission for such administration of the second dose of Covishield.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/extend-relaxation-on-vax-gap-for-intl-students-sawaikar/articleshow/87807982.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Bawankule, not incumbent Vyas, is BJP’s MLC candidate||Nagpur: Former cabinet minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule has been chosen as BJP candidate for the upcoming polls, over incumbent Girish Vyas. The official list issued by the saffron party is confirmation of rumours doing the rounds for the last month, with Bawankule’s political rehabilitation on the cards after a shocking denial of MLA ticket in 2019. TOI had also recently reported that Bawankule is likely to get the ticket. Recently,in a public event, Vyas had spoken about the work done during his tenure, leading some to believe that may be Vyas had edged out Bawankule and retained his claim to the seat. Bawankule did not respond to TOI’s phone calls or messages. Girish Vyas, the incumbent MLC, said he has no qualms over denial of ticket. “I have always worked for the party and their decision is final. Bawankule is a great choice and I have no doubt that he will be an asset in the upper house. I shall continue to focus on party work in my role as spokesperson,” said Vyas. BJP city president Pravin Datke tried to play down the decision not to give Vyas a second shot. “Party high command has taken the decision and I am convinced that they have taken it after due consideration. Girishji is a very senior BJP member and I have no doubt that the party will give him some other important responsibility,” said Datke. Party insiders say Bawankule had raised the pitch for his claim to the MLC seat. A BJP leader said, “Right from the time of a major power outage in Mumbai, Bawankule took the front row seat in attacking the MVA government using his former energy minister portfolio as credentials. Since then, he has remained in the limelight regardless of the issue and led multiple street level protests and agitations.” Another party member said Bawankule’s street smart political acumen was on display, especially after being denied the ticket in 2019. “After the first few days of tantrums, he quickly toed the party line. Ever since, he has never spoken against either party or any leader. Bawankule stuck to this policy even in private discussions,” said another party member. A party worker, known to be in the Vyas camp, said the MLC ticket for Bawankule could be a double-edged sword. “Now that he’s got the MLC ticket, does that mean in 2024 he won’t get back his MLA ticket? Only three years to go now, so wonder what the party leaders have in mind,” the worker said. But Datke dismissed this as too speculative. “Who knows what will happen at that time. I am neither the authority to decide nor I would like to take a guess,” said Datke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bawankule-not-incumbent-vyas-is-bjps-mlc-candidate/articleshow/87807375.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nashik co gets US FDA nod for liquid biopsy to detect early breast cancer||MUMBAI: A Nashik-based cancer laboratory on Friday announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has granted a “breakthrough device designation” for its liquid biopsy test to detect early-stage breast cancer. US FDA grants such a tag to devices (including tests) that represent breakthrough technology with no alternatives. Last month, it granted the tag to an American company for its liquid biopsy test for early detection of pancreatic cancer. Usually a biopsy involves removing a piece of tissue or a sample of cells from a patient’s body to detect cancer, but in the past few years there has been increasing research on the non-invasive liquid biopsy method. As the term suggests, liquid biopsy is the process of analyzing tumor material—molecules or whole cells—found in bodily fluids such as blood.On Friday, the Nashik company, Datar Cancer Genetics, said its TriNetra blood test could detect circulating tumour cells and cluster-specific to breast cancer with accuracy. “Our clinical trials with over 20,000 women have shown the test can detect stage ‘0’ and stage ‘1’ breast cancer with an accuracy better than 99% without any false positive,” said Rajan Datar. He said the test, which requires 5ml of blood, is already available in Europe and will be launched in the US after it receives marketing authorization from the US FDA. The company’s press release said the test will be available in India shortly. “We are exploring tieups with various chains of laboratories to offer this test,” said Datar. According to the release, “This is for the first time that women above the age of 40 can obtain a breast cancer-specific blood test in consultation with their physician from the privacy of their home or office.” Breast cancer is the world’s most widely prevalent cancer. In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 6,85,000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past five years. In India, too, it is the most common cancer among women; affecting 25.8 per 100,000 women and with a mortality of 12.7 per 100,000 women. When contacted, leading breast cancer surgeon and director of the Tata Memorial Centre, Dr R Badwe said there is yet no solid evidence about the efficacy of liquid biopsy. Another doctor said that liquid biopsies are used as a “therapeutic guidance” to check if a treatment modality is working or if the disease has resurfaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-nashik-co-gets-us-fda-nod-for-liquid-biopsy-to-detect-early-breast-cancer/articleshow/87808791.cms||---

---||India||Repeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decision||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs of a resolution. Read Also'Apology to countrymen': Couldn't convince a section of farmers on agri laws, will repeal all three, says PMIn a decision that took the nation by surprise, PM Modi on Friday offered an apology for being unable to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the new farm laws and announced that they would be withdrawn in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament.The need to remove what has been a thorn in BJP's side ahead of important state elections, particularly UP, has widely been seen as as a trigger for the announcement, but BJP and government sources stressed that the souring of inter-community relations in Punjab was a stronger reason. The announcement came soon after the Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage was restored, and Modi remembered Guru Nanak in the two meetings he addressed in UP later in the day. Modi had observed the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur and visited Gurudwara Rakabganj. He has recalled the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's two sons in his Mann Ki Baat. Read AlsoFarm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash.Sources said this will not be the first time Modi has repositioned in view of a developing situation, having removed the national population register from the government's programme during a poll rally in Delhi in 2020 or, on a lesser scale, sidestepping the net-zero trap at Glasgow. The assessment that the farm stir had become a lightning rod of all manner for BJP's opponents also prompted the party brass to consider repeal of the laws.

This is said to be the first case involving a boy in the district.The 17-year-old boy from a village in Ballari district had allegedly stolen cash and gold from his neighbour’s house when the inmates were out of the city. Though none suspected him in the case, police arrested him after month of crime as they noticed a change in his behaviour.Sources said the boy’s parents are poor, while he wanted to lead a lavish life. To fund his habits, he struck the house in his neighbourhood.Ballari SP Saidulu Adavath told TOI that none suspected the boy soon after the theft. “When a neighbour went out of the city last month, the boy struck his house and made away with jewellery and Rs 2-3 lakh cash,” the SP added.But police suspected him after the boy kept travelling to Bengaluru. “After we took the boy into custody, he admitted to stealing. We have recovered 105gram jewellery worth Rs 5.50 lakh from him,” he said.During interrogation, the boy told police that he had stolen money to party in Bengaluru, and to buy costly liquor and cellphones. “He travelled 2-3 times to Bengaluru for partying. He had also planned to sell the jewellery.

As many as 10 goats and 40 hens got buried under the soil. The bodies of three goats have been found till now. When he understood that his remaining goats were in danger, he has chosen to shelter them in his home. The house has five rooms. His family adjusts in one room and the other rooms are occupied by 30 goats. “Without them I cannot survive. There is no other place, where I can house them. A few officials have visited the spot and promised me compensation. But I have not received any further information from them,” said Rajan. The landslide occurred in the early morning at 5.30am. Rajan, who was awake, suddenly heard a huge sound of the soil and trees falling down. When he rushed to his backyard, he saw that the shed was fully buried under the soil. Rajan had started the farm five years ago and it was his only source of income and that too has been destroyed in the landslide. “From this income, I used to pay for my daughter’s education and meet other necessities. Now, I have lost my source of livelihood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/landslide-hit-farmer-keeps-surviving-goats-inside-home/articleshow/87787418.cms||---

NCP chief Sharad Pawar said it was solely the fear of losing the upcoming Uttar Pradesh and Punjab elections that led to Modi changing his stance. Addressing media at Chandrapur, Pawar said, “BJP got a lot of negative reactions from these two states and Haryana. Hence, looking at all these things a political decision was taken to repeal the farm laws.” Lauding the protesting farmers, Pawar said, “They were resolute and steadfast in their opposition to the new farm laws. They braved the cold, rains and heat and continued their struggle. I salute the farmers who continued their protests peacefully for a year.” Pawar claimed that discussions over amendment in agriculture law for better support price for the harvest and to create an international market for farm produce were held when he was the Union agriculture minister. “Then, the BJP, which was in the opposition, was pressing for framing of new agriculture laws. I am of the view that agriculture is a state issue and hence no initiative can be taken without discussion with the states and other stakeholders. I met agriculture ministers, marketing and cooperative ministers and different farmer unions. Suggestions and recommendations were sought from agriculture universities too,” said Pawar. State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray issued a statement saying that Friday’s developments prove that the common man has won. “I pay tributes to those who lost their lives during this agitation. We hope that in future, the Union government will consult opposition parties before making any law,” said Thackeray. He also added that MVA had always registered its opposition to the farm laws at both cabinet meets and the legislature. State Congress president Nana Patole said that Modi needs to do more than just repeal the farm laws. “Modi and the BJP are habitual liars. We demand that Modi must first apologize to the farmers and also promise that in future no such anti-farmer laws shall be introduced,” said Patole. Patole added that certain actions of Modi do not inspire confidence in farmers. “Why is the Union minister, whose son mowed down farmers under his car in Lakhimpur, is still part of the cabinet. So, his decision is only because of fear of losing elections,” said Patole. Cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said there was nothing in Modi’s decision “to be welcomed”. Wadettiwar said, “Why should I welcome the decision which comes at the cost of 600 lives of agitating farmers. Why did the government wait for nine months before taking this decision. It’s been done due to impending polls, nothing else.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/political-compulsions-forced-modis-hand-say-mva-netas-on-move-to-repeal-farm-laws/articleshow/87807378.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Kingmaker Atal Bahadur Singh dead, city mourns||Nagpur: Atal Bahadur Singh, 79, a prominent figure in the city’s administration, academic, cultural and sports circles, passed away on Friday afternoon following prolonged illness. The last rites would be performed on Saturday. Born on March 2, 1942 in Benaras, Singh was a revered figure across many circles due to his friendly nature. After becoming deputy mayor in 1974, he had twice donned the mayor’s cap in 1977 and 1994. Several dignitaries, who closely worked with him during his heydays, mourned the demise of the leader, who was also known as ‘kingmaker’ in Nagpur Municipal Corporation circles. After floating a political party Lokmanch, Singh had unsuccessfully contested 2009 Lok Sabha polls on BJP ticket, but lost to former Union minister Vilas Muttemwar of the Congress. Union minister Nitin Gadkari said Singh was never bogged down by caste-religion-creed politics. “I shared a long-standing relationship with him. No matter what crisis befell this city, he was the first to run, help and build. As a sensitive and socially responsible person, Singh will always be remembered by the people. Many of his memories are etched in my mind as a person who always kept his word. Despite political differences, he worked to bring together people from all walks of life,” said Gadkari. “He enriched the city’s art and culture scenario and was extremely passionate about development, keeping aside political differences. As a student leader, Singh had taken part in the initiative to name various Nagpur University campuses after revolutionary freedom fighters,” recalled leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Besides holding the post of Nagpur District Football Association (NDFA) president, Singh was a member of NU’s Executive Council, Senate and other bodies for a long time and was part of many important decisions. A disciple of former NU registrar Balraj Aher, he had suggested conferring honorary DLitt on melody queen Lata Mangeshkar. “With his three decades long association with the NMC, Singh was known as a popular mayor due to his significant contribution for the city’s development. He was always at the forefront of sports, literature and social work activities,” said mayor Dayashankar Tiwari. Considered as one of the main pillars of NMC during his times along with Prabhakarrao Datke, Nana Shyamkule, Himmatrao Saraikar, Singh was instrumental in starting Sheshrao Wankhede Vidyaniketan for poor students and also took an initiative to start several libraries during his tenure as mayor. In 2014, he was honored with Shiv Chhatrapati Lifetime Achievement award by the government of Maharashtra. “Atal bhaiyya was an asset for the Western India Football Association (WIFA). I happened to work with him for more than 30 years and we had organized many events in the region including the India vs Rest of India football match at Yashwant Stadium,” said NDFA president Haresh Vora. For senior BJP corporator Sandeep Joshi, Singh was a guiding light and he shared a close relationship with him. “He was real inspiration and guide on how to do social work, how to back budding players,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kingmaker-atal-bahadur-singh-dead-city-mourns/articleshow/87807401.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Vehicles carrying sugarcane without reflectors being fined||KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur traffic police has started taking action against the transporters for not installing reflectors on their vehicles carrying sugarcane to the mills. So far, 14 tractors operators have been fined Rs 1,000. Since the start of the crushing season three weeks back, several fatal accidents have occurred. The commuters are unable to spot the trolleys parked on the roadside at night and crash their vehicles into them. Kolhapur traffic inspector Sneha Giri said, “By rules, installing illuminating reflectors on the rear and front side of the vehicles carrying the sugarcane is mandatory. We have conducted several meetings with the sugar mill operators and they have agreed to get the illuminating reflectors fitted on the transport vehicles. We are also conducting the awareness session by visiting the fields and interacting with the transporters. We are providing them with suitable reflectors as well.” “Most accidents take place in urban areas and along major highways. In a city like Kolhapur, sugarcane carrying vehicles are not allowed during day time. The routes have been fixed by the traffic department to reach the respective mills. According to the primary estimates, over 1,000 tractors transport sugarcane in the district daily during the crushing season,” Giri said. She further said that the tractors or the bullock carts are parked along the roadside as they cannot be taken into interiors most of the time. During the night hours, the rush of vehicles continues along the National Highway 48. At times, the overloaded trolleys get overturned in the middle of the roads and cause obstruction. In such cases, lack of reflectors causes major fatal accidents, Giri said. “To make more trips and earn more money, the transporters speed up the vehicles. The drivers are also fined if they drive under the influence of liquor and play loud music,” said Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vehicles-carrying-sugarcane-without-reflectors-being-fined/articleshow/87805899.cms||---
---||Delhi||Jeet, Jalebi And Joy After A Year Of Agitation||Ghaziabad: The modest bunch of protesters holding fort at UP Gate (Ghazipur border) had nothing special planned on Friday. Dull as the November sky, it was to be another eventless day for the vanguard with their heels and tents dug in as the battle of attrition with the Centre moved towards an important landmark – a week from now, the protest against the three new farm laws on Delhi’s borders will turn a year old. Then, the mobile phones started ringing. One of the first to get the morning’s biggest “breaking news” was Bijender Singh, a farmer from UP’s Ghazipur district who was in his tent, yet to start his day. At the other end, his son was screeching. “Krishi kanoon wapas le rahe hain (the farm laws are being repealed). Modi ne announce kiya (Modi has announced),” he told a stunned Singh. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” Singh told TOI. “I cross-checked and when I was convinced that what my son was saying was true, I rushed out to inform others.” Soon after, the celebrations began. The sizzle ofjalebis in the langar, a round of crackers, a group dance, bellows of triumph and excited phone calls to family followed. Some drove along the protest site loudspeakers blazing till the border where they were stopped and turned back by Delhi Police. “This too will go soon,” yelled a protester, pointing at the barricades. Through the nippy air and the acrid overhang of smog, the warm breeze of victory that swept into UP Gate on Friday when the PM announced that the farm laws would be repealed was lapped up by just 150-odd tired but beaming faces. With none of the farmer leaders around, the moment belonged to the footsoldiers. By afternoon, many of them were on national media, their faces lighting up newscasts on mobile screens as journalists outnumbered protesters at UP Gate. “Jeet” was the word on everyone’s lips, but this was a bittersweet win, achieved through sacrifice and months of struggle through the turn of seasons, moods, opinions and politics Balwant Singh, a farmer from Shahjahanpur, said, “We will stay put at UP Gate till the time laws are repealed by Parliament because we can’t trust it will happen till then.” “A lot has gone into making this year-long protest a success. I remember the day Kashmir Singh from Bilaspur committed suicide at UP Gate (Jan 2). It shook me and others, but we remained determined and succeeded at last,” said Manjeet Singh Atwal, a farmer from Uttarakhand. Others said a law on MSP and compensation forfamilies of farmers who died during the agitation remained unfulfilled demands that the Centre needed to respond to. Speaking to TOI over the phone, BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, “The battle is half won. Apart from the repeal of the farm laws, we also want a guarantee on MSP. The agitation has seen so many farmers losing their lives at the protest sites in the past year and we demand that their families get compensation.” At the protest site, though, several farmers were relieved they could go back to their families, and not empty handed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jeet-jalebi-and-joy-after-a-year-of-agitation/articleshow/87807413.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Tribal school in Thiruvananthapuram facing threat of wild animal attacks||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The life of children studying at Thalathoothakaavu tribal school in the district continues to be in misery due to the threat from wild animals. The students have been facing the threat from wild animals, including bison, elephants and wild boar for many years. Recently the wild elephants destroyed the trees which are too close to the school building. Around 28 tribal students from eleven tribal settlement areas are studying here. The herd of elephants was spotted on Wednesday by PTA committee members Mahesh and Suresh who live near the school. They saw the elephants near the school around early morning. The herd has destroyed most of the trees in the compound. “The elephant has destroyed the coconut trees in the compound. It is sure that the herd will come again for the coconuts. We have been trying to build the compound wall around the school, but the forest range office has denied our request. We are planning to talk to the Palode range office authorities again, if they are not ready to grant the permission, then we would surely stage a protest in front of the office,” said Jain P, a teacher of Thalathoothakaavu tribal school. “The students are not safe in this compound. The parents are really scared to send their children to school,” said Asharaf M, the headmaster of the school. The school had even suspended classes due to the disturbances by these wild animals. The forest department have denied the permission for the compound wall saying that the school authorities failed to produce the required documents. The demand was put forward by the PTA committee members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tribal-school-facing-threat-of-wild-animal-attacks/articleshow/87787449.cms||---
---||Pune||Private sites in Pune sitting on 21 lakh doses, Mumbai close second||PUNE: Vaccination slow down has hit the private hospitals in Pune and Mumbai the most, with stocks at these sites increasing to 21 lakh doses in Pune alone, followed by Mumbai (20 lakh) — both of which form a lion’s share among nearly 54 lakh doses available with the private centres across Maharashtra. Nashik, Thane, Palghar, Satara and Raigad (in that order) are other districts where private sites are now left with considerable number of doses and few takers. A bulk of the stock is that of Covishield. Maharashtra’s additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI, “There are no plans to use private hospital doses as there is sufficient stock available with the state government.” Private hospitals said it has now become a matter of worry for them as weekdays hardly see any beneficiaries approaching them for inoculation. Dr Madhav Chavan, managing director - Phoenix Hospital, told TOI, “There are days when the authorities cannot open a single vial as they don’t even get 10 beneficiaries for vaccination. We have 4,000 Covishield doses lying unused with us, while some others have 8,000-plus. We are in a dilemma, and fear that our Covishield stocks may not be utilised completely, especially if mix and match doses for booster shots are approved.” He said stocks with private sites were now double of what they were in October. “One of the ways to deal with this situation is that vaccine manufacturers could buy the unused stock back from us and supply it to government sites. Even corporates are not coming forward as many of their employees are already vaccinated and the ones left out are getting the doses for free from government sites,” he said. Hospitals in Pune are now considering approaching corporates (to sell off their stock to the latter under their CSR funds) for the under privileged at a no-profit, no-loss basis to reach a break-even point. Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, which has three private vaccination sites said, “After suitable permission from the government, corporates could procure the excess vaccine doses from us at the cost price, under their CSR funds. We could then go to remote areas to administer the excess vaccine doses to the poor or tribal population without any additional cost.” The three Symbiosis private sites have an excess stock of nearly 20,000-plus doses. Dr Prince Surana, chief executive of Mumbai’s Surana Group of Hospitals, told TOI, “We started using the vaccine doses under corporate CSR funding a month ago at the cost price of Rs 600 per dose. We had realised very early that demand for paid jabs was plummeting and thus opted for this. We are currently left with 25,000-odd doses to be used as a part of the CSR activity, hence no dose is likely to go waste. However, many hospitals have hit the panic button as in a month or two, there might not be many people to inoculate. Hospitals left with huge quantities are therefore now trying to liquidate the stocks.” Dr Suman Singh Rawat, medical administrator at Sanjeevani Hospital in Mumbai, said the hospital has close to 7,000 doses, with the hospital administering just 25-odd doses per day lately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-sites-in-pune-sitting-on-21l-doses-mumbai-close-second/articleshow/87807051.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nagpur||Falling cotton, soya prices, not farm laws, worry Vidarbha farmers||NAGPUR: Amid the hype over scrapping of the three controversial farm laws, farmers in Vidarbha remained rather indifferent as it was also during the protests in Delhi. The reaction in rural Vidarbha remained low even as a group of members from the Sikh community in Nagpur were rejoicing over the decision. Here, the farmers are concerned about prices of cotton and soyabean — the two main crops of the region. They are worried that the textile and poultry industry lobbies may soon succeed in bringing down rates of the two crops. While cotton is used for making yarn, soyabean is also a raw material for chicken feed. The prices of cotton, which had touched an all-time high crossing Rs8,500 a quintal, have now come down to the range of Rs7,500 to Rs8,000 a quintal. Soyabean rates too crashed from all-time high of over Rs10,000 a quintal, now settling at Rs5,600 to Rs5,700 for the better grade. After over a decade, rates of the two crops had reached a level that the farmers had always hoped for. Gajanan Sindadwar at Yavatmal-Telangana border said that cotton rates had fallen by Rs900 touching Rs7,500 quintal. Soyabean was at Rs5,000 quintal and hoped it should be at least Rs6,000. Former MP and Swabhimani Paksha leader Raju Shetti has already initiated an agitation seeking intervention to improve rates of soyabean. In Maharashtra, sale of farm produce is already allowed outside agriculture produce marketing committee’s (APMC) yards. The state also allows contract farming. “There was little impact of the whole issue on the farmers here. In Maharashtra any one can get a licence and even purchase farm produce out of the APMC areas. Buying fresh vegetables doesn’t even need a licence,” said Sudhir Kothari, chairman of APMC at Hinganghat in Wardha district. Ganesh Nanote, a cotton grower from Akola, said that the textile industry and poultry lobby are already making representations demanding measure to reduce prices of cotton and soyabean. The farmers are at a loss due to low yield of cotton. Nitin Khadse from Yavatmal said that his primary concern was the low cotton yield. Shetti’s party will be continuing the agitation over soyabean prices. “Going against the very spirit of Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, the Centre imposed stock limit on soyabean. This led to a crash in rates of the produce, he said. “We are also demanding a law making purchase at MSP mandatory. Even if the MSP is declared for a number of crops, farmers have to even settle at rates lower than that. It should be made mandatory for even private traders to buy at MSP,” he said. Kishore Tiwari, the chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavlamban Mision, said the farmers crisis in Vidarbha has different dynamics. “The farm laws have already been eased in the state but it has made a little impact on farmers’ earnings,” he said. On the other hand, consumer activist Shahid Sharif said repealing the Essential Commodiies (Amendment) Act will help in keeping the prices under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/falling-cotton-soya-prices-not-farm-laws-worry-vid-farmers/articleshow/87807404.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Pune||Only 48% beneficiaries in 45-plus age group fully vaccinated in Maharashtra||PUNE: The state public health officials are yet to achieve 100% first dose vaccination of the 45-plus population in Maharashtra — one of the crucial measures to reduce hospitalisation and deaths in case there is a third wave of Covid-19. Nearly 21 districts have so far registered below 80% coverage of the first dose. Only a handful of districts have managed to fully vaccinate 70% of the population in this age group though it was the focus of the inoculation drive. The state’s average first dose coverage in this group was 80% and it was 48% for the second shot till November 16. The state health officials stated that there would be special focus on ensuring that the entire population in this age group was administered at least the first dose by November 30 in all the districts. The earlier deadline set by the state health department to vaccinate the vulnerable group was October-end. “With the Har Ghar Dastak programme, we want to ensure that there is maximum coverage of this age group. We want the local authorities to make extra efforts to complete the vaccination of the 45-plus population at the earliest,” said a senior official of the state public health department. The Union health ministry and WHO have been continuously iterating the importance of immunizing the 45-plus population because the severity of the disease and deaths were higher in this age group. The Covid task force members from the death audit committee also stated that maximum deaths in the state had occurred in the 45-plus age group. Still, many people in this category are yet to get even the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines. Only Sindhudurg has fully vaccinated 81% of its population in the 45-plus age group, closely followed by Mumbai and Kolhapur with 71%. The two-dose coverage in almost all other districts is below 70%. Hingoli and Aurangabad are at the rock bottom with 31% coverage. Hingoli, Nanded, Palghar, Nandurbar and Aurangabad remained in the red for poor first dose vaccination. All these districts have registered below 65% first dose coverage and for the second dose it was in the range of 30-39%. The Covid task force members cautioned that vulnerable groups cannot be left out from the vaccination drive at any cost. “The local authorities should prepare an age-wise list and ensure under the door-to-door vaccination programme that those yet to be vaccinated visited the near-to-home inoculation centre at the earliest,” said a state health official. The local authorities were earlier told to prepare a detailed list of the beneficiaries left out in all age groups with the help of the electoral rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-48-beneficiaries-in-45-plus-age-group-fully-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/87807056.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Rash with itching in focus as chikungunya cases rise in Pune||PUNE: Rash all over the body with itching as well as redness over face and joints were prominently being seen among chikungunya patients in the city, besides fever and weakness, treating doctors said. More patients have been testing positive for chikungunya, along with dengue, over the past few days. “I have been seeing more cases of chikungunya than dengue in the last few days. Patients often present with prominent facial and joint redness. The proportion or percentage of chikungunya cases to dengue is 60:40 now, which was earlier 20:80,” said general practitioner and family physician Santaji Kadam. The redness in dengue-infected patients is often uniform. “But in chikungunya, it is more prominently seen on the patient’s face and joints, mainly shoulder, knee, and finger joints,” Kadam said. The early symptoms of chikungunya include fever, headache and joint pain (arthralgias). The knees, elbows, wrists, ankles, and/or fingers are generally affected. Joint pain increases with movement and is worse in the morning. It may take many weeks before the symptoms improve. “Besides these symptoms, I am seeing more patients presenting with rash all over the body with itching, usually on the fourth and the fifth day from the onset of illness. The rash is also a symptom in dengue but in chikungunya it is usually all over the body with itching,” said family physician Mahesh Wayal. Wayal underlined that the chikungunya cases had surged significantly over the last 10 days. “I do see dengue cases even now. But compared with the last month, when dengue cases were seen in 90% of the patients and chikungunya in 10%, the number has surged considerably now. I see chikungunya cases in about 40% of the cases of mosquito-borne illness now.” Experts said chikungunya was mostly clinically diagnosed by doctors based on a patient’s symptoms as fatal complications in chikungunya were considered a rarity. “It often happens that a patient is prescribed symptomatic treatment without being subjected to any diagnostic tests. This is one of the reasons why many chikungunya cases often go unreported,” said senior family physician Avinash Bhondwe, dean (elect) of Indian Medical Association's College of General Practitioners and past president of IMA, Maharashtra. Experts stressed on physical activity and early rehab to get over the joint pains that patients have to bear for a long period after full recovery from chikungunya. “Patients often get well within 15 days. But joint pains last for months. Hence, initiating early rehab under doctor’s supervision is the key,” said senior physician Narendra Javadekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rash-with-itching-in-focus-as-chikungunya-cases-rise/articleshow/87807064.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Though night safari was started in Palsasgaon two years ago, in Khadsangi it was launched on November 5. In the last few days, there were protests by green activists from Chimur led by Kawdu Lohkare. “After opening huge forest area for a day-long safari through 14 gates in the buffer zone, why night tourism should be pursued putting nocturnal animals in distress. As it is, there is no response,” said Lohkare. “Night patrolling by vehicle is meaningless because one can view the light from 5km and hear the sound of vehicles from the same distance. No poacher or wildlife criminal can be nabbed,” said Lohkare. “Vehicular movement with torches has been prohibited because as per wildlife science, eyesight gets reduced and affects animals’ natural movement, habits, modus operendi, behavior, and its biology. It also induces pettism,” remarked Uday Patel, honorary wildlife warden of Gadchiroli. Talking to TOI, deputy conservator (buffer) G Guruprasad said, “It is basically not night safari but night patrolling through forest roads along with the villages and farms. In Khadsangi we have a 30km to and fro route. This patrolling will deter wildlife criminals.” However, Suresh Chopne, founder president of Green Planet Society says, “Any form of night tourism is unacceptable. The forest officials should put conservation at the top and not commercial gains. Neither permission has been taken from National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) nor the statutory Local Advisory Committee (LAC). Besides, the TATR’s Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) also makes no mention of night safari. The park is charging money from tourists and hence it is basically night tourism under the garb of night patrolling.” Patel says, “Night tourism will increase human-tiger-wildlife conflicts as the animals would be exposed to light which they generally avoid. Ask any expert they will always opine against such unnatural haphazard form of tourism in the name of providing jobs to locals. Does it make sense at the cost of wildlife?” “It is a non-sustainability process and seems to be driven by the resort lobby where a maximum number of gates matches the number of resorts. As per guidelines, there should minimum disturbance and exposure to wildlife,” says Patel. Earlier, such experiments were undertaken in Gorewada, Nagalwadi (Pench), and Narnala (Melghat) but have met with poor response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-no-to-night-tourism-in-tadoba-buffer/articleshow/87807408.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Vomiting after any head injury is dangerous even in youth: Doctors||NAGPUR: The unfortunate incident in which a young boy from the city lost his life due to brain hemorrhage on November 17 once again trigerred discussions on the serious issue of brain injury at a young age. The boy had a fall from his bike on November 14 and had episodes of vomiting in the evening. He had visited local doctors but as he was not having any serious symptoms, he avoided going to the hospital and having a CT scan. The boy had his dinner and went to sleep. Next morning, when his grandfather tried to wake him up, he did not respond. In spite of 3 days’ treatment, his condition deteriorated and doctors declared him brain dead on November 17. Neurologists and neurosurgeons told TOI that injury can happen at any age and there is no point in neglecting the falls due to sudden dizziness, followed by vomiting etc. “Injury can be of different types. Even if you feel good and recover after the fall, it could be a kind of internal injury. One should not take head injury lightly at any age or at any circumstances,” said neurosurgeon Dr Nilesh Agrawal. Early intervention and check-up in a hospital with good facilities can detect the nature of injury in the ‘golden period’ and life can be saved. According to interventional neurologist Dr Amit Bhatti, time is of the essence in the treatment of brain injury. “In case a stroke occurs due to a clot, about 1.9 million neurons die every minute until medication or interventional neurological procedures clears the clot that’s blocking or reducing blood flow to the affected brain area. The sooner you get to the hospital the better,” said Dr Bhatti. He further said that in stroke-ready hospitals, one can undergo MRI or CT scan which creates a picture of the brain to look for physical evidence of internal bleeding or stroke. “An angiogram looks for blood vessel abnormalities,” said Dr Bhatti. Doctors said even blood tests can detect signs of infection and clotting abnormalities. Neurosurgeon Dr Ninad Shrikhande said that any symptoms post head injury or fall should never be avoided. “Sometimes, symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke present slowly and steadily worsen over time. Early visit to specialized clinic can be the best remedy. Symptoms like spinning sensation, mild confusion, nausea or vomiting, temporary ringing in the ears should be taken seriously,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vomiting-after-any-head-injury-is-dangerous-even-in-youth-docs/articleshow/87807411.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Rs 25 lakh lottery bait leads to loss of Rs 45 lakh||PUNE: A 34-year-old man fell hook, line, and sinker for a Rs 25 lakh lottery scam and ended up losing nearly twice as much money to fraudsters. In his desperation to bag the lottery, regarding which he had received a text message, the man broke his late father’s fixed deposits, borrowed money from relatives and made 30 bank transfers totalling Rs46.35 lakh to15 accounts between May and August before he realised he had been taken for a very expensive ride. The Bibvewadi police said the victim, a resident of Indiranagar, works as a deewanji (traditional accounts employee) with a prominent vegetable merchant at Market Yard. He filed a complaint with the cyber police and an FIR was registered on Wednesday. Senior inspector Sunil Zavare said the complainant received an SMS on May 22 claiming that his mobile number was selected for a Rs22 lakh lottery. The man contacted the phone numbers mentioned in the SMS. “The suspect(s) asked him to pay different ‘taxes and fees’ to get the lottery. He ended up paying Rs46.35 lakh between May and August,” Zavare said. The complainant told TOI on Thursday, “I continued to make the money transfers in the hope that the caller(s) would deliver on their promise. I wanted the money as I thought it would make my life easier.” Zavare said, “The complainant’s father, a retired police constable, died a few years ago. He kept some fixed deposits, all of which the complainant broke. He also borrowed money from his friends and family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-25l-lottery-bait-leads-to-loss-of-rs-45-lakh/articleshow/87787461.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Pune||Increased under-reporting of AEFI events a worry: Experts||Pune: Public health experts have observed an increasing trend of under-reporting of Adverse Event Following Immunisation events in all states. Virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI that the system of reporting the incidents of Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) continued to be faulty 11 months after the vaccination drive teed off in India. “Transparency on AEFI and clarity are the need or two legs for the vaccination campaign. The country has not devised a system to collect data with quality. The under-reporting is not merely quantitative, but also under-detected, undercounted and under-investigated AEFIs,” he said. The country has administered over 113 crore vaccine doses to the eligible population so far. The Union ministry of health stated that 1,868 serious adverse events were reported post-vaccination till October 25. Dr John felt that under-reporting of AEFI events would only increase vaccine hesitancy. He said there were only two ways. “First, the government clearly says it does not have the data to be transparent about AEFI. Second, the government gives out what it knows. When the second does not happen, the first is also a suspect,” he said. The health expert claimed that the country had not devised a system to collect data with quality and comprehensiveness on health events. “If we aspire to be a developed country, we must be able to develop a system. It is not difficult or very expensive. No government in the past or present has understood this as a necessity,” Dr John said, adding that AEFI was just one item in this black hole. Malini Aisola, the co-convener of the All India Drug Action Network, said the health ministry’s presentation to the National AEFI Committee noted a trend of decreasing AEFI events being reported while the vaccination drive was expanding. Officials from the Union health ministry said there were some delays in verification by local authorities. The health ministry instructed the officials concerned to scale up reporting of minor AEFIs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/increased-under-reporting-of-aefi-events-a-worry-experts/articleshow/87807072.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The neta claimed many truck drivers travelling between JNPT and Gujarat, Nashik opted for this route as the stretch was toll free, even though it was longer. He said this often led to traffic congestions on the route and also blamed the continuous heavy traffic for the frequent damage to the road.  The road was designed in 2000 to divert heavy vehicular traffic off the old Pune highway. The stretch has been popular with freight vehicles as the existing toll plaza on the route was removed few years back.

Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s finance minister, said the city recorded the lowest inflation rate for food prices in the country in the financial year 2020-21. Sisodia was releasing Annual Report of the Price Index for Delhi, prepared by the directorate of economics and statistics for 2020-21, which reveals that in the last fiscal, the increase in inflation in Delhi was 3%, while Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai and Bengaluru registered 4.6%, 4.4%, 4.1% and 4% hike, respectively. The finance minister said the data showed that the Delhi government efficiently managed to keep inflation under control in the national capital and, even during Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi recorded the lowest rate of inflation among the five metro cities in the country. While releasing the report, Sisodia said that in the financial year 2020-21, the rate of growth in average annual inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) was 5% nationally, while it was only 3% in Delhi. Sisodia also said that in the previous fiscal, the national inflation rate for food prices was 5.7%. On the other hand, in Delhi the rate was recorded at 4.1%, which, he said, was the lowest in the country. The housing index of the consumer price index saw an increase of 5.2% in the entire India in 2020-21, but it was only 3.9% in Delhi, the finance minister said. Sisodia also pointed out that the inflation rate increased sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic in the country and the prices of essential commodities increased. In Delhi, however, the rate of increase in inflation is much lower than that of the entire country even during this period, he said. The increase in inflation in Delhi was 2% less than the national figure, which saw an increase of 5%, Sisodia added. The deputy chief minister said that due to the timely measures adopted by the Arvind Kejriwal government, the prices of commodities in Delhi remained stable during this period and did not increase much. Sisodia said the Delhi government was constantly monitoring the prices of essential commodities and made efforts from time to time to control and stabilise the prices of commodities through market interventions. Sisodia further said that the Aam Aadmi Party government was committed to the common man and always stood with him. He said that the stable inflation rate even during the pandemic was a big relief for the people of Delhi at a time when the inflation rate had increased rapidly in the entire country. The finance minister said that the Delhi government did not allow an increase in inflation in the city during the pandemic period by taking different measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-inflation-lowest-among-metros/articleshow/87807419.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The airport area is a habitat for three packs of golden jackals and the foresters are working out a strategy to keep the animals away from the runway. Earlier, a plane was delayed in landing due to sighting of these animals on the runway by the pilot of Mumbai- Sindhudurg flight. Chief conservator of forests (Territorial) Clement Ben said, “The strategy is still in its planning stage. In the next two days, some concrete plan will be worked out to keep these animals away from the airport premises. The area is huge with wall fencing around its 275 acre premises. It, however, has heavy grasslands in the surroundings.” Ben added, “There are three packs of around 25 to 30 golden jackals having their habitat here. This area is not a recorded forest land, but now as these jackals have also been sighted on the runway, it’s a serious concern. I am in talks with the officers.” The senior forest officer said that there are plans for airport expansion as well with the airport authority and hence, they have to act fast about translocating the jackals. “Tranquilising or dotting might be an issue. Instead, netting or trapping them would be a better option I feel. We are having word with experts and within 2-3 days, some concrete solution will be found out,” he added. Earlier, the Chipi airport was inaugurated amidst controversial presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Narayan Rane in October. The airport runs daily flights to and from Mumbai and is getting good response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/foresters-worried-as-jackals-seen-on-chipi-airport-runway/articleshow/87805921.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The incident occurred at Malakayal under Paravur police station limits in Kollam district on Wednesday morning. Sheeba of M S Bhavan, Malakayal, is the injured. Paravur police have arrested her husband Vijayakumar, 42, of Kurumandal near Paravur on charges of attempted murder. He was produced before the court on Thursday and remanded in judicial custody. According to the police, Sheeba, who worked in a private firm, was living separately from her husband for the past six months due to domestic violence. She had even filed a petition before the court accusing Vijayakumar of domestic abuse. He is a carpenter by profession. Even though her husband had made several attempts for reconciliation, Sheeba rejected his requests every time. On Wednesday, Vijayakumar waylaid her and attacked her while she was on her way to work on her scooter. When she reached around 500 meters away from her house, Vijayakumar, who was waiting for her, blocked her path and attacked her. Sheeba told the police officials that Vijayakumar, aimed his knife at her chest, but she blocked it using her left hand and sustained a serious injury below the elbow. He then pulled out the knife and stabbed her again on her knee before fleeing from the spot. Vijayakumar was soon caught by a police team led by Paravur station house officer inspector A Nizar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/domestic-abuse-victim-stabbed-by-husband/articleshow/87787463.cms||---
---||Pune||Successful liver transplant at taluka-level hospital offers hope||PUNE: Doctors successfully performed a cadaver liver transplant on a 54-year-old patient suffering from an end-stage liver condition at a private hospital in Karad in Satara district recently. “This is the country’s first liver transplant that was successfully carried out at a taluka-level hospital, which happens to be our branch in Karad. The procedure was carried out last month. The patient is doing well post surgery,” Sahyadri hospital’s head and senior neurosurgeon Charudutt Apte said. The taluka-level organ transplant centre in Karad is expected to bring much relief to the patients of Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri, and the surrounding areas. The patients will not need to travel to major cities for liver transplant services. The organ transplant centre can conduct liver, pancreas and kidney transplants, Apte said. The hospital’s liver transplant surgeon Bipin Vibhute said, “The 54-year-old patient, a resident of Ahmednagar, was the first one to undergo a liver transplant at Sahyadri Hospital’s Karad unit on October 14. He received the liver from a 52-year-old woman, who was declared brain-dead at a hospital in Kolhapur. The liver was brought in from Kolhapur to Karad in 25 minutes via a green corridor. Thereafter, it took four hours to complete the transplant surgery.” Liver-related problems are a growing concern in India. Not only alcohol, but wrong lifestyle choices, wrong diet, lack of exercise add to the risk. If neglected and not diagnosed and treated on time, they can cause further complications, a doctor said. “We have been conducting outreach programmes through liver OPDs in semi-urban areas and smaller cities. Many times tranpslant is the only option left in patients with end-stage liver disease or in patients with liver failure. Therefore, an organ transplant centre at taluka-level can reduce time and give a new lease of life to many,” Vibhute said. Venkatesh Mule, the chief manager of Sahyadri Super Specialty Hospital, Karad, said, “The diagnosis and surgical facilities under one roof give much relief to patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/successful-liver-transplant-at-taluka-level-hosp-offers-hope/articleshow/87807077.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Centre feared farm law backlash in UP, Punjab elections, says NCP chief||PUNE: Former Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday that the central government’s announcement repealing the three farm laws was spurred by the need to prevent a backlash in the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. Pawar, in a series of posts on a microblogging and social networking site, said, “It was good that farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Harayana participated in the protest. The farmers and the people in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab would have posed questions to the BJP’s candidates on farm laws during the elections. Fearing a backlash, the government decided to repeal the laws.” The NCP chief said that though the government’s decision came late, it was a wise decision. “I salute the farmers for their peaceful protest for one year. For the first time in the history of the country, the farmers had to protest for more than a year. The government should have listened to their demands and opted for a middle path to address their concerns through dialogue, but it took the extreme step of going ahead with the laws,” he added. “The government ignored the views of the opposition parties on the three farm bills. We told the parliament that the agriculture sector is the soul of the country. Thus, a discussion on the subject should have been taken, irrespective of political differences. However, the government did not pay heed to opposition views and passed the bills in haste,” Pawar added. Pawar reiterated that there was a discussion on reforms in farm laws when he was the agriculture minister. “But I am of the view that this kind of decision should not be taken at ministers’ meetings or in New Delhi. As per the Constitution, agriculture is a state subject. The Centre need to take the states into confidence along with farmers’ organisations and agriculture experts before going for any reforms in farm laws.” Senior state NCP leader and home minister Dilip Walse Pati said in a social media post, “Had the Prime Minister’s announcement come earlier, many lives of innocent farmers could have been saved. I pay tributes to the farmers who lost their lives in the struggle.” Another NCP leader and Shirur Member of Parliament Amol Kolhe said, “The announcement is a victory for farmers’ unity. The Union government might have taken the decision in view of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. However, it is a big thing for the affected farmers.” Prakash Ambedkar, president, Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi, said, in video and social media message, “Even though Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has said that the three agricultural laws have been repealed, the Supreme Court of India should still give its judgment on whether agriculture is a state subject or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-feared-farm-law-backlash-in-up-punjab-elections-says-ncp-chief/articleshow/87806596.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Govt must ensure minimum support price: Kisan Sabha||PUNE: All India Kisan Sabha’s state unit general secretary Ajit Navale said on Friday that the central government should now take an early decision on bringing in an enactment to ensure legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP) for various crops. He said the farmers who died in the struggle to get the three contentious laws repealed deserved a salute after the government’s announcement. “It’s a victory for more than 500 farmers’ organisations who fought collectively against these laws.” he added. Sachin Holkar, agriculture activist, said, “Today’s announcement proves that the farm laws were against farmers and hence the government had to repeal the laws. Now, the MSP is the most crucial thing for farmers. If farmers get guaranteed rates for crops, they won’t be dependent on the government. Often, farmers had to sell their harvest/ produce at very low cost due to the existing system of open auction in markets. This method is inappropriate and hence many farmers are economically poor.” Anil Ghanwat, a member of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to listen to the grievances of farmers relating to farm laws, termed the government’s announcement an “unfortunate step” for farmers. Ghanwat, who is also the president of the Shetkari Sanghatana, said, “The government surrendered eventually. Because of the old farm laws, the farmers were not getting any benefit and were driven to take extreme steps, like committing suicides. Our panel had addressed loopholes/drawbacks of the laws. However, without studying our recommendations, the laws will now be repealed. No party in power will ever dare to reform farm laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-must-ensure-minimum-support-price-kisan-sabha/articleshow/87806598.cms||Sandip Dighe

However, after Awade declined the offer, Patil approached Mahadevrao Mahadik to let his daughter-in-law Shoumika Mahadik contest elections.

---||Delhi||Repeal of farm laws: A victory for democracy, says Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday described the Centre’s decision to withdraw the three farm laws as a victory for democracy. He said the farmers were called terrorists, Khalistanis and anti-nationals, and all sorts of attempts were made to break their spirit, but they didn’t give up and fought like freedom fighters. A timely withdrawal of these laws could have saved the lives of 700 farmers martyred during the struggle, Kejriwal said at a press conference. “This day will be written with golden letters in the chronicles of Indian history, just like August 15 and January 26. The Centre had to finally bow in front of the farmers' tireless struggle and withdraw all the black laws. It is not only the victory of our farmers, but also of democracy,” the CM said. He said the farmers had proved that in a democracy, a government would always have to listen to the people. “Only and only the will of the people will rule. Be it any party or leader, your arrogance will not work in front of the public,” Kejriwal said. The AAP government had stood with the farmers right from the beginning, the CM said, adding that it had arranged for water, toilet and other facilities for the protesters when they arrived on Delhi borders. Kejriwal, meanwhile, postponed his visit to Punjab by two days to November 22 where AAP would celebrate the “victory”. The CM claimed that the “system” did its best to try and break the movement, but it could not succeed. “The water cannons dried up in front of the courage of the farmers. The laathis of the government were broken. All their tricks fell flat,” Kejriwal said. He said the death of over 700 farmers engaged in the movement pained him. “These deaths could have been avoided if the laws were rolled back earlier. Our brothers and sisters did not need to suffer in the cold, rain and the sun, sitting on the roads for so many months. I salute these martyrs, bow to their families,” Kejriwal said. The CM said that the country would never forget the sacrifices the farmers had made. “The victory of the farmers is a lesson for the children and the youth of our country that if we fight peacefully with the right intention, then success will be achieved, no matter how tough the fight,” he added. AAP MLAs, councillors, officebearers and workers joined the protesting farmers on the Singhu border to congratulate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-victory-for-democracy-says-kejriwal/articleshow/87807497.cms||AlokKNMishra

It would be the first session in the city in almost two years as it was cancelled last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to sources from the legislature offices, the forthcoming elections for six MLC seats in the state was one of the reasons as the code of conduct was already enforced and would stay till December 16. Another reason was time taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to recuperate from his neck injury after his recent operation. “We have discussed the issue in our cabinet meeting and it was decided to defer the session due to many factors. Earlier, the dates were proposed in December third or fourth week, but after realising that those clashed with holiday season, it was decided to defer it till next month. However, the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) would take a final call in this regard during its meeting shortly,” guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI. State water resources minister Jayant Patil said that the winter session would be held in Nagpur only, but it would not start on December 7 as proposed earlier. “Since, the CM is recuperating and would take time, it was decided in the cabinet to postpone the session. The BAC would be apprised of this development and it would take a final decision on new dates,” he told TOI. Earlier, the session was scheduled in the city from December 7 to 17 and legislature’s principal secretary Rajendra Bhagwat had also conducted a meeting with top officials including divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Varma, collector R Vimala and others last month for its preparations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/winter-assembly-session-may-be-deferred-till-jan/articleshow/87807416.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Hadapsar resident Garad was part of a group of Kamble’s aides who had gone to the civic ward office around on Wednesday to inquire about the delay in completion of drainage and concrete work in the area.

The contractor and his men then reached the ward office and questioned Garad’s locus-standi in the matter before abusing and assaulting him, police said. The Wanowrie police have registered a case under various sections of the IPC. The TOI on Thursday afternoon called the contractor but his phone was switched off. Corporator Kamble told TOI, “The contractor is expected to do the work within the timeframe since he has bagged the tender.

City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said on Friday, that the currency notes were seized when the accused were attempting to transport them in an SUV in the city. The accused are Zubair Hammabba,52, Abdul Nasir,40, and Deepak Kumar,32, who are residents of Mangaluru. While Zubair and Abdul are drivers, Deepak assists his father, who is an electrical contractor. The vehicle used for the crime has been seized. Preliminary investigation revealed that the accused had procured the notes from a person near Shivamogga and Chitradurga districts. They had reportedly approached some people in the city, offering these notes at 20% of their face value. They claimed that banks would accept such notes at 50% of the face value under a special provision. Clarifying that demonetised currency notes have no value, the top cop requested the public not to fall prey to such claims. The accused have been booked under IPC Section 420 and various provisions of Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act-2017. The accused will be produced before a court, and the police will seek their custody for further investigation. “We need to track the source of demonetised currency notes, and to whom they tried to supply the same,” the commissioner said.

From 60 in 2014, the number of women who have joined Telangana Rifle Association (TRA) and National Rifle Association (NRA) is now around 150. Women students and professionals and housewives have now picked up the gun for a shot at gold and glory. Many of them can be seen hard at work at the Sports Authority of Telangana State (SATS) shooting range in HCU campus at Gachibowli. “There are 150 women shooters. It was 60 in 2014. This range was constructed in 2002 and it now needs to be upgraded,” Telangana Rifle Association general secretary J Kiran said. While SATS coach Sandeep Varanasi said that the number of women coming into the sport has seen a spurt in the last three years alone in a couple of categories. “Overall, shooters’ numbers tripled in the last three years, both in 10 metre and 50 metre shooting. International players also practise here. We are hoping to win medals in Nationals in the 50 metre and 10 metre range. Most of these shooters spend extra hours here before competitions, keeping aside their work,” Varanasi said. In the upcoming competitions at least 15 women shooters were likely to take part, he said. Among shooters at the range is VVS Kiran, an interior designer who left her job and took up shooting. “In 2019, I started shooting after enrolling as TRA member. I have participated in pre-nationals and now practice for nationals,” she said. She added, “I also started my own firm. More women are into 10 metre shooting. This sport is for everyone.” While Agastya Sai Kumar, an architecture student, said: “One can’t become an Olympian overnight. There is a lot of process that goes into it.” Many women cops and forest officials also practise at the shooting range for competitions. Prasanna Kumar, inspector (IT and communication) of Rachakonda commissionarate and a certified International Shooting Sports Federation coach, said: Women cops come here too. Shooting requires less physical endurance, but it’s a sport that requires more psychological fitness.

The court also sentenced Chavan to 10 years’ jail under Section 4 of the POCSO Act for sexual assault and to seven years and three years under Sections 376 and 363 of the Indian Penal Code for rape and abduction, respectively. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the court said. Chavan is lodged in the Yerawada jail ever since his arrest on January 28, 2016. The court said that he shall be given a set off against the main sentence for the period served so far in jail. Additional public prosecutor Leena Pathak, who examined nine witnesses, including the girl who was the star witness, told TOI, “On January 25, 2016, the girl had called her boyfriend near her high school to take her along with him for marriage, fearing that her family won’t agree with the same. Her boyfriend reached the spot along with Chavan and together they went to her boyfriend’s home. Her boyfriend told her that their marriage won’t happen under the circumstances and she should return home.” “Chavan then offered to drop the girl home on his bike, but instead took her to an isolated place on a hillock and committed the first sexual assault. He put fear in the girl’s mind that her parents would beat her if she went home and she should instead marry him. He then took the girl to a relative’s place where he again committed another sexual assault,” the prosecutor said. Pathak said, “The evidence recorded by the girl, besides the statements under Section 164 CrPC recorded by three witnesses, medical and chemical analysis reports proved crucial in the conviction of the accused. The defence had claimed consensual physical relationship, but the court upheld our argument that a minor’s consent is immaterial in such cases.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-gets-20-years-in-jail-for-kidnap-rape-of-minor-girl/articleshow/87806601.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Delhi||Delhi court junks plea in 1984 riots case: ‘No proof son existed’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed an 80-year-old man’s plea seeking a declaration of his son’s death, allegedly killed during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saying he has produced no document to prove that his son even existed. The court said it is a matter of common and legal sense that only a person known to have existed in the first place can be declared dead. The man had approached the court seeking declaration of civil death of his son Ajit Singh and procuring/issuance of a death certificate from the office of the concerned registrar of births and deaths. “Needless to say, before seeking a declaration that a person is dead, plaintiff had the onus to prove the existence of Ajit Singh, who is the ‘person’ sought to be declared dead. On the contrary, despite a query by the court during final arguments, the plaintiff did not bring on record any ID proof of Ajit Singh nor any document which could reasonably satisfy the court about his identity and existence,” Civil Judge Helly Fur Kaur said in an order on Thursday. The court noted that it was an admitted fact that no missing report was available with the man since the police allegedly refused to register the same. The one lodged with Delhi administration was misplaced. According to the suit filed by the man, his son allegedly went missing during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and his efforts to trace him failed. He submitted that it is trite law that a person who has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of if he had been alive should be presumed dead. The suit said it was incumbent to submit here that the plaintiff’s son had not been heard by anyone among the family/relatives/ friends since the riots, so his son was presumed and declared dead. It further said that in any event, for issuance of a death certificate and for seeking compensation, the plaintiff needs to obtain a declaration of civil death of his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-junks-plea-in-1984-riots-case-no-proof-son-existed/articleshow/87807455.cms||---

The jeweller filed a complaint with the Chinchwad police on November 12. An officer from the Chinchwad police told TOI that around 4pm on November 11, the shop’s accountant sent a screenshot of the customer’s payment to the complainant. “The customer had purchased a gold coin worth Rs25,000 and he showed a screenshot of the payment. When the complainant checked his bank account, he found that the amount had not been credited,” the officer said. The officer said the screenshot of the payment had the name of the jewellery shop, but the transaction ID was fake. An officer from the cybercrime cell said a racket of fraudsters was operating in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and duping shop owners. They first take a photograph of the QR code from the shop and select an item, which they want to purchase. After scanning the code, they get the details of the account and subsequently create a fake screenshot of the payment. A pharmacist from Kothrud, Yogesh Nankar, said, “Customers have duped me at least thrice till date, by showing fake screenshots of payments. As I was busy at the time, I believed them and allowed them to go. Later, I found out that the amounts were not transferred to my account.” He added, “Since then, I have started taking precautions during the payment process. I equest the customers to wait the till I get a payment message from the bank.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conman-dupes-jeweller-of-rs-25k-with-fake-screenshot/articleshow/87787504.cms||---

None of the 119 corporators in the 122-member house have returned the oxygen cylinders given to them despite getting reminders from the corporation. Each corporator was given five oxygen cylinders. The NMC polls are expected to be held early next year and any sitting corporator, who wants to contest the election, has to take the certificate from the civic body informing the election authorities that they do not have any liability with the NMC. Nashik mayor Satish Kulkarni also said that the corporators should return the concentrators and he would take steps in the direction in next couple of days. “Most of our members are new in the house this time. There is no intention to keep the concentrators at home. I will ask each of the member to return the same,” he said. The NMC had procured 1,200 oxygen concentrators, some of which were distributed among the corporators so that they could provide the same to the citizens who needed them most. “Since it is the civic property, the members should have returned them to the corporation. But that has not happened so far,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent, NMC. Dr Nagargoje said that the oxygen concentrators turned out to be an important resource for some of those who required only oxygen and there was a shortage of beds in hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/return-o2-concentrators-or-no-noc-for-polls-civic-chief-tells-corporators/articleshow/87805973.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||BJP trying to destabilize MVA by hook or by crook: Sharad Pawar||CHANDRAPUR: NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the BJP leadership at the Centre was frustrated for not having a state like Maharashtra in its hand. Replying to a query about repeated cases being filed by central government agencies against the ministers and leaders in MVA government, Pawar said the senior BJP cadre was trying to destabilize the Maharashtra government “by hook or by crook”. Addressing a press conference in Chandrapur, the NCP neta said, “Soon after the MVA government was formed, BJP leaders had started predicting that this government will not survive for long. However, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has given a stable government for two years, which has irked the central leadership of BJP.” He claimed that similar tactics were being employed in non-BJP states like West Bengal and Kerala to destabilize the governments there. “The cards are being moved at the highest level. However, they should remember that history will have mention of the people abusing power,” Pawar said. He added that the “dirty tactics” of BJP to destabilize the government had instead brought the constituent parties of MVA together and steadfast in their resolve. On the Vidarbha statehood agitation, Pawar said the party is not against the movement in the name of the region’s development. However, there were differences in opinion about keeping the state together. “Our stand is that if there is a need of keeping Marathi-speaking people together, then their unity should be maintained,” he said. The senior NCP neta was accompanied by party leader Praful Patel, minister of state Prajakt Tanpure, district NCP president Raju Vaidya, OBC leader Ashok Jiwtode and district women president Baby Uike in the press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-trying-to-destabilize-mva-by-hook-or-by-crook-pawar/articleshow/87807460.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Mumbai||Western Railway plans to set up terminus at Mumbai's Jogeshwari||MUMBAI: The Western Railway has sent a proposal to the ministry to set up a terminus at Jogeshwari, primarily to operate Tejas class trains and privately operated trains. Indian Railway’s almost all long-distance trains run with locomotives. If platforms have a dead-end, a locomotive has to be attached at the rear end of the train to pull the coaches out of the platform once all the passengers deboard. A senior Western Railway official said, “We plan to run Tejas class types which are like suburban trains that can be operated from both ends of the rakes and there will be no need to attach locomotives to pull in and pull out a train from platform. Railways is planning to run private trains and hence a proposal has been sent to the Railway Board for operating trains from Jogeshwari.” In Mumbai, WR operates long-distance train services from BDTS, Mumbai Central and Dadar but these have now become saturated. A senior official said, “At present, there is a goods shed that handles freight traffic like cement and even food grains. Without disturbing freight operations, Jogeshwari can be upgraded into a terminus at a cost of Rs 70 crore.” The plan is to have an island platform that will allow handling of two trains simultaneously. Also, there will be one stabling line. Another senior official said, “We will await directions from the Railway Board when it comes to deciding which trains to be operated from Jogeshwari.” The terminus will come up on the east side of the tracks –between Ram Mandir and Jogeshwari suburban stations..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-plans-to-set-up-terminus-at-jogeshwari/articleshow/87808849.cms||Manthank Mehta

On November 17, the state average of vaccination of the first dose is over 76% and it is nearly 39% for the second dose. The vaccination in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts is significantly lower than it. In fact, Nandurbar is ranked at the bottom in the state. Nandurbar’s district health officer Dr Mahendra Chavan said they were hoping that vaccine coverage improves with the door-to-door drive. “We are aiming to vaccinate 70% of the beneficiaries with at least the first dose by this month-end,” he added. The health authorities from the region have blamed ‘vaccine hesitancy’ for the low coverage. In Nashik city, the health department officials said that beneficiaries of some pockets are still not keen to take the vaccine. In Nashik district, a sizeable population of Malegaon is yet to take their first dose. Covid-19 coordinator of Dhule, Dr Vishal Patil, said that people are not forthcoming to take their shots as the cases have reduced and things are back to normal. Jalgaon civil surgeon Dr N S Chavan said even they have started a door-to-door vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-hesitancy-hinders-coverage-in-n-maha/articleshow/87805995.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Dehradun||Gur mixes with ragini songs, but celebrations muted||Meerut/Muzaffarnagar/Agra: Farmers in parts of western Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand burst into a moment of joy in their villages and towns following PM Narendra Modi's decision to take back the three farm laws. Jaggery and laddus were passed around as ragini songs rang out around tractors and people danced to the beats of drums. But after months of protest, fatigue had sent it, lives were lost and disrupted. Celebrations at many places were muted. While Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Naresh Tikait welcomed the Centre's decision and demanded a law on MSP, several farmers of the region were cautious. "It took a year for the government to tell us this. Farmers suffered a lot and they didn't deserve this kind of treatment," said Manveer Huda, a farmer in Shamli. Another farmer, Naveen Pradhan, from Meerut, said, "A huge burden is off the shoulders of farmers. But they paid a heavy price to achieve this. We've sacrificed hundreds of our brethren during the year-long agitation. The government should not try to take credit for this so-called 'benevolence'. It was their mistake and they had to rectify it." Rakesh Dhankad, also from Meerut, said that the farmer's stature has now increased. "This decision was taken out of electoral compulsion," he quipped. "People know our worth." There was recognition, too, of the importance of Friday's announcement. BKU's Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar said, “We welcome the decision. On Guru Nanak Dev ji's birthday, we are now on the threshold of victory -- of truth and patience." Joining Parihar in celebration, BKU Agra district president Rajveer Lawaniya thanked everyone who supported the movement. In Agra, many also said that the PM should provide monetary help to the families of those who died during the agitation. Kin at the Kasganj house of Lakhvinder Singh, 60, who fell ill near the Ghazipur border and died soon after on January 22, were still in mourning. Tributes were paid to the ex-block development council member at the local gurdwara on Friday. His brother Satnam Singh said, “Over 700 farmers, including my brother, lost their lives. The PM did not utter a word in their memory.” Farmers of the Terai region, also known as the 'rice bowl of Uttarakhand', were elated. They assembled in Jaspur, Kashipur, Gadarpur, Rudrapur, Kichha, Nanakmatta, Sitarganj and Khatima towns to distribute sweets and burst crackers. "It is a huge relief for people of the Terai. It's a win for farmers and labourers," said Tejender Singh Virk, who was critically injured in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 and is still undergoing treatment. Gulshan Rod, head of Uttarakhand Kisan Morcha, said "it is a historical day for not just farmers but the entire nation. But trust in the government has been hit, of course".

Although police remain tight-lipped about the development, sources confirmed that a man was taken into custody and is being questioned. The suspect was picked up from Krishna Nagar and is reportedly associated with the film industry. Police are probing whether the suspect was involved in similar offences in the past. In February 2021, a similar offence took place at KBR park, when there was an attempt to rob a woman, who had also sustained injuries during the robbery attempt. The offence took place at the same place where the actress was robbed. “We suspect the person in our custody has committed similar crimes in the past. We are trying to ascertain the facts before we come to a conclusion,” sources at Banjara Hills police station said. Recently, the actress had told reporters that despite she offering to transfer ₹10,000 to the accused’s ewallet, the accused did not accept the money and sought valuables from her. In the complaint lodged by the victim in February, there has been no breakthrough so far. Police have beefed up security in and around KBR park after the latest incident. On Sunday night, when the actress was walking in the park, an unidentified man came from behind and gagged her mouth with a cloth. The victim managed to escape but the accused snatched her phone and fled from the spot. The actor called the police with the help of passers-by. Police have verified CCTV footage and the tower location of the actress’ mobile phone which was snatched by the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kbr-park-theft-accused-nabbed/articleshow/87807509.cms||---

The report, based on the audit of 1.5 lakh pieces of plastic by 1,000 volunteers from 19 states, also stated that some international and national brands had been consistently contributing to the plastic pollution at the national and local levels. It found that of the total audited plastic pieces, non-recyclable plastic made up 35% of all waste and the share of branded plastic was 40%. SWaCH Pune, along with Break Free From Plastic movement members, including those of CAG Chennai, Hasiru Dala, Zero Waste Himalaya, Paryavaran Mitra and Natures Buddy, conducted brand audits across the country. Brand audits are data-driven and citizen-led initiatives that document the plastic waste and identify the companies responsible for the pollution. These audits are conducted every year across the world by members of the Break Free From Plastic movement. Brand audits involve counting and documenting the brands and companies contributing to plastic waste. SWaCH project in-charge Lubna Anantakrishnan said, “The dominant narrative on plastic pollution has been crafted by plastic producers to focus on consumer behaviour, littering and waste management. These companies have continued to pump in more plastic. Low-value plastic is difficult to recycle into our communities. Through brand audits, we hope to correct the narrative and shift the focus back onto the producers. The problem with single-use plastics begins with oil extraction and extends to the chronic externalisation of life-cycle costs by producers.” Satyarupa Shekar, Asia Pacific coordinator of Break Free From Plastic, said, “Given that 99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels and that the fossil fuel corporations are actively shifting their focus to plastic as an increasing source of revenue, all of these companies are contributing significantly to both the climate and plastic pollution crisis.” When contacted on the issue of plastic pollution, Sanjiv Rangrass, group head of ITC Limited’s environment, health and safety, projects and life sciences and technology, told TOI, “We are holistically addressing the issue of plastic waste through running large-scale plastic waste collection programmes like the flagship initiative, ‘WOW – Well-Being Out of Waste’, as well as working towards ensuring that 100% of its packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable within the next decade. ITC is already ensuring that it collects and manages plastic waste that is in excess of the plastic packaging utilized in its operations. ITC is all set to go beyond plastic neutrality this financial year.” Though TOI contacted a senior official of city-based Chitale Group, he refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biggest-brands-maximum-plastic-polluters-reveals-swach-audit/articleshow/87787527.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

District Home Guard commandant Murali Mohan Choontharu said that the deceased is Santhosh Kumar Kateel,35, from Kateel. It is learnt that on Wednesday, at 4.30 pm, the victim spotted a group of eight children being attacked by poisonous insects at Mulki. He rushed to their rescue, and got bitten in the process. He even ensured that the children were examined at a primary health centre, and went back home at 7 pm, probably without seeing a doctor. He later suffered breathlessness and died, Choontharu said. His mortal remains were handed over to the family on Thursday afternoon, and the last rites were performed. Choontharu said that Santhosh joined as a Home Guard in 2017, and had served in the fire and police departments, and performed Covid-19 and bandobast duties. He is survived by his wife and three children. Senior officers from the police department and Home Guards have pooled in Rs 25,000 that will be handed over to his family. The Home Guard commandant will also write to the government for providing Rs 10,000 for immediate expenses. Meanwhile, tributes were offered at the Home Guard headquarters on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/home-guard-saves-children-from-poisonous-insects-dies/articleshow/87806004.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj administration identifies 28 pollution hotspots||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when pollution, be it through the smoke emitted by factories, vehicles and burning of stubble or for that matter due to dust and noise, is causing problems across the country, the Sangam city too has registered a significant increase in pollution levels. In view of the increasing pollution of dust, smoke and noise, 28 busy roads have been identified as the most affected and district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Khatri has officially termed them as “pollution hotspots”. These hotspots include Noorulla Road, Transport Nagar, Master Zahrul Hasan Marg, Shivram Das Gulati Marg, Muir Road-I, Muir Road-II, Kutchery Road, Lal Bahadur Shastri Marg, Sardar Patel Marg, Dr Lohia Marg, Clive Road, Strachey Road, Cooper Road, Tashkent Marg, Tej Bahadur Sapru Marg, Kamala Nehru Road (1st), Shobhnath Singh Road, Katra Road-II, Mission Road, Hashimpur Road, Mumfordganj Road, Babi Bindeshwari Road, Subhash Nagar Road, Pannalal Road, Bank Road, Sarojini Naidu Marg, Kamala Nehru Road-II and PD Tandon Marg. The DM has ordered officials of all departments concerned to take necessary steps to bring this pollution under control. To oversee these efforts to cut down on air and sound pollution on city roads, environment engineer of Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) Uttam Kumar Verma has been made the nodal officer. “The DM has ordered strict monitoring of air and noise pollution in the city and ordered that all necessary steps be taken to bring it under control. However, the 28 spots identified as the most affected would take priority in this regard,” said Verma. As part of the strategy to bring down dust floating in the air, the Jal Kal department has been directed to do regular water sprinkling to reduce the dust on the under-construction roads of the city while the responsibility of taking action against those who burn garbage or polythene under the open sky has been entrusted to zonal officers of the PNN. The responsibility of controlling noise pollution owing to vehicles has been entrusted to the transport department and the traffic police, the official shared. He said that the problem of too much dust ails most roads which have become pollution hotspots. Many of these roads are being widened. Though the Prayagraj Development Authority has started black-topping these roads to reduce dust on them, the PDA has also been asked to sprinkle water on these roads, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dist-admin-identifies28-pollution-hotspots/articleshow/87807517.cms||---

Each box contains 25 to 26 kg of tomatoes. A sudden shortage of tomatoes in the wholesale market has pushed up tomato prices,” he said.There is not enough supply from the local tomato growers from Dharwad district, Harpanahalli, Davangere and Kolar. The majority of the produce was damaged because of heavy and untimely rains in the last 2-3 months that caused the shortage in the market, he said.Earlier, the price of tomatoes per box was hovering between Rs 60 to 80 but now it has jumped to Rs 1,000 to 1,200 per box in the APMC. As a result, the price of tomatoes in the local retail market has increased to Rs 50 to 60 a kilo. Tomatoes are likely to be costly for some more days, said APMC merchants.Muttu Bhupalil, a tomato grower at Govankoppa village in Dharwad district, said: “I suffered a huge loss when the price of tomatoes crashed six months back and I had to destroy the crop on my 2 acres of land. But now, I am enjoying better profit though the tomato yield has been very low. Due to low yield, I am able to get only 60 to 70 boxes in one acre against the 100 to 120 boxes in a normal season. Many tomato growers have lost their crops to the heavy rain,” he said.Vijayakumar Ryagi, senior assistant director in the horticulture department in Hubballi admitted that there is a big drop in tomato yield now because of the untimely rain. The tomato plants had rotted after excess rain in Dharwad and other districts. “As tomatoes can be grown throughout the year, farmers should do the proper seed treatment to protect it from heavy and untimely rains,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/tomato-prices-move-skywards-in-north-karnataka-after-rain-ruins-crop/articleshow/87797190.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

According to district fire officials, the incident happened in the morning when locals informed them that a car got washed away due to flash floods which caused the river water to spill over to the road, leaving 10 people stranded. The car was attempting to cross the submerged road but the force of the gushing water resulted in the vehicle skidding off the road and into the river. When fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot along with locals, they found it difficult to reach the spot where the people were trapped due to the force of the water current. As the fire officials and locals helplessly looked on, those trapped managed to stay afloat by sitting on top of a JCB excavator, with the water levels rising every minute. Local MLA Topudurthi Prakash Reddy then brought the matter to the notice of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who then sought Indian Navy’s help to airlift them. Navy reached the spot in a chopper and lowered a rope. Navy personnel then slid down to lift each of those sitting on the roof of the JCB into the chopper. Officials said the chopper had to hover at the same spot for about 15 minutes to complete the operation. The survivors were later dropped off at a secure location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/navy-airlifts-10-people-trapped-in-chitravati/articleshow/87806822.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Mumbai||Mumbai cops get training in traffic junction redesigning||MUMBAI: In a first training workshop of its kind, around 40 Mumbai Traffic Police attempted to redesign a model of a busy Lalbaug intersection in its pre-pandemic avatar when it used to be crash-prone and unsafe for users. The idea behind the exercise was to arm the traffic police with information on how infrastructure and road design play a crucial part in improving road safety and traffic efficiency. The Sant Jagnade junction, located close to the Lalbaugcha Raja Ganesh mandal has a footfall of 3500 people during peak hours and witnessed 26 road crashes between 2016 and 2019. It was transformed earlier this year by the BMC, under the Bloomberg Initiative of Global Road Safety, and made safer with pedestrian friendly infrastructure. The traffic police play a crucial role in the current situation when large parts of the city have been taken up for Metro construction and bridge repairs. Using basic materials like barricades and cones, traffic policemen can make changes in street geometry and influence motorist behaviour. A well designed street can help regulate traffic and minimise the need for police presence. “Our experience of working at Bharatmata junction, Turner Road junction and many other key junctions in Mumbai is that simple design changes can regulate traffic to the extent that the burden of traffic regulation is taken off the police almost entirely. This in turn can aid better enforcement instead. Infrastructure will self regulate the traffic," said Dhawal Ashar, head of integrated transport at World Resources Institute, India, who conducted the training workshop at Traffic Training Institute, Byculla, on Thursday. Following a two hour presentation by Ashar, the traffic personnel in the audience were divided into seven groups. They were handed over drawings and designs of the Sant Jagnade Chowk pre-transformation. In the absence of road markings, pedestrians would dart across, endangering themselves. "We were asked to make changes in the design focussing on pedestrian infrastructure such as refuge islands to halt," said sub-inspector Hanumant Pise of Bhoiwada traffic chowky, one of the participants. "Being a Lalbaug resident, I have experienced first-hand the woes of pedestrians here," he added. The focus of the exercise was also on lane alignment and reclaiming unused space on roads to improve its efficiency. Once the police teams were done putting forth their ideas, they were shown visuals of the transformed intersection in its present-day avatar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-get-training-in-traffic-junction-redesigning/articleshow/87808852.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolkata||4,000 Kolkata Metro smart cards returned daily||KOLKATA: Metro’s footfall graph may be rising, but around 4,000 commuters are returning their smart cards every day, forcing the carrier to pay back around Rs 1.7 lakh from its cash counters daily. These commuters are purchasing the smart card to travel by Metro in the morning but returning them at the end of the day to take back the balance. Most of these commuters used to buy single-journey tokens before the pandemic. With Metro not issuing tokens now, these commuters were forced to adopt smart cards as a means to travel by Metro. However, many of them are unwilling to leave the cash on the card by the day’s end and instead return the card to take back the balance, only to purchase a fresh card the next morning. A smart card costs Rs 120, of which Rs 80 stays deposited with Metro. Of the remaining Rs 40, Metro offers a 10% incentive or rides worth Rs 44. When this balance is exhausted, the cards need to be recharged. But when the card is returned, the unused balance and the deposit amount is refunded to the commuter. Metro is campaigning on the plus points of having a smart card. It is the most user-friendly ticketing system, especially in pandemic times, it says. But smart cards and tokens can’t be directly pitted against each other, confessed officials. “Officially, we can’t discourage any passenger from submitting his card, even if it means debiting huge sums of money every day. The trend is worrying,” rued a station manager. Metro deputy general manager Protyush Ghosh said while smart cards are safe during a pandemic, it is even convenient otherwise as the commuter is spared of long queues. The card can also be recharged online. He, however, added, “In absence of tokens, it is true that some passengers may find it convenient to return smart cards. Though they are valid for a year, some may be reluctant to spend Rs 120 while embarking on a single day’s journey.” At the meeting of the Metro Railway Users Consultative Committee on November 9, Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said that tokens will be back as soon as Covid cases reduce significantly, responding to a question by Shankar Das, nominated member of Railway Board, as to why only smartcards are allowed for boarding a Metro train. The GM explained that tokens would add to the risk of transmission. Metro had earlier announced re-issuance of tokens from March 15, but deferred its decision on March 13 as Bengal’s daily Covid count rose to 700-plus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4000-metro-smart-cards-returned-daily/articleshow/87806821.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Heritage plaque for old governor general’s house||KOLKATA: To commemorate World Heritage Week, the West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) will install a plaque at the old governor general’s house in Barrackpore on Sunday. It was declared a heritage site in 2013. It was in Barrackpore that the oldest cantonment was set up by the British in 1775. The old governor general’s house was originally a permanent barracks and was setup as a cantonment of the British East Indian army. However, the history of the place predates that. It was called Chanak before the British came here to establish their military base. Chanak was inhabited by the then Bengali zamindars. From the 15th century onwards, Chanak and its adjoining area Nona Chandan Pukur grew up as a trading centre on the banks of the river Hooghly. When Marquis Wellesley took over the charge of the commander-in-chief in 1801, he decided to make improvements to the cantonment area. He built a single storied house for the future governor generals of India that is presently known as the governor general's House in Barrackpore. It was designed by Captain Thomas Anbury in 1813. Wellesley also landscaped the adjacent gardens in the English style and made various other arrangements by adding an aviary, a menagerie and a theatre. He also added a park which later became a popular place and is known as the Barrackpore Park. The old governor general’s house is located at Barrackpore’s Lat Bagan. However, the site was lying in a shambles due to lack of maintenance. The commission took up the restoration in 2012, engaging Manish Chackraborty as a conservation architect. Kolkata CP Soumen Mitra was then the ADG of police (training) and in charge of Lat Bagan Police Training School. “It was under his supervision that the restoration was done. Over Rs 5.5 crore has been spent so far. We have decided to visit the site on this Sunday and install the plaque,” said WBHC chairperson Shuvaprasanna. Speaking to TOI, Mitra said: “The greatest challenge was to convince my department 17-18 years ago not to pull it down and to make our men understand the value of this building. But once work started and my officers and men at the Police Training Academy learnt about the history and heritage of Barrackpore Park, their response and support were overwhelming.” Mitra also established a museum at the basement of the building. It currently has a good collection of arms and ammunition of the British period. The adjoining area of the building is also brought under restoration. That includes an aviary, menagerie and a large water body. On being asked about opening the museum to public, Mitra said: “Once the restoration is complete, it will be open to public in a restricted manner as it is located in a protected area close to the shooting range.” According to officer on special duty Basudeb Mallik, apart from the installation of the heritage plaque, we also plan to take a trip of other heritage sites in Barrackpore. That includes the Annapurna temple, Garrison Church and Stuart Kuthi (Lal Kuthi), among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-plaque-for-old-governor-generals-house/articleshow/87806836.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No interim relief to Adsul, court says sufficient material for interrogation||Mumbai: In a detailed order rejecting interim relief from arrest to Shiv Sena’s former MP Anandrao Adsul, a special court this week observed that the availability of sufficient material against him necessitates an interrogation to unveil the larger conspiracy in the serious offence. “From the material shown by the respondent Enforcement Directorate, a need to have custodial interrogation of the applicant is found necessary, which is more fruitful for collection of further evidence,” said Special Judge H S Satbhai. Adsul (74) had moved an anticipatory bail plea in a money laundering case last month. The ED is investigating a case where they suspect Adsul is a beneficiary of misappropriated funds of City Cooperative Bank. It had summoned Adsul. The court said that prima facie, the case made out by the ED is neither found to be frivolous nor groundless. “Success in interrogation would elude if he knows that he has been protected by a pre-arrest bail order. The grant of interim anticipatory bail in economic offence would definitely hamper the effective investigation,” the court said. It further said that prima facie the material shown by the ED is found to be substantial and satisfactory to not grant the relief of interim anticipatory bail. In the plea seeking interim relief, Adsul said that he was a Union minister of state for finance between 2002 and 2004. He said that in 2006, he contested City Cooperative Bank. He became the chairman. The plea said in 2014-2015, certain anomalies and irregularities in loan disbursement by the bank were noticed by the auditor. The plea said that on getting to know about this, in June 2017, Adsul approached the Economic Offence Wing (EOW), and lodged the complaint. The plea said that in an audit report, certain general and vague allegations have been made against the bank’s board of directors. It said that there are no specific and substantial allegations against him. He denied having any nexus with the alleged anomalies and irregularities in the loan disbursement. The plea said he was unaware for what purpose he had been summoned to appear before the ED. It was further submitted no information has been disclosed to him that for what reason he has been asked to appear in the office of the ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-interim-relief-to-adsul-court-says-sufficient-material-for-interrogation/articleshow/87808865.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Police have termed it as a suicide as a poisonous substance was found in her body, however, they have not ruled out the possibility of murder. A case has been registered at the Kotwali police station. Police said the deceased woman, Sunita, had been with her family members and was a widow. "She got a job on compassionate grounds after the death of her husband. On Thursday evening, she had her dinner and went to sleep. Suddenly, she complained of uneasiness, drowsiness, and respiratory problems. She was rushed to the BDK hospital, where she was declared brought dead," said a senior police official on Friday. "It has to be verified if she consumed the poison by herself or she was given poisonous substance by someone," said the official. Police said Sunita’s brother had stated that she consumed poison as she was depressed. "Prima facie it appears to be a suicide, but we are probing the murder angle into the case as well. Certain things have to be clarified in the case," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/48-year-old-govt-hospital-nurse-dies-under-mysterious-circumstances/articleshow/87806862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The melas had been cancelled last year due to the pandemic. This year, stalls selling a variety of handicrafts, including Nagina’s popular wooden handicraft, Khadar’s jute mattresses, Bijnor’s reed furniture and Amroha’s dholaks, are doing brisk business at the melas. Talking with TOI, apar mukhya adhikari (district panchayat) SB Sharma said, "Small traders and vendors faced huge losses during the pandemic. The Ganga snan fair has brought cheer to local artisans and villagers, as they could make money by selling their products.” The four-day melas commenced on November 16. Officials estimate that officials that around five lakh pilgrims in Bijnor’s Vidurkuti, 15 lakh in Amroha’s Tigri and over six lakh in Hapur’s Garhmukteshwar will take the holy dip in on Friday on Kartik Poornima, which is the last day of the fair. A large number of devotees have pitched their tents on the banks of the Ganga. Mats made of reed and tall grass that grow abundantly in wetland areas have been rolled out to cover the floors of the tents. Rajeev Kashyap, a resident of Ganj said, "We have been making reed mats for generations. One person weaves 10 to 15 mats a day, which are sold to the contractors or pilgrims for Rs 10 per piece." Local blacksmiths have also set up their stalls to sell sickles, spades, knives and other traditional and agricultural equipment made by them. In addition, several stalls selling toys, handicrafts, makeup products, tea and sweets dot the fair grounds. On Thursday, the devotees floated diyas in the river and offered prayers for their family members who have passed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ganga-snan-melas-bring-smiles-back-as-small-traders-biz-picks-up/articleshow/87806857.cms||Harveer Dabas

Thousands of people fled villages in Rajampet region following massive floods in the local streams. Several dozens of villages are facing threat of inundation as it took no time for the heavy rains to maroon the region. The communication system in many villages has been cut off as people living in high-rises were seen seeking help from the authorities. The roads were completely washed away as the swirling streams mercilessly jumped onto villages in almost all parts of Rayalaseema. Crops were damaged in thousands of acres as no land is visible in any part of the region.  According to water resources department officials, Gandikota dam in Kadapa received highest-ever flood in its history. Anticipating the situation, the officials started releasing about 1 lakh cusecs of water to the downstream Penna river since Thursday night. The lifting of gates at Gandikota dam had eased pressure on the project but wreaked havoc in the downstream areas.  Breach of Annamayya bund further complicated the situation in the villages close to the project including Baggidepalle, Pulaputturu, Paparajupallem. They were completely marooned in the floodwaters.  “Chief minister is closely monitoring the situation. Our first priority is to oversee the relief operations to help people trapped in the floodwaters. We will focus on enumeration of crop losses a little later,” said agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu.. According to initial estimations, crops in over 1 lakh acres were washed away in the floods and heavy rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/standing-crops-in-over-1-lakh-acres-washed-away-by-torrential-rains/articleshow/87806845.cms||Samdani MN

Nani had moved the high court with a lunch motion petition seeking urgent hearing of the matter. Arguing on behalf of Nani, N Ashwani Kumar said that according to the AP Municipal Act, a member of parliament can choose a municipality of his choice to be the ex-officio member. He has chosen to be the ex-officio member of Kondapalli municipality and sent representation to the authorities concerned. Ashwani Kumar argued that after notifying the elections for municipality, the municipal commissioner should inform about the same to the elected members of the parliament allowing to choose if they wanted to be the ex-officio members. Though the municipal commissioner claiming to have sent letters about the same, Nani did not receive any letter, he said. Justice D Ramesh directed the officials to allow Nani to cast his vote. Ex-officio vote has become a deciding factor in Kondapalli municipality as TDP and YSRC won equal number of wards in the election. TDP is now poised to win the municipality by fielding its candidate as chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-allows-mp-to-vote-in-chairperson-election/articleshow/87806871.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Drones were used by the police to identify spots that might need further police interference. While police looked at both immediate and long-term plans to make Chingrighata safe, Bose said the FOB will be opened in December. “Construction work along with its trial run will be completed by this month and it is scheduled to be inaugurated in December,” said Bose. KMDA officials said that escalators have been fixed on both ends of the FOB and a trial run is on to check them. “Some finishing work is left that will be completed in a few days and the FOB should be thrown open by this month-end,” said an official. About Rs 6 crore is being spent to set up the FOB. Kolkata Police, on the other hand, has started setting up 14 LED blinkers across EM Bypass — from the Metropolitan crossing to the Hyatt crossing — that will act as a guide along the median divider and help motorists comprehend the exact curvature of the road. Police officers said they were following the standard highway procedures in setting up these LED blinkers. “It has an added advantage. It throws light on the face of motorists and stop them from falling asleep. In the past, we have had accidents here as drivers dozed off. This will help stop such accidents to an extent,” explained an ACP. If successful, blinkers will be put up across the Bypass and Basanti Highway to combat dense fog, said Lalbazar sources. “Basanti Highway is extremely accident-prone, especially in winter. The installation of blinkers can be a major help to prevent vehicles from rolling down to the adjoining water bodies when visibility is low,” said an officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fob-ready-for-dec-opening-eye-in-sky-for-chingrighata-trouble-spots/articleshow/87806877.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The town buzzed with religious rituals and songs and there was maha aarti in evening. With this, the Pushkar fair drew to a close. There was drizzling since morning on Friday which pushed the mercury down. A large number of devotees mostly from the rural regions of the state visited Pushkar. Every community has a temple of their own deity where people conduct the rituals. "Pushkar fair is also important because community members meet, discuss and fix marriages of their children," said Santosh Jat of Sikar who came along with his family to attend the event. Devotees later were seen shopping in the main market of Pushkar and many of them enjoyed swings in the mela ground. Brahma Temple opened early in the morning and there was a queue of devotees to offer prayers. Meanwhile, because of the holiday on Friday many families from Jaipur and nearby cities were also seen enjoying outing in the dunes of Pushkar. Meanwhile, the Naga sadhus on Friday morning staged a rally in the town and went to the Pushkar Lake where they took a dip in the water and performed religious rituals. Looking to heavy rush on the occasion of full Moon on Friday, the police was on their heels and put up barricades and check posts on the main roads of Pushkar.

The deceased was identified as Rajya Lakshmi, 45, a housewife from Ashok Nagar in Miryalaguda town. According to Miryalaguda II Town inspector N Suresh Varma, a month ago, Rajya Lakshmi along with her husband Kantha Rao had moved into a rented house in Ashok Nagar area of the town. “Kantha Rao told the landlord at the time of moving into the house that he works for a civil contractor in Miryalaguda,” the inspector said. Three days ago, Kantha Rao had told the landlord that he and his wife were going out of station. The house was locked from outside. “On Friday, the landlord’s son-in-law went to the house after neighbours complained of foul smell emanating from inside. Upon noticing that the smell was from the house, he unsuccessfully tried contacting Rao and subsequently alerted us,” the inspector said. Police broke the lock on the main door and entered the house. They found the body of Rajya Lakshmi on the bed. “The body was decomposed and it was difficult to say if there were any injury marks on it. Things in the house were not ransacked,” the inspector said. Police are trying to locate Kantha Rao. “We do not have any details about him or the family. We are trying to gather more details. The cause of death could only be ascertained once we get the postmortem report,” the inspector said.

Consequently, the country's largest company by market value will pull out its application with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for segregating the O2C business from itself. The re-evaluation follows RIL's "evolving" energy business play, which includes its recent moves in solar power. It plans to make India a hub for low-cost solar manufacturing even as it targets to become net carbon zero by 2035. In a media release issued late Friday night, RIL said that, due to the evolving nature of its business portfolio, the company and Saudi Aramco have mutually determined that it would be "beneficial for both parties to re-evaluate the proposed investment in O2C business in light of the changed context". Two years ago, RIL announced that Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL's O2C unit for $15 billion. As part of the deal, Saudi Aramco would get one seat on the board of RIL and the right to appoint its executives in key managerial positions in the O2C unit. But the Saudi Aramco investment got delayed due to the pandemic and its impact on energy demand. The Indian company, however, recently appointed Saudi Aramco chairman and governor of the Kingdom's wealth fund Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director on its board. The engagement over the last two years has given both RIL and Saudi Aramco a greater understanding of each other, providing a platform for broader areas of cooperation, the Indian company's statement read. Analysts interpreted that Saudi Aramco could look at investing in RIL's larger portfolio, including O2C and renewable energy & new materials businesses. The Indian company's facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which accounts for a major part of RIL's O2C assets, is envisaged to be the centre for its renewable energy and new materials play. Like RIL, Saudi Aramco too is pivoting towards green energy. In June this year, RIL announced that it will make a Rs 75,000-crore investment in clean energy over three years. Later, it bought Norway's REC Solar and India's Sterling and Wilson Solar. RIL's Friday statement further said that it shall continue to be Saudi Aramco's preferred partner for investments in India's private sector. RIL and the Kingdom have an over two-decade-old relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from Saudi Aramco for many years and the latter, through its wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF), investing in the Indian company's retail, telecom (Jio) and fibre-optic units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-aramco-to-review-15bn-o2c-investment/articleshow/87809113.cms||Reeba Zachariah

While the Congress leader took the lead in launching protests against the farm laws immediately after they were passed in Parliament in 2020, without a committed support from the opposition parties, he had also waged a lone battle over the land acquisition Law in 2015. It was only after much persuasion that other like-minded parties came around to back the agitation. In the end, both the controversial government moves spurred larger opposition agitation and forced the government on the back foot. Read AlsoRepeal of farm laws: Worry over Punjab unrest drove decisionPM Narendra Modi's Gurpurab surprise was strongly driven by concern over the fallout of the prolonged agitation in Punjab, a border state where the possibility of fresh disaffection was seen to be a problematic issue that needed an urgent outreach to the Sikh community as the stir showed no signs ofIn the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s surprise announcement on farm laws, the opposition bloc may be eager to push ahead. Though a key sore point for the government that had pitted the farming community against the ruling BJP would now be out of the public debate, much to the latter’s relief ahead of key assembly elections, it may tempt the anti-BJP axis towards greater stridency on other controversial issues that have hitherto remained either untouched or have been handled with soft hands. That raises the possibility that Rahul Gandhi’s hand may now be stronger to nudge the naysayers or the doubting Thomases. Read AlsoFarm laws: 'No govt will dare to bring full reforms'Certain provisions of the central farm laws might have been debated fiercely, but the decision to roll back the legislations is seen as a serious setback to farm reforms, which may not now be taken up at the Centre in a comprehensive manner in near future fearing a backlash.The big handicap in the opposition camp has been the divergence over issues to attack the government. Rahul has single-handedly forced the congress, despite in-house reservations, to question the BJP with gusto over Chinese aggression, Rafale scam, handling of J&K, but the rest of the opposition has stayed away from these sensitive subjects which they feel end up benefiting the BJP that quickly paints criticism on them as politicking over “National security concerns”. The coming winter session will reveal if the repeal of farm laws has changed the thinking of the non-congress, anti-BJP parties. Many in Congress believe that the Pentagon report on Chinese occupation and fresh revelations on Rafale purchase call for renewed aggression on the twin issues. Some changes, though, have been evident in recent months. The complete blockading of the monsoon session of Parliament over the Pegasus scandal, was a big departure from how a badly divided opposition had played post-2019 when BJP returned to Lok Sabha with a greater majority and the rivals lost their upper hand in the Rajya Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/boost-for-rahul-line-on-street-politics/articleshow/87809114.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

In 2016, the then BJP MP of Kairana Hukum Singh had produced a list of more than 200 families that he claimed had migrated due to the town's "poor" law and order. The issue found a mention in the BJP's manifesto and Kairana became a poll plank in the 2017 assembly election. On Saturday, Shamli DM Jasjeet Kaur said, "The CM has asked to maintain a record of those who have returned to Kairana so that they could be compensated, if required. We will conduct a survey to locate such families." Notably, the CM had visited Kairana a few days ago and met with four families who had left the town after facing alleged harassment by local criminals. One of the families, who had left for Gujarat and returned to Kairana in 2018, said, "I felt honoured when Yogiji met us. He gave us enough courage and told us to live and work without fear."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-cms-exodus-remark-survey-on-to-find-migrated-families-for-compensation/articleshow/87806906.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Continuing his arguments on behalf of farmers on Friday, Rao said that if a man did same thing to another man it would be called cheating but the state government is doing exactly the same in case of thousands of farmers of Amaravati in the guise of a legislation. Describing the state government’s action as palpable arbitrariness, Rao said that the state government persuaded the farmers to give up their lands and entered into a contract by promising something in return through a legislation and it has taken a different stance now to repeal the same legislation. While repealing the CRDA Act, the state government said that it would save the land pooling scheme to retain the land that it has taken from the farmers. However, there was no mention of compensation to the farmers as it is going back on its promise of developing world class infrastructure. If one party is not willing to continue in a contract entered with other party, it has to compensate the latter for the consequential losses that arise from the cancellation of that contract. The state government by keeping the lands all these years and wanting to retain them by saving land pooling scheme, turning away from its obligation of compensating the farmers. This is nothing but gross abuse of power and palpable arbitrariness in exercising the power, said Rao. Another senior counsel, Jandhyala Ravi Shankar, argued how the twin legislations were not constitutionally valid. Ravi Shankar is to continue his arguments on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/repealing-apcrda-act-was-abuse-of-power-argues-counsel/articleshow/87806905.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Delhi||Amid music and cheers, chorus at Singhu border: Give it to us in writing...||NEW DELHI: The township of tents and tractors that has come up at Singhu border on the national highway, and only expanded over the past one year, is not about to disappear into the blue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s early morning announcement that the three farm laws would be repealed set off celebrations at this camp but the protesters insisted that they wanted the government to put everything in writing, indicating the huge trust deficit that has prolonged the agitation. Their leaders have, of course, elsewhere said that they would like the laws to be actually repealed before they give up this vantage point. On Friday, the farmers were in a festive mood with loud music blaring from tractors and people breaking into a jig. If there had been any bitterness about their clashes with the police and subsequently being put under a virtual siege with layers of barricades and access control, this was not the day to rake that up. They took it as a good omen because it was Guru Nanak Jayanti and their long struggle had borne fruit. Nichetra Singh, 85, was hugging other farmers near his tent. “We braved the cold weather and heavy rain here. We lost our brothers during the protest. But, finally, we have won. We will, however, not leave this place till they don't give us in writing that they have withdrawn the farm laws,” he said. Ajit Pal, 34, standing next to Singh, was flashing the victory sign, posing for photographers. “The past one year has been a golden as well as the worst period for my life. During the protest, I met several people and we all became a family. It was a learning period for me. I was hurt when I saw elderly people sitting and protesting for their rights. I also missed my daughter," he recalled. He said they have won the battle, but if today's announcement turned out to be some kind of political stunt, they could continue their protest till 2025. Meanwhile, a tractor, blaring Punjabi songs, reached near the main stage. Children and youths were dancing on it while sweets were being distributed. People from across the city, including politicians, had reached the site to congratulate the farmers and click selfies with them. Joginder Singh, 64, along with four friends, has been camping here for the past nine months. “It is the victory of democracy and farmers across the country. They have given us immense support,” he said. His friend, Balbir Singh, 65, insisted that they wanted everything in writing before they could even think of moving. Gurmel Singh, 63, who was sitting near the stage and talking to other protesters, said besides their protests, the forthcoming elections too had forced the government’s hands. Yudhvir Singh, a Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader, agreed with Gurmel. “The government should have taken this decision on the very first day of our protest. We lost more than 700 farmers. If they had thought about the well-being of the farmers, they would have never come up with such laws,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amid-music-and-cheers-chorus-at-singhu-give-it-to-us-in-writing-/articleshow/87807602.cms||Abhay Singh

A letter by Kirankumar Bondar, joint director of higher education, Pune division to the director of higher education has said that a review of all the hostels in Pune, Ahmednagar and Nashik was taken and it was seen that all college or university hostels are fit to reopen and the managements have also given their assent. “Hostels in Pune division are all set to reopen as soon as the decision is made. There are four universities in Pune division that have 12 girls’ and boys’ hostels each, and 77 affiliated colleges with hostels with a total capacity of 17,382 students,” Archana Borhade, administrative officer, joint directorate of higher education, Pune division, said. Reopening hostels is necessary because a major chunk of the students studying in Pune university come from outside the city and for them, staying at the hostel is the only viable option as it is cheaper than the private hostels or rooms. Also, since most hostels are either within the campus or nearby, the students also save time and money that they otherwise would have spent on commuting. Lastly, facilities like reading rooms, library and others are available on the campus which is easier for hostel students to access. Hence, the decision on hostels must be taken as soon as possible,” Kuldeep Ambekar, a law student and activist, said. Ambekar added that a letter to reopen hostels belonging to the social welfare department has also been submitted to the district social welfare office as many students belonging to reserved categories get free accommodation here which is a big support for their higher education. “These students come from poor families and they cannot afford to pay huge rent and stay outside. Hence, social welfare hostels must reopen without any further delay. We will protest outside their office if this demand is not met,” he added.  Colleges and universities have reopened but continue to provide lectures in both online and offline modes. Students have not returned to their educational institutions in full strength. Most are expected to come back in early December or when the second term starts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-decision-on-reopening-of-hostels-likely-in-8-days/articleshow/87806901.cms||Ardhra Nair

It was the first such forum organised in the division with two more planned in Nashik and Ahmednagar. The fora conducted online and offline are open to students, parents and teachers and will be organised every two months, Kirankumar Bondar, joint director of higher education, said. Archana Borhade, administrative officer at the joint directorate of higher education for Pune division, said, “In the first programme that was organised in Pune on Wednesday, 227 people participated in both online and offline mode. We had gone through each and every complaint, which we had told them to register online and then clubbed them into different segments. We told them to send their problems beforehand so that we could give appropriate answers. Apart from this, on-the-spot questions were also allowed. The initiative is important because we have all stakeholders on the same platform and the department studies the problem well before answering.” Maximum grievances were about academics such as delay in results, or examination related or online teaching problems, travelling problems, or scholarship disbursal, hostels and so on. “Then there were problems like what to do if one is not 18 and in college but cannot attend physical classes due to lack of vaccination. Many students complained about scholarships, the problems they faced on the web portal when they applied. This will be taken up with the technical team. Also sometimes, students do not link their bank account with their Aadhaar number and that becomes an issue. There were also fee-related issues and we have instructed colleges to take instalments and not force students to pay a lump sum amount,” Borhade said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/higher-edu-officials-to-address-plaints-of-pune-division-learners-every-2-months/articleshow/87806907.cms||Ardhra Nair

On average, the sun rotates on its axis once every 27 days. However, its equator spins the fastest and takes about 24 days to rotate, while the poles take more than 30 days, according to NASA. The researchers used the upgraded Giant MetrewaveRadio Telescope (uGMRT) to discover emissions in the stars. The first such star was discovered in 2000, four between 2013 and 2020, and eight were discovered in 2021. The astronomers named the stars as main-sequence radio pulse emitters (MRPs). Till two decades ago, when the first such emitting star was discovered, scientists felt that MRPs were a rare phenomenon. But, when NCRA researchers started rigorous work from 2018 onwards, they observed that the phenomenon was more frequent. A research paper describing these new results has been recently accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Lead author Barnali Das developed an optical path and strategised the observations that were timed specifically to watch these stars more frequently which changed the notion that the phenomenon was rare. Das recently completed her Ph D thesis under Poonam Chandra at the NCRA. Das and Chandra have been working on characterization projects of this little-known class of objects. Both introduced ‘MRP’ as a name in 2020 and extensively studied them to understand their properties over an ultra-wide frequency range using uGMRT and the US-based Karl G Jansky Very Large Array telescopes. Their work shows that the radio pulses emitted by MRPs contain vast information on the stellar magnetosphere. The pulsed radio emission from MRPs are the only visible signatures of theoretical models which predict tiny explosions in magnetic massive stars at specific locations in the magnetosphere of the star. “Radio pulses are visible only at certain times, and the phenomenon is mostly observable at low radio frequencies. This is the frequency range where the uGMRT stands out as the most sensitive telescope in the world,” Das said. Chandra said these discoveries are the fruits of an ongoing survey with the uGMRT being launched specifically for solving the mystery of MRPs. “The success of the GMRT programme has revolutionized the notion about this class of stars and has opened a new window to study their exotic magnetospheres,” she added. The astronomers said that the high sensitivity of the uGMRT and its ability to make high resolution images were instrumental in enabling the recovery of the pulsed signal from the different types of radiation coming from space. Combined with strategic observation, it allowed the astronomers to reveal the true nature of these objects. The GMRT is located at Khodad village near Narayangaon. It is an array of 30 fully steerable parabolic radio telescopes of 45 metre diameter, observing at metre wavelengths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/emissions-from-11-stars-bigger-than-sun-spotted/articleshow/87806915.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Farmers rejoice, rue loss of lives during protests||TRICHY/MADURAI: The farming community across delta and the southern districts rejoiced at the Prime Minister’s announcement to repeal the three contentious farm laws. Calling it a massive victory for their unrelenting protests in Delhi and the states including Tamil Nadu, farmers distributed sweets and burst crackers. However, leaders pointed out that many farmers would not have died during the protest had the Union government repealed the laws in the initial stage of the protest itself. All Farmers Organisations Coordination Committee president P R Pandian termed the revocation of the three laws a failure of PM Modi. “The on-going protests in Tamil Nadu will continue till the three laws are repealed in Parliament,” he said. While appreciating the PM, Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Thanjavur district secretary S Vimalnathan said elected representatives in the Union government should unconditionally apologise to the farmers “for demeaning the protests by calling us anti-nationals activated by foreign forces.” Tamil Nadu Farmers Association state general secretary P Shanmugam said the BJP government is responsible for the deaths of over 600 farmers involved in the protest.  The PM’s announcement also brought an end the 39-day-long protests of farmers led by the state president of Desiya Thennindhiya Nadhigal Inaippu Sangam, PAyyakannu. RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangam (BKS) state spokesman N Veerasekaran suggested the Centre take the views of farmers to enact a new law on agriculture. In Madurai, farmers burst fireworks and distributed ladoos at Melur while DYFI distributed sweets at Kalavasal. Madurai district farmers association president S P Elangovan said this was only a partial victory for them as the government had not said anything about the MSP for their produce or privatisation of electricity, which too had been the major demands of the farmers. In a statement, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Dr N Jegatheesan said the implementation of the three laws would have eliminated the govt’s role. Agriculture produce purchases and storage in private hands would have led to farmers being dependent on the private sector due to unlimited storage. Goods would be hoarded and artificial famine would occur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-rejoice-rue-loss-of-lives-during-protests/articleshow/87807596.cms||D Vincent Arockiaraj

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Link roads to ease traffic congestion||COIMBATORE: The city corporation has prepared a detailed project report to construct link roads at five places at a cost of Rs 144.80 crore using the infrastructure and amenities fund. The estimate has been prepared for five separate packages. “The works include acquisition and purchase of small land parcels. For instance, the link road near the Fun Mall from Avinashi Road can be connected to Masakalipalayam Road and from there to Kamaraj Road if a small piece of private land is purchased. The road will pass through the 5th Street on PPC Colony to connect Masakalipalayam. It can ease traffic congestion on Avinashi Road, particularly when the flyover work reaches advanced stages. It is estimated that Rs 18.59 crore is required to provide the link,” a corporation official said. Similarly, a link road can be formed to connect Anna Nagar Road from Avinashi Road in ward number 56 if a small portion of land at Varadaraja Mill is acquired. The project is proposed at a cost of Rs 55.54 crore. A link road has been proposed at Rs 45.62 crore to connect Puliakulam Main Road and Rajiv Gandhi Nagar Road in wards 65 and 66. A road project at a cost of Rs 19.87 crore proposes to link Aishwariya Nagar in ward 15 and Maruthamalai Road. Another road linking Nava India-Avarampalayam Road-SNR College Road has been proposed at a cost of Rs 5.18 crore. More than 100 scheme roads were marked in the detailed development plan to developed by the local planning authority decades ago, said R Raveendran of the Residents of Awareness Association of Coimbatore (Raac). “But they never materialised and as a result, many areas in the city have lost crucial links. A commuter should be able to travel in the city without touching the Avinashi Road, Trichy Road and Sathy Road to bring down traffic congestion in the key roads. It requires smaller rings roads within the city, which can be provided by developing link roads. The projects proposed by the corporation is a first step towards it,” he said. The DPR and estimate will be sent to the principal secretary of housing and urban development through commissioner of municipal administration. Works will be carried out after approval is obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/link-roads-to-ease-traffic-congestion/articleshow/87807595.cms||V Devanathan

---||Meerut||How powerful khaps stood behind farmers, aided agitation||MEERUT/MUZAFFARNAGAR: Since September last year when farmers started their protests against the Centre’s new agricultural laws, the powerful khaps -- not only of western UP but also Punjab and Haryana – have been the lifeline of the agitation. They have come together to share the same platform with the single aim to provide full support, from sending tractor trolleys for transport to arranging funds and food round the clock. These khaps ensured that there was no slackness in logistical support at the Delhi borders. In fact, khap leaders kept urging families to make adequate food and shelter arrangements for the agitating farmers at various protest sites. Baba Surajmal of Batisa Khap in west UP said in Shamli on Friday, "No war can be won without logistical support. Khaps have been the lifeline of this movement. After all, it's a matter of sustenance for farmers, and khaps should not be seen as separate from farmers." Jitender Singh Huda of Huda khap, also in Shamli, added, "What RSS is to the BJP, the khap is to the farmers’ movement. It will not be an exaggeration to say that khaps have been the backbone of the agitation, and this bending of the government has rejuvenated them." On September 5 this year, the massive mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar witnessed the unified face of major khaps of western Uttar Pradesh that resolved to "hurt BJP's prospects in the forthcoming assembly elections in the state". Bahawadi Shyam Singh, a Gathwala khap leader who presided over the mahapanchayat, had then said, "The massive participation of Punjab and Haryana farmers, and with considerable representation from states such as Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, has galvanized the peasant community of UP against the farm laws and this fire will spread in entire UP now. The farmer will immensely hurt the BJP with his vote.” Head of Baghpat’s Desh khap, one of the biggest khaps in the region, Chaudhary Surender Singh had gone to the extent of asking local BJP MLAs and MPs to “tender their resignations and stay home”. “They (politicians) have come to power with the help of farmers’ votes, they will need the votes again. Sab hisaab rakha jaayega (everything will be accounted for)." Surender Singh, accompanied by hundreds of farmers, also carried food from Baghpat to the Delhi border in January. Now, more than two months after the September mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnager, these leaders are all smiles following PM Narendra Modi’s announcement that the farm laws would be repealed. They feel that their support to the cause has resulted in a "historic win”. Naresh Tikait, head of the Balyan khap whose outfit Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) led the agitation in UP, said in Sisauli (Muzaffarnagar), "Repealing of the farm laws has saved the honour of farmers. Khaps have played a major role in this achievement. This agitation has united the khaps like never before. All our differences have been ironed out and we stand unitedly behind farmers who have seen much exploitation and neglect in the recent past.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/how-powerful-khaps-stood-behind-farmers-aided-agitation/articleshow/87806096.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||Pune: 2 senior Ratnakar Bank officials held in Rs 30 lakh bribery case||PUNE: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a regional head of the agri division of the Ratnakar Bank Limited branch in Ahmedabad and its recovery head in Pune in a Rs30 lakh bribery case on Friday. The probe agency said the duo had demanded Rs1 crore for issuing a valuation certificate to the complainant, who along with his 12 family members had applied for an agri term loan. The application was made under the development of commercial horticulture through production and post-harvest management of the horticulture scheme of the National Horticulture Board, for which the government gives 50% of the total project cost limited to Rs56 lakh per project. Due to the non-availability of subsidy, all the agri term loans of the complainant and his family members became non-performing assets (NPAs) and for availing subsidy, a valuation certificate for mortgaged properties was required, the CBI said. “The bribe was settled for Rs30 lakh on negotiation. CBI laid a trap and caught Nimesh Manger, the regional head of the bank, for demanding and accepting the bribe of Rs30 lakh. Later, Saurabh Bhasin, the bank’s recovery head in Pune was also caught. Searches were conducted at five locations including at Ahmedabad, Pune, Delhi at the office and residential premises of both accused,” a release issued by the probe agency stated. “CBI Pune unit was also involved in the operation and arrested Bhasin from his residence in the city around 3pm. He will be produced before the court on Saturday,” said a senior CBI official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-senior-ratnakar-bank-officials-held-in-rs-30-lakh-bribery-case/articleshow/87806923.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Low-pressure and irregular water supply hits Shivajinagar residents||PUNE: Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole and local corporators on Thursday told the civic administration that low-pressure, irregular water supply was inconveniencing residents of the area. On Thursday, the elected representatives held meeting with officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation’s water supply department and sought urgent solutions. Shirole said he received feedback from residents of various localities during recent visits. “We got to know from citizens that the housing societies in Shivajinagar Gaothan, Apte Road, Prabhat Road, Bhandarkar Road have been receiving low-pressure, irregular supply, while slum pockets like Janwadi, Wadarwadi and Pandavnagar get water at odd hours. Residents say the problems have amplified in the past few years,” Shirole said. Corporators said the residents have complained that the water distribution schedule is not followed properly, often causing shortage. Shirole also said he had seen during his visits that public toilets were getting inadequate water and that the quality of cleaning needs to be improved. “We have discussed all these issues with the water supply department and have asked for concrete solutions. There is a need to increase supply from overhead water tanks as well as coordinated efforts to supply water from SNDT water works and Chatushrungi water works,” he said. Vilas Naik, a resident of Gokhalenagar, said that the area should get water in morning hours at adequate pressure. Residents of Shivajinagar police line said they want the authorities to boost daily supply in the area, while people from Khairewadi and Khilarewadi urged the administration to supply water at adequate pressure. PMC officials said area-wise plans will be chalked out to resolve the issues. “We will be following up the complaints raised by the elected representatives and will come out with a plan. Some issues will require longer planning,” PMC officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-pressure-and-irregular-water-supply-hits-shivajinagar-residents/articleshow/87806929.cms||---
---||Delhi||Repeal of farm laws: All smiles at Tikri border, farmers say they aren’t going anywhere, yet||NEW DELHI: Almost a year after farmers began their protest against the three agri laws, there were smiles all around at Tikri border on Friday. The protesters, however, maintained that they would stay put at the site till the laws were taken back officially in Parliament. “Gurupurab is a bigger celebration for us than the Prime Minister’s announcement. In the past, too, several promises were made but not kept. We will believe the government when the laws are actually taken back. We are happy, but there are issues to be addressed. We have other demands too,” said Ruldu Singh Mansa (70), national president, All India Kisan Mahasabha. Mansa added that while the farmers would go ahead with their proposed march to Parliament on November 29, they would meet before that to decide their future course of action. On Friday afternoon, celebrations were already on for gurupurab and children were singing songs on the stage. Several farmers then spoke about the PM’s announcement. Amrita Kundu (35), a member of Mahila Kisan Committee, said, “Until the laws are withdrawn in Parliament, we can’t be sure of the next step. There are issues that need to be addressed, such as MSP and electricity bill.” Many protesting farmers were seen dancing to the beats of dhol and langar with kheer was served to all. By noon, they dispersed to their tents and trolleys like usual. While some said it was a surprise, a handful said they had expected it. Mansa was onboard a train when he got a call from a mediaperson informing him about the development. “I had gone home for two days to prepare for the upcoming events. My phone started ringing in the morning and has not stopped till now. We are happy, but the movement will continue as other issues have not been addressed,” he added. Advocate Amarveer Singh Bhullar, who has been fighting cases for the farmers, said, “This move was made out of the blue. The PM is still not acknowledging the fact that farmers across the country were united over this. At least the PM accepted that we are farmers, else we were given multiple names, right from being terrorists to Khalistanis and what not.” Baldev Singh Sandoha, Bathinda district president, BKU, said, “The laws should be taken back in the same way they were brought. Until the authorities sit with our leaders and listen to our issues, we are not moving out of here. It’s sad that so many farmers lost their lives for this announcement to be made. We hope the government thinks about them too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-all-smiles-at-tikri-border-farmers-say-they-arent-going-anywhere-yet/articleshow/87807615.cms||Sakshi Chand

All of us in the Congress party had been opposing the laws. For a year now, we have witnessed farmers’ Satyagraha and their martyrdom. Today, the Centre learnt a great lesson that in democracy, one cannot impose decisions just by the virtue of absolute majority (of numbers),” Tharoor told a gathering at Murhu block in Khunti district. He further said, “One should understand that no matter how great the majority is, one has to bow down before the will of the public. Tharoor, who is the national president of Jharkhand Professional’s Congress Committee, is in Jharkhand for a two-day visit and he landed in Ranchi on Thursday evening. On Friday morning, he inaugurated a library in Murhu block, along with a skill development center. In his address, Tharoor harped on the need to develop reading habits and the need for libraries. “Books broaden the mind and open new dimensions of thinking. I urge the people of Murhu to read books at the library and also, take the books home for reading. Jharkhand Professionals’ Congress Committee is building a skill development center here for the farmers and it will be ready when I visit next time,” Tharoor said.

---||Ranchi||Maoists call for three-day bandh in four states||Ranchi: Banned CPI Maoists have extended three-day bandh call beginning November 23 in four states — Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh — to protest against the arrest and alleged torture of Politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, his wife Central Committee member Sheela Marandi and four others of the outfit. The Maoists also protested the killing of 26 “unarmed revolutionaries” in Gadhchiroli in Maharashtra on November 13 and expressed solidarity with the protesting farmers on Delhi borders. The time when the press statement was issued, the Centre was yet to announce recalling the contentious farm laws. Bihar Jharkhand North Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh Simant Regional Committee (BJNCUP-SRC), a Maoist unit under the Eastern Regional Buro of the ultra-leftist party, has described the arrest of Kishan Da and Sheela Di as an act of deceit by insiders. “75-year-old Kishan Da and 65-year-old Sheela Di suffering from multiple ailments were undergoing treatment at an undisclosed shelter from where they were picked up in a joint operation of state police, CRPF, NIA and IB. They were tortured and when their physical condition deteriorated, they were shown to be arrested in transit,” Maoist spokesperson, Manas claimed. Admitting that the arrest of tall leaders of the outfit is an achievement for the Centre and the state government, Maoists have described it as a momentary loss for the revolution. The BJNCUP-SRC in a press communique have shared a brief history of their politburo member who started as a student leader of Communist party of India in the 1960s. “Kishan Da later joined comrade Kanhai Chatterjee (KC) to propagate Mao Zedong ideology. He played a key role in the Naxalbari uprising of 1967 under comrade Charu Mazumdar and later went to Assam to spread communist ideology under guidance of comrade KC. He later came to undivided Bihar and remained active in Dhanbad, Hazaribag and Giridih. He led from the front in adjoining states of Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Tripura,” the statement read. The Maoists have also credited Kishan Da of supporting separate Jharkhand movement and charting out a detailed strategy with Marxist Coordination Committee (MCC) leader A K Rai and Kanhai Chatterjee with the slogan – Jharkhand ko laalkhand me badal dalo (convert Jharkhand into a red zone) to envision a nationwide adoption of communism, starting from Jharkhand. The outfit has also underlined Kishan Da’s role in bringing two revolutionary streams — Marxist Communist Center of India (MCCI) and CPIML-People’s War (PW) under the umbrella of unified CPI (Maoist) in 2004 and supervise the formation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the country. “He neither had a friend nor an enemy in his personal life. Kishan Da was dedicated to the cause of establishing neo-democracy on the foundations of socialism,” Manas said. The banned outfit has also appreciated contribution of Sheela Marandi in organising the women power in the party. “She joined as a child and completed her education within the party. She later founded Nari Mukti Sangh and paved the way for induction of women in the party. It was because of her contribution and dedication that she rose to the level of Central Committee Member (CCM),” Manas said. The outfit has appealed to the administration to treat both the top leaders as political prisoners and ensure their safety, medical care and proper treatment in captivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoists-call-for-three-day-bandh-in-four-states/articleshow/87806547.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Among the many inspired hands are textile artists Gaurang Shah and Lavina Baldota who recreated these paintings on khadi sarees which are currently on exhibit at the Durbar Hall in Laxmi Vilas Palace. Titled Santati, the exhibition displays a variety of Varma’s paintings on Jamdani sarees and the project, presented by Abheraj Baldota Foundation, is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation and Raja Ravi Varma, the father of modern Indian art. Twenty artists have recreated Varma’s paintings on the Jamdani sarees through intricate Jamdani hand-weave and yarns dyed in over 600 shades of vegetable dye. Each saree took anything between six months and two years to weave. Santati was unveiled on October 1, 2021 at the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. “The textile industry of India and the expertise in the field were major reasons for the prosperity of the country in the ancient era. But under the colonial rule, the British destroyed the textile industry in India. Under Gandhi’s Swadeshi movement, khadi production was encouraged, enabling Indians to regain their confidence and dignity through self-reliance,” Shah said and added that these hand-woven khadi sarees are his tribute to Gandhi’s philosophy. It showcases the potency of Khadi in its journey from looms to luxury, he added. Radhikaraje Gaekwad, member of the royal Gaekwad family, too caught a glimpse of the artistic sarees on Friday. “Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad had opened Durbar Hall to people to see an exhibition of Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings 130 years ago. And after years, Varma’s paintings are on display here. Women weavers are usually not seen so it is good to see them being trained and getting opportunity,” Gaekwad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/varmas-paintings-recreated-on-jamdani-khadi-sarees/articleshow/87806831.cms||---

He also mocked BJP and called the announcement a laughing stock. “The PM announced to withdraw the black farm laws this morning. The whole announcement is a laughing stock. Now, the entire BJP machinery will jump into promoting the idea that the PM is a well-wisher of the farmers,” he wrote. Congress hailed the announcement as a victory for the party’s stand and the farmers. “The PM had to relent before the will of the Congress party and the farmers, and we are happy about it. The victory shows that our country does not tolerate dictatorship and that democracy is still alive,” Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur told TOI. Congress workers also lit firecrackers and distributed sweets at the party’s state headquarters to celebrate the announcement. State Congress president Rajesh Thakur (in white shirt), Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey (on Thakur’s left) and other party members burst crackers to celebrate the withdrawal of the farm laws, in Ranchi on FridayMeanwhile, JMM mounted a scathing attack on BJP and the Union government over the development. “BJP does not care about the country and is only concerned about winning elections. We are pretty certain that once the elections (in Punjab and UP) are over, they will bring back the laws,” JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya claimed. JMM also claimed that the Centre has now turned its attention towards the country’s Adivasis and Moolvasis. “By bringing in the forest regulatory authority, they are planning to throw out the tribals from the forests and hand over vast swathes of land to their corporate friends,” Bhattacharya added. The Left parties took out a victory march in Ranchi to celebrate the announcement and distributed sweets to the passers-by. “It is a victory for democracy and a victory of the farmers, students, workers and the intellectuals of the country,” CPI’s state secretary Ajay Singh said. CPM’s state secretary Prakash Viplav said, “This will go down in India’s history as a significant movement. More than 750 farmers died and the Union government left no stones unturned to disrupt the movement. The farmers will retreat from Delhi’s borders only after the laws are withdrawn in Parliament as announced by Modi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/soren-seeks-rs-rs-5cr-each-for-deceased-farmers/articleshow/87806422.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand Mukti Morcha threatens economic blockade against Tatas||JAMSHEDPUR: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) on Friday threatened to set up an economic blockade against Tata Steel, Tata Motors and other functional units of the Tata Sons if the conglomerate doesn’t agree to their demands within 20 days. Days after leading protests against the Tata Cummins’ proposal to shift its tax jurisdiction to Pune from Jharkhand, JMM lawmakers from Kolhan division warned the conglomerate of the blockade if they did not pay heed to the party’s demands, which includes shifting the headquarters of Tata Cummins to Jamshedpur and hiring adivasi and moolvasi workers in 75% of all its total vacancies. "We are giving a 20-day ultimatum to the Tata group to fulfill our demands, else the party will be compelled to launch economic blockade," JMM’s Ghatshila MLA Ramdas Soren said. The MLA further said that the decision was taken in a meeting of eight JMM lawmakers from Kolhan division on Thursday. At the meeting, which was chaired by JMM vice-president and state transport minister Champai Soren, it was agreed that the raw materials will not be allowed into the factories and finished goods won’t be let out in the economic blockade. “All Tata group companies that are operating in Kolhan, including Tata Steel and Tata Motors, will face economic blockade,” Ramdas said. Champai has also been nominated to speak with chief minister Hemant Soren and seek his intervention into the matter. Speaking to TOI on Friday, Champai said: “The purpose of the agitation is to make sure that the factories operating here should have its corporate office at the same place and adivasis and moolvasis get priority in employment.” He added: "Since we are in the government, it is our responsibility to secure the future of adivasi and moolvasi boys and girls.” While the conglomerate remained silent on the issue, a senior official on anonymity said: "Tata Sons will look into the matter as it is an issue concerning the group.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/jmm-threatens-eco-blockade-against-tatas/articleshow/87806485.cms||B Sridhar

Keeping Covid protocols in mind, thousands of Sikhs took part in the birth anniversary function of their first guru, Guru Nanak ji at different gurdwaras. This is the second year, nagar kirtan, which usually traverses through the length and breadth of the Steel City, was not taken out as no confirmation was received from the administration in this connection. Prabhat pheris were taken out by individual gurdwaras in various parts of the city and other areas. Such processions were confined to nearby areas only. Head of Telco gurdwara, Gurmeet Singh, said “akhand paath” and “kirtan” were organised on the occasion, so was “langar” (community kitchen). Women from Thursday were actively taking part to ensure smooth running of the langar. They are following the Covid guidelines formulated by the government while working in the langar, said sources. Many gurdwaras have tweaked their programmes and functions so that the guidelines are followed. Breaking the 20-year-old tradition of holding langar in the evening, Hume Pipe road gurdwara organised it just after noon. On the occasion of Kartik Purnima, a large number of people took a dip in Kharkai and Subarnarekha rivers in the city. After taking a holy dip, people distributed clothes, foodgrains and money among the poor at river ghats. Special prayers were offered on this occasion by the devotees. Meanwhile, medical experts have expressed concern over the rise in Covid cases in the district, especially in city areas. On Thursday, the number of positives was 10 and all the cases were from Jamshedpur, 129 days after 10 cases were reported in the district on July 12. Sources said 2,666 people were tested on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/gurparav-kartik-purnima-celebrated-in-steel-city-with-covid-rules-in-mind/articleshow/87806585.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand government schools’ timing changed to improve education quality||RANCHI: The time table of state-run schools has been changed in order to give the teachers sufficient enough number of hours for ‘imparting quality education to the students’. As per the notification issued by the school education and literacy department earlier this month, the new school hours will be from 9am to 3pm between July 1 and March 31 and from 7am to 1pm between April 1 and June 30. Earlier, the timings were from 8am to 2pm between July 1 and October 31, 9am to 3pm between November 1 and March 31 and from 6:30am to 11:30am between April 1 and June 30. “Clear-cut instructions have been issued for ensuring quality education for students. The regional joint director of the department will be responsible for implementing the order in the districts,” state education secretary Rajesh Sharma said. According to the order, Saturdays will be full working days with the second, fourth and fifth Saturdays being used for teaching solely and the second halves of first and third Saturdays being used for extracurricular activities, quiz and music. The move aims to achieve 200 days and 800 hours of teaching for students of classes 1 to 5 and 220 days and 1,000 hours for classes 6 to 8. Earlier, it had come to the department’s notice that the minimum number of teaching hours were not being utilised due to various external factors, including the teachers’ being involved in non-teaching-related work, like polio vaccination-related work and in population census, for instance. Also, some schools did not follow the official time table which also resulted in the lack of utilisation of the minimum number of hours. Now, as per the current order, other departments can engage the teachers in non-teaching-related work only after obtaining the education secretary’s permission. Sharma said that teachers should only be appointed as booth-level officers during elections only if the number of employees assigned for poll-related work from other government departments is falling short of the requisite number. The order further stated that teachers need to stay back for an hour after classes are dismissed for completing non-teaching-related work and for fulfilling the responsibilities of the management committee. Besides the teachers’ involvement in other work, what was also hampering the quality of education was the fact that schools would often remain shut for around 70-75 days in a year due to various reasons, like harsh climatic conditions and festivals, even though the education directorate has approved only 60 days of holiday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-schools-timing-changed-to-improve-education-quality/articleshow/87806470.cms||---

He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today". Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur from Melbourne after his graduation and joined the stir. "Our blood and sweat has paid off," his grandfather said. On Republic Day last year, 75-year-old Hardip Singh Dibdiba had cried himself to sleep. He remembers that evening as if it was yesterday. The apple of his eye, his grandson Navreet, just 25 and back home from Australia after his marriage in that country to a girl he knew, had been killed during violent protests against the farm laws in Delhi, reports Kanwardeep Singh. "There was darkness in our house, in fact in the whole of Dibdiba (a small village in Rampur), he said. "People loved Navreet. He would have been so happy to hear the declaration by the PM on the farm laws today. I miss him so much." Navreet, a vocal opponent of the farm laws, had just returned to Rampur in UP from Melbourne after completing his graduation in commerce from a university there. He dived headlong into the farmers' agitation. His wife, Mansweet Kaur, 22, stayed back in Australia to finish her masters. She had told him she would join him later. After Navpreet died, the cause of his death mired in conspiracy theories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/granddad-in-up-mourns-farmer-killed-on-jan-26/articleshow/87809181.cms||---

Nishu, now 23, had taken leave from studies to till the land vacated by the menfolk in her family as they sat in dharna at the Ghazipur border. On Friday, as the government proclaimed the nullification of the laws that led to the agitation, Nishu had an announcement of her own to make. She would head back to her classroom. "I am relieved," she said. "Education is important too." Nishu will now be able to complete her post-graduation in physical education from her college in Dehradun. PM Narendra Modi's early morning declaration had taken her by surprise on Friday. "I was preparing to go out to our fields. But we heard the news and huddled back in. Later, we took time off, the women in the family, to celebrate. Papa joined us in the afternoon. It was like a festival. It is a great achievement."  Her mother added, "Modi ji took a year (to take this decision) but at least he listened to us. So, thank you. We are now more than happy to take care of our kitchens as our men will return to the fields." Choudhary, 58, beamed like a baby. "I have four children. Since childhood, Nishu used to accompany me to the fields. When I along with my two sons went to Ghazipur, she held the reins and did a great job. With her and the other women around, I never had to worry about my crops."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-who-tilled-fields-will-now-return-to-college/articleshow/87809183.cms||Sandeep Rai

None of the visits lasted more than three-four days,” said Ravindra Daurleya, a 78-year-old farmer from Meerut who came to the UP Gate protest site in the first week of December last year and has stayed at the spot since then. “This is a do-or-die battle. If we do not fight today, our children will have no future. I was convinced the farm laws were not good for us, so I was determined to see this through. I’m happy that the protests have reached their logical end,” the farmer told TOI, hours after the PM announced on Friday morning that the three agriculture laws will be repealed. During his time at UP Gate, Daurleya developed a special bond with Sheru, a stray who was his constant companion. “Sheru stayed with me all these months and even slept with me in my tent,” he said. Daurleya is one of the few protesters who have been consistently present at UP Gate since November 26 last year, the day the agitation began. They have braved the winter chill, summer heat and the rains to stay put at the protest site with a steely resolve. Ram Kumar Sharma, a farmer from west UP who has been staying in Nithari for the past few years, was a permanent fixture too. “I have been part of the protests since November last year. I am entrusted with the responsibility of attending to the kitchen and distributing food to farmers, which I am doing till this day and will continue doing till the protest is officially called off,” he said. Ramesh Malik, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar’s Kazi Khera, said, “My wife Nira can now heave a sigh of relief. It seems like ages since I’ve been home, but this place has become a second home to me. I had even started growing vegetables by the side of the expressway.” Pintu Biswas from Ghazipur, who is another familiar face at the protest site, had initially come to lend support to the agitation but ended up opening a stall for daily items to cater to the farmers’ needs. “I realised that farmers had to go a long way to buy things in the winter, so I decided to set up a stall where I sold towels and other items. Later, demand grew and I started offering Tikait caps, T-shirts and badges at a reasonable rate. I contributed to the farmers’ cause in whatever little way I could,” said Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/foot-soldiers-who-stayed-put-at-up-gate-for-a-year/articleshow/87808249.cms||Abhijay Jha

Dull as the November sky, it was to be another eventless day for the vanguard with their heels and tents dug in as the battle of attrition with the Centre moved towards an important landmark - a week from now, the protest against the three new farm laws on Delhi's borders will turn a year old. Then, the mobile phones started ringing. One of the first to get the morning's biggest "breaking news" was Bijender Singh, a farmer from UP's Ghazipur district who was in his tent, yet to start his day. At the other end, his son was screeching. "Krishi kanoon wapas le rahe hain (the farm laws are being repealed). Modi ne announce kiya (Modi has announced)," he told a stunned Singh. "I couldn't believe my ears," Singh told TOI. "I cross-checked and when I was convinced that what my son was saying was true, I rushed out to inform others." Soon after, the celebrations began. The sizzle ofjalebis in the langar, a round of crackers, a group dance, bellows of triumph and excited phone calls to family followed. Some drove along the protest site loudspeakers blazing till the border where they were stopped and turned back by Delhi Police. "This too will go soon," yelled a protester, pointing at the barricades. Through the nippy air and the acrid overhang of smog, the warm breeze of victory that swept into UP Gate on Friday when the PM announced that the farm laws would be repealed was lapped up by just 150-odd tired but beaming faces. With none of the farmer leaders around, the moment belonged to the footsoldiers. By afternoon, many of them were on national media, their faces lighting up newscasts on mobile screens as journalists outnumbered protesters at UP Gate. "Jeet" was the word on everyone's lips, but this was a bittersweet win, achieved through sacrifice and months of struggle through the turn of seasons, moods, opinions and politics Balwant Singh, a farmer from Shahjahanpur, said, "We will stay put at UP Gate till the time laws are repealed by Parliament because we can't trust it will happen till then." "A lot has gone into making this year-long protest a success. I remember the day Kashmir Singh from Bilaspur committed suicide at UP Gate (Jan 2). It shook me and others, but we remained determined and succeeded at last," said Manjeet Singh Atwal, a farmer from Uttarakhand. Others said a law on MSP and compensation forfamilies of farmers who died during the agitation remained unfulfilled demands that the Centre needed to respond to. Speaking to TOI over the phone, BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said, "The battle is half won. Apart from the repeal of the farm laws, we also want a guarantee on MSP. The agitation has seen so many farmers losing their lives at the protest sites in the past year and we demand that their families get compensation." At the protest site, though, several farmers were relieved they could go back to their families, and not empty handed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-cheer-but-stir-to-continue/articleshow/87809229.cms||---

Sanjay K Jain, chairman, ICC Textile Committee, and past CITI chairman, told TOI that through a notification on November 18, the GST has gone up from 5% to 12% in a lot of textile items, including garments below Rs 1000. Garments over Rs 1,000 already attracts a GST of 12%. “Now, poor consumers will pay 7% extra for their clothing, adding fuel to the inflation. The price of cotton and cotton yarn has already gone up by 25% in recent times. GST in yarn is 5% so input tax credit (ITC) in this case would not help,” he added. According to Jain, the total garments industry is worth Rs 10 lakh crore and out of this, Rs 8.5 lakh crore is from this segment. “MSMEs mainly supply low-end garments, so the reduction in consumption in that segment would be huge as this segment is more price elastic and more working capital requirements will put more nails in this struggling segment,” he added. Jain also argued that GST compliance had grown multifold in the unorganised segment of the industry as at 5% there was no financial gain in evading GST. “However, it is feared that at 12% the unorganized segment will once again go back to old days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/garments-below-rs-1k-to-cost-more-on-gst-jump/articleshow/87807340.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Now, highway contractor damages water pipeline at Peddem during shifting work||PANAJI: Parts of Bardez, including most areas of Mapusa town, went without water supply on Friday after the main pipeline for the area burst at Peddem. This is at least the fourth time in less than two years that the pipeline has suffered a damage as a result of work being carried out by the highway contractor. While on an earlier occasions the pipeline had burst when the highway expansion work was on, this time the rupture took place when the contractor was shifting it. Following repeated damages to the pipeline during the highway expansion work, the contractor had been asked to shift it further away, by the side of the road, to avoid further damage. The contractor had agreed and taken up this work recently. While this work was on on Thursday, around 5.30pm, the pipeline suffered a damage near the Peddem sports complex area. The pipeline is the main channel carrying water from the Assonora water treatment plant supplying treated water to Mapusa and surrounding areas. Huge quantities of water was seen gushing out as a result of the damage. PWD officials said that repair work was taken up immediately on Thursday evening. “Repair work began almost immediately. But to carry out the repairs, water supply has to be shut down and, after this, when water supply chain is put into motion again, there is a backlog in supply of almost 14 to 24 hours. Few hours are required for the pipeline to dry due after the repair,” an official said. Dismayed locals said that they have suffered frequently due to the pipeline bursts ever since the highway expansion work began. “We are already facing a water shortage, with supply provided for only a couple of hours every day. And every time a burst occurs the delay in restoring supply is often prolonged and longer than what is stated officially,” Mapusa resident Sonali Raikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-highway-contractor-damages-water-pipeline-at-peddem-during-shifting-work/articleshow/87807474.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Repeal of farm laws biggest gain for BJP, setback for ruling Congress in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: Pushed to a corner due to the ongoing agitation against three contentious farm laws for the last over one year, BJP is going to be the biggest gainer from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the Acts as its leadership would at least be able to reach out to the people in its preparations for the 2022 Punjab assembly polls. Though political observers feel that despite the announcement to repeal the laws, the saffron party cannot presume that the aggrieved farmers struggling for over a year would vote for them. “It is 100% advantage BJP. It does not mean that they will form the government in Punjab but at least they can step out to campaign now,” says Panjab University’s political science professor Ashutosh Kumar. The biggest loser from the decision would be the Congress as its main electoral campaign issue was “black farm laws” and many Hindu votes, which earlier used to go to the Congress could now come to BJP’s kitty. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma told TOI, “I don’t want to see this decision from a political point of view but it is obvious if there is a peaceful environment in the state and there is freedom of expression, it will be easy for us to convey our views.” Earlier, there used to be various hurdles not by the farmers but others in the guise of farmers, who wanted to further their political interest, he added. Asked about the possibility of again stitching an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) as Akalis’ biggest demand to repeal farm laws was now addressed, Sharma replied, “I don’t think so. Because we were very clear that farm laws were good for the farmers but we could not convince some farmers and therefore we decided to repeal the laws. But the SAD knew our vision very well and despite that they chose to break the alliance due to political considerations.” He added that earlier being in alliance with the SAD, their hands were tied and they also used to “face the wrath for the incompetence of the state government by just being 17% alliance partner”. But professor Ashutosh sees there is a possibility of BJP’s post-poll alliance with SAD because of the fluid political situation in the state this time. “As of now, BJP can have an alliance with Capt Amarinder Singh or the breakaway factions of the SAD or rebel leaders of various parties on the basis of their winnability to at least establish BJP in the state being a bigger alliance partner. “That is what they have been doing in many states where they were weak like in Assam and Tripura, and BJP has formed governments there,” he added. But he says that for a workable alliance with BJP, Amarinder would have to stick to a maximum of 20 to 25 assembly seats. At the same time, professor Ashutosh warns that one should not underestimate BJP as it has many silent Hindu and urban voters in Punjab as there are nearly 49% Hindus and among them Khatris, Aroras and Baniya have been with BJP and they are hardly concerned with the farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/repeal-of-farm-laws-biggest-gain-for-bjp-setback-for-ruling-congress-in-punjab/articleshow/87808018.cms||Sanjeev Verma

While demanding that the process be simplified, they also sought for monkeys to be declared as vermin. Sattari farmers said that allowing them to kill wild boars would help save 40% of their plantations. “We also want permission to kill monkeys, since they destroy 60% to 70% of our crops,” a farmer from Hedode-Sattari, Ashok Joshi said. He has been actively involved in the movement to declare some wild animals as vermin. Farmers said that monkeys cause greater damage than wild boars and that coconut production has declined drastically in Sattari mainly due to the monkey menace. The Goa government on Thursday issued a notification authorising the deputy conservator of forest to permit controlled killing of wild boars based on farmers’ complaints. Joshi said that while he welcomes the decision he is unhappy with the lengthy procedure. “I demand that the government give farmers direct licence to kill wild boars and monkeys without any procedure. Our plantations will be destroyed while we wait for the lengthy official process to be completed.” Another farmer from Sonal-Sattari, Ranjit Rane reiterated the demand for the procedure to be eased for farmers’ benefit. He added that they are also fed up with monkeys and bisons, who damage crops like coconut, banana, arecanut, etc. “They come in large numbers and we have had to face huge losses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-farmers-want-boar-culling-procedure-eased/articleshow/87807470.cms||Afaq Khan
---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh: Will keep up fight for MSP, say apple growers||SHIMLA: Himachal Kisan Sabha, the state unit of All India Kisan Sabha and a major constituent of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, has expressed happiness over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to withdraw the new farm laws and has termed it as a historic victory of the farmers’ movement. Himachal Kisan Sabha claimed that the new farm laws were anti-farmer and made it clear that till the withdrawal of these laws through proper parliamentary process, the farmers will not end their struggle. At the same time, the Kisan Sabha made it clear that the struggle for the minimum support price (MSP) will continue. What will be the nature of the struggle and what will be the methods, it will be decided only after the guidelines of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, it added. Rakesh Singha, former general secretary of Himachal Kisan Sabha and CPIM MLA from Theog, said that the government had left no stone unturned to defame the farmers’ movement and a conspiracy was hatched to defame farmers by calling them a terrorist and Khalistani. He said that an attempt was made to divide farmers between Haryana-Punjab, Sikh-Jaat, rich farmer-poor farmer but the government finally had to kneel before the solidarity of the farmers. Singha said that farmers should not forget that the central government is the killer of about 700 farmers,, and farmers should unite and continue their fight for the remunerative price as per Swaminathan Commission report. State president of Himachal Kisan Sabha, Kuldeep Singh Tanwar, said that there are many issues of farmers in Himachal Pradesh on which farmers will have to fight on the lines of the national movement. He said that Himachal Pradesh is yet to get the MSP and the farmers are also deprived of the crops for which the minimum support price has been fixed. He said that regular mandis for the purchase of food grains have not yet been established in the state, and farmers of Kangra and Mand are facing the brunt of this. He said that on the lines of Jammu and Kashmir, the farmers of the state are asking for market intervention scheme (MIS ) for apples. He said that there is neither support price for vegetables nor proper compensation for destruction in natural calamity. He added that the farmers’ movement at national level has instilled a new confidence in the farmers of Himachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/will-continue-to-fight-for-msp-say-himachal-apple-growers/articleshow/87808020.cms||---

The middlemen take the benefit and the farmers suffer at present. It was a good law to eliminate this and bring the benefit to the farmer and the Prime Minister tried to convince them. But somehow they were not convinced. So the Prime Minister took back the decision. It is actually difficult to go back on a decision. But the Prime Minister with a big heart went back on it, keeping in mind the wishes of the farmers,” Tanavade said. The PM wanted the see that the farmers prosper. But some people and organisations succeeded in keeping the protest going and overpowering the voices in favour of the farm laws, the state BJP president said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/farm-laws-pm-displayed-big-heart-says-tanavade/articleshow/87807503.cms||---
---||Goa||Fear of UP polls made Modi repeal farm laws, says oppn||Panaji: Terming it as a victory for farmers, all the opposition parties on Friday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws is driven by fears of an electoral defeat. Welcoming the Prime Minister’s announcement, political parties said that it is time for BJP to start listening to the people. Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) said that Modi’s announcement sends a signal to the opposition that people’s power works. “BJP has feedback that they will lose the next round of elections very badly in five states, including Goa. It is the fear of losing elections that has impelled the Prime Minister to announce that he has decided to repeal the farm laws,” former Union finance minister and AICC senior election observer P Chidambaram said. Describing Modi as a “dictator in the garb of a democrat”, Chidambaram said that the move to repeal the three farm laws proves that in a healthy democracy, “consultation, discussion and parliamentary debate” is vital. Three weeks earlier, Modi in a speech in Uttar Pradesh said that anybody who opposes the farm laws is anti-national, they are speaking for big farmers and that they will never withdraw the farm laws. “For this stubborn government to today announce that they will repeal the farm laws means that they know that they are losing the next round of elections. This is a lesson for the people. This government does not fear democracy and Parliament. It fears losing elections,” Chidambaram said. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that repealing the three farm laws will be a victory for all people. “Even after being called terrorists and Maoists and subjected to inhumanly oppressive physical and mental force, our farmers have shown India and the world that the arrogance and tyranny of BJP can be and will be eradicated,” he said. He said that a similar unity is required to defeat BJP in Goa. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat also welcomed the Prime Minister’s statements. “After the most insensitive, irresponsible and failed BJP government at the Centre started feeling the heat of people’s anger, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he will withdraw the three anti-farmer laws. This is the beginning of the withdrawal of BJP from across India,” Kamat said. TMC MP Mahua Moitra said that all the opposition parties had consistently urged the Centre to take the laws back. “They criticised us saying that we are anti-national. So many farmers died. The farmers have been protesting for one-and-a-half years through summer and winter. Now when UP elections have come, their brain has started moving,” Moitra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fear-of-up-polls-made-modi-repeal-farm-laws-says-oppn/articleshow/87807510.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||TMC demands CBI & ED probe into CM Pramod Sawant's assets||PANAJI: Releasing documents to prove that chief minister Pramod Sawant has obtained a lease for a stone quarry at Dodamarg, Maharashtra, All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Friday demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Directorate of Enforcement (ED) into Sawant’s assets. TMC questioned how Sawant was able to obtain a stone mining lease in November 2019. The allegations against Sawant were made by TMC Goa in-charge Mahua Moitra, who launched a two-pronged attack against the state BJP government. Moitra said that Sawant failed to restart mining operations in Goa and also failed to prevent diversion of water from the Mhadei basin by Karnataka. Citing a letter from the office of the deputy regional director of Maharashtra, dated November 7, 2019, Moitra said, “The letter clearly shows that Pramod Sawant, as the chief minister of Goa, got a mine in his name in Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra. But the big question is, where did he get the money to lease a mine?” Maharashtra’s directorate of geology and mining has granted Sawant permission to mine a 1.2ha stone quarry at Talekhol village in Dodamarg-Sindhudurg. “We demand a CBI and ED probe into the source of funds used by Pramod Sawant to secure the mine. I would also like the Prime Minister to order a disproportionate assets inquiry against Pramod Sawant,” she said. TMC said that Sawant managed to obtain a mine for himself, but has done little to restart Goa’s iron ore mines, which have been shut for three years. After taking over as the chief minister, Sawant had said that he will get mining started in three months, Moitra said. On the Mhadei water dispute, Moitra said that Karnataka has started diverting more water than the neighbouring state is supposed to. “Despite winning, most of the water from the basin has been diverted to Karnataka,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-demands-cbi-ed-probe-into-cms-assets/articleshow/87807516.cms||---

Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry conference on Nautical Tourism, Naik said that tourism and hospitality sectors are expected to “definitely rebound to the pre-Covid levels in the next two-three years. “There is a need for Goa to focus on nautical tourism as the way forward,” said Naik. “Goa has a great potential to become a natural marine hub and cater to these high-end tourists on sailing boats.” CII aims to push nautical tourism in Goa in order to give a boost to Goa’s revenue and employment. Panelists at the conference spoke about developing Goa as a home base for cruise vessels, which would lead to the development of ancillary services and attract cruise vessels to the state. Industry stakeholders agreed that this proposition was achievable for Goa but it requires the concerted efforts to improve infrastructure and the regulatory environment. Chairman in charge, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) Jayant Singh said that an accommodative regulatory stance can help drive nautical tourism not just in Goa, but across the country. Tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar urged local barge operators to explore the possibility of converting barges into floating restaurants and to hold events. “There are many people who have become jobless and there are lots of barges lying unutilised and getting rusted. Also we are trying to work out a strategy or a scheme whereby these barges can be utilised for floating events, which will be a new tourism product,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pandemic-blow-blunted-due-to-domestic-tourism-shripad/articleshow/87807525.cms||---

Meena said that he was posted to Goa at the height of the pandemic. He also said that Goa police force faces a shortage of manpower as well as vehicles and modern equipment. Meena will be replaced by I D Shukla. “It was very challenging to work here. I came when the Corona pandemic was at its peak. Policemen were deployed everywhere at the borders and in crowded places and we helped control this pandemic. We have taken action against those violating the guidelines and instructions of the government,” Meena said. He said he has worked during his short tenure in Goa to resolve some long-standing issues. “It is the duty of police officials to take measures for the welfare of the police department. When I joined, I was asked what will you do about promotions. So whenever vacancies were there, I filled them up. At least 1,500 promotions we could give, up to the rank of sub-inspector and inspector,” he said. Meena was posted in Goa for barely sixteen months. “For promotions up to DySP level, the matters are in the final stage. I could take it up with the government vigorously. I have written several letters. We have had several meetings. The matters will be resolved very soon. I hope the government will respond positively to the request of police headquarters,” Meena said. He said the department also faces a shortage of vehicles to carry out patrolling and is also in need of new recruits. “We have taken measures to expedite recruitment as there is shortage of manpower in Goa. Around 2,000 vacancies have been advertised. We have already got sanction for equipment. I have again written asking for 67 vehicles, which are required.,” Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-stint-was-challenging-due-to-pandemic-meena/articleshow/87807560.cms||---

Goa moved from the seventh position in the SDG India Index for 2019 to third place in the third edition of the SDG India Index for 2020–21. Stating that 60 panchayats of the state have implemented the second phase of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), Sawant said the stress has been on creating awareness on water and sanitation. As the state has already been declared as ODF, Phase II lays stress on solid and liquid waste management (SLWM), dry waste management and faecal sewage management. “After ‘har ghar nal’ (tap water to every house), we have now given water testing kits to seven to eight panchayats and trained people to test water (from water bodies) on and equal number of parameters. If the water sample doesn’t pass the test on those parameters, they can complain to the PWD. We are thereby attempting to provide potable purified water,” Sawant said. He said that the government was working at constructing sewerage treatment plants in rural areas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/working-to-top-niti-aayogs-devpt-goals-index-says-sawant/articleshow/87807554.cms||---
---||India||In a first, IITs to hire quota-based faculty||MUMBAI: For the first time since they were set up, IITs have placed advertisements for quota-based hiring of faculty members. The recruitment process, for which IITs had autonomy, has been changed at the behest of the Centre and new deadlines set. Since 2019, the education ministry (then called HRD ministry) has been pushing centrally funded higher education institutions to apply the reservation policy in hiring. This time around, the IITs have deferred to the ministry. Advertisements are out for hiring SC/ST/OBC/ EWS faculty members at all institutes, including IITs. A letter issued by the education ministry in Augustend insists that reservation rules be adhered to and vacancies “especially in the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes” be filled by September 4, 2022. IITs follow a year-long rolling recruitment process and never before has a deadline been set by the ministry. IITs ought to be exempted from reservation: PanelThe time limit poses difficulties due to the paucity of engineering doctoral candidates, more so from the SC/ST/OBC categories — a PhD is the minimum eligibility criterion. Usually in a year, the IITs in metros manage to hire about 35 faculty members, 40 in a good year. “Filling up hundreds of vacancies will be impossible,” said a director. While some institutes have advertised vacancies for a number of specific positions, others have enlisted all the departments where there is at least one unfilled post. “Each IIT has followed its own process. We are all recruiting under the mission mode. But while IIT Bombay has advertised for 50 positions, IIT Madras has advertised for 49. Others like IIT Delhi, Roorkee, Hyderabad, Kharagpur have enlisted departments where there are vacancies,” said a dean (faculty). All advertisements encourage women from the disadvantaged background to also apply. In June 2020, a committee set up to suggest implementation of reservation in central education institutes had said the IITs are institutes of national importance and ought to be exempted from reservation. It said the matter of reservation be left to each IIT’s board and if quota in hiring was to be implemented, the posts of professor and assistant professor be exempted. However, that report is gathering dust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-iits-to-hire-quota-based-faculty/articleshow/87809334.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The leaders will now have to see the modalities of how the protesters are to be dispersed. We are happy that this decision has come on such an auspicious day,” said Harvinder Singh, president of the Gurudwara Shri Guru Singh Sabha at Betim. Devotees from various parts of the state were seen attending the event, offering their respects to their leader, Guru Nanak. “We give him the status of a living God and wanted to be a part of the ‘guru janam din’. Though we did pay our respects at the gurudwara in Betim, we visited Azad Maidan as well, because it is a day of double celebration,” Varsha Gopani said. The Sikh community on Friday observed the 552nd Guru Nanak Jayanti at Panaji by holding a kirtan and langar at the gurudwara. This was followed by a procession to Azad Maidan. “Due to the pandemic, we had restricted entries to the gurudwara last year. The idea to hold the event at Azad Maidan this year was to send a message across Goa that devotees can come here to pay their respect to the Guru Granth Sahib. The message of Guru Nanak must be spread throughout Goa,” Singh said. There were at least 2,000 people at the gurudwara who were allowed to enter in small batches throughout the day. Only 600 were allowed to attend the kirtan, while the rally was led by 250 people who were at Azad Maidan. “Everyone is equal and on a par at the gurudwara, so there is no restricted entry only for believers. We believe in the concept of one God and preach that. The rally was taken out to preach the sermons of Guru Nanak and spread the message of humanity,” treasurer of the gurudwara, Rupinder Singh Kher, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-guru-nanak-jayanti-sikhs-have-2-reasons-to-rejoice/articleshow/87807575.cms||Nida Sayed

Claiming that YSRCP leaders had made wild allegations against his wife, and the Speaker was not letting him make a point, Naidu vowed to step into the Andhra assembly again only after returning to office as CM. In an emotion-filled tone, Naidu vowed to step into the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly again only after returning to power. He wept before reporters, taking several seconds before speaking again. “I’ve never experienced such pain in my long political life,” he said. “So far, I’ve tolerated many insults in the assembly for the sake of the people. But they (YSRC) insulted my wife who sacrificed many things in her life to encourage my public service,” he added. YSRCP leaders said Naidu was smarting from the recent political defeats, having lost a number of bypolls and civic polls, and walked out because he felt embarrassed. They denied attacking his wife. Naidu also said Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, father of CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s, had also humiliated his mother in the assembly.

District officials urged stakeholders to go back to their homes, start a discussion on the salient features of the compensation offer and return to them if they needed clarification. Suri MLA and Birbhum zilla sabhadhipati Bikash Roy Chowdhury said the project once implemented would bring about a sea change in the district’s socio-economic life. “Don’t pay heed to misinformation,” he said. The district magistrate addressed questions and concerns from stakeholders over the job promise made in the compensation offer, apart from land price. At the meeting, Birbhum SP Nagendranath Tripathi said: “All possible arrangements have been thought of. Land survey has been completed and owners of land and properties have been identified so that no anomalies can happen in case of land ownership. A joint team has been formed to resolve any kind of dispute regarding ownership of land and other properties.” The DM also allayed fears over deforestation in the command area. “Afforestation will be done as per law to save nature,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/birbhum-dm-holds-stakeholders-meet-for-deocha-pachami-project/articleshow/87807924.cms||Someswar Boral

Hazari Mondal, from Chargheri of Lahiripur in Gosaba block, left for the Sunderbans forest with son Chitta and neighbour Subhash Mandal on Friday morning. They had anchored their boat on the river bank adjacent to the Jhila forest and were catching crabs when the tiger grabbed Hazari and tried to drag him deep into the forest with its paws, said local sources. Chitta and Subhash used a stick and crab-catching rope to fend the animal off but the big cat fought back, forcing the duo to beat a retreat. The tiger then dragged its prey into the forest. An overwhelmed and helpless Chitta and Subhash returned to their village, where a pall of gloom descended as the news spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tiger-drags-fisherman-away-into-sunderbans-forest/articleshow/87807910.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Can PM Modi give lives back, asks Cong||Kolkata: Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Hannan Mollah, who is a CPM politburo member, described PM Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal farm laws as “a historic victory for farmers”. But he was in no mood to end the agitation until the laws were repealed by Parliament. “It is indeed a historic victory for all of us. However, I am a bit cautious and unwilling to trust this government until and unless these three laws are scrapped on the floor of Parliament,” Mollah said. SKM, he added, would now press for a new law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, among other issues. “We saw how the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act was scrapped in 2014. But no fresh law has been promulgated yet,” Mollah said. West Bengal Pradesh Congress president and opposition leader in Parliament Adhir Chowdhury called the decision a “late realization after so many deaths”. He pointed out that the BJP government had to suspend the three laws’ implementation following a Supreme Court order. “The apex court had stalled their implementation for 18 months. The PM had to repeal the laws today or tomorrow. The difference with others is that he did it after muddying waters. This government has lost its credibility among people,” Chowdhury said. Left Front chairman Biman Bose hailed the protracted farmers’ agitation at the Singhu border. “More than a hundred farmers laid down their lives against the BJP bulldozing farmers with the three draconian farm laws. Can PM Modi give those lives back?” he said after taking out a rally in Jhargram. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra congratulated SKM and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee for their “magnificent victory”. He demanded that the state government should drop similar provisions in the amended state Act immediately. Coordination committee national secretary Avik Saha said the farmers’ victory was “incomplete”. “While the three farm laws are yet to be repealed in Parliament, the struggle for the legal guarantee of MSP for all produce, and the withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Act persists,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/can-pm-modi-give-lives-back-asks-cong/articleshow/87807929.cms||---
---||Kolkata||This is farmers’ victory, says Mamata Banerjee after repeal move||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday congratulated farmers “who fought relentlessly” against three contentious farm laws, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced their repeal by month-end. She also paid condolences to bereaved families who lost their dear ones in the prolonged agitation. The Trinamool Congress chief had sent party delegations to the Singhu border protest site time and again to show solidarity with the farmers’ cause. Taking to her Twitter handle immediately after the PM’s annoucement, Banerjee said: “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and was not fazed by the cruelty with which @BJP4India treated you. This is your victory. My deepest condolences to everyone who lost their loved ones in this fight.” In November 2020, the CM had written to PM Modi demanding repeal of the farm laws. In January this year, the West Bengal assembly passed a resolution against the laws. Banerjee had also penned a poem for the farmers, highlighting their pain and struggle. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee described the development as “more power to farmers” but linked the decision to “crucial assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, among other states”. He tweeted: “Their long and arduous struggle, their grit and determination against all adversities has shown @BJP4India their true place. This is the real power of dissent in a democracy and I salute each and every farmer for their courage.” Trinamool leaders said BJP could sense the ground under their feet slipping, especially in Punjab and UP, in the run-up to assembly polls. Senior Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said the Modi government had to bow down as it was “losing ground in north India”. “We supported the farmers’ protests. It took more than a year for the Modi government to bow down. There are political reasons,” he said. Party vice-president Yashwant Sinha said: “I attach no noble sentiment to the government for this move. It is a calculated step for the UP elections. For this government, democracy begins and ends with elections.” Trinamool leaders had been in touch with Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders since the beginning, raising the issue repeatedly in Parliament. Farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait and Yogendra Yadav had campaigned against BJP’s anti-farmer stance in the summer Bengal assembly polls. Trinamool’s Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Shekhar Roy said the repeal decision was a sign of BJP’s fear of defeat in upcoming elections to five states. “Farmers had announced sending representatives each day to Parliament. The decision shows the government is now scared of public outrage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-is-farmers-victory-says-mamata-after-repeal-move/articleshow/87807911.cms||---

India is set to play New Zealand in the third and final T20I of the bilateral series at Eden Gardens. This will be the biggest sporting event in the city, with spectators in stands since the pandemic started. Since March 2020, the city had witnessed only one sporting event with spectators in attendance when the Durand Cup final was played between Mohammedan SC and FC Goa in October. The last time a cricket match was played with spectators at Eden was in November 2019 when India played Bangladesh in their first pink ball day-night Test. "After such a long time, cricket is finally returning to our city and I don't want to miss watching it from the stands. I try to watch every game at Eden Gardens but this time I couldn't manage to buy tickets online. So, I am trying to get one somehow," said Mahipal Singh (34), a businessman, who scampered around searching for a ticket. Entrepreneur Gaurav Ghosh, was also among the fans scurrying for tickets. "I have been calling every friend and club officials begging for a ticket. I am willing to pay something extra, but so far I haven't been able to manage even one," said Ghosh, a Jadavpur resident. The Bengal government has allowed 70% spectator attendance at the ground considering the pandemic. The total capacity of Eden is 68,000. If operated on a 70% capacity range, there is space for 47,600. "Around 1,500 online tickets in the first lot were sold out in 15 minutes last Tuesday. The respective clubs have already picked up 30% of their reserved tickets and so have all life members and temporary members. We are going to have a packed stadium," said Srimanta Kumar Mallick, a CAB official.  The joy of getting a ticket was evident as 34-year-old private firm executive Arpan Mondal stood outside the stadium to collect tickets he had booked online. "It's going to be a historic event and I couldn't miss it at any cost. Over the last few months, I have been watching fans thronging stadiums outside India and missed being on the ground. I am glad I will be among the firsts in the city to be at the stadium again," said Mondal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-cricket-returns-to-eden-gardens-after-covid-break/articleshow/87809375.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The pantry car will continue to serve ready-to-eat (RTE) food items as well. The notification, signed by Railway Board executive director Vandana Bhatnagar, comes a day after TOI reported that hot meals would be back on track this month. “In view of this resurgence of rail travel and easing of Covid lockdown restrictions in eateries, restaurants, hotels and such other places across the country, it has been decided that service of cooked food be resumed and RTEs may also continue. Further, prepaid catering services with opt-out option wil be restored on premium trains,” the notification reads. The IRCTC has already started preparations to reopen its base kitchens. Sources said by next week, the railways subsidiary would likely restore its catering services on board trains like Rajdhani and Satabdi. Following a surge in Covid-19 cases in March 2020, the railways had stopped serving meals and offering bedrolls to passengers. Sources said it incurred losses to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore owing to the suspension of catering services. Friday’s notification stated that an assessment of passenger taste had shown marked preference for cooked meals. The survey suggested only 7-10% passengers bought RTE food while 40-70% asked for cooked meals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/railway-board-oks-return-of-cooked-meals-on-trains/articleshow/87807973.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 40km ‘safe route’ sends herd back to Bankura jungle||BURDWAN: Forest officials of five districts — along with road and railway authorities, police, panchayat members and villagers — created a 40km ‘green corridor’ for a herd of around 60 elephants that finally made its way to Bankura’s jungle in the small hours of Friday, a week after causing jumbo worries for farmers in Burdwan and its adjoining areas. Speaking to TOI, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Debal Roy said: “Between 3.40am and 4am, the elephants crossed Damodar river and safely reached Bankura’s forests.” The district forest departments of East and West Burdwan, Malda, Birbhum and Bankura had mobilised a team comprising four DFOs and several rangers, among others. The team was led by East Burdwan DFO Nisha Goswami. Officials said the 40km route covered the Howrah-Delhi main railway line, the NH-2, two PWD roads and four DVC canals, besides vast swathes of cultivated land across villages. Both railway and highway traffic was suspended to ensure safe passage. Additional principal chief conservator (Southeast Circle) Kalyan Das, who monitored herd movement for the past seven days and also supervised the day’s operation, said driving 60 elephants back to the forests of Bankura was a tall task. “The route is intersected by a busy railway line, a national highway and several canals. Then there are villages and agricultural land. It was a big challenge. We used GPS to map the safest possible corridor. A ranger was deployed at Asansol railway control room to stop train movement once the elephants reached the tracks,” Das said. Galsi OC Dipankar Sarkar said: “We stopped highway traffic near Simnori petrol pump in East Burdwan between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Thursday. All lights were switched off too to ensure the animals weren’t startled.” To make matters more difficult for the team, the herd had several calves, which slowed down its pace of movement. “Some elephants had again separated from the herd. We burnt red chillies; the thick smoke allowed us to herd them back together towards the forest,” Das added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/foresters-map-40km-safe-route-drive-jumbo-herd-back-to-bankura-jungle-after-a-week/articleshow/87807872.cms||Mohammad Asif

While the Centre recently resumed supplies to Covax, it is now also considering allowing commercial exports. The health ministry had given permission to Serum Institute to export one crore doses of Covishield through Covax. India has also resumed supplies to Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh and Iran, almost 8 months after it stopped exports. “Vaccine production is swiftly increasing. The country will soon have a surplus supply. What are we going to do with it if we do not allow exports?” the source said. Thirty crore doses have been delivered in November, whereas only 8.8 crore doses have been administered in the month so far. Bio E’s vax may come up for emergency-use nod in DecIn December, supplies are expected to increase further. Around 31 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin are scheduled to be received in December, while an additional two crore doses of Cadila Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D are also expected by the end of the year. Besides, new jabs like Biological E’s Corbevax are also expected to come up for emergency use authorisation in December. On the other hand, the consumption pattern is not expected to witness any significant rise with over 81% of the adult population already covered with at least first dose. This would also mean the demand for new vaccines will be very limited, unless they are approved and used as a third dose or for use in children. While vaccination is now largely driven by the coverage of the second dose, it will move according to schedule. Around 42% of the adult population in the country is now fully vaccinated with both doses. However, there is still a huge demand for the vaccines in the world, particularly for the jabs manufactured in India as they are likely to be far more cost-effective as compared to those available globally. “There are many countries that are waiting for vaccines. There are 195 countries in the world and only 40 of them have achieved 75% vaccination coverage,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-22cr-unused-doses-govt-may-allow-commercial-vaccine-exports/articleshow/87809601.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Victory comes at the cost of several lives’||KOLKATA: The civil society in Kolkata with intellectuals, activists and academicians, some of whom have spoken directly in favour of the farmers in the past one year and were in constant contact with leaders of various farmer organizations on Singhu border, have hailed the decision announced by PM Narendra Modi to repeal the three farm laws as historic. Yet, they have claimed before each stakeholder in this protest — and every citizen here — that the win has come at a cost. Thrilled in the manner how grassroot democracy has made its voice heard, they have asked the people “never to forget the supreme sacrifices of the farmers, many of whom even died during the protest”. “I am extremely happy today. There were horrific pictures of the struggle that the media had portrayed for the past one year (referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident). Finally, there is relief and victory,” said writer Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay. Pradip Basu, dean of the humanities and social sciences, Presidency University, has been a vociferous supporter of the farmers’ agitation since its inception. “At last, PM Narendra Modi has declared that the three farmers’ laws would be repealed. True it happens to be a decision taken before the elections in UP and Rajasthan along with other states. But there can be no doubt that it is a victory for the people’s movement. A very respectful salute to the over 700 farmer martyrs,” said Basu. Maroona Murmu, professor of history at Jadavpur University and the first Adivasi professor teaching social sciences at a university in Bengal, said it was the farmers’ movement that forced the government to repeal the laws, though hundreds were martyred in the protest. Linguist Pabitra Sarkar said he is relieved after the multiple “sad vignettes” that were coming in from across a few pockets of the country. “Finally, there is relief. But one cannot ignore the fact that the elections are coming and that might have induced the announcement. I wish the Centre tenders an apology for the deaths that have happened in between,” he said. Satabdi Das, an activist who kept in touch with one of the leading voices in this agitation — Harinder Kaur Bindu — said she called up Bindu who assured her she was not leaveing Delhi till the Parliament officially repealed the laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/victory-comes-at-the-cost-of-several-lives/articleshow/87806519.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal agri protest belts hail repeal of farm laws||SINGUR/BURDWAN/NANDIGRAM: PM Narendra Modi’s promise to repeal farm laws came as a fulfilment to Singur farmer Krishna Ghosh who had been organizing Khaser Bheri farmers against the farm laws. It had been a long battle for Ghosh — an organiser of the Kisan Morcha campaigns at Singur. For the past 15 months, along with a few more farmers, Ghosh had been campaigning against the farm laws in the nearby villages. “There cannot be any bigger achievement than this for the farmers in the country. Had the laws been enforced, millions of farmers would have been pushed to sheer desperation leading to massacre,” said Ghosh. As he continued to speak, villagers at Khaser Bheri started to come out with sweets. “When the Kisan Morcha held a rally here, we were not sure of the outcome. But we had faith in the movement that continued to gain strength each passing day,” said Manik Das, another farmer at Khaser Bheri. Farmers at Singur also demanded a law guaranteeing minimum support price for their produce. “We could not get a good price for the potato this year. We can at least recover the cost of farming if there is a guaranteed MSP,” said Sukumar Ghosh of Beraberi village. At Burdwan, the rice bowl of the state, farmers cheered the decision to repeal farm laws. Kartik Ghosh, a farmer at the Simlon village in East Burdwan said: “I have 50 acres where we sow paddy, lentils and potatoes. I was scared of losing my income if the laws were put into force.” Small and marginal farmers were also happy with the announcement. Shyamal Mandal, a small farmer at Daminya village under Raina II has been growing Gobindobhog rice for decades. “We struggle to make a decent margin for the produce each year. We would have been at the losing end had they allowed multinationals to step in,” he said. At Nandigram, another epicentre of farmers’ movement in Bengal, celebrated the day. Bhabani Das, a farmer who had taken an active part in the Nandigram movement, said, “We had fought against the state government for nearly a year. Many were killed yet we did not get swayed. Farmers in Delhi have shown the same grit.” Nanda Patra, another farmer, said: “History repeated itself once again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-agri-protest-belts-hail-repeal-of-farm-laws/articleshow/87806528.cms||Falguni Banerjee
---||Business||Manipal is in takeover talks with Amri hospitals||Kolkata: Bengaluru-based Manipal Group is still in talks with Amri for a possible takeover of the hospital group run by Kolkata-based Emami, which has diverse business interests ranging from FMCG, edible oil, real estate to healthcare. Manipal Hospitals COO Karthik Rajagopal indicated that it is looking at both the options of a complete takeover of 1,300-bed Amri hospitals or acquiring some of its assets. If materialised, this takeover would make Manipal inch closer to healthcare leader Apollo. Rajagopal was in the city for rebranding of Columbia Asia, which Manipal Hospitals group had acquired earlier this year. “We are still in talks with Amri. The idea was to expand the footprint in the east. But whether it would be an asset-specific or a complete takeover, that is yet to be finalised,” he added. Amri has four hospitals, three in Kolkata and one in Bhubaneswar. Top officials of Emami group could not be contacted for comment but sources close to the development pointed out that the discussion was for the whole hospital business not any particular unit. The three units of Amri (Advanced Medical Research Institute) in the city are in Salt Lake, Mukundpur and Dhakuria. Rajagopal said that with 7,600 plus beds, Manipal is the second largest hospital player now. So, the addition of another 1,300-1,400 beds would take it in the striking distance of Apollo. Manipal had resumed talks to buy the Kolkata-based hospital group for Rs 1,500 crore ($200 million), earlier this year. Initially, a few years back, both the parties had a talk for a possible buyout but it could not be materialised due to differences in valuations. Meanwhile, Manipal had bought Vikram Hospitals in Bengaluru. “In the east, we are definitely looking to expand after Columbia Asia,” he added. Manipal Hospital has a combined revenue of around Rs 4,000 crore and has 27 hospitals across the country. However, hospital business revenue is heavily skewed towards Bengaluru as almost 55-58% of it is coming from its headquarters. Manipal Hospital CEO also added that from October this year 90% of its business is coming from normal operations and not Covid. Incidentally, Columbia Asia Hospitals across the country has been rebranded to ‘Manipal Hospitals’. According to Manipal, With the rebranding and new logo launch, all 27 units of Manipal Hospitals across India, including Columbia Hospitals and Vikram Hospital will be brought under one umbrella.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/manipal-is-in-takeover-talks-with-amri-hospitals/articleshow/87807364.cms||---

The husband of the Bhopal woman, who was raped and murdered by her father in a horrific honour killing, hanged himself at home in Sehore district on Friday afternoon. Just three days ago, he had learnt of the gruesome end of his wife, and never recovered from the shock. His father-in-law was arrested by Bhopal police on November 16 for raping and strangling her out of anger that she had married outside the caste. The woman’s brother was arrested too for his involvement in the crime. He stood guard on the road, around 1km away, to keep an eye on passersby, say police. According to police, father and son had plotted the murder and taken her on a bike to a forest in Ratibad on November 5 on the pretext of burying her five-month-old son, who had allegedly died from pneumonia. There, the father raped and strangled his daughter-in-law next to the body of the newborn and left both to rot in the sun. Till police made the arrests, the woman’s husband didn’t even know that she and his child were dead, said police. Ratibad SHO Sudesh Sehore police registered a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/husband-of-honour-killing-victim-hangs-self-in-bhopal/articleshow/87809411.cms||---

The semester exams will begin only after January 20, 2022, higher education minister K Ponmudi said on Friday. A section of students had been protesting over the past few days demanding that the semester exams be conducted online. The higher education department, along with controllers of examinations from state universities, discussed with 11 student organisations, including the Students Federation of India (SFI) and the All India Students Federation (AISF) regarding their opposition to offline exams. "The representatives of student organisations also wanted offline mode exams. However, they wanted more time to prepare for the exams. They said students have been attending offline classes only for the last two and half months. They have asked for a month's time to prepare for the exams. We have decided to give them two months time," Ponmudi told reporters. The state government would withdraw the cases filed against protesting students, he added. He also said the universities and colleges would finish the syllabus before the start of the semester exams and conduct model exams before the semester exams from January 20. City colleges also welcomed the decision saying it would give them more time to complete the syllabus after the physical classes were affected by the rain holidays. "Due to the prolonged rain holidays, we will be able to complete the syllabus only in the second or third week of December. Students will get more time to prepare for semester exams," a principal from a city college said. Another principal said arts and science colleges would be able to finish the syllabus for first year students too before the start of the semester exams. Earlier, University of Madras planned to conduct semester exams from December 20 and Anna University from December 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/semester-exams-in-all-tamil-nadu-colleges-postponed-to-give-students-more-time/articleshow/87809679.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka may repeal APMC law, but not land act amendment||BENGALURU: Now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that his government will repeal the three contentious farm laws, the Karnataka government is in a dilemma over whether it should follow suit and repeal two of the laws it enacted in 2020. Law minister J Madhuswamy said the government will take an appropriate decision after discussions with the Centre. “When these laws were amended, we did take advice from the Centre. Now too, we will wait for directions from them,” the minister said. The two laws — Karnataka Land Reforms (Second) amendment bill 2020 and Karnataka Agriculture Produce Marketing (Regulation and Development) (amendment) bill, 2020 — were passed in both houses of the state legislature despite protests from opposition Congress and farmer organisations across the state. While the amendment to the Land Reform Act liberalises ownership of farmland and allows anyone to purchase agricultural land, the APMC amendment bill curtails powers of local Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees and allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMCs. Farmer group sets deadlineBuoyed by the Centre’s decision on Friday, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, a farmers’ organisation, set a deadline for the government to repeal both laws. “If these laws are not repealed in Karnataka, we will block all highways in the state on November 26,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekar, convener of the Sangha. However, while Madhuswamy insisted the government will not repeal the land reforms amendment “as it has nothing to do with the Centre’s farm laws”, ST Somashekar, minister for cooperation and APMCs, said the state will wait and see whether the Centre’s decision will affect amendments passed in Karnataka. Another minister said: “The winter session of Parliament begins on November 29 and Karnataka will get clarity by then. If needed, we will take up the issue in the winter session of the state legislature beginning December 13, or we may push it to the budget session next year.” Farmer leaders though were jubilant and claimed they will continue to oppose the laws since they “are anti-farming community”. “If the state government does not repeal the APMC and land reforms amendment acts, then it will face the same kind of pressure the Centre did,” said Kurbur Shanthakumar, a farmer leader. Samyukta Horata Karnataka, an umbrella organisation of farmer associations and unions, said the onus is on the state to repeal the laws. “While the PM and the BJP government at the Centre have said they will repeal them, the BJP government in Karnataka has speeded up implementation of the APMC and land reform laws,” the association said. “We expect CM Basavaraj Bommai to follow in the footsteps of PM Modi and repeal these black laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-may-repeal-apmc-law-but-not-land-act-amendment/articleshow/87809656.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Guwahati||Assam Police ranks third in country in smart policing index of the IPF||GUWAHATI: The Assam Police has ranked third in the country in overall rating in the index for public perceptions and citizen satisfaction in a survey for 2021 conducted by the Indian Police Foundation (IPF). Based on the philosophy underlying the Prime Minister's SMART policing idea, IPF used six competency-based dimensions and three values-based dimensions of trust in the survey. "We believe that these annual surveys would be an ideal strategy to nudge state police organisations to strive for better public perception and trust levels, year on year, by continuously improving their professional competencies and ethical values and thereby, the quality of their service to the people," the survey report published on Thursday stated. The SMART Scores are set on a scale of 1 to 10 and are indicative of the levels of citizen satisfaction, a score of 10 being the highest level of satisfaction. The levels of popular satisfaction with the quality of policing was highest in Andhra Pradesh (8.11), Telangana (8.10), Assam (7.89), Kerala (7.53), Sikkim (7.18), Mizoram (7.14) and Gujarat (7.04) in that order, with an index value of seven or above, 19 states and UTs scored an index value between six and seven, while three states scored between five and six. The survey report adds, "Despite being attacked for insufficient sensitivity, declining public confidence and growing concerns about the quality of policing, a majority of citizens (a weighted average of 66.93%) believe that the police are doing their job well and strongly support the police." Going by the individual indicators for the six competency-based dimension, Assam Police has been ranked at third position in "perception index of police sensitivity", "perception index of strict and good behaviour", "perception index of accessibility", "perception index of police responsiveness" and "perception index of helpful and friendly policing". Only in the "perception index of technology adoption," Assam has ranked eight. Under the three value-based dimensions of trust, Assam Police has ranked third in both "perception index of fair, unbiased and lawful policing" and "perception index of police accountability" but fourth in "perception index of integrity and corruption-free services."  In the "perception score of public trust in the police", the state police force has ranked fourth in the country. Assam Police DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta expressed his appreciation to each member of Assam Police who have been working relentlessly despite myriad challenges in the service of society. "However, there is no room for complacency and we have to go a long way." he said. Mahanta also stated that Assam Police is committed under the visionary leadership of chief minister of Assam to transform itself as a force dedicated to provide reliable, accessible, responsive, technology-driven and trained policing services to the people, a police force that is value-driven, will promote integrity, set standards of conduct, make efforts to reduce corruption, ensure that police discharge their duties with fairness and impartiality and build appropriate accountability mechanisms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-police-ranks-third-in-country-in-smart-policing-index-of-the-ipf/articleshow/87809683.cms||Prabin Kalita

But guess there is more to the exercise than meets the eye. Last month, there was shock and awe when Kamrej police in Surat district found 3,221 bottles of IMFL from a sub jail. Ahmedabad: Liquor worth Rs 73 lakh crushed by road-rollerThree constables were booked under the Prohibition Act. Sections of criminal conspiracy were also invoked for their gesture of hiding liquor stock in a sub-jail. The shocker does not end there. Now one of three constables booked has submitted before the Gujarat high court that of the 3,221 liquor bottles seized from the sub-jail, 1,678 bottles were part of the 25,360 cache of liquor which was destroyed in August end by running a bulldozer following a court's order. The constable has claimed that the police inspector himself had prepared a panchnama of destruction of the liquor.  This has sent alarm bells ringing in the high court and Justice Ilesh Vora has sought a detailed report from the higher authority on the issue of stealing liquor bottles from the muddamal. The petition was filed by constable Pinesh Vithani, who was posted at Kamrej police station. He along with two others – a lok rakshak constable Gulabbhai Karsanbhai and GRD Dhavalbhai Kiritbhai – was booked after Kamrej police inspector raided the sub jail and recovered liquor stock on October13. The police have alleged that since the muddamal room in the police station is small and the quantity of liquor seized in the area is so huge that muddamal is kept in a room in police quarters. But these three accused were stashing liquor bottles in sub jail on the pretext of shifting the muddamal from the police station to the police quarters. The constable has approached the HC for quashing of the FIR and claimed that since he is the lowest in the hierarchy, he has been made a scapegoat. Goods allegedly recovered from the sub jail in which he is implicated is in fact the goods so destroyed under the orders of the magistrate and vide a panchnama dated August 27, 2021 under the signature of police inspector and various other authorities, constable's petition reads and cites the make, batch numbers and quantity of seized muddamal, which was destroyed under court order. He submitted that the Kamrej PI, M M Gilatar, had made a request to the principal civil judge at Kathor court for destruction of 25,360 bottles of IMFL seized during June to August 2020 in 36 different prohibition violation cases. After the court’s nod, the contraband was destroyed in presence of the officers of the prohibition department, the prant officer and PI Gilatar.  The panchnama of destruction bears PI’s signature also. He cited police reports to point out 1,678 bottles bearing seven different batch numbers from the seized goods, which was actually a part of the liquor destroyed in August end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/booze-destroyed-in-letter-by-gujarat-cops-found-in-spirit-in-jail/articleshow/87809678.cms||Saeed Khan
---||India||Denied teacher’s job despite topping merit list, man gets post after 30 yrs||DEHRADUN: In 1989, following an advertisement in a newspaper, then 24-year-old Gerald John applied for the post of commerce teacher at CNI Boys’ Inter College, a government-aided minority educational institute in Dehradun. However, despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he didn’t get the job. In 1990, the Farrukhabad resident moved the Allahabad HC. After Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in 2000, the case was transferred to the HC in Nainital. When he turned 55, the Uttarakhand HC ruled in his favour in December 2020 — ordering him to be appointed in the school as well as a release of Rs 80 lakh as compensation. Of this, John was paid Rs 73 lakh by the Uttarakhand government a few months back but the remaining Rs 7 lakh, which is to be paid by the UP government, is still due. Being the senior-most teacher, John is also the acting principal of the school now. Reminiscing about his long fight, he told TOI that he was quite taken aback when despite clearing the interview and topping the merit list, he didn’t get the job. “When I asked authorities why I was rejected, I was told the candidate needed to have stenography skills to be selected. Stenography was not mentioned as one of the required criteria in the job listing. I suspected that the candidate who got the job had connived with authorities. Then I took matter to court.” In 2007, a single bench of the Uttarakhand HC ruled against John. He challenged the verdict in Supreme Court. Ex-Union minister and lawyer Salman Khurshid took up his case and fought it for free. “He saw it as a genuine case and it stayed in SC from 2007 to 2010. The court said the case had merit and asked us to appeal for it in front of a double bench of the HC instead of a single bench,” he said. Ten years after the case moved back to Uttarakhand HC, a double bench ruled in John’s favour in December 2020. In January, he was appointed the commerce teacher for classes 11 and 12 at the CNI Boys’ Inter College. In April, after the principal retired, he was also made the acting principal.

The victim, a Bhopal doctor’s wife, was fully vaccinated, as is her husband, who recovered and has been discharged from hospital. The couple tested positive on November 14 and were admitted to AIIMS-Bhopal the next day. The woman, a 54-year old, died in the early hours of Friday. “She had no comorbidities, apart from slight obesity. On November11 and12, she and my brother had a mild fever. They gave their samples on November13 and tested positive on November 14. At the time of admission, she had 70% lung infection. We can’t understand how the infection deteriorated so rapidly,” the radiologist’s brother, who is also a doctor, told TOI. Sources say she had taken her second vaccine dose in February this year, around nine months ago. Bhopal chief medical and health officer Dr Prabhakar Tiwari said, “The patient was fully vaccinated. Details regarding comorbidity are awaited. In the meantime, teams will trace the contact history of her husband as he is a radiologist.” On November 15, Indore reported its first Covid fatality in four months — a 69-year-old, who was fully vaccinated. He had diabetes and hypertension. He tested positive while being treated at a private hospital on November 9 and was shifted to MRTB hospital, where he died six days later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fully-vaccinated-woman-dies-of-covid-in-bhopal/articleshow/87809688.cms||---

The incident took place at Goalpara Civil Hospital. An electrical short circuit is suspected to be the cause of the fire. Hospital authorities said the fire broke out around 9.30 am at the special newborn care unit of the hospital following which nurses and other staff there evacuated the babies immediately. Goalpara joint director (health) Nil Madhab Das said the fire was immediately doused before it could spread. He said soon after the fire broke out, the nurses present at the spot broke open a window and shifted the newborns. "All the babies are safe and have been admitted to newborn care units of private hospitals in Goalpara for the time being," he added. Goalpara deputy commissioner Meenakshi Das Nath, who rushed to the hospital, said, "All 14 babies and mothers are safe and shifted to nearby private hospitals. We suspect that the fire broke out due to a short circuit. We have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident and a power audit of the hospital." It is pertinent to mention that on November 10, one ventilator of an intensive care unit (ICU) of a pediatric ward in Assam Medical College Hospital (AMCH) in Dibrugarh caught fire. The fire, which was caused due to a short circuit, was immediately doused and all 10 newborns were moved to another part of the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-close-shave-for-14-newborns-as-fire-breaks-out-in-goalpara-hospital/articleshow/87809723.cms||Mukut Das
