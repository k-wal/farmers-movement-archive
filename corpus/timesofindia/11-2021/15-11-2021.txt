He added that the Islamic Emirate now controls the entire country and Daesh (the militant Islamic State group) has been eliminated from most of Afghanistan. “We do not want Afghanistan to have a conflict with any other country or have challenges arise that could affect our nation. When we participated in the Moscow conference, the representatives of India, Pakistan and several other countries were also present. We had a positive conversation with New Delhi and others,” Muttaqi responded when asked about relations with India. Calling Daesh a threat, the Afghan minister said the Taliban government has eliminated it from a major part of the country. “Previously, 70% of Afghanistan was under the control of the Islamic Emirate and the Daesh only had presence in areas ruled by the former Afghan government. After the Taliban took over, the government took effective measures to control them and confine them to certain areas,” he added. The Afghan minister further said that his country has been acting as a mediator between Pakistan and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the desire of both parties. “The two sides have not yet reached an agreement, but the process has had a good start, leading to the announcement of a month-long ceasefire,” Muttaqi said, adding that he was hopeful that the process would not face obstacles in the future and that relations between the Pakistan government and TTP would improve. Dispelling the impression that women were being excluded from education and work in offices in Afghanistan, Muttaqi said: “Women have 100% inclusion in the health sector. They are also in the education sector. They are working in every sector where they are required. Our government has not fired any female official who had worked under the previous government.” “We have no such policy to deny women of their rights in any field. Their salaries, as well as opportunities for education and employment, were also not affected,” he added. Muttaqi claimed that the Taliban government has fulfilled the international community’s demand for an inclusive government. He said that since the Afghan government consisted of representation from all areas and ethnicities, the world should recognise it. “The incumbent Afghan government comprises staff and workers from the previous set-up that come up to approximately 5,00,000 people. If the world had recognised the previous government as an inclusive government, then why not us? If they mean a cabinet representing all areas, then we have a minister from Panjshir. People from Badakhshan, Faryab, Kandahar, Nangahar and Kabul are also present in the cabinet. Therefore, every country has its own definition of an inclusive government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-doesnt-want-conflict-with-any-country-including-india/articleshow/87704609.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The annual music and dance festival is also celebrating the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav this year and will feature artistes and performers from all over the country. Kaushalya ReddyRonu MajumdarThe hybrid event was held at Natya Tarangini, which has been established by celebrated Kuchipudi exponents Raja and Radha Reddy, who also performed at the event. From sanitisers placed at the entrance to having socially distanced seating, the amphitheatre was set to welcome its eager audience. Artistic collaboration was the focal point for this year’s festival, and one of the highlights of the evening was an enthralling jugalbandi between flautist Ronu Majumdar and Kuchipudi dancer Yamini Reddy. Yamini said, “During the pandemic, we saw everybody coming together and helping each other. This is our way as artistes to represent the same sense of unity.” Emphasising on the importance of a live audience for any musician or performer, Ronu Majumdar said, “We were all really missing the feel of a live concert, weren’t we? I hope this is one of many collaborations and live concerts we have.” Raja Reddy elaborated on the message that the artistes were trying to convey through the festival and said, “Plant seeds of love in your heart, let them grow into trees of service – trees that bloom fruits of joy and then share that joy with everybody.” Yamini Reddy Shruthi Parasa, a lawyer and entrepreneur, was quite excited to be in the audience. “I have waited for events to come back to the stage. The online experience is nothing compared to what performers can do live,” she said. Chinmaya Iyer, a classical vocalist, said, “I’m an artist myself, so I know the importance of a live audience and feel that offline concerts should definitely make a comeback. I think we can move towards a space where there can be more concerts if they are organised in a controlled way.” - Eesha ThoratRead AlsoWith COVID cases consistently low, the big fat wedding returns to NCRFrom venues to caterers and bandwallahs, everyone says they have been double booked for the first time in two years Ever since the pandemic hit, one of the major changes in our society has been the way we organise and approach weddings.

The twin ordinances amend the Central Vigilance Commission Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which govern the ED and the CBI, respectively. They pave the way for extension of the terms of the chiefs beyond the mandatory two years by another possible three years, through three extensions of a year each. The amendment to the CVC Act overrides a recent Supreme Court order where the apex court had held that the government could not prolong the tenure of the current ED chief SK Mishra beyond November 18 when his extended tenure runs out. With the changed law, the government can, if it so desires, extend Mishra’s tenure for another two years, through two extensions of a year each. As per the ordinances, any extension for chiefs of the agencies beyond two years will have to be recommended by a committee which ought to record in writing the reasons explaining why prolonging the tenure would be in “national interest”. A 1984-batch IRS officer, Mishra was first appointed as the director of ED on November 18, 2018 as principal special director and was promoted as additional secretary: the rank assigned until then to the ED director. Mishra was subsequently promoted to secretary and, accordingly, the post of ED director also got elevated to the same rung. Mishra, the first IRS officer chosen to head the anti-money laundering agency after LK Singhvi who held the charge in 1992, is seen as one of the most powerful government functionaries. The profile of ED, which had so far remained under the shadow of the CBI, has risen considerably under him. The CBI is not going to be impacted by the ordinance immediately as its chief, Subodh Jaiswal, a 1985-batch officer, is in the first year of his two-year tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-chiefs-can-now-be-in-office-for-up-to-5-years/articleshow/87705130.cms||---
---||World||Glasgow climate deal reached, progress made but not enough||GLASGOW: After facing tense moments in the final hours when India had its way in replacing a reference to “phasing out” of coal with “phase down”, a change that reduces the mandatory nature of the wording, the COP26 concluded with the Glasgow Climate Pact late Saturday night calling countries to further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets by next year. As with the emissions targets where progress was made but success remained elusive, the decision on “loss and damage” lacked a clear plan for a funding facility, much to the disappointment of climate vulnerable countries. Work on having a definite plan to compensate disaster-hit countries will now be shifted to COP27 in Egypt next year. Some nations criticised India’s insistence on a softer reference to fossil fuels, but Indian officials said the country has voluntarily set aggressive green energy targets and there is need for an overall view of issues, including finance to developing nations. The pact also moves on finalising the last piece of the unfinished agenda — a mechanism for a carbon market (Article 6) and transparency — of the Paris Agreement rulebook. The declaration also promises to deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries by deciding to double the quantum for adaptation by 2025 and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. The overall pact was finally adopted when the COP26 presidency accommodated India’s concerns where the country objected to phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The change from “phase-out” to “phase-down” with respect to coal power use in the final text was agreed during the last-minute amendments to build the consensus. Just before convening the final plenary, UK COP26 president Alok Sharma and his team members were seen trying to convince India’s environment minister Bhupender Yadav over the text as the latter strongly objected to it on the reference of coal and fossil fuel while intervening during the stock taking. Both leaders were even seen looking at the amended version which Yadav finally proposed and the plenary accepted. India, in fact, got the amended paragraph by opting “phase-down” for coal in the final text instead of “phase-out” and even included points on “targeted support to the poorest and the most vulnerable in line with national circumstances” while referring to fossil fuel subsidy, even as Switzerland and EU objected to it before reluctantly agreeing on it as a compromise to finally arrive at the Pact. It was quite an emotional moment for Sharma who chaired the plenary that finally adopted the COP26 decision. It reflected the difficult moments which he negotiated as he sought to bring all countries on board through little compromises on different fronts. Though smaller island nations and Mexico, along with Switzerland and EU, criticised India’s move on watering down the text on coal and fossil fuel by calling it a bad economic choice, Indian delegation defended the country’s position. A senior official from Indian delegation said, “All fossil fuels are bad for the environment. Singling out coal without talking about other fossil fuels like natural gas is not the best way forward. But India, in the spirit of compromise, helped evolve language that was acceptable to all. This language takes care of concerns of many developing countries including India.” He further said, “India has always maintained that it does not favour sectoral targets. We have taken on economy wide target like reduction in emission intensity of GDP. This gives countries more flexibility to meet mitigation targets in line with the national circumstances and developmental needs. One size fits all approach is not the best way to evolve consensus on global issues.” China too wanted clarity on coal and fossil fuel references. However, it was India which decided to call it out during the stocktake and finally Yadav suggested the amended paragraph which was adopted by all countries. Nevertheless, it was for the first time the coal and fossil fuel subsidies found place in the COP decision text, making the issue much more important in the context of the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius at a time when the world would try to collectively achieve ‘net zero’ (carbon neutrality) by 2050. In any case, India’s substantial focus on renewable energy and its commitment to increase non-fossil fuel installed electricity capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and achieving 50% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from renewable energy by 2030 are testimony of the country’s own efforts to gradually reduce its dependence on coal without compromising with its current development trajectory. The outcome of COP26 is also significant in view of finalising the rulebook for 2015 Paris Agreement after six years of discussions. The rulebook provides guidelines for full implementation of the Paris deal. This will allow for the full delivery of the landmark accord, after agreement on a transparency process which will hold countries to account as they deliver on their targets. The final rulebook now includes rules for carbon markets (Article 6), which establishes a framework for countries to exchange carbon credits through the UNFCCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/glasgow-climate-deal-reached-progress-made-but-not-enough/articleshow/87705231.cms||Vishwa Mohan

They also blew up the family’s mud house with dynamite. The incident came to light on Sunday. Locals said the Maoists raided the house of Saryu Singh Bhokta around 7pm on Saturday. They shot his two sons — Satyendra Singh & Mahendra Singh — and their wives Manorama Devi and Sunita Devi, calling them police informers. Killed 4 for poisoning cadres: NaxalsThe Maoists stayed there for around two hours till 9pm. The Maoists left a pamphlet there, stating that their action was to avenge the March incident this year when four of their cadres — Shivpujan Kumar, Amresh Kumar, Sita Kumar and Uday Kumar — had been neutralised by the CoBRA battalion 205 at the same place. They alleged that the cadres were given poison in the meal, which caused their death. But in the police record, they were killed in an encounter. The Maoists blamed the Bhokta family for the fake encounter and alleged that they acted as police informers. Four AK-47 rifles had been recovered from their possession. The village is on the border of Gaya and Aurangabad districts. Spokesperson of Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh, UP Simant Regional Committee of the banned CPI(Maoists), Manas, in a press statement said that had they lost four comrades in a fake encounter. “We do not remorse the loss of lives if the supreme sacrifice is made in war field, but they were killed by betrayal in cold blood, which warranted revenge,” he said. The Maoists also released two sets of photographs along with their statement. While the first set of four photos shows their slain cadres lying in Bhokta’s house, the second set of four photographs shows four members of the same house hanged by their neck in the courtyard. “We have avenged the betrayal and this would be the fate of anyone who backstabs our men,” the Maoists said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-shoot-4-of-a-family-hang-their-bodies-in-gaya/articleshow/87705360.cms||Alok Kumar

India recorded 80,614 new cases of the coronavirus in the week, just 73 behind the previous week’s count of 80,687, as per TOI’s Covid database. With Sunday’s numbers yet to come in from three smaller states, the final difference is likely to be even less.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); While cases in Kerala and Tamil Nadu continued to drop, a number of states and Union territories registered small increases in numbers.

Other states where the case count rose in the current week were Karnataka, which logged a 17% increase, Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and others. In most of these states, there was no sign of a sustained spike yet and the numbers remained low overall.

The PM responded positively to our request to reopen the corridor soon,” said BJP state general secretary Dayal Sodhi, who was part of the delegation. The Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage was suspended in March last year after the outbreak of Covid -19. Ashwani Sharma, chief of BJP’s Punjab unit, said that PM assured the team that he would look into the demand for the resumption of the pilgrimage to the shrine before Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary on November 19. Sodhi recalled Modi visiting a gurudwara in Delhi to mark the 400th martyrdom day of Guru Tegh Bahadur, and said that the team extended thanks to the PM for taking several initiatives for Punjab and the Sikh community. “The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor was opened in his tenure, which Congress could not do in 70 years. Besides, It was during Modi’s tenure when those responsible for Sikh massacre in 1984 were sent to jail,” BJP Kisan Morcha Punjab president Vikramjit Singh Cheema said. The Kartarpur Corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kartarpur-yatra-likely-to-restart-as-punjab-bjp-netas-meet-pm/articleshow/87705446.cms||---

At the 29th meeting of the southern zonal council attended by the CMs of Andhra, Karnataka and Puducherry; senior ministers deputed by CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana; and LGs of Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, Shah described the nationwide administering of 111 crore doses so far as a big achievement and “an example of cooperative federalism”. At the same time, he urged the member states to speed up second dose vaccinations below sub-division level, with CMs and officers personally monitoring the progress. Shah also requested the southern states to involve officials and experts in firming up their inputs on the proposed amendments to Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act, and submit them soon. Among the other issues that Shah underlined for follow-up by the member states were creation of an independent director of prosecution to speed up prosecution; priority to tackling spread of narcotics and drugs usage; establishing at least one forensic science college with a syllabus in their local language, so that manpower can be trained to meet needs of forensic investigation; adherence to 60-day timeframe for investigating sexual crimes against children; observing November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas by developing an action plan to showcase the contribution of tribals to India’s freedom struggle and development of their states. In his opening address at the meeting, Shah reiterated the Modi government’s commitment to promoting Hindi alongside all regional Indian languages. He in fact urged the delegates to speak in their own state’s language, with arrangements also having been made for translation of proceedings into the languages spoken by member states of the council. Shah said the zonal council meetings, which involve consultations on issues of federal concern at the highest level, have been able to solve many issues despite being advisory in nature. The home minister made it a point to praise the ancient culture, traditions and languages of the southern states and underlined that India’ development cannot be imagined without the “very important contribution of states of Southern India”. Shah recalled that the zonal councils have met 18 times in the past seven years, compared to very few meets held earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-chaired-meet-of-southern-states-heads-resolves-40-of-51-pending-issues/articleshow/87705468.cms||---
---||India||Heavily-fortified Tawang to get its first cinema theatre on November 20||NEW DELHI: The farthest northeastern district of the country will soon be “integrated cinematically and culturally with the rest of India” as Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang is set to get its first cinema theatre on November 20. The heavily-fortified border district, which remains in limelight for faceoffs with Chinese troops, will soon get a 80-seat theatre for a population of nearly 50,000 people. “Jadooz, which targets small and remotest cities of the country, will open its first fully-air-conditioned screen with a high-end virtual reality facility in Tawang. The theatre will not only be used for screening movies but will also double up as a platform for virtual teaching classes as each seat will have a cordless microphone and a camera for interactive sessions to bridge the education gap,” Rahul Nehra, founding managing director of startup Jadooz, which plans to open seven screens in Arunachal in coming years, told TOI. It is quite an irony that Arunachal Pradesh, which is a treasure trove of cultural diversity and traditions and famous for monasteries, currently has just 3-4 small theatres, including one in Itanagar, but none in Tawang. In fact, Arunachal movie ‘Water Burial’, whose storyline was based on a dark ritual of a local tribe, won the best film award on environment conservation at the 67th National Films Awards 2021. “The screen, built at a cost of Rs 35 lakh within two months during the pandemic period, will provide entertainment to the local population at a cheaper price. Unlike expensive theatres and multiplexes in big cities, the Tawang theatre will sell tickets for just Rs 100 but will provide quality entertainment,” Rahul Nehra said, while adding that Jadooz targets to open 11 screens in Arunachal and Assam together. Soon, Tawang will also get to watch the latest Bollywood movies as this theatre will have the facility of ‘first day, first show’, he said. “Currently, 50 Jadooz screens are either under development or ready for launch across the country, and we plan to open 1,000 screens by December 2026,” he told TOI. In India, there are less than 10,000 single movie screens, mostly confined to cities — which means only one screen for every one lakh Indians. So, over 90% of India is devoid of any entertainment destination. “Jadooz wants to bridge this gap as it is building entertainment zones mostly in tier-2 and tier-3 towns and villages. Its aim is to provide entertainment with the feel of a multiplex at a convenient location and affordable price to the hinterland,” the startup founder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heavily-fortified-tawang-to-get-its-first-cinema-theatre-on-november-20/articleshow/87705492.cms||Surendra Singh

Their last stand in the forest of Mardintola in Dhanora subdivision, near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, also helped some other top cadres escape. Teltumbde, in-charge of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh zone, was among 26 Maoists killed. Among the dead, six were women, including Vimla alias Imla, who was Teltumbde’s bodyguard. Another of his bodyguards, Bhagatsingh, too, was found dead. Intermittent firing, including unprecedented heavy firing from either side at times, went on for almost 10 hours, it’s learnt. Four C60 jawans were injured in the encounter, but their condition is learnt to be stable now. On Sunday, SP Ankit Goyal confirmed the death of Teltumbde after he was identified as per the police Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) by a surrendered Maoist at the police headquarters. “We have informed Teltumbde’s wife (Angela Sontakey) about his death, but she is yet to arrive to take the body,” said Goyal. Some 29 weapons, including five AK-47s, one AKM with under-barrel grenade launcher, three Insas rifles, and one pistol were seized from the encounter site by C60 commandos. Substantial explosives and materials of daily use were also seized. Sources from the district police said top cadres, like divisional committee member Sukhpal Parcheki and Dandakaranya special zonal committee member Prabhakar, too, were probably present at the encounter site, but managed to sneak away amid heavy firing. Sources said C60 parties, which started the operation a day ago, had encircled the hillock and forested region in multiple layers, and laid ambushes plugging exit routes. While the hilly and rocky terrain of the forested stretch helped top leaders and cadres flee despite raining bullets, Teltumbde got trapped on the hillock. Sources said the C60 commandos were initially stunned by the unfamiliar style of heavy firing from the Maoists, who are known to be extremely frugal with ammunition. “The experienced C-60 commandos sensed something different in the volume of firing, and realized the rebels seemed to be protecting someone very important,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-maoist-leader-with-rs-50-lakh-bounty-killed-by-commandos/articleshow/87705511.cms||Soumitra Bose

She said Congress workers have been asking her to do anything but join hands with other parties, adding that she respects the views of partymen. Congress will give a chance to its dedicated workers who have worked for the party over the years, she said. Addressing over 7,000 Congress workers from Meerut, Agra and Aligarh zones during the party’s ‘Pratigya Sammelan’ held in Bulandshahr on Sunday, she said the BJP government doesn’t understand the rights of the people and the meaning of independence because they haven’t fought for India’s freedom. While praising BR Ambedkar for his contribution in drafting the Constitution, she also mentioned the contributions of Indira Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Sardar Patel in freedom struggle. Priyanka — who had recently bumped into SP chief Akhilesh Yadav while they were on a flight, and also met Mayawati on Sunday to offer her condolences after the death of the BSP chief’s mother — had sparked rumours of alliance with these parties. During the dialogue with party office-bearers, she chalked out the strategy of polls. Priyanka had asked all ground-level workers to form WhatAapp groups and run Congress’s campaign on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-to-go-solo-in-up-polls-next-year-priyanka-gandhi/articleshow/87705644.cms||Ishita Mishra

This comes soon after external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence secretary Ajay Kumar’s visits to the country. Naravane, during his first visit to Israel from November 15 to 19, will meet the country’s senior military and civilian leadership to discuss “avenues for further enhancing defence relations,” said an official on Sunday. “He will hold meetings with security establishment officials and exchange views on various defence-related issues. He will interact with the service chiefs and visit the headquarters of the ground forces element of the Israeli defence forces,” he added. The visit comes soon after India and Israel agreed to form a joint task force to formulate a comprehensive 10-year roadmap to identify new areas in defence cooperation in the 15th meeting of the joint working group. The meeting was chaired by Kumar and director-general (retd) of Israeli defence ministry Major General Amir Eshel in Tel Aviv on October 27. Israel has been among the top four arms’ suppliers to India for almost two decades with annual military sales worth around $1 billion. The Indian armed forces are inducting the next-generation Barak-8 surface-to-air missile systems under three joint DRDO-Israeli Aerospace Industries projects worth over Rs 30,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-chief-to-help-boost-defence-ties-with-israel-during-5-day-trip/articleshow/87705715.cms||---
---||India||Income from carbon credits sale taxable? SC to decide||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday took up an interesting question related to global warming — is money earned from trading of carbon credits by green industries taxable? — and said this will have a far reaching impact on industries. The issue could have a bearing on India’s ‘net-zero by 2070’ pledge at Glasgow Climate Summit. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M Trivedi caught the significance of the issue raised by additional solicitor general N Venkataraman and counsel Akanksha Kaul challenging a high court decision that money earned from trading of carbon credits be treated as ‘capital assets’ not liable to income tax. Justice Khanna said this would have a far reaching impact on the future industrial scenario given the rising clamour against global warming. Venkataraman said, “The issue could be — whether trading in carbon credits trading is part of the business activities of an industry? Today it may be capital assets but it may become a revenue asset as the carbon credits trading income could be classified as income from other sources.” He said, “If you classify carbon credits trading as income from other sources, there could be a problem. If these are going to be treated as business assets, then the issue will arise in several cases.” The bench didn’t elaborate more as it issued notice to Lanco Tanjore Power Corporation Ltd, which was granted exemption from tax liability on income accrued to it by selling carbon credits to foreign firms. With these new regulations in force, the pressure on businesses to find ways to reduce their carbon footprint is growing. Most of today’s interim solutions involve the use of the carbon markets. What the carbon markets do is turn CO2 emissions into a commodity by giving it a price. When a company buys a carbon credit, usually from the government, they gain permission to generate one ton of CO2 emissions. With carbon credits, carbon revenue flows vertically from companies to regulators, though companies who end up with excess credits can sell them to other companies. In the case in hand, Lanco Tanjore Thermal Power Company Ltd was saddled with a tax effect of Rs 567 lakhs for its earning from trading in carbon credits for the assessment year 2010-11. After the case meandered through the tax tribunals, the Madras HC in February termed the earnings capital assets and ruled it was not liable for tax. The Centre posed this question before the SC, “Whether the HC was justified in holding that the sale of carbon emission reduction, also known as carbon credits, is to be considered as capital receipts and not liable to taxation, without appreciating that carbon credit is revenue in nature as is obvious from Section 115BBG inserted in the Income Tax Act?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/income-from-carbon-credits-sale-taxable-sc-to-decide/articleshow/87705734.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||People need fast justice, not erudite lawyers: CJI||NEW DELHI: After reaching out to nearly 70 crore people during a 45-day campaign by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) to make them aware of their legal rights, CJI NV Ramana said common litigants grinded by resource and energy sapping litigations need quick and inexpensive relief and not colossal court buildings or well-dressed erudite lawyers. Speaking at the valedictory function to mark the end of the intense campaign to spread legal awareness in the nook and corner of the country, he said, “People who are suffering don’t look for well dressed, erudite lawyers or colossal court buildings. All they want is to be relieved of their pain quickly, without exhausting all their resources. We have to work together to promote a sense of belonging with the justice delivery system, among the public.” As a first step, he said, judges must remain “bold and independent” and write in simple language to enable common litigants to comprehend the judgments and orders easily. “Since our decisions have a huge social impact, they should be easily comprehensible and must be written in clear language,” the CJI further said. “It is, primarily, the ability of Constitutional courts to function with absolute independence and necessary boldness in the face of adversity, that defines the character of our institution. Our ability to uphold the Constitution sustains our impeccable character. There is no other way to live up to the faith of our people,” the CJI said. He said the schemes and activities of NALSA act as a necessary bridge ensuring access between the benefactor and the beneficiary. “Today, I can say that we all have sincerely worked to live up to the aspirations of the framers of Constitution,” he said. NALSA executive chairman Justice UU Lalit came in for special praise for working tirelessly and travelling to all corners of the country to infuse energy into those paralegal workers and law students who fanned into the countryside to touch nearly 70 crore people with the legal awareness campaign and ensure that theme of the campaign ‘Ek Mutthi Aasmaan Par Haq Hamara Bhi Toh Hai’ (the marginalised have a right over a slice of hopes, opportunities and aspirations of the country), resonated vibrantly in the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/people-need-fast-justice-not-erudite-lawyers-cji/articleshow/87705759.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Press Association reported that counter-terrorism police said the three men, whose ages ranged from 21 to 29, were detained in the Kensington area of the city. Police were called to reports of a blast involving a taxi at Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday morning. Police said the explosion had not been declared a terrorist attack, but counter-terrorism police were leading the investigation and the men were detained under the Terrorism Act. ``So far we understand, the car involved was a taxi, which pulled up at the hospital shortly before the explosion occurred,`` Merseyside Police said in a statement. ``Work is still going on to establish what has happened and could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything.`` The male passenger of the car died and the driver was being treated for non life-threatening injuries. Police said they were ``keeping an open mind'' about what caused the explosion. The Liverpool Women's Hospital said it immediately restricted visiting access until further notice and diverted patients to other hospitals ``where possible.'' Fire services said they extinguished the car fire rapidly, and a person had left the car before the fire ``developed to the extent that it did.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-3-detained-in-car-explosion-outside-liverpool-hospital/articleshow/87705782.cms||---

The astronauts, who have already finished the basic training at the Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center in Moscow and begun portions of their India leg of the training are returning to Russia for activities relating to crew module seats and space suits.The TOI had reported earlier this year that the astronaut-elects would be returning to Russia. A senior scientist from the Isro Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC), which is spearheading Gaganyaan, said: “Each one of them will be there for about a week. The first one is expected to return in the next couple of days after which another would go. They are not all going together.”Among activities planned there crew seat moulding, which needs to be done as per their body structure; flight suit trials, including depressurisation checks, etc. Isro will be receiving the seats to be used on the crew module from Russia and the space agency has placed orders for four seats, while Russian research, development and production enterprise — Zvezda — will be supplying the space suit. After their initial training in Russia, which lasted for more than a year, the astronaut-elects have completed some basic modules in India, including training in aerospace medicine at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and “continuity training” of flying at Bidar.However, they are yet to begin their mission-specific training, which will be scheduled after they return from Russia again.“The syllabus for their training is in place. The training will be in different stages with each stage dealing with specific requirements of their journey. We will also have simulators that will emulate the crew module and other instruments they will require to handle during the mission,” the HSFC scientist said. As reported by TOI earlier, the Indian module of their training will happen in multiple cities and with the help of multiple agencies, including all three services of the armed forces.For instance, the Gaganyaan module-specific training — different conditions and reactions they need — will all happen in Bengaluru, while buoyancy and water survival tests and training will happen at NIOT (National Institute of Ocean Technology) in Chennai. The flight and other training will be provided by the IAF, while Isro has also roped in the navy. Some of the centrifuge tests will happen at the IAM, while physical and some simulator training will happen at Isro facilities. The advanced training will involve familiarisation of systems, including launch vehicles. This will mostly be theory that will help astronaut-elects understand various systems that will launch them into space and bring them back safely.After this, they will start flight simulation where they’ll be taught how to use safety instruments, intervene manually to operate flight systems in case something goes wrong, how to take photographs of Earth and so on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gaganyaan-one-astronaut-to-return-from-russia/articleshow/87705790.cms||---

They were found later and sent to the rescue centre at Bannerghatta Biological Park, police said. The incident came to light when a private bus service staffer came to the police station with eight boxes of tortoises and claimed they were found abandoned outside their office. The staff said the bags were not part of the parcels received at the office. “We are scanning CCTV footage from the area to check who brought the tortoises there. The private buses had, on Friday morning, ferried passengers from Hyderabad, Mumbai and other places to the city. But the bags don’t have any receipt on them and were not entered in the ‘parcel’ register of the buses. We suspect someone who was not a passenger brought them near the office,” an officer said. Sources said the star tortoises are barely two months old and could have been brought from the forest areas in Chikkaballapur district and from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. Such tortoises are sometimes smuggled to foreign countries to be reared as pets. According to wildlife activist Sharath Babu, trafficking Indian star tortoises is a crime under the Wildlife Protection Act and punishment for offenders is jail term of up to three years and penalty of up to Rs 25,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/170-star-tortoises-abandoned-in-bags/articleshow/87705792.cms||---

Complainant Ramesh (name changed), a resident of Jeevan Bima Nagar, east Bengaluru, lost his wife to cancer in August this year. According to Ramesh, his wife’s condition deteriorated rapidly after she was treated with the ayurveda medicines and she died in a month’s time. Claiming he was depressed over his wife’s death and that delayed filing of complaint, Ramesh told Ulsoorgate police that the ayurveda shop owner and others not only caused his wife’s death, but also cheated him. Ramesh’s complaint stated that his wife was treated at a private hospital on Old Airport Road for cancer for more than a year. During one such hospital visit, one Santosh approached Ramesh and enquired about his ailing wife. “Santosh told me his friend Shankar Yadav’s wife was suffering from a similar cancer and was cured with ayurveda medicines. I believed him and shared my mobile number. A few days later, a person identifying himself as Shankar Yadav called me over the phone and reiterated what Santosh had explained. Yadav assured me that my wife would get cured with the ayurveda medicines and shared the details of Shiva Shakti Ayurveda shop on Cubbonpet Main Road,” Ramesh stated. Accordingly, Ramesh purchased the medicines suggested by Yadav from Shiva Shakti Ayurveda shop on August 1. “By month-end, my wife’s condition worsened and she died. Now I have realised that Santosh, Yadav and the ayurveda shop owner Kumar Gowda cheated me. I had purchased medicines worth over Rs 2.2 lakh. Yadav asked for my help and I transferred Rs 49,900 to his bank account and gave him gold coins worth Rs1.7 lakh,” Ramesh’s complaint copy read. Cops have booked Kumar, Yadav, Santosh and others under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). “It looks like the work of an organised crime syndicate,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/prof-blames-ayurveda-druggist-2-others-for-wifes-death/articleshow/87705793.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt awaits Rs 3,000 crore MSP dues from Centre||BENGALURU: With Karnataka’s food subsidy bill rising, the state has been mounting pressure on the Centre to immediately release outstanding minimum support price (MSP) dues amounting to Rs 3,025 crore to lessen its financial burden and enable it to make fresh procurements. The state government, through its agencies, buys large quantities of paddy, ragi, maize and jowar from farmers at MSP rates, and gives them out to beneficiaries through the public distribution system (PDS) at subsidised rates. This is primarily how farmers benefit from the MSP system. However, the Karnataka government largely buys only ragi, wheat and jowar and purchases only token quantities of other produce like paddy and tur. “The delay in release of funds has resulted in increasing burden on the state food and civil supplies corporation,” said Kapil Mohan, additional chief secretary, food and civil supplies department. “We cannot afford to procure fresh crops from farmers until the Centre clears pending dues,” he added. Though CM Basavaraj Bommai has promised farmers that paddy would be procured under MSP, the government is yet to make a formal announcement as it is waiting for the Centre to clear the pending dues, sources said. Bommai along with food and civil supplies minister Umesh Katti met Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Piyush Goyal during their visit to Delhi on Thursday for the second time in three months, seeking clearance of dues. The minister has reportedly assured to look into it. Seeking personal attention of the Union minister, Bommai requested the former to take measures for one-time clearance of the state’s outstanding dues, including interest burden which is due to delay in the release of subsidy, sources privy to the discussion said. Under decentralised procurement, the state government has been procuring paddy, ragi and jowar on behalf of the Centre for a decade. The responsibility assigned by the Centre under decentralised procurement comprises procurement, storage and distribution of all three. The cost pertaining to the entire operation consists of minimum support price, taxes as payable and other incidental expenditure incurred in acquisition and distribution, said officials. The dues were in small amounts till last year, officials said. However, the state government obeyed the diktat of the Centre and procured ragi, maize and jowar in large quantities to support farmers hit by the Covid -19 pandemic, as result of which the dues went up by five times, they explained. “We cannot afford to procure crops under MSP until we get reimbursement from the Centre. But we are confident that it’s just a matter of time now,” said Mohan. He also said that the state government buys ragi and white jowar in large quantities as both are adequately grown across the state compared to paddy and maize, which are limited to just a few districts. Meanwhile, farmers who have harvested their crops are keenly waiting for the government to start procuring the same under MSP. “We will launch a protest if the government fails to buy paddy in another week,” said farmer-leader Kurubur Shanthakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-awaits-3k-cr-msp-dues-from-centre/articleshow/87705795.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Harvest season hit as crops decay in rain||BENGALURU: The extended southwest monsoon that has seen incessant rain continuing through the winter season has left farmers in the lurch as they are unable to harvest crops in wet conditions, despite the bumper production following record sowing. The well-distributed rainfall during kharif season (June to October) saw sowing being completed on 78.7 lakh hectares. While this is the second successive year of record sowing, foodgrains production is expected to be over 138 lakh tonnes, as against the target of 135.5 lakh tonnes. However, with unrelenting rain, standing crops are decaying. “Production of crops, especially paddy, ragi, jowar and maize, is extremely good this time but the tragedy is farmers cannot harvest them as they’re still wet on the fields,” said GC Bayya Reddy, president of Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha. “About 30% of crops have already been damaged. If the situation continues for a week or so, the consequence will be more severe.” With paddy being sown on 10.2 lakh hectares, as against the target of 9.7 lakh hectares, production of about 18.5 lakh tonnes is expected. Ragi and jowar have been sown on 6.9 lakh hectares and 0.6 lakh hectares, respectively. Need for survey“The government should immediately conduct a crop survey and chalk out a relief scheme,” said Kiran Kumar Vissa, national co-convener of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. On their part, agriculture officials say they will shortly undertake the survey and farmers can report to the department and claim crop insurance. “Farmers can upload details of crop damage on the Parihara app so that they will be eligible for relief under SDRF (State Disaster Response Fund) norms,” said Manoj Rajan, commissioner, Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority. Bayya Reddy, however, said 80% of farmers have not paid premium for crop insurance this time because of procedural hassles, and the onus is on the government to help them. While a few farmers have harvested their crops, the government is dithering on procuring them under MSP (minimum support price) scheme, leaving stockpiles of paddy and ragi sprouting after getting wet in the rain. Traders are taking advantage of the situation as price of paddy in the open market has fallen to Rs 1,350 per quintal, way below the MSP of Rs 1,960 for A grade and Rs 1,940 for common grade. To the dismay of farmers, the government on Friday issued an order to open procurement centres for paddy only in four districts — Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Koppal, and Raichur. “The government will look into concerns of farmers of other districts tool. While we have got approval to procure 3.3 lakh tonnes of paddy, we have sought the Centre’s approval to procure 7 lakh tonnes of ragi and 6 lakh tonnes of jowar,” said food & civil supplies commissioner Shamla Iqbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/harvest-season-hit-as-crops-decay-in-rain/articleshow/87705797.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavraj Bommai asks Centre not to approve ‘illegal’ water projects of other states||BENGALURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai raised Karnataka’s concerns over irrigation projects taken up “illegally” — allegedly by Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — at the 29th meeting of the Southern Zonal Council on Sunday. Listing out the contentious projects in the presence of Union cooperation minister Amit Shah, he appealed to the Centre not to approve them. “Tamil Nadu is going ahead with the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link project, which is inadmissible in law. The Karnataka government, in a letter dated February 17, urged the Centre not to approve the proposal. We reiterate our stand that no statutory clearances should be given to projects planned in violation of water tribunal awards,” he said. He asserted Karnataka’s rightful share in Cauvery, Krishna and Pennar basins as the state has already communicated to the National Water Agency about the Godavari-Cauvery link project on July 26, 2019. The CM also mentioned the Rajiv Gandhi Sangama Banda barrage proposed by Telangana and the Gundrevula project undertaken by Andhra Pradesh across Tungabhadra river, and highlighted their “illegitimate” status. “No projects in Telangana or Andhra Pradesh in Krishna water are permissible if they are not part of allocation,” Bommai pointed out. Earlier, delivering his speech at the first meeting of southern state chief ministers, held in Tirupati, Bommai said a strong foundation for nation-building needs the Centre and states resolving long-pending issues through cooperation. “Southern states are among high performers in almost all sectors. However, some regions have remained backward, like erstwhile Hyderabad-Karnataka. The Prime Minister has directed us to follow the ‘aspirational districts’ model for developing backward taluks. My government is taking steps in this regard,” he said. The CM requested Shah to speed up the inter-state reciprocal transport agreement between Karnataka and the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-asks-centre-not-to-approve-illegal-water-projects-of-other-states/articleshow/87705798.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Police offer to give self-defence lessons to govt school girls in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: If the police department has its way, three girls each from 720 select government schools and PU colleges in Bengaluru will get training in self-defence techniques. The department’s proposal to the education department is part of the Safe City project, a programme initiated by the ministry of home affairs to create a safe environment for women. The department of public instruction has called for a meeting with the police department to discuss the matter. As per the proposal, 240 constables of city police will be trained in self-defence, gender sensitisation and laws related to women apart from counselling skills and public speaking required for trainers. Trained constables will coach the select students and they will in turn teach their peers in their schools, creating a chain. “The training will not be in martial arts as it is not easy to master the technicalities in a short duration. This will be situation-based training. Students will be trained in practical ways of getting out of certain situations that couldarise in daily life. Let’s say, if someone holds a girl by the wrist, or grabs her by the hair; it is not about strength here, but how to get out of the situation by immobilising the opponent for a short duration to escape,” explained Nisha James, DCP (administration), Bengaluru. The constables will further act as a bridge between the student community and police department for any issues henceforth. The constables will be trained daily for 4-5 hours for 64 days. One of the issues the education department is likely to raise is the feasibility of a young child teaching the rest of the kids. “We have written to the commissioner of public instruction and the director of the department of pre-university education. Schools and PU colleges will select master trainer students. We have given a guideline on what kind of student has to be selected. She has to be bright, confident, have a good rapport with the student community and character traits of a leader,” she added. Karnataka had earlier launched a plan to teach karate for high school girls. Schools were given funds to hire trainers too. However, the programme faced fund crunch and post Covid outbreak, it came to a halt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/police-offer-to-give-self-defence-lessons-to-govt-school-girls/articleshow/87705800.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP’s exorbitant sapling tenders draw ire of greens||BENGALURU: Environmentalists are unhappy with BBMP floating exorbitant tenders worth crores of rupees for planting and maintaining saplings across the city. Responding to a TOI report — Tenders floated for 62k saplings, BBMP ready to pay Rs 930 for each — published on Friday, citizens and environmentalists said the civic body doesn’t have a planned approach to address the issue of increasing the city’s tree cover. On World Environment Day, the Palike launched Koti Vruska Sainya programme, which envisages planting 1 crore saplings in the city in three years and declared that it will ensure the plants survive. Harish Gowda, an environmentalist, alleged BBMP failed to maintain the existing saplings and protect tree guards. “The civic body can neither maintain the existing trees, nor tree guards. Why float tenders to raise new saplings and install tree guards?” wondered Gowda. “A sapling can be planted and grown for just Rs 200. The Palike’s inflated estimate of Rs 930 per sapling camouflages vested interests at work,” he alleged. In areas like Indiranagar, Vidhana Soudha, Sanjaynagar and parts of Dollars Colony where there is VIP movement, the civic body makes an effort to plant saplings and guard them, while in remaining parts of the city the saplings are allowed to die, said another senior environmentalist. “Winter isn’t the right season to plant saplings as survival chances are little,” said Akshay Heblikar, director of Eco-watch. Heblikar suggested it would be better if the civic body initiates the same project in March or April, after which monsoon would nourish the saplings. Heblikar added that lack of coordination between civic agencies affects the growth of saplings. “Every time there is road cutting or other construction work, debris is dumped on the saplings, which then eventually die,” he said. Involving NGOs, government institutions and schools in afforestation drives would have been a better idea, he said. Dattatraya T Devare, another environmentalist, said more than planting saplings, ensuring their survival is important. “BBMP does not have the mechanism to monitor a plantation drive, as a result of which saplings end up being planted at the same spot every year and the whole thing is reduced to a joke,” Devare said. “BBMP is using bamboo guards, but they won’t survive. It needs to use iron tree guards to ensure the saplings survive,” he said. Shankar Reddy Babu, special commissioner (estates, forest, education), BBMP, was unavailable for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmps-exorbitant-sapling-tenders-draw-ire-of-greens/articleshow/87705801.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 67-year-old sues KSRTC for failing to pick him up from bus stop, wins Rs 1,000||BENGALURU: A 67-year-old man, who was not picked up at a designated bus stop in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu by a Karnataka State Road transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus on which he had booked a ticket to travel to Bengaluru, took the utility to a consumer court and has now won a refund and compensation of Rs 1,000. S Sangameswaran, a resident of Banashankari 3rd Stage, had booked return tickets online on KSRTC Airavat Club Class from Bengaluru to Tiruvannamalai. As planned, he left Bengaluru on October 12, 2019 and was scheduled to return to the city the next day. He reached the designated bus stop around noon. However, despite waiting for over an hour, there was no sign of the bus. Sangameswaran had received an SMS from the state transporter mentioning his bus details, including the conductor’s contact number. When he called the number, he was told that the bus had left Tiruvannamalai as he failed to turn up at the new temporary stop and it was 30km away on its journey towards Bengaluru. The dejected senior citizen had no choice but to take another KSRTC bus from Tiruvannamalai and reach Hosur by paying Rs 131. From there he took another bus to Bengaluru for Rs 69. Enraged by the fact that a senior passenger like him with a pre-booked sleeper ticket for the premium service wasn’t informed about the change in bus stop, Sangameswaran approached the Bangalore 2nd Urban Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Shantinagar with a compliant against the managing director and general manager (traffic), KSRTC. The litigation commenced on October 30, 2019. Sangameswaran presented his case, while the KSRTC lawyer claimed the complainant wasn’t maintainable by law. The attorney also stated that the case should be dismissed by the forum as the place where the alleged incident happened was Tiruvannamalai and beyond its jurisdiction. He further said the conductor of the bus had sent an SMS to the complainant about the local TN police temporally shifting the bus stop to an outer location to manage crowds during the full moon day and it was a mistake on the part of the complainant, who failed to be present at the spot. He also claimed that 23 other passengers had boarded the bus, but not the complainant. The judges of the consumer forum, however, didn’t accept the state transporter’s version as it failed to provide proof to substantiate its claims. The utility also failed to produce the bus conductor before the forum. In their verdict pronounced on October 26, 2021, the consumer court ordered the managing director and GM (traffic) of KSRTC to refund Rs 497 towards the complainant’s Airavat ticket and Rs 131 and Rs 69 for the alternative bus journey he was forced to take to return to Bengaluru. The court also ordered the officers to pay the senior citizen a compensation of Rs 1,000 for the trouble caused. All payments to the Bengalurean must be made within 30 days of the order, the court ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/67-year-old-sues-ksrtc-for-failing-to-pick-him-up-from-bus-stop-wins-1k/articleshow/87705803.cms||Petlee Peter

The code for the December 10 legislative council elections kicked in on November 10. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is likely to hear a petition on holding BBMP elections in the first week of December. This could lead to another MCC being imposed in the city. Awaiting official launchBMRCL sources said they are waiting for the chief minister to give a date to launch the much-delayed National Common Mobility Card. BMRCL, along with RBL Bank, will issue NCMC to Metro users only after the official launch. In March 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched NCMC to enable travel and payment of parking and toll charges through a single card. However, its implementation in the city has been delayed by over two years for various reasons. NCMC can be used to shop and pay for parking and integrated with other modes of transport such as BMTC, cabs and autorickshaws. The closed-loop cards like the ones currently used in Namma Metro cannot be used for other purposes. BMRCL has installed one or two new automatic fare collection gates at each Phase 1 Metro station. The new AFC gates accept both QR-code and open-loop NCMCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/election-code-derails-induction-of-electric-buses-and-mobility-card/articleshow/87705805.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Owner Sunil Kumar S generally gets a bill of Rs 3,000. Jogupalya residents claim 80% of households in the area faced a similar issue in October. Besides Sunil, TOI spoke to one more resident, Sai Narasimhan, who also complained of excess billing. BWSSB officials conceded that billing has been among the most-discussed issues at its weekly water adalats. They said the board will need to use technology to resolve the matter. Sunil Kumar said, “I don’t run a water supply business to get such a huge bill. When I went to the BWSSB ward office, they said they wouldn’t be able to come to a conclusion without a ball valve. An official who came to read the meter behaved rudely when I said I didn’t have a ball valve. I have been living here for six years and never have I experienced something like this. They asked me to attend a water adalat so that I could get a concession of Rs 20,000 or so. But why should I?” Jogupalya residents say middle-class people have been getting water bills of Rs 15,000-16,000 and the BWSSB must take responsibility for it. Sai Narasimhan, another resident with a faulty bill, said, “I live with one other person in a small house with a bedroom and a kitchen. I have been living in this house for seven years and haven’t paid more than Rs 520 for water bill. I received a bill of Rs 13,000 for October. As an autorickshaw driver from a middle-class household, I don’t see why I should pay so much when it is not my fault. When I approached BWSSB ward officials during a water adalat, they said I could pay amount in instalments!” A BWSSB official admitted there have been a lot of complaints about billing from across the city. “But we are not changing the system as we have water adalats and more to help such people,” he said. “Sometimes people don’t realise the water tap is on. This is why we tell them it is important to have a ball valve to avoid wasting water. Regardless of how much water gets wasted, the Rs 78,000 billed to the Jogupalya resident is very steep and there seems to have been a lapse from our end. I will send our special squad to the location on Monday and have the meter tested,” the official said. The official added sometimes arrears not cleared may push up the monthly bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inflated-water-bills-vex-jogupalya-residents/articleshow/87705807.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

It will have four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City-Yelahanka-Devanahalli (Sampige), Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur-Chikkabanavara (Mallige), Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield (Parijaata) and Heelalige-Yelahanka-Rajanukunte (Kanaka).TOI had published an article, ‘Year after Centre’s nod, Bengaluru suburban rail project still on drawing board’ on October 21. However, Garg said the project is on track. “We are planning to float the first civil work tender (Kanaka Line) in a few days. All preparatory tender work is complete. We are planning to finalise the civil work tender of Kanaka Line by December 15 and to commence civil work by February 2022,” he said. He said around 85% of the land is ready. “The remaining 5-6% land from the state government and 7-8% from individuals will be acquired soon,” he added. While acquiring land in core city areas, felling of trees was a challenge for Namma Metro and building suburban corridors along existing railway tracks is likely to be a major issue for K-RIDE. The operations department of the railways rarely permits construction along operational tracks.Garg said: “We had to finetune the alignment after consulting South Western Railway which took some time. But all hurdles have been cleared now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/k-ride-set-to-float-civil-work-tenders-for-suburban-rail/articleshow/87705810.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Eating right is cricketers’ mantra||Bengaluru: Eating right is not just a diet fad for sportspersons, it is a lifestyle pattern. To ensure players stay healthy, the Karnataka State Cricket Association has roped in sports nutritionist Divya K Purushotham to monitor the daily intake of the senior men and the U-25 teams. The Karnataka teams are among the rare groups in the country to seek the services of an expert.Divya , a Chennai-based sports nutritionist, has been coordinating with team hotels to ensure the players stick to their diet charts and interacts with the players individually to implement the plan. The nutrition expert is a necessity for teams now, especially since they spend 5-6 days in quarantine before the league and knockout phases of all domestic competitions.Speaking to TOI about what goes into planning a team’s diet, Divya, who has over a decade’s experience of working with athletes across sport, explained: “They get boxed meals in quarantine but what we have to factor in is that they will be training in their rooms. We coordinate with the chefs in team hotels, the trainer and the individual players to understand the requirements. Also, their dietary preferences have to be factored in since a few of them are vegetarians.”On coordinating with the team hotels, Divya pointed out, “We request the chefs to change the menu according to the dietary requirements. Sometimes they give them desserts, which is banned during a tournament. Instead, we opt for an extra portion of sautéed vegetables.”Divya also revealed that the diet plans vary depending on the player's specialisation. “The diet plans change according to the position they play. It’s different for the batsmen compared to the bowlers. Even among bowlers the nutrition requirement of the pacers is different from spinners. Pacers get more carbohydrates and proteins which is very essential for their recovery.”To help players avoid unhealthy food, Divya revealed energy bars have been made available. “We have introduced custom-made energy bars, which are rich in antioxidants which help in recovery and also supplements,” she added.It is not just food, even hydration of players has been zeroed in on. “In hydration we had to bring about a change because the right amount of energy drinks need to be consumed. We have given energy drinks in measured portions to players individually,” she said.DO-IT-YOURSELF KITSWith resources limited amid the pandemic, players have been given a checklist of basic ingredients to be carried on tour. While it is yet to be implemented for the senior team, the U-25 team has been given a list of ingredients for their Do-It-Yourself (DIY) kits.“The U-25 players have been asked to carry cinnamon powder, turmeric and pepper which are immunity boosters. They will have to mix the ingredients in water and drink before going to sleep. Going forward we will request the senior players also to do the same,” stated Divya.‘NUTRITION PLAYS MAJOR ROLE IN PLAYER’S CAREER’Karnataka senior team’s strength and conditioning coach AT Rajamani Prabhu said, “Nutrition plays a major role in a player’s career. During the course of a tournament if they put on even 500gm, it affects them drastically, reducing their reactive time and speed. It is also essential for recovery. With a nutritionist on board, we are now able to monitor the players’ daily intake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/eating-right-is-cricketers-mantra/articleshow/87705815.cms||Manuja Veerappa

But he fell prey to militant bullets like his father died in the hands of insurgents in once violence-hit Bodoland Territorial Council area 14 years ago trying to broker peace. Assam cabinet minister Urkhao Gwra Brahma on Sunday evening announced that the state government will give Rs 50 lakh to Suman’s family. “The chief minister has told me to make an announcement of Rs 50 lakh. Besides, his family will get its dues from the Union government,” said Brahma. But money cannot heal the wounds of the family which lost two of the bread earners at the hands of militants within 15 years. When Suman’s body was about to reach his paternal home at Thekerakuchi village on Sunday night, his family members were inconsolabe. The kid was unaware of the harsh reality he had faced at such a tender age and was playing in the lap of his mother with a lollipop in his mouth. “My husband said he will surely come in December to see our son on his next birthday. But everything is finished,” said Suman’s wife, Juri. Suman returned to duty on July 15 after a few days’ break. Due to the poor mobile network near the international border along Myanmar, where he was on duty, getting a phone call from Suman was also a pleasant surprise. His last phone call to his wife was on the morning of the day of the ambush, hours before the militants launched the all-out attack on their convoy. “We are constructing a new concrete house. He was so concerned about the family and asked whether we needed more bricks to complete the house. It was a brief conversation that day,” said Juri. Suman joined the forces almost a decade ago with a resolution after his father was gunned down by insurgents in 2007 at their home. His father was heading a local peace committee during the troubled days when Bodo militancy could not be quelled despite all-out efforts by security forces. “Suman’s father was gunned down in the evening by suspected insurgents for being part of a peace initiative,” said a relative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/jawans-father-too-had-fallen-to-terrorists-bullets/articleshow/87705848.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Speaker Lok Sabha absent. Chairman Rajya Sabha absent. Not a single Minister present.

---||Patna||Bihar: No Sonepur fair for 2nd consecutive year||PATNA: The monthlong famous Hariharnath Kshetra Mela, commonly known as ‘Sonepur fair’, has been cancelled for the second consecutive year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. The fair held on the bank of Gandak river near Sonepur in November-December every year is also known for trading animals since the ancient era. Tourism minister Narayan Prasad said in view of the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19, the state government has not given permission to organize the Sonepur fair, which attracts huge crowd. “Even though the restriction has been eased, fair and big cultural gatherings are not allowed. However, considering the importance of the fair and the sentiments behind it, the prayer service and rituals will be held while maintaining social distancing and other safety protocols,” he told this newspaper. He added: “The district administration of Saran has been asked to make all the arrangements for the devotees as per the Covid-19 protocol.” On the day of Kartik Purnima, a large number of devotees from different places visit the Hariharnath Temple at Sonepur to offer prayers and take a dip in the holy Gandak and Ganga. This year, the Kartik Purnima is on November 19. Saran DM Rajesh Meena said the official fair will not take place because of Covid-19, but the religious prayers are allowed, so the Hariharnath Temple will be open for the devotees on Kartik Purnima. “All the necessary arrangements will be made to ensure peaceful celebration of Kartik Purnima as large number of devotees will start congregating from November 18. Ghats are being cleaned and being barricaded to ensure safety of devotees. Arrangements for lighting, watch towers, changing rooms, urinals and drinking water facilities will be made at the ghats,” Meena said. The DM told this newspaper that adequate security personnel will be deputed. “A team will be formed for crowd management and regulating devotees in view of the Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-sonepur-fair-for-2nd-consecutive-year/articleshow/87703978.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Bandh in Benipatti to protest RTI activist’s murder, five arrested||MADHUBANI: Benipatti observed complete bandh on Sunday in protest against the murder of an RTI activist and local web portal reporter, Buddhinath Jha aka Avinash Jha, allegedly by dubious nursing home operators against whom he had been writing and complaining to the district administration. The bandh, however, remained peaceful. The charred body of Avinash, strapped in a gunny bag , was recovered on Friday night. His brother Chandra Shekhar Jha had lodged a missing report at Benipatti police station on November 11, apprehending his kidnapping. In fact, Avinash had been missing since November 9. When this reporter visited Benipatti on Sunday, Avinash’s cousin Vikash Jha said the protest was a spontaneous reaction to the reported statement of Madhubani SP Satya Prakash to a news channel that a love affair might be the reason behind the alleged murder. This infuriated the locals who viewed this as an attempt to divert the people’s attention and save the culprits. Addressing a press conference at Madhubani, Benipatti SDPO Arun Kumar Singh said Chandra Shekhar, the son of Dayanand Jha, informed the police on November 10 night that his younger brother Buddhinath, 23, had been missing since the previous night. Acting promptly, the police took out the call details of Buddhinath’s mobile phone and found that he had his last telephonic conversation at 10pm with one Purnakala Devi, a nursing staff of Anurag Healthcare on Kataiyya Road, he said. The SDPO said when she was questioned, the woman lied that she was at her father’s place in Brahmpura village under the Arer police station area that night. This claim was found to be untrue on technical verification, which proved that she was at Benipatti. When interrogated further, she admitted that Avinash had come to the nursing home at about 10.15pm and met her. After sometime when they came out of the nursing home, five people waiting there kidnapped Avinash and took him towards the nursing home of K K Chaudhary. She identified the kidnappers as Raushan Kumar Sah, Bittu Kumar, Dipak Kumar Pandit, Pawan Kumar Pandit and Manish Kumar. They all have been arrested. An FIR (243/21) has been lodged against them, the SDPO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bandh-in-benipatti-to-protest-rti-activists-murder-five-arrested/articleshow/87703953.cms||---
---||Patna||Chirag shares his picture with PM Narendra Modi||PATNA: LJP (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Sunday shared his latest picture with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his Twitter handle apparently to show that he still enjoyed his blessings. “In a brief meeting, he (PM) sought to know about our well-being. I found the same zeal and intimacy to maintain the individual relationship in him (PM) like my late father,” Chirag tweeted. Lauding his father and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan for holding personal relationship above the party lines, Chirag said the departed leader remained always connected with the people and their welfare. “Logon aur unke hiton se jude rahne aur apnatva ka wahi jajba aadarniye Narendra Modi ji mein bhi dekha hai,” the Jamui MP tweeted. The tweet came barely two days after the lone LJP MLA from Langthabal in Manipur, Karam Shyam, joined the BJP ahead of the assembly polls there. On being asked, Chirag said, “This happens in every political party during elections and the LJP is no exception.” He, however, claimed that three prominent leaders from other parties would join the LJP (Ram Vilas) in Manipur soon. “We will disclose their names at appropriate time,” he revealed. At a press conference in Patna on Saturday, the Jamui MP said his faction would contest the next election in alliance with a formidable political group. He, however, hastened to add that the name of the political group that his party would tie up with would be disclosed at the right time. The change in the stand to fight election in alliance is considered to be a fallout of the byelection results in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats recently. The party candidates ranked third after JD(U) and the RJD. “We clinched more votes in both the assembly constituencies in comparison to a national party,” Chirag revealed. The Chirag faction of the LJP had earlier contested the 2020 assembly election solo and won only one seat. He again predicted a mid-term poll in Bihar. When reminded that he seldom attacked the BJP, Chirag said, “It is not that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-shares-his-picture-with-pm/articleshow/87703920.cms||Ramashankar

The ancient culture, traditions and languages of the South enrich India’s culture and ancient legacy. He said the Modi government respects all regional languages and, therefore, at today’s southern zonal council meeting, facilities for translation into all languages of the states that are in the Southern Zonal Council have been made, he said. Shah said he would be happy to see delegates feeling free to speak in the language of their states in the future. “We have been able to achieve 111 crore vaccine doses as of today during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a big achievement and an example of cooperative federalism. It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to leverage cooperative and competitive federalism to achieve all round growth in the country,” Shah said. He added, “In the last seven years we have held 18 meetings of zonal councils, compared to which very few meetings were held earlier.

---||Business||Indian patent filings grow despite pandemic||MUMBAI: India’s scorecard showed a decent improvement in intellectual property (IP) filings with higher applications in patents (nearly 6%) and trademarks (over 15%), driven by those filed in the pharmaceuticals sector in 2020. Globally, IP filings — including patents, trademarks and designs — rebounded in 2020, indicating the resilience of human innovation despite dire global and economic turmoil during the Covid pandemic, latest data from World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) showed. In contrast, during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, both patent and trademark filing activity had contracted sharply. Globally, trademark filing activity rose by 13.7%, patents 1.6% and designs by 2%, according to the World Intellectual Property Indicators report, which compiled new data from 150 national and regional authorities. While China’s IP office recorded the highest volume of trademark filing activity, India overtook Japan to become the fifth largest country for trademark filing activity. The strong growth in global trademark filing activity is driven by robust growth in products and services related to advertising & business management, pharmaceuticals, surgical, medical & dental goods. The share of filings related to pharmaceuticals increased from 4.1% in 2019 to 4.6% in 2020, while that of surgical, medical & dental goods increased from 1.5% to 2.3%, the data said. These trends were mirrored by certain countries that saw large increases of trademark filing activity. For instance, India’s 15.4% growth in trademark activity was driven by resident filings in pharmaceuticals. Further, worldwide patent-filing activity returned to growth in 2020 after the first dip in a decade in 2019, due to a decline in China. In 2020, China’s IP office reported growth again with 1.5 million patent applications, followed by the US, Japan, Republic of Korea and the European Patent Office. Together, these five offices accounted for 85.1% of the world total. Among the top 10 offices, only three — China (6.9%), India (5.9%) and the Republic of Korea (3.6%) — recorded growth in applications in 2020. Germany (62,105), India (56,771) and the Russian Federation (34,984), among others, also featured among the top 10 offices. Commenting on the particularly strong growth in trademark filings in 2020, WIPO director general Daren Tang said, “This shows how enterprises across the globe have brought new products and services to the market, as reflected by the double-digit growth in trademarks filing activity in 2020 despite the massive economic shock.” Interestingly, IP’s centre of gravity has shifted to Asia now with an increasing number of applications from the region, the latest data from WIPO showed. While a decade ago, half of overall 10 IP applications were filed in Asia, last year this number was close to seven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-patent-filings-grow-despite-pandemic/articleshow/87704869.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

He said the department has been tirelessly working to provide treatment to TB patients at the earliest. “According to the new plan, TB treatment will prove to be helpful in the prevention of potential diseases. With the TB Prevention Plan, it will protect people from getting infected with diseases when came in contact with TB patients. Awareness is being spread through various means so that people who get treatment from private doctors can also get the benefit of this scheme,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tb-preventive-treatment-scheme-to-cover-11-districts/articleshow/87703697.cms||Faryal Rumi

Only those who are working on the post of professor under the university service in Bihar and have at least three years of university service left are eligible to apply. Applicants are supposed to submit their biodata along with an affidavit to the effect that they are neither facing any charge nor involved in any criminal case. Candidates having administrative experience would be given preference. Welcoming the government decision, Bihar State Higher Education Council’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha said it would ensure fairness and transparency in the system of selection. Earlier, appointment to the post was made on the recommendation of the chief minister or education minister, he said. Working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, also hailed the new system of appointing the director. Under the changed socio-political scenario, higher education needs drastic improvement and the director of higher education would have to play a crucial role in it, he said. It may be mentioned here that the post of director of public instructions (DPI) in Bihar was created way back in 1874 and the senior most official of the Bihar Education Service (BES) Class I used to occupy the chair. This system continued till the early ’70s when university teachers opted for the university service in lieu of BES. Eminent academics like Gorakh Nath Singh, N S Nagendra Nath, Kalimuddin Ahmad, Ramola Nandi and Damodar Thakur had the distinction of serving as the director in the past. Later, the office of DPI was divided into several directorates. Today, we have directors of primary, secondary and higher education besides those of administration, research and training, mass education, and midday meal. The director of higher education happens to be an ex-officio member of the senate and syndicate of all the conventional universities in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-recruit-professor-as-director-of-higher-education/articleshow/87703740.cms||B K Mishra

Once again, a question mark is put on Sanskarinagari’s ‘safe city for women’ tag. Recently, a rape accused in Surat was sentenced within a month of the crime he committed, while the two balloon sellers – Kishan Mathasuriya and Jaso Solanki – who are in jail for the Navalakhi Compound crime are still under trial. Sources close to the case said that the duo’s trial is at evidence stage as 38 witnesses of the prosecution have been examined so far. The prosecution had a list of 98 witnesses for examination, but most of the names have been dropped. The two investigating officers, one of whom is the assistant commissioner of crime branch, will be examined next. After their examination, if the defence will have any witnesses then they will be examined and after the final arguments of both sides, the court will pronounce its order. The heinous crime had taken place on November 28 night in 2019 and police filed a chargesheet on January 22 last year. The case trial began five days later on January 27. Maximum delay was due to the pandemic and the lockdown as the courts were only taking up urgent matters for several months. During the course of trial, the defence lawyers used different tactics by submitting three applications. One of the applications was regarding investigation of the place of offence by the court which was rejected. Later, another application was done to make the survivor’s fiance a co-accused, which was also turned down and the accused were fined. The last application was done to re-examine the girl, her mother and the doctor who did her medical check-up, which too was turned down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-years-on-navlakhi-rape-accused-still-under-trial/articleshow/87704018.cms||Jay Pachchigar

One of the critical patients is in AIIMS, Delhi and two in PGIMER. With the transplantation of retrieved corneas restoring the sight of two corneal blind patients, five lives have been impacted in all. PGI director Prof Surjit Singh said, “It is an extremely hard decision but families like that of donor Manmohan Singh are a ray of hope, a silver lining in the dark lives of organ failure patients. It is through their magnanimity that hundreds of people each year are given a second chance at life. We are overwhelmed by their ‘spirit of giving.” On November 7, Manmohan, who was riding a two-wheeler met with an accident when his bike skidded on a bumpy road and his head hit the pavement, leading to grievous head injuries. Manmohan was shifted to PGI in critical condition on November 9. However, after three days of hospitalisation, the patient was declared brain dead. Transplant coordinators at PGI approached Rano Devi, the bereaved wife, who gave consent for the transplant. Rano Devi said, “We said yes to organ donation because it is far better to give someone new life rather than reducing these organs to ashes. That’s why despite the heartache that we are going through, we knew it was the right thing to do." Following her consent, the heart, liver and kidneys were retrieved from the donor for transplantation in matching recipients. As there was no matching recipient for heart in PGI, Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (ROTTO) PGIMER approached National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) in Delhi and with NOTTO’s intervention, retrieved heart of the donor was allocated to AIIMS Delhi for the matching recipient. It was sent from the institute on Saturday through a green corridor for International Airport, from where it was airlifted for its destination. Prof Vipin Koushal, nodal officer, ROTTO, PGIMER, said, “With NOTTO’s proactive intervention, the heart was airlifted as soon as it was retrieved. Green corridor was created from PGIMER to International Airport with active cooperation and liasoning of department of hospital administration, PGI Security, UT administration and Police.” Later, the liver and kidneys retrieved from the donor, through transplantation of simultaneous liver and kidney in one recipient and another kidney in the second recipient, enabled fresh lease of life to two more patients battling for survival here in PGIMER. With the transplantation of retrieved corneas, restoring the sight of two corneal blind patients, five lives have been impacted with the latest case of organ donation here at PGIMER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/organ-donation-saves-3-lives-restores-sight-in-2/articleshow/87704475.cms||---

Popular wedding destinations along East Coast Road (ECR), Kodaikanal and Yercaud have been sold out till November 2022. With guest restrictions gone, premium resort properties are seeing a rush. Those getting decked up on ECR include ITC Kences Palm Beach, Taj Fisherman’s Cove, GRT property Radisson Blu Temple Bay, InterContinental and Chariot Beach. Other hot wedding destinations include Dunnottar Bunglow on the lakeside in Kodaikanal and a couple of locations in the Shevaroy Ranges. Says Zubin Songadwala, GM of ITC Grand Chola and area manager, ITC Hotels-south: “We (Kences Palm Beach) are booked for almost all wedding dates until March, and more are on the way." Shubhangi N, GM sales and marketing, GRT Hotels & Resorts, adds that wedding bells are back at Radisson Blu resort Temple Bay. We have bookings up to November 2022, and that’s more than pre-Covid 2019." GRT’s yet-to-open property in Puducherry is getting inquiries for weddings next year, while Dune Resort is doing events with 100 guests or less for ‘high profile clients’. Vidya Gajapathi Raju Singh of Sumyog Wedding Planners says after the larger properties are taken, smaller beach properties are sought after. The cost of a wedding at a beach resort can cost Rs50 lakh to Rs1 crore, depending on the bells and whistles. Equally happy is Matrimony.com CMD Murugavel Janakiraman. “We have made a good comeback of weddings this year, and this includes demand for beach weddings,” he says. Tamil Nadu’s wedding planners are also looking at mountains and lake-view destinations. “Kodaikanal has emerged as a great destination for weddings. The Tamara is the latest property, while the Carlton by the lake has been popular,” says Vidya Singh. “Unlike the ceremonies of south Indian Hindu weddings, which start early in the morning, those from the northern states have late evening or night wedding ceremonies. Many couples from Kolkata and Delhi want a beach as the backdrop,” she says. Due to travel restrictions several families have chosen to conduct the weddings in a driveway location to give a sense of exclusivity and experience,” says GRT’s Shubhangi. Apart from the location advantage, resort weddings are also more popular now because of the hygiene and the cuisine on offer. Says ITC’s Songadwala: “Our location, cuisine, and health and hygiene initiatives are big draws.” And homestays are getting their share of business. “Dunnottar in Kodaikanal is a beautiful homestay bungalow that has enough rooms to accommodate a large family gathering, and is set on a lake with large grounds so perfect for a small wedding,” says Singh. GRT is getting calls for its Great Trails Resorts in Yercaud and Kodaikanal, besides its Mamallapuram property. The resorts offer a wedding specialist or wedding planners tie up with a property to coordinate the event. A hillside wedding can cost Rs 25 lakh upward for a night, which includes food, mehendi, music and basic reception décor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wedding-bells-ring-again-on-sandy-beaches-pristine-hills/articleshow/87704504.cms||---

Over the 40 years A V Dharmakrishnan has spent at the company, Ramco Cements’ production capacity has increased from 0.4 million tonnes from a single factory in Virudhunagar, to nearly 20 million tonnes across nine factories (including a capacity addition to be completed in three months) without diluting a rupee in equity. Its capital has been unchanged since 1962. "Life was not any struggle, it was easy paced," says Dharmakrishnan, who was born in a family of farmers, went to the government high school in Rajapalayam, and to Madurai’s Vellaichamy Nadar College to study BCom. He then went to Chennai to pursue chartered accountancy. After that, he chose Madras Cements (now rechristened Ramco Cements) as his parents saw the promoters Rajhas (from Rajapalayam) as people who followed a good value system. "SAIL was offering a job for Rs 1,600, but I joined Madras Cements for Rs 1,200 a month," he recalled. He joined the group as accounts officer. Four years later he was CFO and became the MD by 2012. AVD, as his close friends call him, follows what he calls the LCD principle in management -- loyalty, decision making with a conscience, and dedication to work. "Loyalty to the place (Ramco group), and all decisions must satisfy my conscience, and dedication to work will drive my work life," he says. Early on in his career, when cement manufacturing was seen as dull and drab, Ramco went on a massive digitisation drive, initially undertaken to reduce accountancy lag from six months. "The ERP project of Ramco Systems (a group company) has helped the company significantly," he says. "The world is waking up to ESG (environment, sustainability and governance) now. We set up our wind farm (capable of generating 166MW) way back in 1990," says Dharmakrishnan. His goal was to make Ramco a benchmark of efficiency in every parameter. "Today. we are among the most efficient cement makers and also the benchmark on shareholder returns for other companies to emulate," he said. To create price advantage, Dharmakrishnan spearheaded two key actions __ focus on cost reduction and commodity branding by introducing Ramco Supergrade. "I am happy that we were able to achieve both and that is because of a solid team at Ramco". The entire senior management has been with him for more than 25 years. "If I am not in the office I am at home, spending time with my granddaughter. With the pandemic, I have stopped my routine meditation at Ramakrishna Mutt, which allowed me to declutter my mind. I shall restart once things settle down," he says. Dharmakrishnan’s next goal is to sell the right type of cement to the buyer and provide concrete solutions. "If you visit a stockist you will see him dump some cement on the buyer. We have now developed 12 types of cement, each one for a different application. A buyer needs to be given the right product for the right application. It cannot be one size fits all. Things will change and we will evangelise this," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/loyalty-conscience-and-dedication-cement-his-place/articleshow/87704468.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

A new report from app intelligence firm AppAnnie puts India fourth globally in terms of highest daily time spent in apps after Indonesia (5.5), Brazil (5.4), and South Korea (5). The bulk of app adoption this year was driven by gaming , fintech, health and fitness, and e-commerce categories with crypto apps gaining huge ground, AppAnnie's data showed. India was the world’s largest market for mobile gaming in the first half of 2021 with users here installing 4.8 billion games compared to around 2.2 billion in the US and just around 1 billion in China. India downloaded one in five of all mobile games downloaded globally this year, AppAnnie said. Homegrown Ludo King app by Gametion Technologies continues to top the charts as it was the top game for the first half of 2021 in terms of downloads and active users. FAU-G (Fearless and United Guards) stood at second spot. Battle Royale game Free Fire came in at eighth spot. Despite Ludo and FAU-G, India’s mobile gaming scene lacks the local flavour, AppAnnie’s report notes, as domestic game apps barely figure in the charts with just 7.6% of the top 1000 games in India made by homegrown publishers compared to China where the home grown ratio is 60%. In the case of finance apps, indicating growing awareness around investing and crypto, Upstox Pro, WazirX and CoinSwitch emerged as the apps with the greatest growth in downloads in the quarter ended June. Interestingly, crypto trading apps also have healthy (around 60%) one-month user retention rates among Indian users. UPI has made India a “true pace-setter in mobile payments,” the report notes. The total downloads of merchant utility apps (the likes of KhataBook, OkCredit, BharatPe etc.) in India saw a 48% increase YoY in April-June 2021 to surpass 124 million. In shopping, AppAnnie’s data shows that the digital prowess of brick-and-mortar retail chains is nowhere close to the digit-first retail brands. Digital-first shopping apps saw 23 average sessions per user each month compared to just 10 in Bricks-And-Clicks retail (omnichannel) brands. Overall, India continues to hold firmly to its market leader status in the app economy emerging as the second largest market for app downloads after China. With 24 billion app downloads this year so far compared to around 24.3 billion apps in the whole year 2020 and around 18.9 billion in 2019, India is steadily growing as a mobile-first economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desis-spent-5-hours/day-on-apps-this-year-report/articleshow/87704438.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||This boot is on the right foot||Chennai: When the pandemic closed a door on Vietnam, it opened another for India. And through that door, a clutch of leather footwear makers in Tamil Nadu could march into an overseas market. The lockdown in Vietnam from July to October forced about 90,000 businesses to shut and a manufacturer of sports shoes could not supply five million pairs on time to a US-based global brand. Now, several Taiwanese companies that outsource manufacturing and coordinate supply for top global brands in the US are looking at Tamil Nadu, given its traditional strengths. Taiwanese company Fengtay, which makes Nike shoes, already has a foot in the state through a tie-up with Lotus Footwear in Cheyyar and is now expanding into Bargur and Tindivanam. More recently, Mohib Group, a traditional leather enterprise, signed an MoU with the TN government to invest `500 crore in a non-leather footwear unit in association with a Taiwanese company. It is expected to employ 20,000 people at a facility near Ambur. "We have to unlearn what we did yesterday and continuously evolve if we have to grow," says Mohib group chairman Mohammed Mohibullah Kottai. "While we maintain our growth in leather, we will not ignore new opportunities. Being in the fashion industry, we have to embrace change." Globally, 86% of the footwear sold is non-leather. The leather industry in Tamil Nadu, which accounted for 45%-50% of the annual Indian leather exports of $5.09 billion in 2019-20 and estimated to touch $5.9 billion in 2021-22, is looking at a growth opportunity. "An opportunity came our way around 25 years ago, but we missed it for various reasons. Indonesia and Cambodia benefited then. A bigger opportunity is now coming our way. We should swiftly grab it," says industry veteran and Farida Group chairman M Rafeeque Ahmed. "Let the industry continue to focus on leather, which has now become a niche segment for markets such as the US. Meanwhile, a bigger growth is happening in non-leather footwear and the industry here should expand its operations to this emerging segment," says Ahmed. "For India, the US is a big market. But for the US, we are only sixth or seventh on the priority list (Indian leather sector exports to the US touched $645.6 million in 2020-21 or 17.5% of that country’s leather exports). Hence the onus should be on us to chase this opportunity, rather than expecting them to come knocking here." And the industry expects support from the state government. "It should make available plug-and-play industrial sheds to enable units to quickly move in and establish assembly lines, besides setting up micro-parks for component units," says Ahmed. Council for leather exports (CLE) executive director R Selvam says global companies are looking at India for joint ventures. "It will take time to turn this into reality, but green shoots are visible. If not for the air travel restrictions, delegations from Southeast Asian countries would have been here," says Selvam. Industry representatives say Tamil Nadu should formulate a policy to catapult it into a major footwear destination, conduct roadshows in countries where big supply chain integrators and big brands are present. "The state should declare the non-leather footwear industry as a sunrise sector," says N Mohan, chairman, non-leather footwear panel to promote Make in India by CLE and co-chairman, Assocham for leather and footwear industries. "Given the success Tamil Nadu has achieved in other sectors, I am sure in two or three years all major players will be here." Tamil Nadu is planning to establish half a dozen ‘leather clusters’ across the state, including in places such as Ambur, Manaparai, Ramanathapuram and Manallur. An official said the government is aware of the potential. "Non-leather footwear is a green industry and labour intensive, but not water intensive. It will be promoted in earnest. The industry recently submitted a policy document and we are looking into it," the official said. Pooja Kulkarni, MD & CEO, Guidance Tamil Nadu, says the athleisure category is fast growing. "While leather will continue to remain a niche and luxury product, it is the non-leather footwear that will offer tremendous growth opportunities for at least the next 10 years. We have the capability and we are on the job. We need to create clusters so that we attract not just OEMs but also their numerous vendors, as happened with the automobile industry. We are in touch with the industry and their requirements for ready-built industrial sheds could be handled through Sipcot and Sidco," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/this-boot-is-on-the-right-foot/articleshow/87704489.cms||D Govardan

He has always lived as a commoner despite reaching great heights,” said Shah. Addressing the session, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said parents should try to pass on to their children the message of service orientation and kindheartedness in extending help to the poor, and added that trying to help others is the biggest asset that elders could leave as an inheritance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/commoners-bringing-home-padma-awards/articleshow/87704647.cms||Samdani MN

The guidelines, which come into effect on March 30 next year, bring the NBFC classification norms on a par with that of banks. The guidelines were notified by the central bank in the form of clarification on its prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisions (IRACP) pertaining to advances. “To ensure uniformity in the implementation of IRACP norms across all lending institutions, certain aspects of the extant regulatory guidelines are being clarified and/or harmonised, which will be applicable to all lending institutions,” the RBI said in its circular. Two classifications will directly affect NBFC norms. The first one pertains to when a delinquent borrower, who has been classified as an NPA, can be upgraded. In a bank, if borrowers default long enough to be classified as an NPA, they will have to repay all due principle and interest that has remained unpaid to shake off the NPA label. In case of NBFCs, some of them have been upgrading accounts if the borrower gets back on the repayment schedule and pays past interest. “The NPA upgradation criteria has been tightened for NBFCs. This could lead to a spike in NPAs as loans that were upgraded from NPA to SMA (special mention account) 2 can no longer be classified as standard,” said ICRA VP Anil Gupta. He added that banks were in any case upgrading NPAs to SMA only after all the overdue amounts with respect to principal and interest were received. This difference in asset classification is also the reason why banks that acquire NBFC portfolios end up reporting a small spike in NPAs. The other change — that lenders will have to classify borrower accounts as overdue according to their day-end process — forces for the due date irrespective of when the process is done. Many banks have been following a process where they classified a loan as default only if money was not received at the month-end. This would mean that a borrower who does not meet their payment obligation on say 15th of the month would be immediately classified as delinquent but if there is a payment on the 17th it would be upgraded. This would mean more work for banks in terms of reporting but overall the delinquency may not rise. Bankers say that if the same day default rule is applied there would be a lot of defaults as almost a third of borrowers don’t have enough balance on the due date. This is seen in the 31% bounce rates in auto-debit payments based on standing instructions. To increase awareness on the importance of timely payment, the RBI has asked all lenders to place consumer education literature on their websites, explaining with examples, the concepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA classification and upgradation, with specific reference to the day-end process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-new-norms-may-lead-to-surge-in-nbfc-bad-loans/articleshow/87704854.cms||Mayur Shetty

Addressing a press conference, Tejashwi said CM Nitish Kumar should drop Leshi as her name figured in the FIR lodged by Rintu’s widow Anulika Singh with the Sirsi police station. Leshi, her nephew Ashish Singh alias Ahiya and Sudesh Singh are among the four named accused in the FIR. Anulika has accused Leshi of hatching a conspiracy for the murder of Rintu as he was planning to contest the next assembly election from Dhamdaha against her. Tejashwi alleged that Rintu had submitted a written complaint with the local police apprehending his murder after an abortive attempt on November 3. However, the police didn’t take any action against the offenders, leading to his murder on Friday. The leader of the opposition in legislative assembly demanded that the CDR of the alleged conversation between Leshi and the Sirsi police station SHO should be made public. The SHO’s suspension is an eyewash, he alleged. Reacting to Tejashwi’s allegations, Leshi said investigation was underway and she was ready to face any action if found guilty in the probe. “Merely naming somebody in the FIR does not prove his/her involvement in any crime,” she said, asserting that her name was dragged in the case to tarnish her image. “The Nitish Kumar government does justice with everybody. Tejashwi should wait for the police investigation to be completed,” she told this newspaper over the phone. Taking a swipe at the RJD leader, Leshi said even Tejashwi was accused of harassing a Purnia Dalit, who was subsequently killed. “Did he resign or was arrested merely on the allegations?” she asked. Leshi got support from her cabinet colleagues Ashok Choudhary, Shahnawaz Hussain and BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, who said law will take its own course in the case. Earlier, Tejashwi alleged that murders, kidnapping and loot have become a routine affair in the state. The criminals were roaming free while Nitish’s police were watching as mute spectators. To drive home his point, he cited the murder of an RTI activist and web portal journalist, Buddhi Nath Jha alias Avinash Jha, in Madubhani. The victim’s kin had apprehended Jha’s kidnapping for murder. Yet the police remained idle and did precious little to search him. Tejashwi also cited several examples of police inaction, including that of a girl’ death in police custody in East Champaran district, murder of the nephew of former minister Raghunath Jha in Sheohar and rape of a girl in Nalanda during Chhath. “Nothing has happened in these cases as well,” he alleged. He further alleged that around 500 members of the business community have been killed in the past one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-seeks-leshis-resignation-minister-refutes-allegations-in-fir/articleshow/87704036.cms||Ramashankar

It will help pedestrians, who find it difficult to cross the busy and congested Station Road to reach Patna Junction. It will also be the first pedestrian subway with escalators in the city. The subway is a part of Railway Station Area Redevelopment Project of Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) and will come up by utilizing the funds to the tune of Rs68 crore. According to sources, the subway will be built around 8 metres deep. PSCL’s managing director-cum-Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the agency has been selected and the work will start once the foundation stone for the project is laid. “This subway will connect three important points, including Patna Junction, multimodal transit hub and multi-level car parking. People will find it convenient to travel to and from Patna Junction without facing the traffic rush near the Mahavir Mandir roundabout. The plan is to take pedestrians underground as much as possible and let motorists use the road. It will also ease off the traffic rush on Station Road,” he said. Sharma said the multimodal transit hub, in which different modalities of transport like private cabs, autorickshaws, buses will be catered, is also a part of the Railway Station Area Redevelopment Project. “A five-storey building will bring seamless passenger transfer. The detailed project report of the building is being prepared by the building construction department and soil testing at Bakri Bazaar was done on Saturday (November 13) by the officials concerned,” he told this newspaper. An overbridge connecting the second-level of multi-level car parking with Station Road flyover (between pillar 7 and 8) will also be constructed for proper utilization of the existing parking space. Commuters coming to Patna Junction would use this overbridge to park their cars directly at MLP without facing any congestion near the Budh Marg. The estimated cost of the overbridge is around Rs17 crore. Meanwhile, the construction work on Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) building on the Patna SSP office premises near Gandhi Maidan has been completed under the Smart City Project. L&T has been selected to set up an IT-based monitoring system to provide various smart services and solutions. PSCL’s public relations officer Harshita said the company will lay optical fibre, develop server room and other software to provide smart services to the city residents. The ICCC will integrate all civic and essential services into a single platform aimed at monitoring and addressing public issues in real time. The total cost of the project is around Rs221 crore while Rs15 crore has been spent on the construction of ICCC building. According to sources at PSCL, the ICCC building will be inaugurated this month by chief minister Nitish Kumar, who will also lay the foundation stone for the subway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-construct-subway-with-escalators-near-patna-junction/articleshow/87703672.cms||Faryal Rumi

The explosion damaged the houses of Suleiman Ansari (80) and his neighbour Ayaz Khan (64) and shattered the windowpanes of houses belonging to Nasim Ahmed, Bhola Sao and Ashok Sao in the neighbourhood. Khan’s wife Zaida Khatoon (60), Ansari’s wife Saddrina Khatoon (75) and her grandsons Abdul Ahmed (2) and Mohammad Shahid (9) were injured in the explosion. Injured Zaida told this newspaper that she was cooking food when the blast took place and the outer wall fell on her. Eyewitnesses said they spotted a greenish-white smoke billowing from the explosion spot with strong gunpowder smell. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, SP (west) Ashok Kumar Mishra and Danapur SDPO Syed Imran Masood reached the spot with forensic experts for investigation. Masood said Ansari’s two sons, Shafiq Ahmed and Taufiq Ahmed alias Fasiq Ahmed, and Khan’s son Mohammad Golu have been detained for interrogation. He did not rule out the possibility of explosion from any low-intensity bomb. “Investigation is being carried out from all angles, including if cooking gas leakage caused the explosion,” he said. Masood, a young IPS officer, said forensic experts have collected samples from the explosion site and their analysis will make things clear. “There is no splinter, shrapnel or severe burn injury from the blast,” the SSP said. Sources said preliminary tests carried out by the forensic experts could not immediately establish the presence of any explosive substance. Ansari’s family is into garment stitching business while Khan sells clothes on roadside in Danapur. Broken bricks from walls, acting as projectiles, damaged the household items of both the families. Zaida has received at least eight stitches on her head while Abdul’s ears were damaged due to explosion shockwaves which resulted in severe bleeding. He was initially taken to Danapur primary health centre from where he was rushed to the PMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-injured-in-explosion-at-danapur-3-detained/articleshow/87703853.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The gap between the minimum and maximum temperatures narrowed to just three degrees as the cloud cover persisted throughout the day. It drizzled occasionally in some areas as well. Moderate rain has been predicted by the Met office on Monday under the impact of a low-pressure trough that stretches between Tamil Nadu and Gangetic Bengal. Kolkata could receive between 20mm and 40mm rain over the next 24 hours, but the skies could start clearing up from Tuesday. Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 25.8°C and a minimum of 22.3°C on Sunday. The maximum was five notches below normal. “We expect a persistent and more intense spell of rain either late on Sunday or Monday morning. The low-pressure trough and easterly winds have combined to turn conditions favourable for a rainy spell. The trough will fizzle out by Tuesday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. The temperature had started sliding below 30°C last week. “When a cloud cover remains, some of the sun’s rays are reflected back into space. This reduces the volume of the sun’s energy and heat reaching the Earth’s surface, pushing the temperature down. This is what we saw on Sunday and this was responsible for a difference of just three degrees between the maximum and minimum temperatures,” said a weather scientist. The minimum temperature may start sliding down from Tuesday as the cloud cover recedes. But it could be a very slow and gradual drop. “The mercury may drop by a degree, so we don’t expect the weather to turn chilly immediately. Onset of winter is still some distance away. The minimum temperature has to slide below 15°C for three consecutive days for winter to officially set in. It rarely happens before December 15,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/max-temp-at-25-8c-as-city-wakes-up-to-cloudy-sunday/articleshow/87704385.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Chona is not alone. A lot of affluent families from the city are now migrating to foreign countries after the outbreak of the pandemic. “With better infrastructure, I have moved here at least for a period of two years so that my children can get a better life and education,” said Chona, who is the managing director and co-founder of HRPL Restaurants Private Limited. Chona already has a thriving business back home and now he is also eyeing business opportunities in the foreign land. “While I and my family have just settled out in this city, I am looking for investment opportunities in the food and beverage as well as FMCG segment, which has been the expertise of our business back home as well. With greater connectivity and a gateway to the world’s market, I am sure it will be a strategic location,” he added. Ever since the pandemic struck, many businesspersons and professionals are shifting their base overseas seeking better opportunities for education, work and business as well as a better quality of life. Apart from Dubai, Canada is another most preferred destination. Pankaj Shah, who owns a 22-year-old business in designing of embedded software, robotics and AI, said, “We started an office out of Canada some two-and-a-half years ago and my son has been handling that for some time now. Our family is in the process of transitioning to Canada. We are looking at better opportunities for our business and it will be good for the younger generation too to get some international exposure.” Immigration consultants suggest there has been a spike in people seeking out work opportunities in countries like Dubai, Canada and even Singapore. Ahmedabad-based businessman Mignesh Parekh shifted to Canada last year with his family. “Due to the nature of my business I used to travel to Canada at least thrice a year. It was last year when I decided to shift base, with a planned transition. My kids will get better exposure and education whereas my wife, who is a physiotherapist, also has better work prospects here,” he said. Sajid Teli, CEO of an Ahmedabad-based immigration consultant, said, “We have received a sizeable number of requests since the beginning of 2021, and the number of clients approaching us has almost touched pre-Covid levels. Even professionals who get a better opportunity are looking to move abroad. For instance, Aman Kumar, a hospitality-sector professional, said, “I have worked in the hospitality sector for several years in India with different brands. However, Dubai being a market driven by tourism, the opportunities are far better here and the biggest positive is a better work-life balance due to which I decided to move there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/affluent-amdavadis-migrate-abroad/articleshow/87704498.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pedestrian crossings on Bypass may get manual drop gates soon||KOLKATA: Manually operated drop gates are likely to be introduced at pedestrian crossings on Bypass. In the past two-and-a-half months, Bypass has witnessed 10 accidents, which led to the death of three persons, including two pedestrians. The pedestrian cross-over volume has increased sharply between Highland Park and Ruby crossing, the stretch between VIP Bazar and Panchannagram, and between Chingrighata and Bengal Chemical. “At the multiple accident review meetings at Lalbazar last week, pedestrian cross-over challenges on some stretches were cited as a major concern,” said an officer. Other problems, like lane jumping and dangerous riding, were also pointed out, said sources. According to the new proposal, each major crossing with a portable drop gate will have at least four to five cops present during peak hours. At the less important crossings, two cops will be deputed. “Unlike automated boom barriers that open and close in sync with traffic signals, manually operated drop gates allow police more flexibility in easing pedestrian pressure. This will remain a stop-gap solution at crossings that handle huge pedestrian movement till FOBs or subways are planned,” an officer said. “In addition, police will ensure the median dividers are barricaded — except at crossings — to stop illegal crossovers,” said an officer. The cops have also proposed collecting fines from pedestrians who jaywalk. Cops have also requested KMDA to ensure future subways do not force pedestrians to climb up and down too many stairs — the primary reason why people avoid them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pedestrian-crossings-on-bypass-may-get-manual-drop-gates-soon/articleshow/87704407.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The urban development department is also making arrangements for toilets so that local slum dwellers do not have to use the sewerage ditches to relieve themselves. “I’ve asked the engineers to find out if any manhole was open. They will be immediately covered,” said Kolkata corporation mayor Firhad Hakim, adding, “I came to know that slum dwellers use these spaces as toilets for the kids. I have asked the local ward coordinator to earmark a space where a toilet could be built for them.” Surajit Chakraborty, a local, said he fell into a nearby ditch nearly six months ago and broke his leg. Locals, like Sk Nuruddin, also raised concerns about kids using the pavement on their way to school. the school going kids who use the pavement. Sk Nuruddin, a local, said, “There are two schools and kids will start going in a few days. This will create trouble for them.” Meanwhile, Trinamool ward coordinator Puspali Sinha (ward 2) has asked KMC to conduct an immediate survey on the state of manholes in the Dum Dum-Cossipore belt. A member in the KMC board of administrators overseeing the sewerage and drainage department, Tarak Singh said a list of uncovered manholes in the Cossipore-Dum Dum area was handed over to state PWD officials in September after a deluge asking them to take immediate action.

Among four others arrested in the case, three are women — Dalia Nath, Priya Chakraborty and Anita Gupta. Residents of Rahara, the Mitra sisters were known as daughters of a former Army personal. The duo had been arrested earlier on similar charges of fraud, said the CID. The CID cyber cell added that though multiple such call centres had been busted earlier, this is the first time they have come across an all-woman gang. “The arrested are the owners and main operators of the fake call centre, which they started after renting the property. We have seized multiple phones, incriminating documents, bank documents and registers,” said a CID statement. A case in this regard has been initiated. The sisters had made a name for themselves in Baguiati’s Loknath Park for providing employment to women for the past five months. On Friday, however, their crimes were revealed when the CID’s cyber cell came calling. The sisters had told their employees to call up people to ask if they had vacant plots or empty rooftops and were interested in renting out the space for mobile towers, the officer said. “They targeted people in the districts and other states and would offer incredibly high returns for small spaces.” The accused would convince those interested to pay a huge sum as “registration fee”, “no-objection fee” and “GST charges”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-women-con-gang-busted/articleshow/87704401.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The city’s current meteorology is also conducive and good flow of air is not allowing pollutants to settle in the lower strata of the atmosphere. However, the sustained cloud cover can change the pollution level drastically. Times ViewWe must learn from Delhi and do everything we can to preempt such a situation here. Kolkata, too, has several bad-air days in a year, with vehicular emission being a key contributor.On Sunday, the city’s ambient air quality improved from ‘moderate’ to satisfactory, with AQI plunging below 100 across stations. “Satellite monitoring of crop residue burning proved extremely effective last year. We managed to activate the local administration the moment we located a flame and it was doused before it could pollute the air. This year, we are also receiving data to help the administration trace fires and take action on the ground,” said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra. Track the pollution level in your cityCrop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana has left Delhi gasping for breath and Kolkata faces a similar situation when crop residue is burnt in Hooghly, Burdwan or North 24 Parganas. WBPCB is also monitoring the dump yards of Dhapa and Pramod Nagar so that fire fuelled by constant generation of methane can be doused immediately. WBPCB has moved the proposal of deploying fire tenders at these dump yards. “Because of the burning of assorted garbage, the fumes are noxious and extremely harmful,” said a WBPCB scientist. “I dread peak winter when lower radiative temperature at the ground causes calm wind conditions lowering the vertical wind speed below 2m/second. Then no amount of pre-emptive measure will work as pollutants hang at the lower strata of the atmosphere and pile up every day,” said Rudra. WBPCB has started distributing gas ovens to food vendors to replace biomass burning with LPG. Besides, WBPCB will soon float tenders for water sprinklers, which will spray unfiltered water mixed with dust suppressant chemicals that will make dust particles join together into a bigger particle, not allowing them to float in air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pcb-takes-steps-to-prevent-del-like-pre-winter-pollution/articleshow/87704396.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

A heritage conservation committee has to be constituted for advising the VMRDA in preparation of a list of heritage sites in the region and for their conservation/preservation. The earlier master plan of the VMRDA identified nearly 100 heritage sites and structures in its jurisdiction, including over 40 from Vizag city. Of these heritage sites, six sites including Bavikonda, Thotlakonda, and Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple are under the protection of the department of archaeology and museums. But a majority of the heritage sites remain without protection from any authority. According to a close observer of the developments with VMRDA, the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (which has been upgraded to VMRDA) for the first time had envisaged a master plan for 15 years from 1986 and 2001 without paying any attention towards the heritage structures. The revised master plan-2021, with expanding horizons of the Vuda, laid down regulations for the effective conservation of heritage sites. As per the VMRDA master plan-2041, a list of heritage sites is to be prepared. This will be supplemented by the development authority on the advice of the heritage conservation committee. Before being finalised, objections and suggestions of the public have to be invited. And on the recommendation of the heritage committee on the objections and suggestions, the state government will accord the final approval to the list of heritage sites. The listed heritage buildings and precincts may be graded into three categories, including grade-I, II and III. For instance, the heritage grade-I comprises buildings and precincts of national or historic importance, embodying excellence in architectural style, design, technology, material usage and aesthetics. They may be associated with a great historic event, personality, movement or institution. When it comes to the scope of changes for the grade-I heritage sites, no interventions will be permitted either on the exterior or interior of the heritage building or natural features unless it is necessary in the interest of strengthening and prolonging the life of the buildings, precincts or any part or features. For this purpose, absolutely essential and minimum changes would be allowed and they must be in conformity with the original.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-master-plan-lays-focus-on-heritage-conservation/articleshow/87704598.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Plans afoot to set up granite mining zone in Prakasam district||AMARAVATI: Setting its focus on unexplored mining areas, the state government has decided to close down the existing state highway for a distance of about 4 km near Chimakurthy in Prakasam district. This will facilitate the government to create an exclusive mining zone. The state government is planning to lease out the land, which is expected to hold vast reserves of black galaxy granite, to private developers. The land on which the state highway passes through on the outskirts of Chimakurthy is the only stretch that has been left unexplored in the region. Thousands of acres of land in the villages of Rajupalem, Lakshmipuram and Budavada, close to Chimakurthy have already been excavated since the discovery of galaxy granite in the region. Sources said reserves in areas on both the sides of highway are almost empty and the local granite industry is finding it difficult to extract quality stone. However, studies by the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has found that about 250 to 400 acres of land underneath the state highway holds huge granite reserves. Although the previous TDP government wanted to lease out the area to private developers, it backtracked following protests from locals against plans to close off the roads. Then roads and buildings minister and granite industrialist Sidda Raghava Rao took the initiative to create a bypass road to Chimakurthy. But with the construction of the bypass road getting delayed, plans to take over the state highway land did not materialise. Upon learning about the issue, the state government had now decided to close down the highway to take over the land for mineral extraction. Sources said the state government has already transferred the stretch to the APMDC to initiate the lease process. Meanwhile, the roads and buildings department, which manages the state highway, has been directed to lay a bypass road to connect both ends of the state highway. Sources said another bypass would be laid to connect the existing bypass road near the NSP canal. A flyover on the NSP canal will also be taken up. Sources said the vehicles carrying granite would be diverted via the bypass road without being allowed to enter Chimakurthy town. Passenger vehicles, including APSRTC buses, will be allowed to enter the town from the bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/plans-afoot-to-set-up-granite-mining-zone-in-prakasam-dist/articleshow/87704612.cms||Samdani MN

Even after 10 days of the 18-year-old Navsari girl’s alleged gang rape in Vadodara and recovery of hanging body in suspicious condition from Gujarat Queen Express coach, Valsad police are clueless about perpetrators of crime. Police received the postmortem report on Sunday on 10th day, but they are non-committal if she was was raped, murdered or she committed suicide. Her body was found hanging on November 4. In the postmortem report, three injury marks were found on lower back, thigh and waist. “The injury marks are of scratch and around four to five days old according to the postmortem report. She must have suffered the injuries during rape,” said a police officer part of investigation. Cops are yet not clear if the girl was killed or committed suicide. During investigation, it was found that she urinated while hanged. Police also found that her legs were touching the floor and it is not possible for anyone to hang herself in this position. She was found hanging to the luggage shelf using her dupatta. “There are no signs of strangulation or injury due to resistance if someone killed her. It is possible that the dupatta loosened after a while and her feet touched the floor,” said a police officer who ruled out the possibility of murder.  “We are yet to receive viscera and vaginal swab results from the forensic science laboratory. Only after the report things will get clear,” said a senior police officer. Supervision of the case has been handed over to Subhash Trivedi, in-charge IGP CID crime and railways. Trivedi arrived in Vadodara on Sunday and collected progress reports from various investigating teams. Multiple agencies of police including Valsad railway police, local crime branch (LCB) of Government Railway Police, Vadodara, detection of crime branch (DCB), Vadodara city and DCB Ahmedabad city have also joined the investigation. “Police are working to gather some important details only after that we will get a clear idea of who is involved. We will soon come out with facts,” Trivedi told TOI. Police investigation revealed that a few hours before the girl’s death she visited Surat city on the night of November 3. She is believed to have reached the city by bus from Navsari. She had informed her mother about plans to visit Maroli. She spent some time at Surat city bus depot and then went to Surat railway station. Her movement was captured by cameras at the railway station. She boarded the Gujarat Queen Express and did not get down at Navsari. Later her body was found early on November 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/injuries-on-private-parts-reveal-rape/articleshow/87704137.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Exactly two years ago when he sat across the table from Dr. Francois Carre at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire in France, Anwar couldn’t believe what the leading expert on cardiology in sports was telling him. Dr. Carre, head of sports medicine at the hospital, told Anwar, then just 19, that the “practice of a competitive sport in competition presented an excessively high risk of serious cardiac accident.” Anwar, 21, was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition where the heart muscle wall becomes abnormally thick and affects the pumping of blood. For footballers, it’s a risky proposition with even the seemingly fittest – England midfielder Fabrice Muamba, for example – collapsing on the field. “When I heard the doctor, I thought the world was ending for me,” Anwar tells TOI, recalling that evening in Rennes. “I was shocked to hear and didn’t know what was happening. Since childhood, all I have done is play football.” Anwar grew up herding cattle just as his father and family had done in Punjab. Football was his passport for a better life, and he seemed on the right track, particularly when he played every minute of India’s campaign in the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017. In the words of his mentor, Ranjit Bajaj, “Anwar is a once in a generation footballer.” The talent seemed lost when doctors in France reiterated their opinion. Anwar, all of them said, couldn’t play competitive football. “From France, I made a phone call to Ranjit sir and my family. They told me not to worry, and just be patient. They motivated me. It’s only because of them that I am here today. Otherwise, I don’t know what would have happened to me,” says Anwar. Since being forbidden to play by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under its umbrella, Anwar shut himself in his room at home. His reaction, in his own words, “was off.” The lockdown imposed to control Covid-19 in March didn’t help. In-between, AIFF officials got in touch with his father and explained the consequences of Anwar continuing to pursue competitive football. They offered him a job – he could choose to become a youth coach, scout or administrator. “I didn’t want any of those jobs,” says Anwar. “My mentality was not for coaching. I was focused only on playing. Coaching job is fine, but not right now. I was meant to be a player and I wouldn’t stop for anything or anyone. I made it clear that if not at the top, I’d play in lower divisions, non-recognised football tournaments, anything. But I would not stop playing.” He didn’t, and backed by Bajaj, owner of the Minerva Football Academy in Punjab, started training all over again. He sought advice from other doctors who provided him hope. When AIFF were not willing to budge, he continued to knock on every door, including the Delhi High Court. To take care of his congenital heart condition, Anwar listened to experts and made adjustments to his lifestyle. Growing up on a non-vegetarian lifestyle, he quit meat, turned vegan and stayed away from energy drinks too. It was tough. “Meat is something I’ve enjoyed since I was a kid. It’s very dear to me,” he says with a hearty laugh. Anwar quit his vegan diet after six months. When the Delhi High Court offered a lifeline and allowed him to play after more than a year, Anwar grabbed the chance. He played in lower divisions in Uttarakhand, Punjab, and later Delhi. Bajaj, meanwhile, hired top experts from London to plead his case and the AIFF medical committee eventually cleared him to play if he could “produce an affidavit claiming full responsibility, along with details of the medical precautions to be taken by him, and his prospective club to make him eligible to play competitive football.” For a year, FC Goa had tracked him. He seemed a natural fit for a club which loved to play football on the front foot; Anwar, a defender, was top scorer in the recent I-League Qualifiers. When the path was clear, invited him to train. Anwar will officially sign for the club when the transfer window opens on January 1. He is expected to make his much-awaited debut in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier of Indian football, 24 hours later against Kerala Blasters. “I am very excited,” says Anwar. “I have been waiting to play again at the top for a very long time. Everyone knows I was forced to play lower divisions but that turned out to be an experience for me. Whatever happens, happens for the best.” Anwar is ready to “start all over again.” That it will be with Goa is just what he had dreamed all along. “I have played more games in Goa than anywhere else. We trained here for the under-17 World Cup, then Indian Arrows. We played a lot of (friendly) matches with FC Goa. They have a good style, they keep the ball and entertain. I saw the coach (Juan Ferrando) at the Durand Cup and he’s also good. “Honestly, I can’t express how excited I am. My family and those close to me have gone through a lot. Ranjit sir too. They are all just as excited as me. Having waited for so long for this opportunity, I will not let it slip out of my hands,” says Anwar. Everyone’s waiting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/anwar-alis-dream-now-just-a-heartbeat-away/articleshow/87724294.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The body of the third and elder brother was also recovered by Sahil. On November 9 Sahil’s mother Ranjana and sister Shraddha, who were washing clothes on the bank of the Mhadei river in their village at Betkekar wada saw three brothers drowning after they were swept away by currents. They immediately alerted Sahil who jumped into the river and managed to save two of the three brothers. Unfortunately, the elder brother lost his life in the river, Sahil managed to pull out the two brothers from the river. Valpoi residents have praised this act of bravery and appreciated him for his selfless act while requesting the government to honour Sahil with a bravery award. Narrating the incident Sahil said that he felt sad when he saw the body of the older boy floating in the river. He said that while he managed to save the two, one life he could not save. Sahil who is a student of Class XII at the Government Higher Secondary School, Valpoi, said, “My mother and sister came running to me and told me that due to strong currents the three brothers were getting swept into deep water. My uncle Sagar and I jumped into the river and started looking for the three.” He added that after 10 minutes he managed to bring out the 10-year-old boy who was in a semi-conscious state and administered him first aid and later a local shifted the youngster to Valpoi community health centre in his vehicle. “I went in again and started searching in the river. I saw the second brother who was holding on to branches in deep water. I swam and brought him safely to the bank of the river and ventured again and continued looking for the third boy but sadly I found a floating body deep into water which I fished out,” he said. Sahil was felicitated by the Valpoi police station and a local NGO. Valpoi police inspector Harish Gawas said, “There are very few people who help others by risking their own lives and Sahil is one of them. This boy has done a commendable job by saving two lives,” Gawas said. Health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane said, “I am really proud of Sahil Laad, a youth from Valpoi who, without even a thought jumped into the river to save two precious lives. I will be recommending to the chief minister to present Sahil Laad with a bravery award to honour his bold act.” Councillor of Valpoi Municipal Council Idris Shaikh said that the courageous act is highly appreciated. “I am very proud that Sahil is from my ward. I request the state government to kindly consider Sahil’s name for the bravery award as he dared to dive into the deep river to bring back the drowning children from the brink of death,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teen-risks-life-to-save-duo-from-drowning-awarded-for-bravery/articleshow/87704997.cms||Afaq Khan

A conference of ministers and senior officials from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were convened by devaswom and SC/ST welfare minister K Radhakrishnan on Tuesday, wherein the participating states discussed and raised their requests to ensure a safe and secure pilgrimage season. In the meeting, G Vani Mohan, principal secretary (Hindu religious and charitable endowments) department of Andhra Pradesh, requested that Kerala should consider favourably allotting land at Nilackal for setting up a rest house for devotees from Andhra, as about 50% Sabarimala devotees are from there. In exchange, it would allot land for Kerala at Tirumala-Tirupati, a major pilgrimage centre in Andhra. Telangana too requested for land allotment at Nilackal In September 2015, the UDF government had decided to give five acres owned by Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) at Nilackal to Telangana to build and operate accommodation and facilitation centre for the Sabarimala pilgrims from there, with land ownership vesting with TDB. The state government had also allotted five acres to Karnataka government through an agreement between TDB and Karnataka government. In return, Telangana government had assigned one acre at Mahendra hills in Hyderabad for setting up Kerala Bhavan to provide accommodation and tourism facility for visitors from Kerala to Hyderabad. However, the allotment of land for other states had run into legal complications. The decision of the state government was then stayed by the high court. “The land at Nilackal was supposed to be used for the development of Sabarimala. The matter has since been stayed by the court. Now that the requests from other states have been made again, the Travancore Devaswom Board will discuss the matter on the further steps to be taken,” said TDB president N Vasu. In the meeting on Tuesday, Puducherry PWD and law minister K Lakshminarayanan said that more than 50,000 devotees are expected to arrive at Sabarimala from Puducherry. Senior officials who represented Telangana and Tamil Nadu in the meeting, requested the state to open control rooms at major centres enroute to Sabarimala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/other-states-seek-land-for-pilgrim-facility-centres/articleshow/87704496.cms||KP Saikiran

Hazel’s swimming expedition was an attempt at spreading awareness about the need for cleaner oceans for the sake of environment. A state-level swimming champion who recently passed out of Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School in Thane, Hazel was felicitated by Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha as she came out of the water at Gateway. Her coach, Umesh Uttekar, lauded her maiden attempt in long distance swimming. Talking to TOI, Hazel said, “I wanted to swim from Elephanta to Gateway as I strongly feel about the poor condition of our seas and oceans. A lot of plastic trash, polluting industrial waste and domestic sludge is daily dumped into the oceans, which is not good for the environment. Even as I swam today, I had to be careful to avoid floating plastic bottles, waste paper, cardboard cartons and general garbage. It’s very unfortunate.” She added, “Our oceans are the origin and engine of all lifeforms of our planet, yet we uncaringly dump a lot of plastic and chemical into them. I know many swimmers who avoid swimming in the open seas because there is a lot of visible dirt and pollution. Let us not turn our seas into a dump yard.” Her proud father, Mitesh Raikundalia, said, “Hazel wants to swim across the legendary English Channel in the next two years, which is why it is important to first swim locally along the Mumbai coast. However, the dirty condition of the Arabian Sea deters many. I am happy my daughter has the will and dedication to swim long distances.” Coach Uttekar pointed out that the recent lockdowns were tough phases for Hazel as she could not access any of the swimming pools. However, as soon as circumstances improved, she again started her rigorous training in pools before making her debut dive into the sea. She was accompanied by pilot boats consisting of observers, time-keepers, her coach and family members. Annually, we offload over 180 million tonnes of toxic waste into the sea. Around 8 million metric tonnes of plastic trash (which is equivalent to 57,000 blue whales) is also annually dumped into the oceans which is disastrous for the marine biodiversity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-maiden-attempt-teen-swims-14km-to-save-the-seas/articleshow/87705667.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Mangaluru||Rain pattern worries farmer documenting rainfall since decades||Mangaluru: A Sullia farmer who has been manually recording rainfall for the past four decades has expressed concern about the changing rainfall pattern in recent years. Since 1976, Pataje Govindayya Sathyanarayana Prasad, 63, an agriculturist from Balila in Bellare, approximately 85 kilometres from here, has been keeping track of rainfall in his backyard. The region receives 165 days of rain on average each year, but so far this year, the region has received 177 days of rain, and is likely to cross 200 days by the end of the year. The depression that has formed in the Bay of Bengal may bring rain to the region over the next few days. The region witnessed 200 days of rain in 1978. Rainfall has also been recorded every month from March 2020 to November this year, which was not the case previously, he said. Every day, the farmer broadcasts rainfall details for his village on his Facebook page and Whatsapp groups, as well as rainfall statistics and zodiac signs. Since 1976, he has not missed a single day of recording rain from 8am to 8am (24 hours) and has served as an inspiration to many people. The rainwater is collected in a glass jar that rests securely on a three-foot-tall pedestal. In Sullia, Puttur, Kadaba, Karkala, Belthangady, and Udupi, there are currently about 50 people who record rain the traditional way. The aim is to get at least 100 more people to record rainfall in their backyards. The region receives an average of 4,500 mm of rainfall every year, with this year's total expected to exceed 5,000 mm. “Also, in general, if we have abundant rainfall for three years in a row, the fourth year is expected to get less rainfall. However, in recent years, we have seen a shift in this pattern, with rainfall increasing. If at least three people document rainfall in a village, we will be able to understand the exact pattern,” he said. The destruction of the western ghats and the El Nina effect, according to Prasad, are to blame for the change in rainfall pattern and climate change. Agricultural activity will be affected due to this, as well as the quality of arecanuts, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rain-pattern-worries-farmer-documenting-rainfall-since-decades/articleshow/87703750.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

But seemingly, fate too got adventurous leaving not only the duo, but their kin too, with an unforgettable mid-sea nightmare. Ajit Kathad, a health worker of a village primary health centre, and his wife Sarla, a teacher went for parasailing ride at Nagoa beach in Diu on Sunday morning. Just a minute into the ride, the couple had a close shave while floating several metres up in the air mid-sea with only their lifejackets and an uncontrollable parachute above their heads to hang on to after the rope tied to the boat broke. Kathad and his wife did not realize immediately, but his elder brother Rakesh, who was recording a video on his mobile phone, screamed in horror seeing his brother and sister-in-law flying away on their own. As the shocked couple safely landed in the sea, they were rescued immediately and brought ashore. “I was recording the video and had no idea what to do when the rope broke. I could see my brother and sister-in-law falling from a great height, and I never felt so helpless as I did at that moment,” a teary-eyed Rakesh said. Owner of Palms Adventure and Water Sports, Mohan Lakshman told TOI, “This is first time that an incident like this has happened in the past three years because there were heavy winds on Sunday. We have well-trained staff for rescue operations going by the guidelines and they have all been trained in Goa.” Lakshman operates similar waters sports in Daman too. Later, Rakesh told reporters that he had noticed that the rope was weak, and fearing it may snap with weight, he had even warned the people managing the ride about it. However, they assured him that nothing would happen and that the damaged part of the rope would not even go up in the air, he added. Sarla was in such a state of shock that she could not speak for few minutes. “My wife and I were talking when the rope snapped, but we did not realize it. After a few seconds we understood that we were on our own,” Kathad said.  “We could have fallen in the sea or even on the land. But when we questioned the staff, they arrogantly brushed off their responsibilities,” he alleged. The families had taken their children too, on the boat, but the ride operators did not have lifejackets for children. “Initially, they gave faulty jackets, but after insisting twice they gave us the right-sized jackets for the children,” Kathad said. The family went to the police station to raise the issue of negligence, but did not file any complaint. “We wanted to ensure that no other person should face the same experience as us. The company should take up the responsibility,” Kathad added.

---||Amritsar||Change in air: How some exceptions in Punjab fields are holding out hope||LUDHIANA/PATIALA: It wasn’t fog that obscured the view as one entered the lush Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana on this not-so-fine November morning. The smell was not that of fresh air and the eyes hurt, the thick smog diminishing the magnificence of the Dr Manmohan Singh auditorium. A big flex banner outside the auditorium read, “Stop burning paddy stubble”, indicating an acknowledgment of the crisis at hand. Gurpal Singh, a farmer from Tarn Taran, looked closely at one of the many farm machines on display, even as he and his friends from various parts of the state shared notes on their results elsewhere. Gurpal told TOI that he had been using happy seeder -- a tractor-installed “zerotillage” agriculture machinery employed to sow wheat following the paddy harvest that also does in situ management of the stubble -- for three years now. “It is common knowledge that burning the farmland hampers its fertility. It also kills a lot of mitr-kitanu (friendly insects). I stopped burning the paddy stubble in 2018. Yes, the cost (of happy seeder) is a bit high, but the long-term benefits are promising,” said Gurpal. The 60-year-old recalled that his father didn’t burn the paddy either: it was only in the early 90s that the practice became popular as the cost of farming spiked. “Opting to burn the stubble was out of helplessness and not a permanent solution. Earlier too, we didn’t burn the stubble and rather mulched and mixed it in the soil. Then, people started burning paddy stubble to cut costs. Now that we have access to the seeders, the first thing I decided to do was switch to the old ways using the latest machinery,” said Gurpal. He also pointed out that the new techniques had considerably reduced the irrigation requirements for his 20-acre field. His friend and fellow farmer, Satnam Singh, who had 25 acres under his plough, agreed. “There has been no difference in the wheat yield in the last two years. Rather the water requirement has come down as the soil holds moisture better,” said Satnam, who, however, rued the high cost of diesel. All the same, at a time when smouldering farms have become a common sight in rural Punjab, a few exceptions where the stubble is not burnt but managed in situ or ex situ, have come as a silver lining. Though small in number, some farmers have realised that burning the stubble only hampers the cultivability of their fields and costs them more in the long run. A few of them even grudgingly agree that the stubble burning is not only impacting Delhi’s air quality but also their own quality of life. Jaspreet Singh Jaggi, a 35-year-old third-generation farmer from Nabha, agreed. After the recently concluded harvest, while his brother was busy getting the paddy processed at a small mandi in the village, Jaggi was inspecting his latest smart seeder. “We have been using both the happy seeder and its variant, super seeder. But the access to such machines is limited to a few,” said Jaggi, adding that he was trying to dissuade others from burning farm stubble. He, however, admitted that the new alternatives were yet to catch the imagination of people. Harpal Singh’s is among the few success stories, though. The “foreign-returned” 34-year-old from Ramgarh Sivia village in Ludhiana drives a modified 50-horse-power Ford-3620 tractor, with a happy seeder attached, on his 25-acre land. He pointed towards a farm next to his that mulched straw and proudly told us that “this year, they also did not burn the stubble, while I have been following this practice since 2018”. Harpal said while the whole exercise cost him Rs 3,500 per acre, he had been following the “zero-tillage” farming for four years now and the benefits far outweighed the costs. “The cost of irrigation has dipped by more than a half. The usage of potash and urea has also come down. The soil fertility has increased over the years,” said Harpal. Under “zero-tillage”, one does not mix the mulched straw into the soil and, instead, keeps it covered on the field. As the happy seeder cuts deep into the soil, the mulched straw retains the moisture and decays eventually, thereby increasing the soil fertility. “These are our farmlands and no matter how educated the new generations become, there will always be a dearth of employment. So, the young men will have to pick up the ploughs and become farmers. We cannot risk losing our land’s value by burning it,” he added. Not everyone is convinced. Hriday Pal Singh (39) from Soniwal Kalan in Ludhiana said he was subject to taunts from not just other villagers, but also his own father. “I am the only one using a happy seeder here. Even my father thinks that I am crazy,” he said. According to BS Sidhu, Punjab’s director of agriculture, people are slowly seeing the light of the day. “Traditionally, we did not like burning. But in the early 90s, things started to change. To reverse the trend, we need to extend incentives. The high cost of diesel is a major deterrent,” Sidhu said. “It’s the farmer who is the biggest loser as the farm stubble burning kills most of the micro flora and fauna in the soil layer that augments productivity,” he added. Agricultural engineer Dr Harminder Sidhu, who developed the happy seeder way back in 2007, said India was lagging behind other countries. His machine was first introduced in 2012 and it was only until 2017-18 that it started reaching the farmers. “When I developed the happy seeder, I thought of all constraints, that is, feasibility, economy, sustainability and scalability. It is one of the best zero-tillage machines currently being used in the country, but not many know about it. So, while a farmer in one village may be using a seeder, another in a nearby village may not be aware of it,” he said. Giving a rough estimate, he said of the about 80 lakh acres under paddy culativation in Punjab, less than10 lakh used zero-tillage. This, he said, wasn’t even a fraction of what was being done in countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/change-in-air-how-some-exceptions-in-punjab-fields-are-holding-out-hope/articleshow/87704506.cms||---

However, due to the pandemic, only nine countries turned up against the 23 participants in 2019. For the exhibitors from Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Tunisia, Sri Lanka, Turkey and UAE, the event is of a major significance as it is being held after a one-year gap. The key highlight was the participation of artisans at the Bihar stall, the event partner state, and at SARAS 2021 being organised by NIRD and Panchayati Raj. ITPO, the event’s organising agency, claimed that the fair would see the participation of over 1,500 artisans and 130 self-help groups (SHG) in sync with its theme “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. Artisans and SHGs from across 28 states displayed their items at the SARAS mela. Silk and cotton sarees from Odisha, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, bedsheets from Uttar Pradesh, Kantha sarees from West Bengal and bamboo art and water hyacinth products from Assam were displayed there by MSMEs. Inside the newly inaugurated exhibition hall, the Bihar stall presented its traditional Madhubani, Manjusha and Sikki art forms on terracotta and textiles. “We have 41 stalls representing Bihar this year against 34 in 2019. We will have a live demonstration of Madhubani paintings by Dulari Devi, an artist from the lowest strata,” said Ashok Sinha, organising director. Uttar Pradesh, a focus state at the fair, had 124 exhibitors from across its districts representing it as a brand. Among the 30 states and Union Territories, Nagaland and Karnataka did not turn up. Jharkhand was another focus state. A few visitors were seen confused at the Hunar Haat pavilion of the ministry of minority affairs. All state and country stalls were scattered across the new exhibition halls 2, 3, 4 and 5. “The four halls are interconnected and appear like one big hall. It is difficult to figure out the stalls without any help,” said Seema Kumari, a visitor. An exhibitor at the Turkey stall, Harulla Karpus, who had put up a display of handmade ceramic items, said, “The exhibition is hardly seeing visitors on Day 1 compared with past years. There are only three exhibitors from Turkey this year.” There were 20 exhibitors from Afghanistan displaying dry fruits. The country’s exhibitors didn’t travel to India because of the travel restriction amid the political turmoil in their country. Maria and Khaliza, exhibitors at the Iran stall, were hopeful of selling their traditional gold-plated jewellery, but sale was low for them on Day 1. There was a live performance of Fusion Yoga by practitioners from Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, free medical consultation by experts of various Ayush streams and display of various food items promoting nutrition and good health at the pavilion of the ministry of Ayush. The activities revolved around the theme of holistic health. Various institutes and research bodies of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy streams had set up their counters in hall number 10. While there were boards on display reiterating Covid-19 precautions, thermal detectors and sanitisers were not available at the entry gates. Many exhibitors and visitors were seen without masks. Till Friday, the fair would be for B2B participants and open for the general public from Saturday. The price of entry passes would reduce to Rs 80-120 from Friday against the current Rs 500. More crowds are expected on the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cautious-start-to-first-trade-fair-of-covid-era/articleshow/87705002.cms||Zumbish

Pollachi Lok Sabha MP K Shanmuga Sundaram visited Podanur Junction to witness the first trip of the train. He had given representation on several occasions for the restoration of the train service over the last few months. For T Krishna Balaji, a resident of Pollachi, resumption of train service has come as a big relief. Working in an IT company in Saravanampatti, Balaji had preferred working from home as the train service was halted. Flyover work near Athupalam and Ukkadam has been causing frequent traffic jams making the road travel from Pollachi to Coimbatore hectic. While monthly season train ticket would cost just Rs 270 from Coimbatore to Pollachi, the same would cost Rs 1,800 in bus. Though the train was expected to be operated with an electric engine as the broad-gauge line from Podanur to Pollachi was electrified recently, it was operated with diesel locomotives. K Jayaraj, a member of Divisional Railway User's Consultative Committee (DRUCC), Salem division, cited rake sharing arrangement with the Pollachi–Palakkad passenger train as the reason for not operating electric engines. Since the Pollachi–Palakkad section is yet to be electrified, Coimbatore – Pollachi passenger train is operated with diesel loco. Operation of electric engines will further reduce the travel time between Coimbatore and Pollachi, he said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/train-service-resumes-after-20-months/articleshow/87705010.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This has been proven time and again when cops’ selfless activities helped saved many a life during the pandemic induced lockdown. And their good work didn’t end there when another of their ilk, constable Kishan Rathod working in DySP office Modasa, has shown yet again what charity begins at home truly means. Rathod was inspired to do charity when the group organized collection to help donate for the poor. This time, he did the charity work himself, albeit from his own purse. It all began with Rathod saving a portion of his salary every month to buy sweaters and save lives of underprivileged children this winter. Talking to TOI, Rathod said, “I decided to serve the children by sparing a bit from my salary. Their faces remind me of my own poverty that our family suffered and the smile I receive after getting the gift itself gives me a lot of satisfaction. I have been doing so for the past five years and after my pay increased, I also increased my contribution. This winter, the number of beneficiaries has gone up to 50 children.” Dy SP Bharat Basiya said, “Kishan Rathod has been providing yeoman service for the past five years. He identifies needy or orphaned children and their families writing in cold and distributes sweaters which he buys from his own savings. He is a writer holding the post of constable in my office. Rathod and his brother, who hail from ordinary background themselv es, are truly helpful in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/policemans-charity-work-keeps-needy-kids-warm-in-winter-season/articleshow/87704510.cms||---

The presence of Croatian visitors was just the trigger. It took them centuries back to the time when travellers from the country left behind their footprints in this tiny village. Croatians, according to records, had built the beautiful church on the scenic hillock on the banks of Cumbharjua canal, about five kilometres east of Old Goa A three-member team from HRT Croatian Radiotelevision was at the historic church at the invitation of Goa tourism, filming a documentary on the erstwhile relationship between the European nation and Goa. A Croatian indologist Zdravka Matisic had found the reference to her country’s Goa links while studying Sanskrit in India. Fr Walter D’Souza, one of the three concelebrants at the Mass, while delivering the homily, reminded the parishioners about how Croatians had planted the seed and how they grew in faith. The chapel dedicated to St Blaise — Sao Braz in Portuguese — was built in 1541 and elevated to church status in 1563, said parish priest Fr Albino Mendonca. He was a concelebrant at the Mass with Fr Joaquim Loiola Pereira, secretary to the archbishop. The Sao Braz Church is a smaller version of Sveti Vlaho Church in Dubrovnik, Croatia. “We have shown the team a few things. The church bell, statue of St Braz and other antiquities that are part of our rich history,” Mendonca said. While the crew flitted about and cameras zoomed in on the Sunday celebrations and the parishioners, they tried to keep themselves rooted to the present. “The villagers are happy and thrilled to see the Croatians. A few years ago, they had collected donations in Dubrovnik church that helped our church restoration work,” villager Braz Silveira said. For the visitors, the trip will be a memorable one. “It is a learning experience for me and my colleagues about our country’s rich past,” Croatian journalist Dragan Nikolic said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/croatian-documentary-teams-visit-stirs-up-gandaulims-historic-past/articleshow/87705040.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KIIFB, CAG differ on off-budget borrowings||T’puram: Kerala infrastructure investment fund board is an annuity-based economic model and not an entity created for off-budget borrowing, KIIFB said in response to the observations made by the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) in its report that was tabled in the assembly last week. Government has entrusted KIIFB to implement projects worth Rs 70,000 crore that were announced in the budgets of previous years. For this purpose, government gave a legal assurance that petrol cess and half of the collection of motor vehicle tax will be paid to KIIFB as a growing annuity. In other words, KIIFB is an organization with a strong revenue source. The statement further added that 25% of the projects undertaken by KIIFB are revenue yielding and they include loans provided to KSEB, K-FON and industrial parks. This revenue along with the revenue shared by government will ensure that KIIFB will never become debt-ridden. KIIFB has also developed an asset-liability software that will calculate the liabilities of each project. In addition, revenue that will reach KIIFB in the coming years can also be calculated in advance. KIIFB director board will clear projects only after ensuring that its liabilities will never affect its revenue and it is functioning on the basis of asset-liability matching model. Government has not conceived KIIFB as a model that can avail loans outside the budget, but as a body corporate that is required to find resources for the development of infrastructure in state. It further said that the comments made in CAG’s 2020 report was one-sided and doesn’t conform to the facts about KIIFB. In the period that was discussed in the CAG report, Centre also has made transactions on annuity basis. Till 2019-20, KIIFB availed Rs 5,036.61 crore as loans and repaid Rs 353.21 crore as interest on loans. The government shared Rs 5,572.85 crore with KIIFB collected from motor vehicles tax and petroleum cess. This would mean that KIIFB received more funds from the government than it paid in its liabilities. For these reasons, the loans availed by KIIFB needn’t be construed as an off-budget borrowing or government’s direct liability, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-cag-differ-on-off-budget-borrowings/articleshow/87704520.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sharma has been accused of trespassing into a Krishna temple, Nidhivan, in Vrindavan, where entry is forbidden at night. Sharma and his associates are alleged to have entered the premises "with their shoes on” by climbing over the wall at midnight and filming the area. As per popular belief, no one is allowed to enter the temple at night since it is held that Lord Krishna and Radha perform 'raslila' at night at the place and they should not be disturbed. According to SP (City) MP Singh, during interrogation, Sharma told the police that he has been running his YouTube channel under the name of ‘GauravZone' for the past five years and earns Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 per month from it. He has around 45 lakh subscribers. “I had visited my uncle’s place in Mathura on November 6. My cousin Prashant told me that there is a place in Vrindavan, where no one enters at night, as it is believed that misfortune strikes those who do so. I decided to make a video of the area and arrived at Nidhivan around midnight with my cousin and his friends and after shooting the video for 15-20 minutes, we came out,” Sharma told the police. He confessed to uploading the video on his channel on November 9 and added that when he came to know about the FIR lodged against him, he immediately deleted the video from his YouTube channel. Soon after the video was uploaded, an FIR was registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station on a complaint filed by a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple. The complainant stated that the accused tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-youtuber-remanded-to-14-day-judicial-custody-for-entering-into-krishna-temple-in-vrindavan-at-night-filming-video/articleshow/87703768.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Police have deputed two armed guards for his security. According to police, the victim identified as Shailendra Goyal is a leading jeweller in Bharatpur and owns a shop. “He stated that he got a phone call in which the caller stated that he was calling from Sewar jail of Bharatpur and asked him to pay Rs 5 lakh else his henchmen will shoot him dead,” said a senior police officer of Kotwali police station. The jeweller is clueless on the sudden demand of money further asked the caller about his identity. “The caller in threatening tone asked him to listen what is been told to him.

Meanwhile, senior police officers ordered to deploy two armed policemen at the house of the jeweller. “For the time being we have provided two armed guards to the victim. Also our teams in plain clothes are deployed in the nearby area to check the movements around the house of the jeweller,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jeweller-gets-extortion-call-of-rs-5-lakh-in-bharatpur/articleshow/87705054.cms||---

That’s sad because she is a super good holding midfielder,” coach Thomas Dennerby told TOI. Sangita picked up the injury during India’s recent tour to Sweden. “She is very strong with her defence, the best player to intercept balls and win them back for the team. She is someone who makes the players around her look better, always protecting them,” said Dennerby. Sangita’s injury comes after another star player – Bala Devi – is on the verge of being ruled out of the tournament, also with ACL. Bala, the country’s biggest name in women’s football, picked up an ACL injury during her stint with Rangers FC in Scotland and was operated on September 3. She is currently undergoing rehabilitation in Bengaluru but is yet to start jogging. With the tournament drawing near, it now looks unlikely that she will be able to make the cut. “I am a little bit doubtful to be honest (about Bala),” said Dennerby. “There is no final word, but she is not here at the camp. She is still on rehabilitation. If you really work hard, you can make a return after six months, although it takes six to nine months before you are 100 percent fit. The doors, though, are not closed yet.” Participating teams have to submit the final list of 23 players to AFC before January 10. India have been handed a tough draw for the Asian Cup, clubbed alongside eight-time champions China, two-time winners Chinese Taipei and Iran, who they face in the opener on January 20 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sangita-ruled-out-of-asian-cup-with-acl-injury-bala-doubtful/articleshow/87724366.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Kochi||Kochi: Now, laity protests against uniform mode of Holy Mass||KOCHI: Protests over unification in the style of conducting Holy Mass in Syro-Malabar Church escalated further on Sunday as hundreds of churchgoers held a protest march to the Church headquarters on Sunday evening. The protesters were laity from the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. The issue pertains to the differences in celebrating Holy Mass in various dioceses of Syro-Malabar Church, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in some dioceses and facing the altar in others. The unified way is a combination of both. As per the Syro-Malabar Church synod’s decision, the uniform mass would come into effect from November 28. According to the protestors, for the past five decades in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, the priest conducts the ceremony facing the people. The protest took place under the banner of Almaya Munnettam, an organisation of laity members of the Church. “We have warned of stronger protest forms in the coming days if a favourable decision is not made before November 20. Sunday’s march was attended by nearly 1,000 representatives from various parishes of the diocese,” said Riju Kanjookkaran, PRO of Almaya Munnettam. On Friday, around 200 priests from Palakkad, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur, Thamarassery, and Ernakulam-Angamaly dioceses had marched to the Church headquarters, raising the same issue. The priests were denied entry into the compound of the headquarters even as the curia chancellor of Syro-Malabar Church accepted a memorandum detailing their concerns. The protesting laity members on Sunday criticised the Church authorities for denying entry to the priests and demanded an apology. However, as per officials of the Church, the uniform mode of conducting the Holy Mass is a decision approved by the bishops and the Pope. The second summit of the 29th synod of Syro-Malabar Church had envisaged a complete transformation into the new way of conducting mass by the Easter Sunday of 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-laity-protests-against-uniform-mode-of-holy-mass/articleshow/87704536.cms||---

Ghazipur superintendent of police Ram Badan Singh told TOI on Sunday, “The permission sought by Samajwadi Party could not be given as the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), which has executed the project, has not opened it for general commuting since its inauguration is due. Hence giving permission was not possible for the district authorities.” In response to the application seeking permission, Ghazipur DM MP Singh and SP sent a letter to SP saying the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway by the PM in Sultanpur and a public meeting will be held between 2pm and 4pm. “UPEIDA had not allowed general commuting on the expressway for security reasons in view of the PM’s visit. Movement of public vehicles will be allowed only after the inauguration,” the letter stated. Expressing inability in granting permission, the officials suggested the SP chief reschedule the event on November 17 or on any day later. Reacting to the denial of permission, SP spokesman Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi said, “The party had planned a public meeting at Pakhanpura (Haidaria) between 11.30am and 12.30pm after which the Vijay Rath Yatra had to proceed to Azamgarh through the expressway, a project launched by former chief minister in his regime, but the BJP government is trying to grab its credit.” The officials have denied permission under pressure of the government, alleged Rai, claiming huge turnout of people in support of SP chief in the state has made BJP nervous and hence it is putting hurdles. SP Ghazipur district unit president Ramdhari Yadav said the expressway event has not been permitted but public meetings will be held at Pakhanpura, Varachavar, Kasimabad, Haiderganj and Harikarna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhileshs-attempt-to-hold-parallelshow-on-purvanchal-e-way-jolted/articleshow/87704535.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Chand Miyan claimed the policemen told him that the money was from the government, and asked him not to proceed with the matter. Miyan also claimed that he was provided the cash in bundles of Rs 500 notes in presence of senior officials of the police and the administration at the Goraha police outpost. Miyan on Sunday said the money is still with him. “I am ready to return it. All I want is justice for my son,” he said. The father said that, in the paper (which has now gone viral), it was written that his son was suffering from depression and committed suicide in the washroom of the lock-up at Kotawali Sadar police station. Miyan further claimed that his relatives were also warned not to speak about the matter to the media and ensure the body is buried peacefully. Altaf was buried amid heavy police presence on Wednesday. “Station house officer (SHO) Virendra Singh Indolia (now suspended), along with some some other policemen, a sub-divisional magistrate and a local activist was present at Goraha police outpost when the money was handed over to Altaf’s father,” said an uncle of Altaf. Kasganj superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod said, “Police did not give any cash to Altaf’s father. A request was made to the district magistrate (DM) to consider providing monetary assistance to the family,” said Pramod. When asked about the matter, DM Harshita Mathur said, “As of now, there is no declaration of monetary compensation for the deceased’s family. We have sent a proposal to the state government in this regard. We will also try to give a job to one of the family members of Altaf.” ADGP Rajeev Krishna said, “I have no knowledge about any such transaction. Even if the cash was handed over to cover-up the entire matter, it is irrelevant now. An FIR has been registered on a complaint by the deceased man’s father. The focus of the investigation is on custodial death. A magisterial and departmental probe is also being conducted.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said that he was "detained" at Goraha police outpost after his son’s death. “The policemen made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by them. The cops forced me to put a thumb impression on a piece of paper, saying that if I do not do it, the body of my son would not be handed over to me and that I would not be allowed to leave the outpost. I had no idea what was written in that paper,” the complaint read. Meanwhile, Kasganj police recovered the 16-year-old Hindu girl who was allegedly kidnapped by Altaf and an “unknown friend”. She will be produced in court to record her statement on Monday, a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-custodial-death-cops-gave-rs-5l-cash-to-keep-quiet-claims-father/articleshow/87703795.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Leopard cub reunited with mom on Children’s Day eve||MUMBAI: It was a happy reunion on the eve of Children’s Day for a rescued leopard cub. Three days after the black wild cat was rescued from an empty tank in Sindhudurg, it walked away with its mother who had been looking for it in a forested stretch at Kudal on Saturday. For two days, forest officials had waited for the mother to take it away. After its rescue on Thursday, the cub was kept in a cage. The cage was connected by wireless cameras and rescuers kept watch from a distance. The door had a long rope attached so it could be swung open if the mother leopard came near the cage. On Friday, a team had surveyed the stretch around the cage to look for signs of the mother’s presence, like pugmarks. “The mother leopard did come looking for the cub, but our Internet connection snapped at that time, we did not pull open the door as we could not watch what was happening at the spot,” said range forest officer Amrut Shinde. A team from an NGO in Pune, ResQ, had also moved in to assist in the reunion, said Shahaji Narnavar, deputy conservator of forests. The cub had been rescued from the empty tank atop a hill at Goveri village. The spot from which the cub had been rescued is nestled on a forested area on a hilltop with a good prey base. “It’s perfect for survival of wildlife,” said Shinde. The leopard cub is referred to as ‘black panther’ due to the hue of its hide. It has excess of melanin pigment which determines the colour of the hide. A rare find, these wild cats have been spotted in Maharashtra, Goa and at Kabini National Park in Karnataka, said forest officials. On Saturday evening, around 8.30, the mother returned to look for her cub. “We could hear her loud roars,” said Shinde. Stationed about 500 metres away, the team watched the mother inch close to the cage and pulled the rope to open the door. The cub hopped out on all fours, its mother in tow, and both vamoosed into the thicket of green, said Shinde. It was a happy reunion, Shinde told TOI, adding, “Seeing the mother and her lost cub together again made us quite emotional.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-leopard-cub-reunited-with-mom-on-childrens-day-eve/articleshow/87705689.cms||Alex Fernandes
---||Hyderabad||Centre mum on pleas for powerloom cluster: KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: Industries minister KT Rama Rao has shot off a letter to Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goel pointing out the Centre’s indifference to repeated representations from Telangana government to sanction a mega powerloom cluster. This letter to Goel on Sunday is preceded by the ruling TRS’ state-wide protest against the Centre over paddy procurement issue on Friday. In the letter, KTR said the youth of Telangana are eagerly waiting for employment opportunities that will be created by projects like the mega powerloom cluster at Sircilla under the comprehensive powerloom cluster development scheme. KTR, who also represents Sircilla assembly constituency, had earlier written seven letters on different dates to the Union government for a mega powerloom cluster, but no action was taken, he said. Sircilla has been a major hub of handloom and textiles activity for several decades. The state government initiated several measures for gainful employment to the weaver community, he said. This town has the necessary ecosystem and trained manpower required to set up a mega powerloom cluster, KTR said. The minister sought to bring to the notice of the Union minister that the flagship initiatives, including 40% input subsidy linked wage compensation scheme, thrift fund to handloom and powerloom weavers, providing continuous work to powerloom workers, have resulted in revival of this industry with major increase in earnings and wages. Even the Union government had appreciated these initiatives on various occasions, he said. KTR highlighted that Telangana has been able to attract some marquee investments into the textiles sector. Also, the state government has earmarked additional budget for the handloom and textiles sector and has taken up world class projects like Kakatiya Mega Textile Park. “Over the past few years, we have been observing that the Union government is announcing schemes and assistance to states, which lack the necessary ecosystem or resources. All this at the expense of fast developing states like Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-mum-on-pleas-for-powerloom-cluster-ktr/articleshow/87705051.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Four killed as truck crashes into a wedding in Bhilwara||JAIPUR: Four persons were killed and three injured when a speeding truck ploughed through guests at a wedding function in Bhilwara on Sunday evening. Hanuman Nagar police station identified the victims as Neeraj, Kuldeep, Manoj and Rajendra. The driver sustained severe injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment. Police said a medical examination will ascertain if he was drunk. The incident took place at Kuradiya village in Jahazpur tehsil where the wedding functions of Shankar Lal Meena’s two daughters were about to start. Around 6pm, a truck coming from Deoli began to flounder before it careened off the road, crushing several people under its wheels. Police said the wedding celebrations were being held at a house next to the road. Locals told police that there were shocking cries for help as people were pulled out from under the wheels. Many wounded were covered in blood, screaming in pain and horror even as the truck’s engine continued to rumble. Several guests ran out of the house to check on the howls of cries and held the driver so that he could not flee from the scene. Once all the injured were taken to hospital, the incident draped the entire area in a veil of silence where celebrations were in full swing just a few moments ago. Local leaders and senior police officials came in droves to take stock of the situation. SHO Mohammad Imran told TOI that the driver was also ferried to the hospital along with other injured. Police said the bodies were being moved to a mortuary. “Injured were taken to hospital immediately after the accident, but four of them succumbed to their injuries,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/four-killed-as-truck-crashes-into-a-wedding-in-bhilwara/articleshow/87705073.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Illegal structures, garbage blocking Gangayaar’s flow||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Gangayaar canal which overflowed and caused flooding in houses, shops and fish landing centre at Vizhinjam in the heavy showers on Saturday is a sore reminder of unauthorised construction of structures and dumping of waste blocking the water flow. The officials with the minor irrigation department said that one of the main reasons for the overflow of the canal is the accumulation of sand at the portion where the canal flows close to the sea. There have been small bridges constructed unscientifically across the canal without obtaining any sanction from the authorities concerned. These bridges are located at a low level and without vertical clearance. Frequent dumping of waste in the canal causes the trash to get blocked within the structures, obstructing the flow of the canal. Absence of retaining wall on either side of the canal is also cited as a reason for flooding. The residents, street vendors and the fishermen have long been at the receiving end whenever the canal overflows during the rainy season. The fishermen who keep their expensive fishing equipment in the landing centre and locker room often end up losing their source of livelihood as the canal would flood all the buildings in the neighbouring areas. It was in 2020 that a sanction was given for the revamp of Gangayaar canal at a cost of Rs 89 lakhs. The tender was invited twice for this work and in the third tender there were two participants. The lowest quote was recorded at Rs 1.05 crores. The quoted amount was 32.74% higher than the estimate of Rs 79.46 lakhs. The water resources department had considered the request for tender excess and assessed that the higher amount quoted for the project was fair and the amount was approved in August 2021 as a special case on the condition that the government will not have any financial liability and that the chief engineer may scrutinize the measurements. As per the scheme, the desilting process will be carried out for a distance of 1 kilometre. A new bridge will also come across the canal. One of the unauthorised bridges was damaged in the heavy rains on Saturday. In order to prevent unauthorised dumping of waste, fencing shall be erected on both sides. A core wall will be constructed from the canal into the sea for a distance of 60 metres. This will be constructed in the same alignment of the canal and would be similar to that of breakwater. The officials said that work on the canal restoration will begin as soon as approval is received regarding the levels. On Saturday after the flood waters entered shops, houses, and landing centres damaging fishing equipment and means of livelihood of the fishermen, Mayor Arya Rajendran, deputy mayor P K Raju and welfare standing committee chairman H Salim visited the spot. Following it, officials of the minor irrigation department and corporation officials deployed earth movers to clean the canal and chunks of plastic waste were scooped up from the canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/illegal-structures-garbage-blocking-gangayaars-flow/articleshow/87704544.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court acquits accused who fatally ran over dog with bike||Mumbai: In a rare trial conducted for offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, a magistrate court recently acquitted a 23-year-old Wadala man for running over and killing a female dog with his bike in 2018. The court said there is no evidence on record to prove that there was intention to kill the “bitch” to commit mischief. Acquitting Juber Shah, metropolitan magistrate JP Shirale said, “Prosecution is required to prove that accused intentionally killed bitch, which is not the case of prosecution itself. Prosecution comes before with case that accused drove motorcycle in a rash or negligent manner and not that accused had an intention to kill the bitch.” Three witnesses deposed during the trial. Shah was also acquitted for offences under the IPC relating to causing mischief by killing or maiming an animal. The court also acquitted him on charges of driving in rash or negligent manner as to endanger human life and personal safety of others. The complainant in the case, Veral Pandya, deposed that on January 13, 2018, at about 10pm, when he was standing on the road at Wadala, the accused drove his motorcycle in a rash and negligent manner and hit the canine. He said he took the dog to hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The court, however, said the investigator had not conducted the test identification parade, so identification merely by witness “cannot be accepted as trustworthy of credence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-acquits-accused-who-fatally-ran-over-dog-with-bike/articleshow/87705928.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad honorary wildlife warden: Diverse bird population sign of healthy biodiversity||Aurangabad: A diverse bird population is a good sign of healthy biodiversity, said Kishor Pathak, the honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad. “As different birds dwell on different trees and prefer other natural habitats, including water bodies, scrublands and greenlands, the varied and rich population of birds imply towards the presence of such habitats in an adequate manner. Such habitats as a whole form healthy biodiversity, which is good for human beings,” he said. Pathak, while addressing the valedictory event of the ‘Bird Week’ celebrations organised by the forest department here, stressed on the need to protect various habitats of birds. “It is a general notion among commoners that birds reside on large trees alone. While such a green cover is essential for birds, other habitats, including water bodies, marshy lands, bushes, creepers and climbers also serve as habitats for different birds,” he said. The rich population of birds is essential for humans. “Many birds feed on insects and pests that prove a menace to the agricultural sector. The birds, thus, act as natural insecticides and pesticides,” he said. During his presentation, the honorary wildlife warden also enlightened the audience about different local and migrant birds found in and around Aurangabad. The Bird Week celebrations, which saw nature trails and awareness seminars, was organised under the guidance of deputy conservator of forest Amit Mishra and assistant conservator of forest Rajendra Nale among other officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-honorary-wildlife-warden-diverse-bird-population-sign-of-healthy-biodiversity/articleshow/87703274.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hubballi||Bifurcation of milk union to cause milk shortage in Dharwad||Dharwad: The state cabinet’s decision to bifurcate Dharwad Milk Union (DMU) by creating a separate milk union for Haveri district will cause shortage of milk in Dharwad, Gadag and Uttara Kannada districts. DMU covers Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag and Uttara Kannada and a major part of the milk comes from Haveri. It is feared that separating Haveri from DMU and creating new Haveri Milk Union (HMU) will hit Dharwad badly. The process of bifurcation will begin now and HMU will be functional from December 2022. Already the work on setting up an Ultra High-Pressure Pasteurization (UHP) unit at a cost of Rs 99 crore has commenced in Haveri. DMU, established in 1984, has 12 directors with each district sending three directors. With the creation of new Haveri Milk Union, the number of directors in DMU will come down to nine while Haveri will have a new president, three directors and one managing director along with new office and staff. It is possible that additional staff from DMU will be shifted to Haveri Milk Union. DMU gets 2.75 lakh litres of milk every day from four districts and Haveri contributes 1.75 lakh litres. The daily sale of milk from DMU is one lakh litres of which about 10,000 litres is sold in Haveri district. When the new Haveri Milk Union becomes functional, DMU will face a shortage of milk to the extent of 1.75 lakh litres per day. Meanwhile, Haveri Milk Union will have to increase sales in Haveri district to remain economically feasible. DMU president Shankar Mugad said the idea of bifurcating DMU and creating HMU is not new and the work has already commenced. DMU will continue to get 1.75 lakh litres of milk everyday till the end of December 2022, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bifurcation-of-milk-union-to-cause-milk-shortage-in-dharwad/articleshow/87703805.cms||---

The officials said with elections a few months away, they have been unable to adopt a strict attitude towards defaulters. Against the capacity of slaughtering 50,000 birds in a day, around 1,000 to 1,200 birds are being taken to the slaughter house while 50 to 60 goats/sheep are coming against a capacity of 500 in a day. The municipal corporation (MC) has fixed Rs 10 for poultry, Rs 100 for pig and Rs 150 for goat/sheep as slaughtering charges, which are to be paid by the shopkeepers. The slaughter house located on Hambran Road was inaugurated in February after almost a delay of one year. It also included five model shops where people can buy meat slaughtered in a hygienic manner. Five air-conditioned vehicles were also provided to the firm for transportation of slaughtered meat from slaughter house to shops. The cost of this project was Rs 19.50 crore. An official, requesting anonymity, claimed that they had kicked off a drive against slaughtering in shops. During the drive, we discovered that some shops had kept 2-week old meat in the refrigerators. From one shop, at least one quintal of such meat was seized. He said there is a need to seal a few shops where gross violation is being reported. Additional commissioner Aaditya Dacchalwal said, “There is slight improvement as number of birds as well as goats being brought for slaughtering has increased. We will continue with the drive against the slaughtering in the open as well as shops.” He appealed to the public not to buy meat from shops unless it is slaughtered in a hygienic manner. According to National Green Tribune (NGT) guidelines, it is not allowed to throw animal waste in the sewerage system. At present, shopkeepers throw everything into the sewerage. The NGT had asked the MC to stop this practice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/illegal-slaughtering-still-rampant-as-modern-abattoir-yet-to-gain-popularity/articleshow/87703806.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt to install solar fish dryers at Old Goa||Panaji: The directorate of fisheries is in the process of installing a solar-powered fish dryer at its sub-office at Old Goa.  The eco-friendly device is expected to convert the surplus fish coming in during an over catch into dried fish. Traditionally, fishermen dry the fish in the open under blazing Sun, but often such a method is vulnerable to dust and rains and attack from insects, pests and microorganisms therefore compromising on the quality. “The area where the solar-powered fish dryer is to be installed has been identified. Fishermen will be given permission to dry their fish over there following the installation of the device,” a fisheries officer said. The dryer runs on the power of the Sun generated through a solar panel to dry the fish. Using this method, fish are preserved by removing moisture from them, thereby arresting the growth of bacteria, action of enzymes and chemical oxidation of the fat. “The device also takes up lesser time to dry the fish, unlike the traditional method,” the fisheries officer said. Initially, the setup was planned at the fisheries sub-office at Colva. In August this year, the directorate notified that fishermen who, since 2015, have been paying a nominal lease amount of Rs 100 per year for using a 100sqm platform to dry fish at the government facility at Colva will now have to pay a whopping Rs 3,000.

The forest department has a plan to help citizens enjoy trekking, jungle safari. It is providing accommodation to let people spend a day in the wild. The Tiger Stay Package will allow one to explore the flora and fauna. There are chances of spotting tigers, leopards, Sambar, Spotted Deer, Wild Dogs, and other wild animals and rare birds during safari and trekking. Those going on safari will get to see the breathtaking view of the region from Farahabad view point. “The intention behind this package is to create awareness among the visitors for developing a sense of responsibility to protect nature and wildlife,” said Rohith Gopidi, forest divisional officer, Amrabad Division. He said that through the initiative, they also intend to generate local employment to prevent people from resorting to poaching and other forest damaging activities. Gopidi said that trekking, safari, and other activities will be conducted in areas having minimal disturbance to wildlife. “We are sure that this will turn into one of the go-to getaway destinations for Hyderabadis and others in Telangana. People of all ages will enjoy their stay here. It would be better if people do not come herewith a sole intention of spotting a tiger as we have a vast area under ATR and safari covers only a small part of it,” said Gopidi. During the trekking, which covers about 3.5 km to 4 km stretch, people will be able to spot various species of birds, get to learn about various plants. The trek will culminate at the Uma Maheshwaram temple, which is the northern gateway of Srisailam — one of the jyotirlings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amrabad-tiger-reserve-to-host-trekking-safari/articleshow/87705067.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

However, it has been estimated that the pollution levels are only going to escalate in the coming days. Keeping this in mind, the Delhi government has decided that all schools, colleges, coaching institutes, skill development and training institutes and libraries will remain shut till November 20. The only exception will be made for institutions already in the process of conducting examinations. Secondly, all construction projects and demolitions taking place in Delhi will be halted till November 17, be it at any scale — small or large construction sites. Thirdly, all offices, corporations and autonomous agencies under the Delhi government will remain shut till November 17 and all officers will be expected to work from home for the week,” said Rai. He added that the purpose of shutting offices and such non-emergency institutions is to cut down on vehicular pollution. An advisory has been issued to private offices to follow suit and help this initiative have an effective impact on pollution levels. He said the government will review progress and take appropriate decisions. The environment minister said, “However, any institutions providing emergency services will be exempted from this order. This includes health and all related departments and services, police, jail, home guard, fire service, district administration, DPCC, environment department, pay and accounts office, electricity department, PWD, irrigation and flood control department, water supply and sanitation, public transport — air, railway, metro, bus. Additionally, the services supporting public transportation like cargo, ticketing, air flight, disaster management services, NIC, municipal service, etc. will also be exempted.” Now, 400 tankers will sprinkle water in the city and the Delhi government will complete the work of spraying bio-decomposer solution for stubble decomposition in 4,000 acres of fields by November 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-curbs-aimed-at-bringing-down-dust-vehicular-pollution/articleshow/87704545.cms||---

The 32-year-old woman had taken the auto from Bisalpur town to Pilibhit city on Friday night. There was only one “co-passenger” in the shared auto. As the auto entered the state highway, she realized that the other “passenger” was the driver’s helper and both men were drunk. As the vehicle sped on the highway, the helper seated next to her allegedly started misbehaving with her. Her protests turned to screams as the auto driver accelerated the speed. At that time, constable Sachin Kumar Tyagi and home guard Suresh Pal, who were on patrolling duty on their bike, happened to pass by the auto in the opposite direction. They heard the woman screaming for help. They immediately turned their bike around, chased the auto and rescued the woman. Both men were arrested and handed over to police. Later, Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit superintendent of police, felicitated both constable and home guard and announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 for their good work. Police have registered an FIR under IPC sections 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman), 376D (gang rape) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against auto driver Rajat Kumar and his helper, Shivam Chaudhary.

---||Mumbai||Four-year-old not competent witness in abuse case: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: Quashing a 2019 conviction under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), the Bombay high court said the sessions court had given “undue importance to a stray statement’’ of a four-year-old without ascertaining first whether the child could be a competent witness. Mumbai sessions court had convicted the accused to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in 2019. He was one of two accused in the case. The co-accused had been acquitted by the trial court. The HC said, “A child is a competent witness provided he is capable of understanding the questions put to him and is able to give rational answers.’’ But in this case, the child was barely four years old and of a tender age, and “it was obligatory” on the judge to ascertain first whether the child can depose as a competent witness, which the trial judge had not done, the high court added. The prosecution’s case was that the accused, who was hired to paint a room, had made the child sit on his lap. It was alleged that at 9.30pm, he then touched her private part and that the other man had slapped her. The man had been convicted under section 10 of Pocso for aggravated sexual assault, where minimum punishment is five years’ RI. Both the accused had pleaded not guilty. The child, who did not have the cognitive skills to recollect and narrate an alleged sexual abuse by a painter-workman, had later in her cross-examination by the defence lawyer also said she was deposing as told by her mother, observed Justice Anuja Prabhudessai while acquitting the man in the 2017 case. The prosecution’s case was based mainly on the child’s testimony. “Conviction can be based on the sole testimony of a child witness provided the witness is competent to depose to the facts and is a reliable witness,’’ said the HC. Observing that the trial court had “failed to evaluate competency’’ of the child as a witness, the HC scrutinised her evidence to ascertain whether her deposition can be relied on. The HC judgment noted that the child “was not trying to conceal the truth’’ and the tenor of her answers during trial indicate she lacked the intellectual capacity and maturity to understand the nature of questions and to give rational answers, hence she “cannot be considered to be a competent witness.’’ Besides, there is no confirmation of the identification of the accused, the HC noted, as the date of painting work was a day after the alleged crime, said the room owner. The HC held that the trial court had “grossly erred’’ in delivering its guilty verdict. The man was on bail during the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-year-old-not-competent-witness-in-abuse-case-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87705691.cms||---

State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai, however, told TOI that the daily average has been over 5 lakh shots during the last two-three days, which is set to increase further from Monday. “Next week is likely to see higher daily vaccination targets, with an aim to go up to 10 lakh doses administered every day through the Har Ghar Dastak programme,” he said. Another state health department official said nearly 75 lakh beneficiaries were due for the second dose. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the number of sessions conducted by private hospitals has dropped further. “One concern is the number of private hospitals conducting daily vaccination sessions falling significantly. This number was 210 at one point in time in Pune district, which has come down to an average of 150. Though these hospitals are still part of the drive, the daily session count by private hospitals has reduced,” he said. Dr Deshmukh said footfall for vaccination in the district has remained low despite festivities ending. A PMC official said with less than 10 beneficiaries turning up at private sites at any point in time, they do not create sessions on some days. If the vial contains doses for 10 people and only four turn up, six doses can go waste. Another PMC official said the civic body received higher number of doses in August-September from the district authorities and nearly 10-12 lakh first doses were administered in the PMC limits during that period. “The due date for second doses of all these beneficiaries will come by November-end-December, which would increase daily vaccinations considerably in the coming period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-inoculation-count-drops-to-3-month-low-in-last-2-weeks/articleshow/87704607.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Two supporting MSRTC bus strike attempt immolation near Maharashtra secretariat||MUMBAI: Two men supporting the MSRTC strike tried to immolate themselves in front of the state secretariat on Sunday. Another suicide attempt by a bus corporation employee was reported in Palghar. The strike entered its 18th day as the deadlock continued and talks failed, while Bombay high court will hear a contempt petition filed against striking workers on Monday. Few days back, transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab had said some workers want to return to work. Since he promised police protection, till Sunday, nearly 4,000 workers resumed duties, while 88,000 continued with the strike. With 195 drivers and 77 conductors back at work, MSRTC operated 79 buses on 60 routes on Sunday and ferried 1,746 passengers across Maharashtra. This included 500 passengers by Shivneri AC buses (Mumbai-Pune). In the immolation bid case, two have been booked for abetment to suicide under IPC, and Marine Drive police detained them along with four women who protested on the road. A senior police officer said two men from the group tried to immolate themselves by pouring kerosene while four women sat on the road around 11am. Officials caught hold of the two. Agency reports stated that on Saturday evening, a driver from Jawhar depot in Palghar allegedly consumed poison at home, a police official said. His family took him to Jawhar sub-hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. Senior officials said commuters were happy that 3,987 workers were back at work. Many passengers complained that private buses and other vehicles were “overcharging”. “We expect more workers on Monday and we will operate more than 100 routes if all goes well,” said a top official. Parab assured workers government was looking into salaries being brought on par with state government employees. A committee has been formed to look into key demands of workers who want merger of MSRTC with state government. The panel will decide within few weeks, sources said. MSRTC union leader Shashank Rao said, “They have issued suspension orders to over 2,000 workers. We have informed these workers that the union will stand with them in their fight. We will also fight a legal battle, if need be.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-supporting-msrtc-bus-strike-attempt-immolation/articleshow/87705948.cms||Somit Sen

Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia and municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi flagged off eight anti-smog sprinklers, 40 tractor-mounted water sprinklers and eight mechanical sweeping machines from the 1090 Crossing. These machines will sprinkle water to clear air and settle the dust on the roads, besides cleaning the streets in a mechanised manner. LMC staff will also be deployed to make people aware about measures to be taken to improve air quality. TOI had highlighted earlier that LMC has only eight trucks for sprinkling water on roads and five for antismog spray. These vehicles cover around 80-85 km of road networks daily. However, LMC has 236 km of road network in the city, of which a large number are in bad shape and hence the measures taken by the civic body are proving to be insufficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-launches-special-drive-to-improve-citys-air-quality/articleshow/87705076.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

---||Lucknow||Construction sites flout NGT norms||Lucknow: A day after Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) imposed monetary penalty on seven private contractors in the city for violating National Green Tribunal (NGT) norms regarding construction work, TOI in its reality check found rules being violated in several areas. As per the NGT norms, the construction sites must control dispersion of dust into the atmosphere by covering the sites with green nets and sprinkling of water. The measures are important because the huge amount of dust raised from construction sites combines with the mist/fog in the winters to form smog, which in return deteriorates air quality, causing several health issues among people. The district administration had also issued strict instructions to all civic and development agencies on Friday for implementation of NGT guidelines. However, TOI found norms being ignored at several private construction sites in many areas, including Rajajipuram, Alambagh, Jankipuram Extension, Gomtinagar Extension, Indiranagar, Niralanagar, Raebareli Road, IIM Chauraha, Aashiana and LDA Colony. Abhishek Gupta, a resident of Rajajipuram, said, "My grandmother, who is already suffering from asthma, gets really troubled due to the under-construction house in my locality especially during these winter times when fog and smog makes breathing difficult." People also complained that the construction debris piled up on the roads also became a cause of accidents and traffic jams. “I was returning home from the college on a two-wheeler with my brother when we lost balance and got injured due to the sand and stones left unattended by workers of a construction site near my house,” said Deepika Joshi, a resident of Nirala Nagar. Not only some private developers, construction norms were also not being followed at the construction work of a flyover on Rae Bareli Road. The local contractor at the site refused to comment when TOI asked about the reason. Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said that teams under command of executive engineers have been deployed in all eight zones of the city to impose monetary penalties on developers violating NGT norms at construction sites.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to discuss fuel VAT cut in cabinet meeting on Tuesday||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said the government would convene a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to take a call on reducing Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel among other things. The state government is under intense pressure from the opposition to cut VAT on fuel following reduction in excise duty by the Centre recently. “I have written to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to further reduce excise duty on fuel to stop the competition over prices of petrol and diesel among states. The issue will be discussed in the cabinet and whatever is possible will be done. Every state has reduced the VAT differently, which has created a big difference in the price of fuels,” said Gehlot. He accused the Centre of increasing the fuel price by almost Rs 25 to Rs 30 and then slashing it by Rs 15-20. Explaining the fuel mathematics and its implications, he said states are already experiencing a slash in their revenues due to the Centre’s move to reduce excise duty. “The reduction in excise duty by the Centre will lead to a revenue loss of around Rs 1,800 crore,” said Gehlot. He slammed the Union government for disrupting the principle of cooperative federalism by challenging and changing the share of states in centrally sponsored schemes. “Earlier, the share used to be 80:20 between the Centre and the state. Now it has become 50:50 and puts additional burden on the states to carry out development works,” said Gehlot, who argued that the Centre should understand that states have limited sources to generate revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-to-discuss-fuel-vat-cut-in-cabinet-meeting-tomorrow/articleshow/87705090.cms||---

The deceased infant was allegedly thrown in the river by her mother Sahin Shaikh (39) on Friday after she fought with her husband. However,the woman later fabricated the story of her daughter’s kidnapping and lodged a fake complaint in Sachin GIDC police station on Saturday. During questioning, the woman kept changing her statements multiple times before confessing to the cops that she had flung the girl child into the river from Hope Bridge. The woman told the police that she was upset due to the disputes with husband Haroon and was upset with her own parents who refused to help her in settle the disputes with her husband. “Body of the child was found from under Jilani Bridge on Sunday. After completing a few formalities, an offence will be registered. Police will take further action once the complaint is registered,” said a police officer in Rander police station. Accused, who had separated from her first husband around a year ago going against her parent’s wishes, started living with Haroon, an autorickshaw driver, in Unn Nagar area. Meanwhile, she gave birth to the baby girl recently. The couple had developed differences in the past few weeks and would fight over petty issues. “On Friday, Shaikh went to her parental home to complain against Haroon, but her parents refused to support her. Angry at not being supported, the woman then went to the bridge and flung the infant in the river,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/upset-mother-throws-18-day-old-infant-girl-in-river/articleshow/87704156.cms||---

In the last 24 hours, cops have scanned profiles of hundreds of auto drivers and begun gathering details of those accused in some or other offence. “Our priority is to track down the auto drivers who reportedly assaulted the 18-year-old girl in the Vaccine Institute Ground. Our teams are going through the profiles of the auto drivers who have had offences registered against them. Also, we have got hold of CCTV footage of the area where the assault allegedly happened,” said a senior police official. “We are trying to find out the auto rickshaws that passed by on that road during the period when the girl had been assaulted. Each of the auto drivers who were seen in that area will be questioned. Also, the mobile phones that were active in that area and the calls that were made too are being scanned,” the official added. The Vadodara crime branch is assisting the government railway police (GRP) in investigation of the suicide of the Navsari girl who was found hanging in a coach of Gujarat Queen Express at Valsad railway station on November 4.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Despite closure order, abattoir functions sans basic facilities||KOCHI: Despite the Kochi corporation issuing orders to the contractor who manages the slaughterhouse owned by the local body at Kaloor to close down the facility in five days from October 29, the slaughterhouse is still functioning. The pollution control board (PCB) had issued closure notice to the corporation in August as the slaughterhouse doesn’t comply with hygiene norms. But, then the corporation authorities didn’t take strong action. TOI had carried a series of articles regarding the pathetic condition of the slaughterhouse and the PCB issuing closure notice. It is following the demand by Anticorruption People’s Movement, an NGO, that the corporation issued closure notice to the contractor on October 29, 2021. “We are planning to take legal recourse as the corporation and PCB continue to fail in ensuring the closure of the slaughterhouse,” said Anticorruption People’s Movement general secretary N S Unnithan. “In fact, the PCB also has powers to close down the slaughterhouse on its own. But the PCB authorities are not exercising the powers rested with them,” Unnithan said. The PCB had conducted several inspections prior to October 2020. Then, it was found that the slaughterhouse lacks the bare minimum hygiene facilities. Though the PCB officials gave instructions to put in place proper facilities, the corporation authorities didn’t act. In October 2020, the PCB officials again conducted an inspection at the slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse has been functioning without an effluent treatment plant for the past several years. Blood from the slaughter house is being drained out to Thevara-Perandoor canal. Moreover, the animals are being culled in an unscientific manner. The PCB asked the corporation to take corrective measures immediately. The corporation authorities informed the PCB that they would set up an effluent treatment plant by March 2021. In July 2021, the PCB again conducted an inspection only to see that the corporation authorities had done no rectification measures.  A few years ago, Kochi corporation authorities mooted a project for the renovation of the slaughterhouse. The project will be funded by the KIIFB scheme. But the corporation authorities couldn’t even float tenders for the project so far. “For starting the work, the vendors in the slaughterhouse should be rehabilitated. But they are not ready to move out. Though we offered them temporary rehabilitation, they moved the court challenging our decision,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. He said that measures had already been taken for shifting the abattoir to the nearby GCDA market temporarily. Kochi corporation had entrusted a private firm to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the renovation of the plant. The firm has completed the work on the DPR. Effluent treatment plant, which is one of the major components of the renovation project, will comprise an anaerobic plant plus an aerobic plant. First, the effluent would pass through the anaerobic plant for initial treatment. Later, it would be treated at the aerobic plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-closure-order-abattoir-functions-sans-basic-facilities/articleshow/87704563.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation to raze illegal building extensions||KOLKATA: The KMC top brass has instructed buildings department executive engineers to demolish unauthorised constructions in buildings within five days of a notice being issued to the owners. The officials have also been warned against inaction. The circular to executive engineers specifies the power they are bestowed with to serve notice and subsequently demolish illegal structures made by owners and developers. A civic buildings department official conceded that unscrupulous promoters had taken advantage of the festive season, when vigilance was slack due to manpower issues, to add unsanctioned floors in under-construction buildings. Some localities that have witnessed a sudden spurt in such deviations from sanctioned plans or construction of illegal buildings are Burrabazar, Belgachhia, Bidhan Sarani, Entally, Bhowanipore, Tangra, Park Circus, Topsia, Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Tollygunge, Behala, Garia, Jadavpur-Baghajatin belt and large areas located off EM Bypass, including Mukundapur, Nayabad, Madurdaha, Patuli and Kasba. A buildings department official said executive engineers were asked to coordinate with local cops and keep a watch on under-construction buildings. “We have asked executive engineers to also rope in assistant and sub-assistant engineers to keep a vigil. For anything suspicious, they should check buildings department records and alert us. We will take action through the engineers,” the official said. Sources said stop-work notices were being sent for illegal structures. “We have alerted assistant engineers about several illegal buildings. We are sending notices to the owners. If they don’t take action, we, with the help of cops, will demolish the illegal parts,” said a borough executive engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-raze-illegal-building-extensions/articleshow/87704560.cms||Saikat Ray

She was found with injuries on her private parts. Her family alleges she was abducted, gang-raped and then killed. Her father, a sanitation worker, identified the body. Her bicycle, school bag, four bottles of beer, and wrappers of snacks were found on the spot. The family had filed a complaint after the girl went missing, based on which cops registered an FIR under sections 363 (abduction), 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) of the IPC, along with relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2013 at the local police station against unidentified persons. Locals said that the girl, a class XII student, was bright and wanted to secure a government job after completing her education. She used to attend two-hour coaching classes after school and would return home around 5 pm. When the girl did not come back on Saturday evening, her father started searching for her. The coaching centre informed him that she had not come to class that day either. He then approached the police at around 7 pm and lodged a complaint, suspecting that she was abducted by a local boy who was seen following the girl in the past. Cops picked up the boy from his home and took him to the station for questioning. However, he claimed he was not aware of the whereabouts of the girl. Thereafter, police launched a search along with the family and recovered her blood-stained body from a cane field nearly 500 metres away from the village, at around 1 am. A piece of her suit was stuck to her mouth and she was apparently strangled to death using her dupatta. There were injuries on her face, possibly caused by sharp sugarcane leaves, which seemed to indicate the hours of struggle that she put up while she was confined. Pilibhit's superintendent of police, Dinesh Kumar, told TOI, “Soon after recovering the body, we had secured the crime scene and forensic experts were called to gather evidence. The girl had injuries on her face, neck, and below the abdomen. We have included the section of rape in the FIR based on the complaint of the family. However, the autopsy will verify the allegations of sexual assault. Four teams are working on the case, and a few suspects have been detained. A breakthrough is likely soon.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/schoolgirl-16-abducted-gang-raped-murdered-in-pilibhit-blood-stained-body-found-in-cane-field/articleshow/87703837.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Police commissioner A Satish Ganesh, on Sunday, said the report on Osama Shahidwith details about how he was involved with the solvers’ gang and was instrumental in ensuring that ineligible candidates become doctors, has been sent to the KGMU vice-chancellor with a recommendation to impose lifetime ban on Osama’s studies in the institution. Osama was arrested on September 14 after his connections with the Patna-based inter-state solvers’ gang came to light during investigation after the gang was busted with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under Sarnath police station. Police said that Osama, a native of Mau district, who had appeared in MBBS final year exam at KGMU this year, used to look for aspirants on behalf of his gang. The gang used to take contract of arranging impersonators to appear in the entrance exam. The officials said the gang used to charge Rs 30 lakh to Rs 40 lakh from each aspirant. Apart from Osama, police had also arrested Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar. Although the kingpin of the gang Pravik Kumar alias PK alias Neelesh is still absconding. With the progress in investigation, police found that 25 aspirants were in touch with the gang. Of them 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine had skipped. As many things were found fishy in the cases of these 25 aspirants, the National Testing Agency (NTA) director’s cooperation was sought in investigation. Later, NTA withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for 2 years from appearing in the exam. Police have summoned these 16 aspirants to appear before the investigation officer of this case by Monday. The CP said that if the summoned aspirants fail to appear before the investigation officer (IO) by Monday, the police will initiate further legal process through court against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cops-urge-kgmu-vc-to-impose-lifetime-ban-on-arrested-student/articleshow/87704566.cms||---

The crime is said to have taken place around two months ago in a village in the Moradabad area, but the woman informed police on Saturday as the video of the act which the accused had filmed was posted online. She told police she had kept quiet all this while as the perpetrators threatened to make the clip viral on social media if she told anyone about the crime. An FIR has been registered against eight people under various IPC sections, including 376-D (gang-rape). Police are investigating the crime, said the SHO of the police station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls. In her complaint to police, the woman alleged that a man named Javed from her village had forced her to sit on his two-wheeler when she had gone to the market for some work. He then took her to a deserted place, where his friends joined him. The woman alleged that they took turns to rape her while the others filmed the act. She further claimed that the men began to contact her, asking her to “meet them” at various places. However, she refused. Angry at her refusal, they uploaded the video online and thereafter approached the police. The SHO told TOI that an FIR has been registered against Javed and seven others. Police are also probing if it is a case of a love affair gone awry, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-22-accuses-8-of-gang-rape-fir-lodged/articleshow/87703851.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||West Bengal’s 1st free IVF unit to come up at SSKM||KOLKATA: Forty-three years after Subhas Mukhopadhay created India’s first and world’s second test tube baby in a government hospital, Bengal and the eastern region are now set to get the first state-run Centre of Excellence in Reproductive Medicine. Treatment at the unit on the SSKM Hospital campus will be free. The centre will also be home for advanced research. An e-tender that was finalized last week and the Ghosh Dastidar Institute of Fertility Research (GDIFR), run by former Trinamool minister and infertility expert, Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, was chosen to be the knowledge partner for Bengal’s first government-run health care unit offering infertility treatment. The in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic and research centre will come up in the hospital’s OPD block. Fertility expert Gautam Khastgir said, “It’s the best gift for the father of assisted reproductive therapy (ART) on his 90th birth anniversary (celebrated on 1 October). Dr Mukhopadhay had to conduct his experiments quietly inside the NRS Hospital lab because his research had no state support.” The SSKM Hospital’s director Monimoy Bandopadhyay told TOI, “I don’t think there’s any other government-run facility in India like this one. Hospitals like AIIMS provide subsidized treatment, but our centre will take care of everything — from the IVF treatment to the baby’s birth. IVF treatment is inordinately expensive. Several couples from the weaker sections continue to suffer the pangs of childlessness because they cannot afford costly procedures.” IVF is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and a sperm in a laboratory dish and then transferring the embryo to the uterus. The SSKM director said the centre would take six months for full-fledged operations. “We hope to start the OPD in December. GDIFR will provide primary training to doctors, nurses and other medical personnel so the centre becomes independent within three years,” he said. The government will pay GDIFR Rs 2.35crore for three years to “operate, maintain and manage” the IVF centre. Ghosh Dastidar said, “This is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s pet project. We have started training the first team of medicos and technicians. It will be developed as a centre of advanced research as well.” The OPD, starting in December, will help in screening the couples who require IVF. The cost of a single cycle of IVF varies between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh at various private fertility clinics in the city. Since the success rate of live births is only 30% to 40%, more cycles are needed. “Cost is the main reason why many people cannot afford IVF. If one can afford six cycles of IVF, the success rate will go up to 80% or 90%. But the cost also goes up to Rs 4 lakh. Now, more people will be able to get IVF treatment,” Khastgir said. According to estimates, a little less than 10% of all married couples suffer from infertility. While most of them get results through medicines or artificial insemination of sperm into the uterus, about 5% of such couples need IVF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-1st-free-ivf-unit-to-come-up-at-sskm/articleshow/87704578.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The duo, one from Odisha's Jharsuguda and the other a resident of Rohini in west Delhi, couldn't produce identity cards showing their affiliation to any bona fide media organisation, Tripura police said after taking custody of the women from their Assam counterparts. Sammriddhi K Sakunia (21) and Swarna Jha (24), who stayed in a hotel in violence-hit North Tripura's Dharmanagar, had been asked to get their statements recorded in Agartala in connection with a case lodged against them at Kakraban police station in Gomati district under sections 153A (promoting religious enmity) and 120(B) (party to criminal conspiracy) under the IPC. Citing hotel records, the police said the two women had mentioned their occupation as “students” while checking in and mentioned “work” as the purpose of their visit. “This triggered suspicion and we started an investigation after registering a fresh case under various sections of the IPC,” an official said. The women, travelling by taxi, had allegedly taken a detour from Kumarghat on Sunday to enter south Assam instead of proceeding to Agartala. They crossed the inter-state border at Churaibari to avoid detection, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/2-women-journalists-on-tripura-beat-detained-in-assam/articleshow/87705937.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Arunkumar, a daily wage labourer, residing at Olathanni under Neyyattinkara police station limits, is the deceased. The police have taken his 60-year-old father Sasidharan, into custody in connection with the incident. The police said that the alleged crime took place on Saturday night around 9.30 pm. The father and son reportedly consumed alcohol together at home and then broke into a quarrel which soon snowballed into a brawl. In the melee, Sasidharan grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Arunkumar on his chest. Neyyattinkara station house officer inspector V N Sagar said that the neighbours have told the police that drunken quarrels were regular between the father and son. “According to the neighbours, Arunkumar was more aggressive recently and started physically harassing his father. These repeated physical harassment may have acted as catalyst for the rage that led Sasidharan to commit the offence,” the inspector said. Sasidharan was working as a supplier at a restaurant near Neyyattinkara. His wife Santha was at home when the alleged crime took place. Arunkumar was a bachelor. His body was shifted to the mortuary on Sunday after inquest procedure. The post mortem examination will be conducted on Monday. Just over a week ago, a father was killed by his son during a similar drunken brawl at their home at Vellayani under Nemom police station limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drunken-brawl-father-kills-son/articleshow/87704588.cms||---

A large group of children belonging to different age groups associated with NGO ‘Udaan’ that works for the welfare of youngsters with type-1 diabetes, were a part of the morning trek at Hanuman Tekadi. After the trekking expedition, a formal awareness programme was held at the foothill by ‘Udaan’ office-bearers and volunteers along with the health authorities. Speaking on the occasion, Tope said, the state government is committed to providing all possible healthcare to children with type-1 diabetes. “There is a need for creating more public awareness about diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes. The state government has set up blood-sugar monitoring facilities even at the government health sub-centres, among other services for the benefit of the patients,” he said. Tope also showered praises upon ‘Udaan’ founder Dr Archana Sarda, who has received the diabetologist award, 2021 from the Research and Study Society for Diabetes in India. “True to its name, ‘Udaan’ has infused new confidence in children with type-1 diabetes and helped them lead a normal life. Dr Sarda and her team have given wings to the dreams of scores of children,” Tope added. An awareness rally involving people from different walks of life was also organized at the end of the event, which saw the participation of volunteers with posters and banners. Type-1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, leading to a dependency on insulin from an early age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tope-treks-with-type-1-diabetic-children/articleshow/87703328.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Documentary presents work of students during lockdown||KOCHI: As part of the Children’s Day celebrations, Ernakulam Vidyarangam Kalasahityavedi launched a documentary that presents various crafty activities undertaken by school students. The one-hour documentary named ‘Mikavukal’ presents the videos of students making various items like LED bulbs, hand-sanitizers, origami models, bottle-arts, clay models, soaps, automobile models and even the miniature model of an aircraft carrier, etc., while they were confined to their houses during the pandemic-induced second lockdown. The students made the crafts using the materials available at their house and directions were given to promote reuse and recycle of non-degradable materials. The activities were given to them to keep them engaged during the lockdown and nurture their crafty skills. Though students of all schools in the 14 sub-districts in Ernakulam took part in the activity, the videos of only 26 selected students were added to the documentary after screening. Simla Kasim, the coordinator of Vidyarangam Kalasahityavedi in Ernakulam, is the director of the documentary. She said that the aim was not only to nurture the craft skills in children but also make them spread their knowledge to peers through the video. So in each video, the student has to explain how he/she made that particular craft. For example, Jilto George, a Class VIII student of St Little Theresa’s High School, Vazhakulam, who made the aircraft carrier model, which he named INS Vishal, explains how he designed and made it. The ship model is seen floating in the water perfectly. He also talks about the purpose of aircraft carriers in war and peace times and explains the functions of control tower, radar and runways. “Some students have made handicraft items using coconut shells, and used clothes for embroidery. Some used old papers to make the crafts and models. The lockdown time was challenging and boring for all students and we wanted them to be engaged. The documentary is being shared across various platforms,” Kasim said. LSGD minister M V Govindan, health minister Veena George, screenwriter John Paul, writer Benyamin and magician Gopinath Muthukad were among the ones who congratulated the students and the Kalasahityavedi for the initiative. The technical support for the documentary was given by Sathi K Thankappan, Eldhose P V, Prathapan M N, and C Reji Paul, who are members of the Kalasahityavedi. The editing was done by R Harikrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/documentary-presents-work-of-students-during-lockdown/articleshow/87704592.cms||---

According to the petitioners, a policeman hit the dog — a pug — and soon after it died. Police however denied the allegation and claimed that they went their looking for one Justin, 29, an accused in over 15 cases, including a murder case. Justin was arrested by Nedumassery police on Friday evening for alleged attempted extortion and threatening. Jijo Thankachan of Chengamanad, who owns the dog, admitted that his brother Justin was indeed in conflict with the law but alleged that this was no reason for the policemen to attack his dog. “Three policemen, including the Chengamanad circle inspector, came to our house on Saturday evening. My mother was alone at the house. She was looking at two of the policemen outside the house, through the window when another policeman entered through the backdoor. Our pet, Pixy, had walked towards the backdoor by then. My mother soon heard the noise of her getting hit and by the time she reached the backdoor the dog had fallen. My mother confronted the officer, but he rushed to his jeep without answering her,” said Thankachan, adding that the police threatened his mother when she questioned them outside the house. However, the police claimed that the policemen did not hit the dog. “We went there to serve a summons to Justin in a case. This seems to be an allegation to trap us. There have been incidents in the past as well where dogs were unleashed when policemen go looking for culprits. We have nothing to do with the death of the dog. If they have a complaint let an investigation take place,” said an officer with Chengamanad police. Thankachan said that he was planning to approach the district police chief with a complaint. He added that the policemen at the station informally admitted their fault to him but did not register a case. The family has even kept the carcass of the dog in their refrigerator seeking an inquiry. Meanwhile, animal rights activist Sachithra Soman said that she visited the house. “It is true that the dog died, and they have kept the body in the refrigerator to ensure that an autopsy takes place. They say that the policeman hit the dog causing the death. There were two dogs at the house, the seven-year-old Pixy which died and a two-year-old puppy, Paulo. Both are pugs and Paulo seemed to be a very loving pet,” said Soman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pet-dog-dies-after-being-hit-by-policeman-says-owner/articleshow/87704584.cms||---
---||Jaipur||270 species of winged guests arrive in Jaisalmer||JAISALMER: With the temperature dipping gradually, more than 270 species of migratory birds, including falcons, cranes, and vultures along with endangered ones such as common rock thrushes and sociable lapwings, from across the globe have started visiting the Desert National Park and the nearby areas. Wildlife experts and bird watchers have attributed the phenomenon to the good rains in the arid regions this year which contributed to the greenery. They said several rare species from colder countries like Kazakhstan and Russia are visiting for the first time this year and they were excited to study them. The sociable lapwing, which is on the verge of extinction covered around 12,000 km from Kazakhstan to reach Jaisalmer. A duck, that is usually found in Himalayan areas has been spotted in Lathi, Dholi, and Khetolai areas of Jaisalmer. Thousands of kurja birds have come to Ramdeora and Khetolai areas. Wildlife specialist Dr Divesh Saini said, "Common rock thrushes or rufous-tailed rock thrushes breed in open, dry and hilly areas, usually above 1,500 m above the sea level. They build cup nests in rock cavities and lay 4 to 5 eggs per clutch." "They are omnivorous and consume insects, berries, and small reptiles. Common rock thrushes are generally shy and quiet, but they may make short squeaky whistles. The males produce an enchanting soft and melodic song," he said. Environment enthusiast and bird watcher, Radheyshyam Pemani, said, "The sociable lapwing is rare and critically endangered as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This species breeds in Kazakhstan and Russia, and reaches India in winter." He said this attractive medium-sized lapwing has longish black legs and a short black bill. Summer adults have grey backs and breasts with dark bellies and white undertails, he said. "The head has a striking pattern with a black crown and eye-stripe, the latter being bordered above and below with white. The upper neck is ochre. Its longish black legs, white tail with a black terminal band, and distinctive brown, white and grey wings make it almost unmistakable in flight. The call is a harsh ‘kereck’. Winter adults have a less distinct head pattern, slightly browner back and breast, and a white belly," he said. He said the sociable lapwing ( Vanellus gregarius) is critically endangered due to rapid decline in the population and habitat loss. He said "This species breeds on open grasslands in Russia and Kazakhstan. These birds migrate south to wintering sites, including India. It feeds similarly, picking insects in grassland." Meanwhile, 124th birth anniversary of Dr Salim Ali, Birdman of India, was celebrated as The National Bird Day on 12th Friday at the park. Bird watchers and nature enthusiasts from Jaisalmer had planned a bird survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/voyaging-12000km-from-kazakhstan-winged-guests-reach-jaisalmer/articleshow/87705127.cms||---

Ragesh alias Vinod, 35, of Kaduvachira near Chullimanoor is the one who will stand on trial before judge K N Ajith Kumar. The prosecution case against the accused is that he murdered his father-in-law, Sundaresan, 60, of Chennanpara near Vithura on November 18, 2017, by stabbing him using a pair of scissors. The murder was committed when the victim intervened to save his daughter from assaulted by the accused. Public prosecutor M Salahudeen will represent the prosecution during the trial. According to the prosecution, Ragesh was married to Sundaresan’s daughter Priya and he used to live with his in-laws. Ragesh used to physically abuse Priya often and this had caused frequent quarrels between him and Sundaresan. On the day of the crime, the accused assaulted Priya for the delay in serving lunch. At this point, Sundaresan intervened and confronted Ragesh. This soon made way for a brawl. In the melee, Ragesh grabbed a pair of scissors from the almirah and stabbed Sundaresan on his neck. Though neighbours rushed to the house and took Sundaresan to hospital, the doctors could not save his life. The accused soon fled from the house and was caught three days later by the police. The crime happened in front of Sundaresan’s wife Vasantha, son Pradeep and daughter Priya.

RG founder Manoj Parab made the announcement at an event at Azad Maidan in the state capital and stated that the party will field candidates in every constituency. “Revolutionary Goans will contest election on Goa Su-Raj party name. This is not a seat-sharing adjustment or tie-up of any compromise or setting. Here we, Revolutionary Goans, will remain as RG but as we need a political party and single symbol to contest the elections, we have decided to do it with Goa Su-Raj party,” Parab said. RG had applied for registration as a party seven months back but have not received recognition as yet. Parab also announced that he had met with Aam Aadmi Party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal and political strategist Prashant Kishor, who is currently lobbying for Trinamool Congress. “Today the time has come to say that Goans are not helpless, we are revolutionary. We will save our Goa. It is time for Goans to get out of the slavery to people from other states. There are dalals today who are running from one party to the other. They don’t have principles, they don’t have an ideology,” Parab said. Parab acknowledged that he used to consider Kishor as his political guru and had approached him seeking assistance from Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) for the upcoming polls. Parab said that Kishor brushed him aside and said that RG will not win more than 500 votes. “These parties from Delhi and other places have treated us as dirt,” said Parab. “We will win the elections and show them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rg-to-contest-2022-elections-under-goa-su-raj-banner/articleshow/87705143.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Weekend spurt in drink-driving cases||KOLKATA: Weekends have thrown up new challenges to traffic cops in the city with a spurt in the number of drink-driving cases. A week after Lalbazar re-introduced breathalyzers, cops prosecuted total 62 motorists, including bikers, for drink-driving. The drive, which had begun a week ago, saw 29 prosecutions in weekdays, expect for Wednesday (Chhath). Between Friday night and Sunday morning, 33 more motorists were prosecuted. “This indicates that we need to step up monitoring on the road with the onset of winter. Usually, we kick off such drives in December every year. This time, we have started the drive early,” said an officer. However, the officers at Lalbazar, who had drawn up an SOP for breathalyzer test earlier, are still not happy with the rising number of drink-driving cases reported from across all the traffic guards. Cops at all the 25 traffic guards have been asked to start nakas by 9pm. “We may deploy patrol trucks too,” said an officer. “Cops on trucks can carry the barricades and put them up at different points of the city,” he added. While Jorabagan guard continued to report the highest 14 drink-driving cases throughout the week, the headquarter traffic guard came second. However, the South and East guards recorded less number of prosecutions despite several pubs being located in their areas. Beliaghata, Sealdah, Kasba and Vidyasagar guards made significant number of prosecutions. In several places, ACPs have already recommended to RTOs for temporary suspension of licences for a few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-spurt-in-drink-driving-cases/articleshow/87704594.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Neki ki Deewar’ serves needy with dignity, respect in Chittor||JAIPUR: Every city has ‘Neki Ki Deewar’ (Wall of Righteous) as a collection point where the donors drop their old clothes and the poor pick them up as per their need. The wall in Chittorgarh has gone beyond the usual by dry cleaning, ironing and packing the donated clothes before the needy take them. Also, civil society members have appointed a cobbler who repairs, and polishes donated slippers and shoes for the needy. Every day over hundreds of people from poor families and the homeless queue up at the wall which has been converted into a proper shop by the local administration. Here the beneficiaries get clothes of their size and have the option of selecting the colours and fabric too. Mukesh Sharma, a member of a civil society group says that until two years it was just a raised platform where the donors would throw their old clothes. “We could see that the clothes thrown by the donors would get dirty in the open. It was very painful to see that beneficiaries had to pick and choose the cleanest from the pile of dirty clothes,” said Sharma, who mobilised civil society members to create a model to provide ease and ensure the dignity of those taking clothes. The local administration along with Acharya Shri Tulsi Foundation came forward by forming a management system to provide clean clothes to the needy. Sunil Dhiliwal of the foundation says that they first converted the place into a shop with proper racks to put the clothes. “A laundry service and tailor were hired for washing, stitching, ironing, coding and packing of the clothes,” said Dhiliwal. This has increased takers - from homeless beggars to poor families from nearby villages - who come and collect clothes according to their size. The success of the model has prompted the civil society members to start the same service by providing footwear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/neki-ki-deewar-serving-the-needy-with-dignity-and-respect-edt-310/articleshow/87705136.cms||---

However, the Akali team had to face protests by several farmers who had gathered outside a resort where Sukhbir was supposed to address a rally. They showed black flags at Sukhbir Badal, and also argued with policemen present at the spot. One of the protestors also alleged that his turban was removed during the tussle, but the police has refused to comment on the matter. The protesters maintained that the dharna was peaceful, but even then the police removed them from the spot. On the other hand, the police claimed that they were deputed to avoid any clash and they did their best to maintain the law and order situation.Congress leaders have also attacked the Akali Dal over the incident, and claimed that black flags are waived at Sukhbir each and every time he visits a rural area. District Congress president Ashwani Sharma said, “This is the reason Sukhbir is visiting Ludhiana urban areas time and again, because whenever he goes to rural areas, people protest against him. They have lost their ground among rural voters which used to be their strength some years back.” He said that the Akali Dal had supported the BJP over agriculture bills, and farmers will never forget this thing. However, Akali Dal MLA Manpreet Ayali countered the allegations, “There was great response to the rally and other programmes by voters in Gill constituency. People are not happy with the Congress because promises made by Captain Amarinder Singh were never fulfilled. As far as these protests are concerned, these are not farmers, but opposition party members who want to harm the Akali Dal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sukhbir-visits-gill-constituency-faces-farmer-protests/articleshow/87703895.cms||---

All these samples were of people who either lived close to or worked with the two Zika virus patients reported in the city on Thursday. Currently, the city has three Zika virus patients – a 24-year-old woman from LDA colony (Kanpur road), a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh and a 48-year-old woman from Lal Kuan. “The samples sent by the CMO office for testing at KGMU have turned out to be negative. Currently, we have two sources for sample collection – through three government hospitals (Lokbandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, Dr SPM Civil hospital and Balrampur hospital) where random sampling is being done and through contact tracing of positive patients,” said district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. “The three patients are doing fine. The young woman had mild fever on Sunday so we gave her medication,” said Dr Vardhan, who visited the patient on Sunday. The health department had created a 400m radius for contact tracing from each of the positive patient’s house which was expanded on Sunday by a few kilometres to widen the search area for more Zika positive patients, if any. Accordingly, 122 samples were collected by 142 teams from three areas and sent to KGMU for testing on Sunday. Test results are awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/106-samples-sent-for-zikatesting-found-negative/articleshow/87705139.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BSP appoints former U’khand head as party’s state poll in-charge; to contest in all 70 seats||Roorkee: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has made 55-year-old Shish Pal Singh, a party's former Uttarakhand-head, as its new state president again ahead of next year's assembly election. The party has replaced Singh, a resident of a local village, with Naresh Gautam, who had taken command in 2020. Before Gautam, a UP resident, Singh was the state party president for over a year. The party also announced that it will contest all 70 assembly seats this time. The BSP has been going through a rough patch in the hill state as it could not win a seat in the 2017 assembly election. In 2012, the party secured three - all from Haridwar - and in 2007, BSP won eight seats. The party registered its best performance in terms of vote percentage in 2002 when it secured 10.93% votes, winning seven assembly seats. Its vote share has been dwindling since and in 2017, it shrunk to 7%. However, the party still has a considerable hold in Haridwar, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar districts. "In 2012, we had won three seats, but after that we witnessed shrinking of our base here. The reason behind this was the rise of the BJP. They made false promises. This time, we will be a kingmaker after the polls," said Singh, a native of Sikanderpur Bhainswal village who had fought the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Tehri seat. Meanwhile, Mohd Shahzad, a two-time party MLA from Haridwar district, is the party's new vice-president. Political observers said that BSP could perform well in the polls. "Haridwar district has 11 assembly seats and more than 2.5 Dalit voters are here. If the party revamps its election engineering with other major communities of the district, including Muslims, from booth level to sector levels, it surely can perform well in the election," said political analyst and lawyer Rao Naved Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bsp-appoints-former-ukhand-head-as-partys-state-poll-in-charge-to-contest-in-all-70-seats/articleshow/87703893.cms||Tapan Susheel

The PIL before Bombay high court highlights the unregulated business of cryptocurrency and seeks direction to the Centre, Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank of India, SEBI, and other authorities to take urgent steps to protect interest of citizens by formulating laws or guidelines to govern the use and trade of cryptocurrency within the country, including a taxation mechanism for all such transactions within or outside the country.  Advocate Aditya Kadam, who filed the PIL, says he has been investing in cryptocurrency since 2018 and given the lack of any regulatory mechanism seeks judicial intervention to develop “a mechanism for monitoring international transactions conducted within the country by establishing a separate organization or by bringing cryptocurrencies under the scope of previously established bodies under Government of India.’’ He also seeks orders to regulate registration of cryptocurrency exchange platforms and a mechanism of redressal of investor grievances against registered trading platforms in India. The petitioner said his PIL is filed to “highlight underlying problems and uncontrolled, unchecked trades and malpractices in crypto currency trading.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-advocates-pil-seeks-laws-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/articleshow/87705950.cms||---

The accident was so intense that it took around an hour for the police to cut the vehicle and take out the bodies of the victims. According to police, Manish Sharma (30) and his friend Rohit Kumar (28), working in a private company in Mathura, were travelling to Haridwar via Ghaziabad on Saturday night when the accident took place. The car was heading at a speed of over 100 kilometre per hour, claimed police. The assessment was made after they found the body of 45-year-old Mahendra Singh, from Kankarkhera. Singh was crossing the road while he was hit by the car. The driver tried to stop the vehicle but failed, said police. “Prima facie, it seems that the speeding car first hit Mahendra. After the accident, they tried to move in a wrong direction with an aim to flee the spot. This is when they rammed into a bus, leaving the two passengers in the car dead. The pedestrian too died at the spot,” said station house officer, Kankarkhera, Subodh Saxena. This is the second such accident in this area in the last 24 hours. On Friday night, two brothers died after being hit by a speeding truck near the same location. The two cousins, residents of Meerut’s Modinagar area, were returning home after distributing invitation cards for their sister’s wedding, scheduled on November 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/speeding-car-hits-a-pedestrian-then-rams-into-bus-three-dead/articleshow/87703896.cms||Ishita Mishra

Purported videos of the illegal mining were released by Congress at a press briefing on Sunday and the party said that it may move court against the government if no action is taken. However, the district administration claimed that no such mining is on in the region and permission has only been given by the government for "river draining in the area". Congress national spokesperson Alok Sharma said the illegal mining work is on along Ravasan river with heavy machines without any restrictions and the state government should make its stand clear on such mining activities. Dismissing the claims, SDM of Haridwar Puran Singh Rana told TOI, "Allegations of illegal mining are false and no such mining is taking place in the entire region. They have permission for mining with machines and our team went to the site on Saturday and no fault was found.

---||Jaipur||For 5th straight day, city’s AQI has been ‘very poor’||JAIPUR: For the second time this season, the city reported ‘very poor’ air quality on Sunday while Kota remained the most-polluted in the state as its air quality further deteriorated and its AQI touched 375. It is the second day in a row when residents of Kota woke up to ‘poor air’ quality. In Udaipur, the air quality turned ‘very poor’ from ‘poor’ in 24 hours. However, in Bhiwadi, the air quality improved from ‘severe’ to ‘very poor.’ For the past four days, the city has been witnessing increase in AQI. On November 10, the AQI was 195 and fell in the ‘moderate’ level. It increased to 198 on November 11, November 12 (236), November 13 (300) and 328 on November 14. There are six AQI categories — good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe. The AQI is calculated on eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb). It means that if the air quality turns very poor, the level of mixture of noxious gases goes up. AQI is emerged as one such tool for effective dissemination of air quality information to people. According to the state’s pollution control board, the air quality has deteriorated as velocity of air has decreased with the onset of winters, which is why pollutants do not disperse easily. Ajmer has the best air quality in the state as it has been categorised as satisfactory. In Jodhpur, the air quality continued to deteriorate for the past two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-5th-straight-day-citys-aqi-has-been-very-poor/articleshow/87705148.cms||---
---||Goa||Multiple checks system put in place to finalise private forests||Panaji: The review committee, carrying out verification of the additional private forest areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo panel, found many land owners raising objections during the process. This required the sub-committees to revisit the survey numbers several times. In view of this, the review committee has now put in place multiple checks and weekly monitoring mechanisms, involving forest officials, talathis and government surveyors. So far, until August this year, the review committee has verified and was able to find that an additional 1,396 hectares or 14sqkm of area in Goa qualifies as private forest. This area is in addition to the 46.11sqkm of the private forest identified by earlier committees and approved by the National Green Tribunal. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said in the assembly in July that the review of the additional private forest areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo panel will be completed by March 2022. The government panels while identifying private forests applied the criteria that the area should be either contiguous to the government forest lands or, if in isolation, the minimum area identified should be 5ha. And, canopy density should not be less than 0.4. The review committee has now formed several sub-committees, which are carrying out ground enumeration mainly based on the third criteria – that at least 75% of the tree species in the private forest being of forestry type. This will be the determining factor for an identified area to qualify as private forest. So that there are no objections to the forest found to be qualifying as private forest from the land owners, the review committee has now put multiple checks in place. “The range forest officer/member secretary of the sub-committee shall invariably visit all the sites and verify 100% sample points on the ground. Further, inspector of survey and land records & talathi shall also attend the field enumeration and verify the report prepared by the sub-committee before sending it to the review committee,” the committee has said in its new guidelines. In addition, it has said that the assistant conservator of forests (ACF) should be assigned an area for checking and he should verify at least 20% of the sample points in each sheet. “The deputy conservator of forests of both divisions shall conduct regular and random test checks for verification of the reports submitted by the sub-committees. DCFs shall conduct at least 5% random checking of the reports submitted by the sub-committees and verify the reports before sending it to the review committee,” the guidelines state. Besides this, geo-reference photographs of the trees at sampling points have to be taken mandatorily, along with the representatives, objectors or owners of the land, the review committee has said. The ACFs have also been asked to visit the DCF’s office every Tuesday and Friday to carry out the work of scrutinising all field reports for correctness and completeness. The review committee has asked for weekly report of the field verification exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/multiple-checks-system-put-in-place-to-finalise-private-forests/articleshow/87705158.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Film festival to screen city director’s docu on Karbala||Kolkata: An invitation via email to visit Iraq resulted in the making of National Award winner Sourav Sarangi’s documentary, ‘Karbala Memoirs’, on the world’s largest annual public gathering. The 40-minute film, which is being screened at the 4th South Asian Short Film Festival at Nandan on Monday, was shot during his week-long journey in Iraq, where he travelled 70km on foot to visit the Shia pilgrimage of Arba’een Walk that witnessed around 25 million people from across the world walking from Najaf to Karbala. According to the director, who is a Presidency College-FTII alumni, shooting this film revealed a new perspective about religion and tolerance. Sarangi was invited to join this Shia pilgrimage, where millions go on a peaceful march to pay tribute to Hussain, grandson of the prophet, who was killed in a war about 1,400 years ago. “Growing up in Kanthi, I had been to the Muharram fair at the local Karbala ground. While I knew about Haj, Arba’een was new for me. Hardly much is written or filmed about this pilgrimage. Everything including food and lodging is offered free there. An Islamic philanthropic organization, despite knowing my religion, wanted me to observe their rituals of the pilgrimage and archive it,” he said. Sourav Sarangi at Najaf's Wadi-us-Salaam which is the world's largest cemeteryRisking deportation in the absence of an Iraqi visa, Sarangi still landed in Najaf in 2017 and finally entered a maze of tombstones at Wadi-us-Salaam - the world’s largest cemetery - with a four-member unit comprising assistant Minarul Mandal and Iraqi cameraman Usama Tmimi. Men, women, and even toddlers in prams and elderly in wheelchairs are part of the Arba’een Walk. Some thump their chests, others collectively wail in remembrance of the martyrdom of Hussain. “Rituals and personal experiences merge to result in catharsis in remembrance of their personal bereavement,” he said. Music, he said, played an important part. That’s evident in Santajit Chatterjee’s intelligent sound design and Sujoy Das’ mixing. Chest-beats overlap with the sound of the marching feet and somewhere connects with the idea of protest. In place of talking heads, Sarangi used his own voiceover and even lyrics of songs that played in the background. “Retaining the interview format risked the essence of our exchange of emotions getting lost in front of the camera,” he said. The voiceover touched upon issues like power, faith and world politics. His writing, which effectively merges disjointed experiences, added an extra edge. “There is a sense of claustrophobia in a world increasingly divided on religious lines. This journey to Karbala showed me another side of religion that can stand for universal peace and love,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/film-festival-to-screen-city-directors-docu-on-karbala/articleshow/87704604.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The passengers, calling the train a lifeline for them to reach colleges and offices, have demanded the continuation of the train. While the aforesaid DEMU train is being cancelled to start the new DEMU train between Kacheguda and Rotegaon, passengers have said that the timings of the former train are only suitable for them. Raj Somani, a railway activist said that the cancellation of the DEMU train between Rotegaon and Nanded would cause huge inconvenience to many passengers. “Without any consultation with the stakeholders, the SCR has taken unilateral decision to cancel the DEMU train in question. The SCR is earning huge revenue by running the train and therefore, it makes no sense in taking such irrational decision,” he said. Many students from the outskirts and nearby areas pursue higher education in Aurangabad by taking benefit of the rail connectivity. Besides, a considerable chunk of the working population from local industries and other establishments also rely on DEMU trains for commuting daily. Gangapur MLA Prashant Bamb, in a letter, addressed to the railway authorities, said many students would suffer due to the cancellation of the DEMU train between Rotegaon and Nanded. “While the Covid outbreak has already hit the students hard, the cancellation of DEMU train will create commuting issues for students plying between Aurangabad and the outskirt areas,” he said. When contacted, the public relations officer for the Nanded division of SCR, Rajesh Shinde, said the top-brass of the railways would take note of any feedback from the passengers over services of the concerned DEMU train.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP kept promise on law & order, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday reached out to the trading community maintaining that the BJP fulfilled the key poll promise of a robust law and order situation it made to the people in 2017 UP assembly elections. Addressing a “Vaishya and Trader” convention called by the BJP, Yogi said that it was because of the hard work of the trading community that UP has turned into a second biggest economy in the country. The convention, which was called by Naresh Agarwal, former Rajya Sabha member who has switched over from SP to BJP, was attended by a host of senior BJP leaders including Union minister Piyush Goyal and UP minister Nand Gopal Nandi. CM Yogi Adityanath being felicitated at Vaishya conventionThe CM categorically drew a contrast with the situation before 2017, when the state faced riots, especially during festivals and criminals gaining political patronage. Yogi also referred to alleged exodus of Hindu families in Kairana in the aftermath of 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and subsequent criminalisation in west UP. "It is no longer the case. Rioters have been rendered silent and the criminals are behind bars," he said. The CM said that it was because of well-coordinated efforts of the Centre and the state government that proper security for investors and traders was being ensured. He highlighted how the ever increasing GST collection was indicative of the growing business opportunity. Lauding the Modi government, Yogi said that India would have been turned into an economic super power soon after independence had the then Central leadership been like that of the present day time. “Be it coronavirus management, schemes meant for farmer welfare or making the country self-reliant (Atmanirbhar Bharat), the government did everything which was needed,” he said. Endorsing Yogi’s views, Goyal said that UP witnessed an immense change which was no less than a “kranti” (revolution). He said that the Vaishya community cared for the country and the society rather than its individual interest. “We often see social works being essentially done by the people from the Vaishya community,” Goyal said, exhorting the trader community to once again help the BJP to form the government . ‘Communist forces trying to create rift’UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the BJP was facing a “crisis situation” as “separatists” and “communist” forces have reached UP to create rift on the basis of caste and religion. “They want to destabilise UP,” he said, and asked workers to visit 1,000 households of backwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-kept-promise-on-law-order-yogi/articleshow/87705156.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ludhiana||Thieves make hay as banks, fin firms take time to act||Ludhiana: The Ludhiana police have given time to the banks and the gold finance companies to ensure safety measures, including deployment of security guards. Banks and finance firms’ officers have to ask their headquarters for security measures, which is taking time, thereby giving robbers a chance to take advantage of this delay. In the recent past, many ATM kiosks, mostly without guards, were targeted. Despite a number of such cases, the police administration has failed to ensure that all ATMs have security personnel deployed even at night, as many have guards only during the day. However, in several areas even during daytime guards are missing. On Saturday near Kailash Cinema Chowk, two assailants had tried to rob a man who was withdrawing cash from an ATM. One of the accused was carrying an illegal country-made pistol, with which he shot at the man who suffered an injury. A security guard present at a nearby shop and some locals managed to nab one the accused and his accomplice was arrested later. On Sunday, the TOI found several ATM kiosks at Pakhowal Road, Kochar Market, near Hero Bakery Chowk, Ferozepur Road near Bharat Nagar Chowk, Model Gram, Gill Road, Dugri and Chandigarh Road without security guards. On November 12, burglars had targeted an ATM of SBI in Swadi Kalan village, Sidhwan Bet, and fled with Rs 9.47 lakh by using a gas cutter. The ATM had a security guard in daytime, but not at night. Prior to that on September 25, car-borne miscreants first broke open the shutter of an ATM of SBI in Bhutta village using a gas cutter, sprayed something on the CCTV camera, then using the same gas cutter broke open the ATM and escaped with cash. The machine contained approximately Rs 18.38 lakh.Joint commissioner of police (city) J Elanchezhian said after the robbery bid at Muthoot Finance on October 30, all such finance firms and banks were asked to have security guards deployed and get other measures installed, but as they have to take up the matter with their headquarters, it was delaying the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/thieves-make-hay-as-banks-fin-firms-take-time-to-act/articleshow/87703909.cms||Payal Dhawan

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in order to ensure smooth purchase of the crop, all key officers, including ADMs, SDMs and tehsildars, had been asked to conduct on-site inspection of purchase centres every day. He said the nodal officers posted at district level would ensure procurement through a transparent process. He warned that negligence would not be accepted at any cost. Food commissioner, Saurabh Babu, said, “The procurement agencies have so far procured 3.66 lakh MT of paddy worth Rs 711.9 crore from farmers. The state government agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) procured the food grain from at least 54,609 farmers.”A total of 4,020 procurement centres have been set up across the state to facilitate direct purchase from farmers.

---||Meerut||Congress will not form any alliance for UP elections, says Priyanka Gandhi||MEERUT: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday said her party will not forge any poll alliance with any party ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year. She said Congress workers have been asking her to do anything but join hands with other parties, adding that she respects the views of partymen. Congress will give a chance to its dedicated workers who have worked for the party over the years, she said. Addressing over 7,000 Congress workers from Meerut, Agra and Aligarh zones during party’s ‘Pratigya Sammelan’ held in Bulandshahr on Sunday, she said the BJP government doesn’t understand the rights of the people and the meaning of independence because they have not fought for India’s freedom. While praising BR Ambedkar for his contribution in drafting the Indian Constitution, Priyanka also mentioned the contributions of Indira Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Sardar Patel in India's freedom struggle. Priyanka – who had recently bumped into Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav while they were on a flight, and also met the BSP supremo on Sunday to offer her condolences after the death of Mayawati’s mother – had sparked rumours of alliance with these two prominent parties. Also, a brief meeting of Priyanka and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary recently was seen as a hint towards an alliance, but Congress refrained from speaking on the issue. “In the past five years, Congress has been working for the people of Uttar Pradesh, and partymen are fighting the real battle in UP,” she said. Party workers have been raising burning issues such as inflation, atrocities on the farmers and the poor, CAANRC, atrocities on Dalits, etc, she added. During the dialogue with party office-bearers, Priyanka chalked out the strategy of elections and stressed on social media presence. She had asked all groundlevel workers to form WhatAapp groups and run Congress’s campaign on social media. The media was asked not to cover the event live as she was speaking to party workers about the party’s poll preparations in western UP. Priyanka had last month announced 40% reservation of seats for women in the upcoming UP polls. During Sunday's Bulandshahr meet, the Congress general secretary asked party office-bearers to give the front seats to women workers, and also had a separate meeting with the women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/congress-will-not-form-any-alliance-ahead-of-up-polls-priyanka-gandhi-vadra/articleshow/87703912.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Pune||High prevalence of post-Covid fatigue in type-2 diabetes patients, finds study||PUNE: Post-Covid-19 Syndrome has emerged as a major roadblock in the recovery of Covid-19 patients. Amidst many symptoms such as myalgia (muscle pain), headache, cough and breathlessness, fatigue is most prevalent. Fortis C-DOC, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi, National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation and Diabetes Foundation, recently conducted a joint study that was published in the journal, ‘Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews’. The study found that type-2 diabetes patients who had Covid-19 showed significantly more fatigue as compared to those not infected by the coronavirus. While experts have said diabetes poses a challenge in the recovery of patients, the results of the study further show that diabetes complicates the course of Covid-19 and results in excess mortality. Sushant Rajput, diabetologist, said, “The right approach is for a treating clinician, psychological counsellor, nutritionist, and physical therapist to help with all-round recovery of diabetics infected with Covid-19.” Dietitian Supriya Kulkarni emphasized proper nutrition. “Keeping one’s glucose level in check is reliant on proper nutrition and exercise/activity,” she said. Adarsh Shetty, physiologist, said that patients with Type-2 diabetes must consider physiotherapy for the recovery of their pulmonary and cardiovascular health. General physician Junaid Siddique said diabetics should be regular with their medical check-ups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-prevalence-of-post-covid-fatigue-in-type-2-diabetes-patients-finds-study/articleshow/87704616.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Ludhiana||AAP: DC being transferred for not allowing wrong sale of LIT land||Ludhiana: Local unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday alleged that deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma was being transferred and they “opposed this punishment” to the officer. Addressing mediapersons here, AAP Ludhiana Lok Sabha polls in-charge Amandeep Singh Mohi said, “The DC was being penalised for his honesty and upright behaviour as he had taken a stand against the sale of government properties by the ruling party.”AAP Punjab spokesman Ahbaab Singh Grewal alleged that the deputy commissioner was being punished as he had not allowed the sale of improvement trust land and building at rates much lower than the market value and had also marked an inquiry against Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid. Mohi and Grewal claimed that the AAP wouldn't allow an honest officer to be penalised for doing his duty and saving hundreds of crores of public money. AAP leaders alleged that the officer being brought to replace him was Dr Amarpal Singh, who is “highly indebted to the Badals for saving him in the iron ore scam and due to which he was promoted to the IAS.” AAP leaders Gurjit Singh Gill, Madan Laal Bagga and Ashok Prashar (Pappi) said, “Our party will approach the election commission against this arbitrary and wrong step of the Punjab government.” They said this pointed to collusion between the SAD and the Congress, as they were trying to team up like the last time against the AAP. Grewal and Mohi said the transfer was against the rules laid down by the ECI. Party’s district secretary Sharanpal Singh Makkar, district vice-president Dr Deepak Bansal and media in-charge Dupinder Singh were also present at the press meet. The Congress, however, has refuted the allegations. Congress’s district president (urban) Ashwani Sharma said he was not aware about the transfer and if it was done, it must be in routine. He added that the AAP has no issue left because chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has delivered on the promises. The Congress leader said the deputy commissioner had no role in the auction of the LIT land and no inquiry was marked against the Gill MLA.The DC refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/aap-dc-being-transferred-for-not-allowing-wrong-sale-of-lit-land/articleshow/87703929.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Equating Jinnah, Patel petty politics, says CM||Lucknow: As the controversy around SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s ‘Jinnah comment’ refuses to die down, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday termed the statement equating Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel as “petty vote bank politics at the cost of national interest”. Speaking at an event by Brahmin Parivar, Yogi said one could assume what would have happened had Patel not been there. “Comparing Jinnah with Patel is no less than an attempt to humiliate the entire generation. How long will we accept this,” he asked. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and cabinet minister Brajesh Pathak were also present on the occasion. Yogi also flayed the previous Congress-led UPA government at the Centre for not considering the pain and sufferings of Kashmiri pandits year after year. “For them, only power and chair were important,” he said, adding that it was the BJP government which not only resolved the crisis but also abrogated Article 370 that entailed special status to Kashmir. “Every true Hindu struggled for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. No political party can say that it did not get a chance to resolve the temple issue. Those who got the chance ordered firing at Ram bhakts,” he said, referring to firing on kar sevaks in 1990 during the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. “The very existence of Ram and Krishna was challenged. But the BJP government organised ‘deepotsav’ in Ayodhya,” he said. Yogi also referred to Tulsidas, a Ramanandi Vaishnava Hindu saint and poet who wrote ‘Ramcharitmanas’, as the one who refused to accept Akbar as king and said ‘Raja Ram Chandra Ki Jai’. “As per ‘sanatan parampara’, Brahmins are the ones who stand for religion at the time of crisis,” said the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/equating-jinnah-patel-petty-politics-says-cm/articleshow/87705165.cms||---

The first accused, Ashwani Kumar, 42, was nabbed by the public on the spot. An illegal country-made pistol and four live cartridges were recovered from him. Police said Ashwani had brought the weapon from a town in Bihar after learning about it on YouTube.The second accused is Gaurav, 28, nephew of Ashwani. Both are residents of Jassiyan village.Division 8 police station SHO sub-inspector Ravinderpal Singh said, “Both are unemployed and drug addicts. At times, they would get labour jobs. They started executing crimes to meet their drug needs. Two years ago, the Jalandhar rural police had arrested them with counterfeit currency notes. They later came out of jail on bail.”The police have also recovered the motorcycle used in the crime from the possession of Gaurav. “The bike has a Sangrur number plate and it is suspected that it is stolen. We are verifying it with the Sangrur police. Their search on YouTube about illegal weapons led them to a town in Bihar. About a month ago, the two bought a country-made pistol for Rs 20,000 from there. The pistol was used in the loot attempt at the ATM kiosk,” the SHO added.On Saturday around 6.30pm, Ashwani and Gaurav had tried to rob Sandeep Kumar, who was withdrawing cash, in the ATM kiosk. As Sandeep resisted, Ashwani shot at him. Sandeep received a bullet injury in his thigh. When the accused tried to flee, onlookers nabbed Ashwani, but could not get hold of Gaurav. A panicked Ashwani fired another shot, but the bullet hit his own foot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/second-accused-also-arrested/articleshow/87703917.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Jaipur||RHB wins SKOCH award for ‘Revival and Strengthening’||Jaipur: The Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) has been conferred with the prestigious SKOCH ‘Gold’ Award for ‘Revival and Strengthening.’ The award selection was based on the study of housing department’s outcome in various states. RHB commissioner Pawan Arora, who received the award virtually said, “Along with housing projects, the RHB has also launched many infrastructure projects and established itself nationally in the past two years. Departments from all the state participated in the competition and ‘Gold’ category award was declared on the basis online voting.” Instituted in 2003, SKOCH award salutes people, projects and institutions that go the extra mile to make India a better nation. At the time of participation, the RHB had presented that within a record time, it has launched Shiksak Peheri Housing Scheme, Luxurious MLA Scheme, All India Services (IAS, IPS and IFS) Officers Scheme and other housing schemes in smaller cities. Similarly, it has developed infrastructure projects including country’s first coaching hub, state capital’s biggest park and food joints (Chaupati) in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota. Many claim that the achievement was remarkable as the then BJP government in 2016 had announced to dissolve the board. An office bearer in RHB Union alleged that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s intention was to give the RHB land on public-private partnership (PPP) model at cheaper rates to develop various projects and no projects were given to RHB. “After the Congress government came to power, efforts were being made to revive the RHB. After the government expressed faith in our team, we performed and yielded results. This is first time any department has won this prestigious award.” Established in 1970, the RHB aims at providing houses on no profit-no loss basis. “The RHB was established nearly 46 years ago to cater to the housing needs of the residents, in particular the lower middle class. Now, it is also developing high-end projects after earning its own revenue,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-wins-skoch-award-for-revival-and-strengthening/articleshow/87705168.cms||---

---||Jammu||How commandos, fate helped overcome a missed chance||Historically, Pakistani generals are obsessed with Chamb-Jaurian. They feel once the Akhnoor-Jammu road is cut off, Kashmir will stand isolated from the rest of India. In 1965, it remained a bridge too far, as General Yahya Khan was unable to organise the promised breakfast on the Akhnoor bridge. Pakistan army’s Operation Grand Slam was a failure. It is often said: once the war is over, there is no dearth of brave men. A brigadier from Pakistan had claimed while sipping his ale in a London pub that had he been given a free hand in 1965, he would have reached Akhnoor in 24 hours and then Jammu. This highlights the importance of Chamb to Pakistan. Operation Venus, planned by Pakistan in1971, was on similar lines. In1971, Lt Gen Sartaj Singh, general officer commanding (GOC) of 15 Corps, had planned a limited offensive into Pakistan from Chamb-Jaurian. The 10 Infantry Division with additional troops was to carry out the offensive. Alfa group of 9 Para Commando battalion, under Maj M M Ashok Cariappa, was allotted to10 Infantry Division. I was a lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the battalion, which was with the infantry division to coordinate offensive tasks. Missed chanceAround the middle of November 1971, there was a war game about the offensive plans and loose ends were being tied up for the offensive. Lt Gen Sartaj Singh had given his outline plan for the offensive when I got up and said: “While we are planning offensive into Pakistan, my commandos who are deployed all along the frontline looking for gaps in Pakistani defences to infiltrate during the war, tell me that Pakistan seems to be building up opposite us with tanks, artillery, and a lot of infantry movement has been seen.” Brigadier R K Jasbir Singh, commander of the 191 Infantry Brigade, got up and said: “I endorse Lt Col Sabharwal’s views.” General Sartaj roared: “It’s all rubbish. As D-Day is approaching, you chaps are getting ‘yellow’.” There was pin-drop silence. I got up and volunteered to lead a confirmatory patrol behind the enemy lines to see for myself and report and sought permission to do so. This was agreed to and permission was given by the commander. At 9 pm on November 20,1971, Capt Keshav Padha, Havildar Waryam Singh, Lance Naik Karam Singh, Paratrooper Pushpinder Singh (radio operator), and I were to cross into Pakistan and spend around eight hours behind enemy lines, to look for any signs of Pakistani buildup. Before we could go ahead, Lt Gen Sartaj Singh rang up: “You will not go across. I repeat, you will not go across.” This, I feel, was a big mistake. Vital bridgeOn December 3, 1971, Maj Gen Jaswant Singh and I were visiting headquarters of the 191 Infantry Brigade, the forward brigade, to tie up and meet with Brig R K Jasbir Singh to get the latest information. After the discussion, when we were about to leave, Brig Jasbir Singh offered us a drink. Just then, heavy shelling from Pakistan began. The war had started. General Jaswant and I headed back for our command posts. As we were crossing the Chamb bridge, we stopped. It was unmanned. Gen Jaswant Singh, seeing this, told me: “Sabu, you will defend this for me no matter at what cost; this bridge is going to be vital for this battle.” Having rehearsed day in and day out for offensive tasks behind enemy lines, here I was given a task in a purely infantry role. Nevertheless, we were determined to do our best. On December 4, 1971, around 3 pm, Capt Cariappa with his boys arrived at the bridge and started digging to defend the structure. Around 400 yards behind them were three tanks of Deccan Horse .800. Behind them, there were 6 guns of 39 Medium Regiment, commanded by Major Ranbir Singh. Azad Kashmir Brigade of Pakistan, having overrun some of the forward Indian positions, was in the area of the western bank of Tawi since December 4 or 5. Their task was to advance along Chamb, Jaurian and Akhnoor. When the advancing elements of the Pakistani brigade reached the western banks of the Munnawar Tawi, they were clueless of the fact that at that given time, there was nothing between them and Akhnoor bridge except the commandos, yet they failed to make it to Akhnoor bridge. At the same time, commandos were blissfully unaware of the fact that apart from them, there were no other fighting forces behind them on the road between the two bridges. Saviours of AkhnoorThe commandos, a troop of tanks, and a battery of gunners stood firm and became saviours of Akhnoor and Jammu by giving Lt Gen Sartaj Singh enough time to redeploy his forces. During December 4-5 night, the Pakistani brigade launched three fierce attacks on the bridge. Each attack was preceded by an intense earth-shattering artillery barrage that seemed to last for eternity. The first attack with the battle cry of ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ came around 2 am. It was on the commando team led by Capt Macarius. Initially, we lost some ground in this attack, but it was soon regained by a local counterattack led by Capt Macarius. The second attack came around 3 am, which came on the team commanded by Capt Amar Bisht. This too was repulsed, with heavy losses to Pakistanis. In both these attacks, medium machine gun (MMG) teams of Naik Ram Singh and Lance Naik Hoshiar Singh, and of Havildar Bahal Chand and Commando Ram Singh played a vital role. Between them, they fired 12,000 rounds and inflicted heavy losses on attacking Pakistanis. The third Pakistani attack came around 5 am. By this time, the enemy had been vanquished and chased across the western bank of Tawi. The commanding officer of 13 Azad Kashmir along with nine of his men had been taken prisoner. During the battle, we lost a few commandos, including Lance Naik Hoshiar Singh, Commando Ram Singh and Lance Naik Om Prakash. Ten commandos, including Capt M A Cariappa, were wounded. In this battle, fate intervened and there were two lucky breaks for India. One, out of the blue, commandos arrived to defend the Chamb bridge at the most crucial time. Two, the GOC of Pakistan’s 23 Infantry Division, Maj Gen Iftikhar Janjua, died in a helicopter crash on December 9. If Chamb and surrounding areas are still with India and Pakistanis could not reach Akhnoor, the credit for this must go to Alfa group of 9-Para Commando under Maj Cariappa, three tanks of Deccan Horse, and six guns of 216 Medium Regiment under the leadership of Major Ranbir Singh.

---||Lucknow||VIP to distribute 50kbusts of Phoolan Deviamong Nishad voters||Lucknow: After its plan to install 18ft statues of Phoolan Devi in 18 divisional headquarters in UP was stalled by the state government, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has decided to distribute over 50,000 busts of the bandit-turned-MP among voters ahead of 2022 assembly elections. The party is receiving online orders on its website for the busts. “We have received over 30,000 orders so far. The busts will be delivered to the people free of cost,” national spokesperson of the party, Dev Jyoti, said. The VIP has been invoking the legacy of the late Nishad leader to have a better run in the state.

The incident came to light on Sunday. The deceased have been identified as Akhilesh Kumar, 30, and Ritu, 28, both factory workers. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-East) Davinder Chaudhary said, “When all the calls of Ritu’s sister went unanswered, she went to the couple’s house and found them dead. Ritu, her sister and husband work in the same factory.” ACP added, “The couple had got married in June. It was the second marriage of both Akhilesh and Ritu. The probe suggests that Akhilesh was a hard drinker and Ritu would deter him from drinking. The neighbours told police that the couple used to fight almost every day. It is suspected that on Saturday, too, they fought and then took the extreme step. No suicide note was recovered from the spot.” The police are proceeding under Section 174 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/husband-wife-commit-suicide-in-meharban/articleshow/87703961.cms||---

So, it is necessary to take precautions even though the person is vaccinated with both the doses. A vaccinated person can also spread the virus. There is high possibility of the third wave to emerge, but it is expected that it will not be as dangerous as the second wave,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of advisory committee on Covid. The health department officials appealed to people to continue taking Covid appropriate behavior and avoid going in crowded places and maintain social distancing.

In comparison, in 12 months from April 2020 to March 2021, the agency had collected 261.38 crore.  From the time the pandemic began, Mhada’s total revenue collection has been over Rs 1,433 crore, a record for the housing agency. From April 2020 till August 2021 (the last month for which data is available), Mhada gave approvals or offer letters to 193 redevelopment projects. In comparison, the agency had approved only 162 projects in three years from 2017 to 2020 before the pandemic broke out.  Mhada officials said fast-tracking approvals and a 50% discount in premiums offered by the state government had helped builders and that was the reason behind the redevelopment push. Builders pay premiums to Mhada for getting additional construction space and concession in rules like having large amounts of open space and staircases.  Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said he was pushing to fast-track redevelopment of old and dilapidated Mhada-regulated buildings and the agency had been asked to issue offer letters in a time-bound manner. “We have cleared several projects that were stuck for decades. We have given offer letters and made way for the redevelopment of several projects like Patra Chawl, Chikhalwadi, Motilal Nagar and even BDD chawls. This has happened because of fast-tracking of processes. Those living in these old buildings will soon get new homes,” Awhad said.  There are 14,000-odd cessed buildings in the city. Many are in urgent need of redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-redevpt-boost-gives-mhada-record-payoff/articleshow/87705971.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The campaign involves door-do-door visits by health workers to trace beneficiaries who are yet to get vaccinated and convince them to take the jabs at the nearest vaccination centre. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, immunization officer for Aurangabad, said both male and female beneficiaries have been located during the door-do-door visits carried out by the health teams. “The efforts made by Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers during the campaign have started reflecting in terms of daily increased vaccination figures. The campaign also involves busting myths and false notions associated with the vaccination,” she said. The municipal limits of Aurangabad on Saturday recorded 11,081 vaccinations — a record daily figure since the vaccination programme against Covid-19 was launched by the government. Health authorities said vaccine hesitancy was observed in some of the minority dominated areas of Aurangabad. Notably, local unit of AIMIM led by city MP Imtiaz Jaleel had carried out mass awareness in many areas for getting vaccinated. The party had also put up hoardings in different areas displaying photos of some of its top leaders taking the jabs. Besides around 65 vaccination sites, the civic administration has also set up camps at tourist places and few other areas. Aurangabad has witnessed a total 10.16 lakh vaccinations so far, including 6.31 lakh beneficiaries who have received the first dose. Against the total target population of 10.5 lakh aged 18 and above, 3.86 lakh beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated, as per official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/health-workers-visit-33213-homes-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/87703385.cms||---

So, the news of the return of Lord Ram reached us late. Ever since, Diwali is celebrated on 'Ekadash', the 11th day. People prepare dal fritters and pooris. We make bunches from local wood like cheed, tie them together, light them and use them as a bonfire. The food is consumed around it and we dance around to folk songs which is the Bhailo dance tradition,” said Pradeep Kukreti, district president, Uttarakhand statehood agitators' forum. The group has been organising Igas celebrations at the Shaheed Smarak in Dehradun for several years now. Hundreds gathered at the ground on Sunday in festive wear. Celebrations were seen across multiple city localities like Nehru Colony, Lalpull, Patel Nagar, among others. Villages in the hill areas also marked the occasion by lighting diyas and preparing festive goodies. “It’s all about the community coming together for the celebrations. Food is prepared and consumed together, we have folk songs and dance. Bhailo is an integral part, sweets are exchanged. Every household will light lamps all through the night,” said Gita Bisra, a resident of Chamoli district’s Gairsain. Meanwhile, the festival of Igas Bagwal was celebrated with much fervour in the Queen of Hills Mussoorie on Sunday.  A cultural programme was organised where traditional folk songs and dances, cuisine and drums (dhol-damau) were played amid a large gathering.

In 2019, a 14-year-old girl was gang-raped by two men in the Navlakhi Compound that is isolated and dark and located right next to a busy Akota-Dandia Bazaar Road. After the accused were arrested, one of them revealed that his relative had looted a girl and her male friend in Navlakhi Compound in 2018 too. The boy had later filed a complaint of loot at Raopura police station. After the incident of gang-rape in 2019, demands were made to illuminate the isolated spots in the city and increase police patrolling in such areas. In March last year, a lok rakshak dal (LRD) cop posted at Laxmipura police station was arrested for raping a 21-year-old girl on the isolated Gotri-Ankodia Road. Accused Surajsinh Chauhan demanded bribe from a couple and then when the boy went to get cash from the ATM, he molested the girl and forced her to perform oral sex.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Those with divisive agenda support idea of Talibanisation, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Unleashing yet another a caustic attack on the opposition, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that people who have a “divisive agenda” indirectly support the idea of `Talibanisation”. “Jo log vibhajan ki baat karte hain wo apratyasksh roop se talibanikaran ka samarthan karte hain,” he said, while speaking at the Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by the BJP in Lucknow. The convention was called in support of OBC sub-castes like Maurya, Kushwaha, Shakya and Saini. The chief minister said that a host of voices from the opposition ranks came up in support of Taliban when it stormed back to power in Afghanistan. The CM’s apparent reference was towards SP’s Sambhal MP Shafiqur Rehman Barq who was slapped with sedition charges after he defended the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, while equating it with India's own freedom struggle. Taliban ka samarthan matlab manavta virodhi tatvon ko samarthan dena…,” he said, insisting that supporting the Taliban was like a conspiracy against Buddha’s message of peace and compassion. “Supporting Taliban was like dishonouring women and children also,” he stressed. Yogi’s statement correlating “division of society” with “Talibanisation” comes days after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav drew sharp criticism from the BJP ranks for comparing Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. Not surprisingly, Yogi once again slammed Akhilesh for “deriding” Patel by comparing him with Jinnah . “Patel rashtra ke nayak hain..aur Jinnah Bharat ke liye sadaiv khalnayak hi rahenge,” he said, reiterating that people supporting Jinnah were also supportive of Taliban. He asserted that the “peace-loving” people should never forget how the Taliban blew up 2,500-year-old statues of Buddha in Afghanistan almost 20 years ago. The statues were blown up and destroyed in March 2001 by the Taliban, on orders from its leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Yogi categorically cited that national emblem was an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka comprising four lions, standing back to back and mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the Capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-with-divisive-agenda-support-talibanisation-yogi/articleshow/87705190.cms||Pankaj Shah

The department of science and technology is making efforts to set up first-of-itskind National Science and Technology Research University (NSTRU), and scientific institutes like BSIP will be its constituent. The department will set up the university by leveraging the research strength of autonomous research and development institutions working in the field of science and technology. Speaking during the founders’ day celebration on Sunday, BSIP director Prof Vandana Prasad said, “BSIP will also come under the umbrella of NSTRU. Like universities, the institute will also offer postgraduate course in science. The move will further strengthen the research output of the institute.” Prof Vandana said the idea behind bringing institutes under NSTRU is to make a mark in global scientific research rankings in which the research strength of all Indian scientific institutions is presented as one and not as individual units. BSIP also released a 20-minute documentary that covered the glorious 75-year journey of the institute, an annual report and a walk-through video of the new building of the institute. Chief guest on the occasion, secretary, SERBDST, Sandeep Verma, spoke about the government’s Science, Technology and Innovation Policy-2020 (STIP-2020). “STIP-2020 will make India technologically self-reliant and catapult India to the league of top three scientific superpowers. It will attract, nurture, strengthen and retain human capital through people-centric science and technology and will build individual and institutional excellence,” said Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsip-to-be-part-of-natl-scienceresearch-univ-offer-pg-course/articleshow/87705187.cms||Mohita Tewari

The party said this will prove to what extent stubble burning is responsible for air pollution in the national capital and what is Delhi’s ‘hand in pollution’. Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other BJP leaders participated in a dharna outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Sunday and blamed the Delhi government for failing to control air pollution. Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said that the Kejriwal government has taken concrete steps in its fight against air pollution. He said that orders have been issued for shutting of institutions and polluting activities, and these tough decisions were taken in the emergency meeting on pollution chaired by the CM. Bidhuri said that if there is pollution in Delhi due to stubble, then states like Punjab and Haryana should have more pollution than Delhi because the stubble is burning there. He claimed that pollution on Sunday in various cities of Punjab is much less as compared with Delhi.

Railways’ passenger reservation system (PRS), however, will be shut for six hours during lean business hours of the night for the next 7 days, said Central Railway chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. “This is to enable upgradation of system data and updating of new train numbers. Since huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all Mail/Express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours,” added Sutar The timings of system shut down will be from 11.30pm to 5.30am in order to minimise impact on ticketing services. Both Western and Central Railway will revert back to the original train numbers of pre-Covid times. During Covid, they ran special trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rlys-reservation-system-to-stay-down-for-six-hours-this-week/articleshow/87705737.cms||Somit Sen

NMC’s education officer Sunita Dhangar said on Monday, students of Class VIII and above will attend schools, but Classes IX to XII in schools under the education department of the zilla parishad will reopen from November 22 as per the state’s directives. “We have instructed all school principals to ensure students and staff continue to wear masks, maintain social distance and sanitise their hands,” Dhangar said. The civic health department will conduct surprise checks in both NMC and private schools to ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is being followed. “Almost all teaching and non-teaching staff have been vaccinated fully or partially. There are only a few teachers with comorbidities who are not vaccinated,” she said. Dhangar said there are still no clear guidelines from the government for starting physical classes for students of Classes I to VII. Himgauri Aher, the chairperson of the association of private English-medium schools in Nashik, said 35 private English-medium schools will reopen from Monday for students of Clases VIII to XII. “All these schools will ensure appropriate Covid behaviour,” she said. “Schools are keen to start classes from V to VII and the association is in the process of seeking guidelines from the state government on the issue,” she added.

---||Ahmedabad||Prime suspect in Anand Niketan case shifts to Dubai||AHMEDABAD: It has been over a year since students of Anand Niketan School in Satellite and their parents have suffered the nightmare of being targeted by threatening emails and morphed photographs of female classmates. While cops zeroed in on the prime suspect, a 17-year-old student, it is reliably learnt that his family has now moved to Dubai. Top sources in the state police said that after the grilling, where the teen even confessed to his crime, the juvenile shifted to Dubai where he is studying and spending time helping his billionaire father’s business. “After we zeroed in on the boy, a Satellite resident whose father owns event management, crypto-currency and digital wallet businesses, the family moved him from Ahmedabad to Dubai in May. He was first sent to Singapore from where he went to Dubai,” said a city police officer. He added, “The boy’s father confirmed this to police recently, saying his entire family has moved to Dubai. “His father, who keeps making trips to Ahmedabad, also met senior police officers on November 5 and informed them that he will soon sell off his property in the city and settle abroad.” The saga began on September 9, 2020, when the school received the first email, threatening it to cancel the mid-term exams if they did not want nude photographs of female students circulated. The school management cancelled exams for Classes 8 to 12 which had been scheduled for mid-September 2020. They then approached cybercrime police, seeking an inquiry into the issue, which was converted into an FIR on October 3, 2020. On December 6, 2020, the perpetrator sent another email, demanding the cancellation of preliminary exams for Classes 10, 11, and 12. The email was sent at a time when the cybercrime police was struggling to trace the person behind the emails. The perpetrator had used the dark web to commit the crime and the case was one of the most complicated cybercrime cases Ahmedabad police faced till date. Investigators even roped in central and American investigative agencies. On March 31 this year, the perpetrator used a virtual cellphone number to join a school meeting on Zoom and posted links to nude photographs of female students. This move revealed his hand. The cops realized that his real motive was to malign the two girls as one of them had rejected his advances and he blamed the other for influencing her. The cops also found a lead in the web searches on one of the devices they had collected from 120 students. “We used human intelligence to track him as he had been using the dark web, leaving no evidence of the crime,” said a police officer. The cops cannot stop them from shifting as they still do not have solid evidence of the boy’s involvement and no offence has been registered against him so far. Meanwhile, someone hacked into the school’s WhatsApp group in August and posted an indecent image of a student, demanding that the school cancel the Class 12 first term exams. “We found that the first suspect had not sent the message this time. We now have strong suspicions that another student learned the modus operandi of using the dark web and committed this offence,” said a police officer. Cops believe the second juvenile was guided by the prime suspect, who is now in Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prime-suspect-in-anand-niketan-case-shifts-to-dubai/articleshow/87704001.cms||---

It was inaugurated by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Sunday at the confluence of rivers Gori and Kali in the Jauljibi town of Pithoragarh district. The town is both religiously and historically significant and is located along the Nepal border, which is 64 kilometers away from the Pithoragarh town. It was earlier considered to be the centre of the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage route and has a rich trading history. It was also a point of exchange for Tibetan, Nepalese, and North Indian traders. Although the fair is known to be centuries old, it officially began in 1911 and was organised by the zamindar of Askot. After the Askot principality became a part of the Indian state in 1948, the fair was stopped for a while. However, it was resumed by the Uttar Pradesh government later on. The fair is especially famous for raw wool and warm clothes. The fair will commence on 14 November and culminate on 24 November, said A K Shukla, the sub-divisional magistrate of Pithoragarh. This year, more than 300 shops have been allotted space, he added. Citizens of Nepal are also coming to visit the event. During the inauguration, Dhami said that the fair is part of the state's cultural heritage and also a symbol of friendship between India and Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jauljibi-trade-fair-inaugurated-by-cm-dhami/articleshow/87703997.cms||Prem Punetha

The duo of Dinesh Chandra and Amit Kumar were in remote sync with their solvers stationed outside and were clandestinely wrapping up the answers, when a sudden checking drive busted their crime at the Jankipuram centre. The examination was held by Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board (UPRPB) on Saturday. Dinesh, Amit and their aides Saurabh Tiwari and Rahul Rathi were formally arrested on Sunday. Police said, Amit was using a ‘Bluetooth’ device to connect with his solver, who is on the run after he was tipped off about the arrest in the examination hall. “We are trying to find his other associate,” said SHO, Jankipuram, Kuldeep Gaur, who said, Dinesh was caught the other examination hall. “The invigilator seized a miniature mobile phone, which escaped frisking before the examination began,” said the SHO. Later, a police team scanned his phone and found he was in touch via WhatsApp with two solvers, Saurabh and Rahul, who were surfing the Net and passing on the answers. A police team was alerted and the duo was also arrested. Police said, Dinesh was a jawan with the Central armed forces. “The four arrested do not have a criminal history, barring this case,” said Gaur.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Pollution a double whammy for firemen||NEW DELHI: For firefighters, the rising pollution has become an additional burden over and above their occupational hazard. Apart from dealing with hazardous gases while dealing with fires, they have to breathe in toxic air in the open. According to Delhi Fire Service (DFS), firefighters work in the most hostile environment filled with smoke, elevated temperatures, oxygen deficiency and poisonous gases. “This is a matter of deep concern and it causes firefighters health issues. However, the department is not capable of handling the pollution crisis,” said Atul Garg, DFS director. Somvir Singh (48), DFS assistant divisional officer, said their lungs were already compromised due to being regularly involved in firefighting operations. “From day one, we work in an environment filled with smoke and toxic gases, so our lungs are already weak. Pollution affects us like any other person. During fire incidents, a breathing apparatus saves us from smoke for 20-30 minutes. But we don’t have anything to protect ourselves from outdoor pollution,” he added. Amit Rana, a 35-year-old fire operator, said after completing a rescue operation when he spits, his mucus is black due to the toxic smoke. Smoke and pollution will have a severe effect on my body in the future. I have seen the effect on my older colleagues,” he added. The firefighters said they get training on how to release smoke from the body. “There are chances that we may inhale toxic fumes, so we have been trained to release it, but it affects our lungs,” said a firefighter. “We don’t get any special diet to save us from pollution. It all depends on what we can do to keep fit. We eat homemade food,” said another firefighter. Station officer Nitin bought an air purifier for his house after his father’s health started to deteriorate. “My father was a DFS staffer. He also smoked cigarettes. Now, he is being treated for a lung disease. An air purifier is just a temporary way to get fresh air. Smoking toxic gases will affect me when I grow old,” he said. A few years ago, while Nitin was dousing a fire in Malviya Nagar, he inhaled toxic gases and had to be admitted to a hospital due to high blood pressure. At the time of rescue operations, firefighters have to search for a place to get fresh air. “When we enter a structure engulfed in fire, we first search for a place from where we can get fresh air, like a window or an exhaust. We stay there and conduct further rescue operations. However, if the fresh air coming from the window or exhaust is hazardous, then it becomes a cause for concern,” said a fireman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pollution-a-double-whammy-for-firemen/articleshow/87704666.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Huge sim card racket busted in Sabarkantha||AHMEDABAD: If you are not using your simcard or your bank account has been dormant, be warned as cyber crooks may have started using your phone number of bank account for illegal activities such as cheating or digital fraud. City crime branch recently nabbed a 22-year-old man named Vijaysinh Jhala of Aniyol village of Talod taluka of Sabarkantha for allegedly selling simcards illegally. During his questioning, it was revealed that bank accounts, digital wallets, OTT app access credentials were also being sold illegally. These activities are flourishing in rural areas of north Gujarat— mainly Sabarkantha, Aravalli and Banaskantha districts — where gangs steal data from telecom companies or banks using the dark web and use it for illegal activities, said a police officer. Jhala was nabbed on October 9 after police learned that he was about to deliver a couple of simcards to certain person. When the cops caught him and investigated further, they found that the gang for which Jhala worked as a delivery man had around 20,000 simcards. “Such gangs work in layers so they can evade the cops. The kingpin will operate various Telegrams groups using which he offers to sell simcards, bank accounts or digital wallets. If a person shows interest, another set of people will check his credentials and if the person passes their background checks, they will send someone to deliver the simcards,” said a police officer. In the case of digital wallets and bank account, the end user or the customer who buys them illegally will be given the user ID or passwords by gang members in such a way that the end user will not even know their name or identity. Not just the end user or customer, the people working in the second or third layer will also not know who the kingpin is, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/simcards-digital-wallets-bank-accounts-on-sale-illegally/articleshow/87704044.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Just 3,982 such people have been completely vaccinated in the state till November 10. Only 20,042 bedridden and immobile citizens have received the first dose so far in Maharashtra.  The updated data of the public health department till November 10 revealed that nearly 10 districts had registered “no vaccination” under this category. The vaccination of bedridden and immobile people in another 10 districts was in double digits. An official from thestate’s public health department said, “We are aware that the numbers are low, and we plan to scale it up this month through the door-to-door campaign, as we have exact data of such people.”  According to data provided by the public health department, just 10,715 bedridden and immobile people had received the first dose and 464 had received the second dose in the rural areas in the state. In the municipal corporation areas, a total of 9,327 such people had received the first dose and 3,518 had got their second dose. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation topped the list with 4,215 people having received the first dose and 3,057 getting the second shot. The central government in September had announced “vaccination at home” for the disabled, in line with Covid-19 SOPs. This came a month after the Maharashtra government launched its pilot project for door-to-door vaccination for bedridden and immobile people in Mumbai. Activists have claimed that the demand for home vaccination was not catered to despite the central government’s announcement. The state government and the Mumbai civic body had told the Bombay high court that they would start door-to-door vaccination for bedridden and immobile people in the state capital as a pilot project from August 1. The court had then received nearly 3,505 responses in Mumbai from bedridden or immobile people. Completely bedridden, immobile or people suffering from some terminal illness were supposed to be eligible for home vaccination. A senior citizen whose wife is bedridden said he did not get the desired response from the immunization officials despite repeatedly sending mails and even calling them up. He said the officials claimed that they were busy at the vaccination sites. “We are hoping that the government’s new phase of door-to-door vaccination to check on unvaccinated people would help cover this population,” said the senior citizen, hoping for some positive impact of the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/immunisation-of-bedridden-immobile-people-dismal-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87704683.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Led by city BJP chief Pravin Datke and general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule, the rally started from Yashwant Stadium and moved to Samvidhan Square before culminating at the collector’s office where the BJP netas handed over a representation to collector Vimala R. On Friday, the BJP unit had staged demonstrations against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government for failure to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on the fuel prices, at Variety Square. According to BJP netas, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government had provided free ration to crores of people throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the ration card by the state government was not of much use and has become a mere identity card as no help was received by people. Warning the MVA government of intensifying their agitation during the forthcoming assembly session, the BJP unit demanded distribution of free ration to about 10 lakh poor people who are struggling after losing their sources of their income during the pandemic. Flaying the three-party coalition for steep hike in Gunthewari charges from Rs 56/sq ft to Rs 168, the BJP unit termed it as “anti-people’s move” and demanded that October 18 government resolution (GR) in this regard be withdrawn. According to BJP netas, about five lakh residents living on the Gunthewari land would be affected by this “draconian decision which was taken without discussing with the public representatives”. Raising the issue of no rebate in power bills during the Covid-19 pandemic “as promised by state energy minister Nitin Raut”, the BJP office-bearers accused the government of being allegedly involved in large-scale corruption. Several prominent BJP netas participated in Monday’s protests, including MLAs Krishna Khopde, Vikas Kumbhare and Mohan Mate, MLC Girish Vyas, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, former MLC Anil Sole, former MLA Milind Mane, spokesperson Archana Dehankar, state vice-president Sanjay Bhende, Deven Dasture and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-city-unit-protests-against-state-govt-demands-free-ration-to-10l-poor-people/articleshow/87723182.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Youth activists ran a signature campaign through the month of October and galvanised support of over 670 citizens. In addition to scrapping the cycle track, the letter states clear-cut points of contentions and suggestions to better the cycle track project,” said Nishant Bangera of Muse Foundation. “The periphery of the Powai Lake, Vihar Lake and SGNP are all contiguous to each other and hence form a very important wildlife habitat,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cmo-cold-to-letter-by-670-against-powai-cycle-track/articleshow/87705756.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The cops found the bodies on Saturday evening. The cops said that the couple, Rakesh Datania and Gungun Datania, were residents of Shahpur and had committed suicide. The couple were in despair because they feared that their families would not allow them to live together, the cops said. On the other hand, their families say that they were willing to get them married and had begun talking about their wedding after they went missing on November 10. A police officer said, “Rakesh and Gungun were in a relationship for about a year but their families were unaware of that.” The officer added: “When they did reveal their relationship to their families, they encountered some resistance. The families apparently sought time to think about it.” But the couple did not accept their families’ approach and decided to flee from their homes. “They might have feared that their family members would punish them and they would be defamed in society,” said the officer. “So they jumped into the river and committed suicide.” Preliminary investigation suggests that the couple may have died about three days before their bodies were discovered. “They left their house on November 10 and on the same day they may have committed suicide by jumping into the river,” said the officer. He said that their family members tried to contact them, but their cellphones had been switched off. “Their family members told us that they were planning to arrange their marriage soon and were trying to find them,” said the cop. Police have registered a case of accidental death and have begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wedding-in-air-couple-die-in-water-not-believing-kin/articleshow/87704049.cms||---

He also exhorted the party to create more active members in each constituency. The senior Congressman said that Goa’s unique identity and culture is under threat from BJP’s misguided notion of one nation, one religion, one language and one food habit. “Goa has a problem of jobs. Unemployment affects every family,” Chidambaram said. “Congress knows how to create jobs. Our manifesto will detail Congress’ job creation plan. We will stop the current tendency of 40,000 to 50,000 talent migrating out of the state.” He also said that Goa’s law and order situation has broken down over the last three or four years and women are afraid of stepping out of their homes in the evening. “We will ensure that women’s safety and security achieves top priority.” Acknowledging the concerns about coal transportation and cutting of trees in the Mollem Wildlife Sanctuary, Chidambaram said that if Congress forms the next government, it will review the linear projects and if necessary scrapthem. Addressing party workers in Ponda, Bicholim and Panaji, he also attempted to address the concerns about BJP MLAs being inducted into the party ahead of the elections. “We are putting the responsibility on to you, the block workers, to select the candidate. You may suggest one, two or three names and AICC will select one. Once the candidate is selected, all of you must work solidly for the candidate,” Chidambaram said. He said that each block must chose candidates based on loyalty, integrity, acceptability to the workers and winability. Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Rao accused BJP of rewriting history to demolish the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Rao said that Goans should not forget Nehru’s contributions to Goa right from Liberation. Meanwhile, social activist from Pernem, advocate Jitendra Gaonkar joined Congress on Sunday. Gaonkar was a Goa Forward Party member and was projected as its candidate for the Pernem seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-manifesto-will-focus-on-jobs-womens-safety/articleshow/87705229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The designated staff said that judicious use of the vaccine by them has resulted in rare wastage and boosted vaccinations. JS Ghodake, vaccination in-charge at the hospital, told TOI, “We have recorded wastage of around 145 doses at our site. Most of it occurred in the first two months, when Covaxin was available only in the 20-dose vial. Now, this the vial is available in 20-dose, 10-dose, and 5-dose options.” She added that this option of multiple sizes of the Covaxin vial also helped supply maximum doses to the eligible population. “Since the District Hospital Aundh also offers different specialities, patients for other ailments are often accompanied by their relatives or family members. We made sure that whenever excess doses were available, such patients’ kin got vaccinated with proper counselling and awareness. In some cases, we asked our staff members’ friends and families to get vaccinated to avoid any wastage,” said the official, adding that in the early part of the vaccination drive, the centre was always crowded with eligible beneficiaries, especially the 45-plus population. Ghodake explained that they usually use a 10-dose vial at the beginning of the day’s vaccination, when there is a slight rush of beneficiaries; conversely, for the last session of the day, a 5-dose vial is used to reduce chances of wastage. Meanwhile, on Sunday, a total of 10,261 beneficiaries got vaccinated across 231 government and private vaccination sites across Pune district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dists-dedicated-covaxin-site-administers-over-73000-shots/articleshow/87704688.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SoBo firm’s ex-staffer nabbed for ‘data theft’ to divert orders to rival||Mumbai: On March 3 last year, Lamington Road-based electronics businessman Rushab Shah was taken aback when a trusted employee of 11 years, in charge of sales and business development, decided to quit. A few weeks later, the mystery behind the hasty resignation began to “unravel”. Shah alleged that hundreds of crores worth of orders for electronic components for which his company, Madhu Subtronics Components, was in an advanced stage of negotiations had been surreptitiously diverted to another. “I was completely crushed to discover that the company which was getting the purchase orders belonged to a relative of my employee who had quit in haste,” Shah said. Late last month, Mumbai south region cyber police arrested the former employee, Pratik Lakhani (34), and his relative, Kumar Pal Shah, under the IPC for allegedly stealing data and cheating and under the Information Technology Act. Both are out on bail. According to the FIR, Lakhani stole data from his employer’s company and facilitated his relative’s firm to get a Rs 256 crore order for dust sensors. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, who appeared for Lakhani for his bail before the Girgaum metropolitan magistrate argued, “The alleged amount of loss of Rs 256 crore is completely imaginary. The actual work order was only for Rs 2.05 lakh, not even Rs 2 crore.” He also contended that as far as the IPC offence of breach of trust is concerned, the money allegedly went to a company where no one was arrested. Ponda further argued it was a fit case for release. He submitted that according to a Bombay high court judgement, police cannot investigate offences under the IPC in a cyber crime case where the offences are bailable. In the FIR, the complainant, Madhu Subtronics Components, said it suspected someone was leaking internal information and confidential mails to rival companies . It called for an internal investigation and allegedly realised its own employee was leaking the information. The company approached the cyber police, who registered an offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust. Lakhani’s alleged role was exposed after the police arrested Shah in August.“During investigation, it transpired that since several years, Lakhani had allegedly accessed the emails, deals and other private business details and passed it on to his relative’s company,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobo-firms-ex-staffer-nabbed-for-data-theft-to-divert-orders-to-rival/articleshow/87705761.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Second vaccine shots 5-fold of first doses||AHMEDABAD: With the rise in Covid cases, the focus is sharply back on the vaccination for the pandemic – out of total eligible population of 4.93 crore in Gujarat, 91 per cent (4.5 crore) have received at least one dose, whereas 59 per cent (2.92 crore) have got both the doses. However, analysis of the vaccination figures reveal a gap between cities and districts – out of eight municipal corporation areas, six have achieved 100 per cent coverage of first dose, whereas among 33 districts, only four have achieved the feat. Moreover, only five districts or cities have recorded over 70 per cent coverage of second dose. Senior state health department officials said that the compliance of the second dose was higher than that for the first. In the past 30 days, the coverage of first dose increased from 89 per cent to 91 per cent, a rise of 2 per cent, whereas in the same period, the second dose coverage increased from 46 per cent to 59 per cent, a rise of 13 per cent. Analysis of the statistics available on CoWIN portal reveals that in the past one month, Gujarat administered 13 lakh first doses of vaccine against 69 lakh second doses – indicating five times more vaccination for the second dose. The latest notification by the state health department instructed all the municipal commissioners and collectors to carry out micro-planning to ensure the maximum coverage of Covid vaccination. The health department has also roped in private practitioners to dispel myths around the vaccination effects. Among the least covered districts, Botad has only 68 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated for first dose, and Amreli and Patan with 73 per cent against state average of 91 per cent. Among the districts with least coverage of second dose, Dang have 33 per cent coverage, followed by 40 per cent in Gir Somnath and 42 per cent in Morbi against state average of 59 per cent. “The carrot and stick approach may be adopted with restrictions on availing the government-run facilities as initiated by some cities and districts, or preference to the vaccinated for some initiatives. However, we request the citizens to ensure that they take vaccination at designated time even as door-to-door campaign would be initiated in the worst-affected districts,” said a senior health department official, adding that there is no shortage of vaccines in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2nd-vax-shots-5-fold-of-first-doses/articleshow/87704084.cms||Parth Shastri

It was recorded at 20.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday by the IMD’s Shivajinagar observatory and 21.6 degrees Celsius by the Lohegaon observatory. Met officials said they expect light rain with cloudy conditions in the city over the next four days. “The moisture incursion is taking place over the state due to presence of low-pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu as well as the presence of trough line from Tamil Nadu to the north coastal area of Odisha. There is another low-pressure area present over the South Andaman sea. Because of these conditions, several areas of the state, including Pune, are expected to receive light to very light rainfall for the next few days,” said a senior met official from the IMD. From Monday onwards, the city will experience cloudy conditions in the afternoon. It will also receive spells of light rainfall (2.5mm to 15.4mm) for the next few days, said the met official. “At isolated places, there is a chance of moderate rainfall in the district. At the same time, the chill factor that the city had experienced in the last few days due to northerly wind will go away completely. The city’s night temperature is likely to increase and it will go above normal by two to three degrees Celsius till November 20,” the official added. On Sunday, the weather conditions had changed completely. It was cloudy in the afternoon hours.

---||Delhi||20 years on, Kishanganj underpass now has yet another deadline - January 31||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has fixed a new deadline for the Kishanganj underpass — January 31. The project was conceived over 20 years ago by the unified MCD while work at the site started in 2008-09. So far, only one of the four underpass sections has been completed and opened for traffic. A senior north corporation official informed that Northern Railway has completed work on the three concrete box sections under the railway line and now the civic agency has to complete the pending work. “This included constructing six 150m long approach roads — three on each end of the underpass boxes, construction of retaining wall and two sump wells at the end to ensure no waterlogging happens below the underpass,” said the official. On October 26, local councillor and former mayor Jai Prakash inaugurated the road construction work at the site. “The corporation is presently removing the debris and simultaneously started work on levelling the connecting roads with machines,” said Jai Prakash. The underpass would link central Delhi with west Delhi and benefit the areas of Inderlok, Gulabi Bagh, Sarai Rohilla, Kishanganj, Padam Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Tri Nagar, Shanti Nagar and Rampura and nearby areas. The project is also expected to decongest Sadar Bazar, Rohtak Road, areas under Walled City extension and Azad Market, the official said. The project has cost Rs 48 crore to the civic agency and of that, 80% was funded from the Centre’s Urban Development Fund Scheme (UDF). “Of the total amount, we have already paid Rs 31 crore to the railway and now that the remaining fund was sanctioned from the UDF, we immediately issued the work order for the project of constructing approach roads. We are going to complete the site fully by January 31. Before that, by the end of December, we will open two more boxes for the general public. After that, a total of three boxes will be allowed for traffic movement,” said the official. North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said that some horticulture work will also be done at the site to ensure the area looks green and beautiful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-years-on-kishanganj-underpass-now-has-yet-another-deadline-jan-31/articleshow/87704689.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Traffic cops swamped with 8,200 wrong challan plaints||PUNE: Last week, the Khadak police registered a cheating case against a scooter rider, who had tampered with his two-wheeler’s registration number plate to evade action for any traffic rule violation that is caught on the CCTV cameras on the streets. Altering the registration numbers (by adding or deleting a number) is one of the key reasons behind the wrongful issuance of challans and is causing inconvenience to other motorists and the police alike. From January 1 to October 31, the city traffic police issued 17.78 lakh challans to vehicle owners captured in the CCTVs while violating traffic norms. During the same period, the traffic police received 8,200 complaints from vehicle owners about having been wrongly challaned. The traffic police use 1,200 CCTV cameras installed on various roads and junctions to catch traffic-rule offenders. These cameras provide a live feed to the traffic police and a team of traffic police keeps an eye on the screens. As soon as anyone breaks any traffic rules, the traffic police take a screenshot. The image is studied and the registration number of the vehicle is taken down. The system is connected to online software. The image and other details of the area where the traffic offence has taken place and time is filled in the online form. The system then generates an online challan. If a mobile number is linked with the registration number of the vehicle, challan link is messaged to the vehicle owner and if the phone is not linked, the fine is collected if traffic police spot the vehicle on roads and examine the registration number using the software on a hand-held portable device. “To escape action, many motorists alter the registration number of their vehicles by using different tricks. Apart from such tampering, that number plates that are damaged/worn out over the years, use of fancy number plates, typographical errors and other reasons are also behind the issuance of wrong challans,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said. A person who received a traffic challan said the offence showed that he was being fined for not wearing a helmet whereas the photograph sent shows him wearing one but parked on the zebra crossing. Others too complained that the offence did not match the photographic evidence presented to them .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-cops-swamped-with-8200-wrong-challan-plaints/articleshow/87705243.cms||Gitesh Shelke

So far, 31.56 lakh beneficiaries have received their first dose, the ZP report said. Senior ZP health department officials held a meeting on Saturday to discuss the matter and decided to intensify the vaccination drive across 13 talukas and 14 municipal councils. “We have prepared a list of the non-vaccinated people with the help of the grampanchayat. Our health staff will go to their homes, bring them to the closest vaccination centre to ensure everyone in the district is vaccinated,” said Dr Abhay Tidke, officiating district immunisation officer. The ZP officials said they have micro-planned the vaccination drive. “Some villages have already shared a list of those who have not yet been vaccinated. We will vaccinate them on priority,” Tidke said. So far, 275 villages of a total of 1,835 villages in the district have achieved 100% vaccination coverage. “Many villages have achieved over 80 -90 % vaccination in the district,” Tidke said. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the ZP, said the district has a floating or migratory population of about seven lakh and most of these people left during the lockdown. “We could not trace them when we tried to track them for the vaccination drive. As a result, the number of non-vaccinated people over 4.94 lakh,” Prasad added. He also said that some villagers, particularly in tribal parts of some talukas, are reluctant to get vaccinated due to lack of awareness. “We have roped in local leaders and people to create awareness among them and hope to complete vaccination in these villages in the coming days,” he added. The zilla parishad has over 275 vaccination centres across the district. It has also launched a special vaccination drive for the bedridden, pregnant, and disabled people to expedite the drive, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-5-lakh-yet-to-get-first-shot-of-vaccine-in-rural-pune/articleshow/87704695.cms||Sandip Dighe

This is apparent with the figures of mask violation cases shooting from 65 offences on the New Year Day on November 5, to 345 on Sunday which is more than five times high. There was also a surge of Covid cases in the city from 20 cases on November 5 to 37 on Saturday. “On New Year Day, we spread awareness about wearing of mask and did not go strict so only 65 cases were registered. On the day of Bhai Beej, we also showed a bit lenient approach and fined only 81 persons, who were caught roaming without mask,” said a police officer. The officer said that the cops intensified their drive from November 7 after which the mask cases were registered in three digits. The figures of mask offences show that there is tendency amongst cops not to book people during the time of festivals and also ahead of polls. According to the figures of the city police, they had on February 21 booked only four people when the civic body polls were held. This is the lowest figure so far since the mask offences were introduced from June 24, 2020. After that, the city reported a surge in the Covid cases and deaths in March and April. Apart from the polls, the mask offences declined during the Rath Yatra festival also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diwali-over-cops-get-tough-on-mask-violation-cases/articleshow/87704112.cms||---
---||Delhi||Use public transport, walk or cycle at least one day each month: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: With the capital battling severe air pollution, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that every Delhiite should use public transport, walk or cycle at least one day every month. The Delhi government's Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) organised a one-day “Neighbourhood Raahgiri” programme on the theme “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virrudh” to spread awareness about pollution, in association with Raahgiri Found.ation, at the Patparganj assembly constituency. The event took place on a stretch of road that was opened to the public with no vehicular traffic. “We can lay the foundation of a healthy Delhi by reducing our share of pollution by taking small steps like turning off the engine at traffic signals and switching to public transport,” Sisodia said during the event, while stressing on the need to work at three levels. “First, it is the responsibility of the government to make rules and regulations for the prevention of pollution, make strict systems to facilitate enforcement, conduct awareness campaigns and take action against those who violate them. The Delhi government is working on these key areas,” he said, adding that the government has prepared a bio-decomposer in collaboration with the PUSA Institute and sprayed it for free in the agricultural fields. He said this has ensured that stubble is not burnt in Delhi and is, instead, used as manure. He said that industry should move towards the latest sources of renewable energy to reduce its share of pollution and construction stakeholders should pitch in through measures like installing smog guns at major construction sites and sprinkling water continuously. “Third, I appeal to the people that the citizens of Delhi need to come together to fight this ‘Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virrudh’. It is our collective duty to come forward and reduce pollution at an individual and community level,” he said. “The purpose of organising programmes like Rahagiri is to make common people aware of such issues. The aim of these events is to give people a chance to experience a road without cars and bring about a change in behaviour,” DDV vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said, adding that this gives people an opportunity to reimagine their streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-public-transport-walk-or-cycle-at-least-one-day-each-month-sisodia/articleshow/87704700.cms||---

Nitin Barai (59) filed the complaint on Saturday, almost seven years after the deal was signed, after realising that the party with whom he had signed the agreement had duped him and failed to return the money he had invested to get the franchise. Barai’s son, Yash (25), alleged they were threatened when they demanded their money back. The police said the contract agreement was signed in 2014. The police registered the FIR against director of SFL Fitness Kashiff Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Raj Kundra, Darshit Shah and a few others who were witnesses in the contract signed in 2014. A case under the IIPC sections 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) was registered. Shilpa Shetty tweeted: “Woke up to an FIR registered in Raj and my Name! To set the record straight. SFL Fitness. A venture run by Kashiff Khan. He had taken naming rights of brand SFL to open SFL Fitness Gyms around the country. All deals were struck by him and he was a signatory in banking and day to day affairs. We are not aware of any of his transactions nor have we received a single rupee from him for the same. All franchisee’s dealt directly with Kashiff.

---||Pune||Hotels, wedding venues booked for next 3 months in Pune||PUNE: Hotels, banquets and marriage halls in the city are fully booked for the next three months as those who had postponed their weddings last year owing to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are holding their nuptial celebrations this year. Amit Badula, director of events, Conrad Pune, said, “In 220, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many restrictions had been imposed by the government and a lot of guests did not want to go ahead with celebrations in such conditions. But now all these guests have booked the property for their events in the second half of 2021. Hence, there is surplus demand in the wedding segment for hospitality industry.” Gauri Kanitkar, CEO, Anuroop Wiwaha Sanstha, is looking forward to recovering the financial losses of 2020 from this year’s wedding season. “The mood for celebration is back among clients, who are ready to go all out for weddings like they used to before the pandemic. Though they are spending less on catering as guest lists have to be restricted to 50% of capacity of the wedding venue, they spend more on decoration, entertainment,” she said. Rounak Sethi, founder, wedding event management company, said, “Business recovery is at 70-80 per cent as of now. Until the pandemic is completely over, and there are no restrictions on the number of guests allowed, there will not be 100 per cent recovery of business.” Rashmi Shah, co-founder of a catering business, said, “With fewer number of guests allowed, the total income from a wedding event is less by 50 per cent. But clients are willing to have elaborate spreads, and don’t mind the increase in rates per plate/person. Last year, though weddings were organised with 20-50 guests, clients preferred per-plate buffets and did not opt for stalls and live stations for chaat, pasta, and so on. This year there has been a rise in clients requesting for such stalls and live stations, while ensuring that we take all safety precautions “ Mudassir Shaikh, who runs a sound system rental, said that business has not picked up much for him. “Even with the relaxations in restrictions, people don’t want to attract too much attention to their celebrations. We hardly have bookings now but hope for business to pick up in December.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotels-wedding-venues-booked-for-next-3-months/articleshow/87705266.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

This will ensure proper spacing of flights. Also, the number of late night and red eye flights have always been more in Pune compared to daytime movements. With the airport operational round-the-clock, there will be more new flights starting, too,” Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke told TOI. He added, “We are hopeful that passenger traffic will reach pre-pandemic levels by next month and attempts are being made to ensure this.” At present, the airport has been witnessing daily average passenger traffic of 17,000-19,000 passengers per day as well. During pre-pandemic times, his same figure stood at 25,000-30,000. “The daily passenger traffic is still 35% short of 2019 levels. But the all-day operations will change this. Total flight movements today are 124-130 on most days, which stood at around 170 in 2019. By March next year, we expect to see the daily flight movements touching pre-pandemic levels. However, things could go back to square one if the third wave hits,” another airport official pointed out. With the new Jet Airways expected to begin operations from the first quarter of next year, airport officials said they expect to see its presence in Pune, too. “Jet Airways had the most slots in addition to an international flight to Singapore before it closed down here. We see no reason as to why it will not resume flights from Pune once operations begin,” the official said. At the moment, chaos and crowding have taken centre stage at the airport, leaving flyers feeling hassled. A meeting of the Pune airport advisory committee will take place on November 24 to address these issues, Pune Member of Parliament (MP) and advisory committee chairman Girish Bapat told TOI. “The meeting will see detailed discussions with all stakeholders on different issues, including crowding. The minutes of the meeting will be prepared,” Bapat said. Sudhir Mehta, president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), said they had written a letter to the PM and Maharashtra CM earlier. “The letters highlight the urgency of the civil aviation needs for Pune and neighboring districts to follow up on Pune airport’s expansion and expediting the process,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airports-per-day-footfalls-may-hit-2019-levels-by-dec/articleshow/87704126.cms||Joy Sengupta

The fee has been increased from Rs 60 to Rs 150 for general category and the parents said that while the scholarship amount has remained the same, the exam fee was increased by the education department. Yuvasena, a students’ organisation, has demanded that the hike be rolled back and has written to the education department on Friday. Joint Secretary of Yuvasena, Kalpesh Yadav, said, “The scholarship amount given to the students is petty. The students do not get much of a benefit with this small amount. The government should rather think about increasing the scholarship amount so that the students are motivated.” Yadav said, “For the past many years the scholarship amount has remained as it is. The education department has already sent a proposal to the state government about the increase in scholarship amount however no decision on the same has been made so fat.” According to the current scheme, the students appearing for middle school scholarship will et Rs 250 to Rs 1,000 annually in standards VI, VII and VIII where as the high school scholarship students would get Rs 300 to Rs 1,500 annually for standards IX and X. Yadav said that the scholarship scheme has to motivate the students, but the amount is so petty that the student do not benefit. Director of education, Dinkar Temkar, said, “The proposal to hike the scholarship amount is with the state government. But the decision on the entry and exam fee is of the exam council and with the changing time and pattern of exam it needs to e increased .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-hikes-entry-exam-fees-for-scholarship-test/articleshow/87704132.cms||---

The aspiring IAS, IPS and state government officers will be trained under this initiative for a year. The civic body will spend around Rs17,000 per student as part of the initiative. As many as 150 hopefuls of UPSC and MPSC exams would be admitted in this course, which is to be conducted in association with the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). A proposal regarding the same was recently approved by the PMC’s standing committee. “It was a long pending demand from the students and training staff to start such a course. The SPPU has supported the move and has agreed to provide the educational expertise for the training,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee. As per the proposal, 100 students from the reserved category and 50 students from open category will get admission in the course. An entrance exam for the same would be conducted and the sucessful students would get admission. The civic officials said that the initiative would be coordinated by the urban community development (social welfare) department of PMC. “The educational expense of the students will be borne by the PMC. The initiative aims at increasing the participation of students from financially weaker sections in competative exams. Family income and other factors such as score in the entrance exam would be considered for giving admissions,” said a senior PMC official. He said the training would include preparation for prelims and mains exams. Interview skills and group discussion skills would be taught. Mock tests and interviews would be conducted. The PMC officials said budgetary provision for the payment had been made. If required, the diversion of funds from other heads could be made, depending on the financial situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-set-to-train-aspirants-in-need-for-competitive-exams/articleshow/87704154.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 15,000 flats to be on offer in DDA’s new scheme next month||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is all set to launch a new housing scheme next month and on offer would be around 15,000 flats, sources said. The proposal to launch the housing scheme would be brought before the authority at its meeting, expected to be chaired by LG Anil Baijal this week. DDA launched a housing scheme earlier this year and the flats that it plans to offer in December would be the ones that were surrendered during its previous housing schemes. Sources said that flats are available in locations like Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Jasola and Narela, but a bulk of them would be one-bedroom flats or those for economically weaker sections. The flats would include those that were surrendered in previous schemes in 2019 and 2014, apart from the 2021 scheme. There are a large number of DDA flats that are in different stages of construction, including premium three-bedroom flats and penthouses in Dwarka, but these would not be offered in the upcoming scheme. Sources said that DDA wants to offer the upcoming flats only when the real estate sector witnesses better growth in the near future. DDA’s previous housing scheme was launched on January 2, 2021, and saw 22,752 applications for the 1,354 flats on offer. The draw of lots for the scheme was held on March 10 for the 253 mostly three-bedroom flats, 757 two-bedroom flats, 52 one-bedroom flats and 291 EWS/Janta flats in areas like Dwarka, Jasola and Vasant Kunj. Even though DDA had carefully chosen clusters in ‘sought-after’ locations for the housing scheme in January, a large number of the 1,354 flats were returned and put up for draw again. However, the handing over of the most sought after of these all – 348 middle-income group (MIG) in Dwarka’s Sector 16-B costing Rs 1.2 crore each – had got delayed as finishing work on them was still on. While the draw of lots was conducted in March this year, DDA later conducted a smaller draw of lots of applicants who were earlier kept on a wait list. DDA had requested all the wait-listed applicants to deposit a registration amount as per their preferences in the application form of DDA Housing Scheme 2021 by June 30 through the DDA website. Wait-listed applicants who failed to deposit the requisite registration amount were not considered for the mini draw of lots for allotment of flats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/15000-flats-to-be-on-offer-in-ddas-new-scheme-next-month/articleshow/87704713.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||ZP to build central school clubbing 12 smaller ones||PUNE: A central school with classes up to Std VII is being constructed in Panshet which once completed can accommodate students from 12 nearby schools. The students will also be given transport allowance so that their commute is taken care of, Ayush Prasad, CEO of Pune ZP, said. Educators have stressed the need for peer learning in students and its lack in schools with less than 10 students where some classes have just one or two students on the rolls. But, one or two teachers are assigned to these schools and they end up having to teach all subjects to all classes. Many of these schools are only up to the lower primary level and for accessing upper primary education, students have to go to the taluka centre which is often far away, resulting in dropouts especially among girl children. The central school hopes to address all these problems. Kamalakant Mhetre, block education officer of Velhe taluka, said that while the new school is coming up in Panshet, the old schools will keep functioning till all parents decide to send their wards to the centralised school. Ayush Prasad said in schools with less than 5 or 10 students, children don’t experience peer learning due to the few children at the school. There are also complaints about teacher attendance and the timings not being followed at the school. Infrastructure is also limited and also underused. “In a central school, children would benefit through better education standards, peer learning and better infrastructure. They would learn with an exclusive teacher for each class. ZP would benefit from better resource utilisation and would be able to save costs, allowing us to do more with our budget. We have the support of the parents as many students from the villages already travel to private schools and young children also seem to associate travel with ‘good schools’,” he said. Prasad said that if successful, the project will be replicated in other areas, and they are planning another project in Velhe itself. “The school should be constructed within a year. This is supported by the Bajaj Group,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-to-build-central-school-clubbing-12-smaller-ones/articleshow/87704147.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Mumbai||Mere non-recovery of contraband does not entitle one to bail: Mumbai court||MUMBAI: When facts of the case demonstrate prima-facie involvement of accused, mere non-recovery of contraband from accused will not entitle him to bail, said a special NDPS court rejecting a plea for liberty in Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) case. The bail plea was filed by a man booked by the NCB, Mumbai Zonal Unit, for offences, including illicit trafficking and conspiracy under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The NCB case was of a seizure of 56 grams of Mephedrone and cash on July 18, from a chawl in Kurla west where two co-accused were arrested. On their statement, the bail applicant was nabbed from the spot and arrested on July 19. Later, NCB seized 53 grams of Mephedrone along with gold and cash from another accused’s house. The bail applicant’s lawyer Rohit Sawant argued that the NCB falsely implicated his client, especially since no contraband was recovered from him and his arrest was from his residence, not the spot, and merely on a statement of a co-accused. But NCB special public prosecutor Advait Sethna opposed the bail, arguing that it was a case of conspiracy, and given that there was a “close nexus” of accused and co-accused and commercial quantity of drug was seized, the rigours of section 37 kicks in. The section requires the court to grant bail only if satisfied that there is no prima facie case made out. Special NDPS court judge A A Joglekar said the contraband seized from a co accused “is undoubtedly” commercial quantity. The court said that while deciding bail plea, it is required to see if a prima facie case exists and the Supreme Court judgment this year in Sambhav Parakh vs State of Chhattisgarh cited by Sethna squarely applies to the bail plea before it.  The SC had observed that “when commercial quantity of illicit psychotropic substance is recovered from one accused in view of section 29 (conspiracy) of the NDPS Act, such other accused from whom no recovery has been made are also not entitled for bail as they have major link in the entire operation.” “It is not necessary to make a roving enquiry” when deciding a bail plea said the special judge, adding that the record demonstrates connivance of the accused and accused failed to make out a prima facie case for bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mere-non-recovery-of-contraband-does-not-entitle-one-to-bail/articleshow/87705785.cms||---

In these efforts, the municipal corporations have a crucial role to play,” Bharadwaj said. “We came to know that the confederation has told all the three municipal corporations that they will go on a mass strike if the arrears are not given,” he claimed. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, meanwhile, said that municipal employees are facing economic hardship due to excessive delays in their salary payments. However, they also know that withholding of municipal funds by Delhi government is responsible for their hardship, he said. Kapoor said if AAP members are serious towards ensuring timely salary payment of employees they should ask Delhi government to release the “withheld funds” to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore. However, Bharadwaj said, “Delhi government has paid every outstanding rupee to the civic bodies. Despite this, BJP is conspiring to throw Delhi into chaos and defame it. We want to tell all of Delhi that, even in times of such tragedy, BJP is scheming and making multiple plans to create more trouble for Delhiites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/threat-of-civic-staff-stir-looms-due-to-unpaid-salaries-aap/articleshow/87704714.cms||---

Work on a link road from Vadgaon Budruk to P L Deshpande Garden in the sinhagad Road area is expected to be complete in a few days. The seven-metre-wide road can be used by two- and four-wheelers, officials said. Another road has been proposed from Prayeja City to Nanded City and is aimed at decentralizing the traffic near the bypass on the Sinhagad Road. The link road was recently approved by the standing committee of Pune Municipal Corporation. Work is expected to begin soon. MLA Madhuri Misal recently inspected the Vadgaon Budruk-P L Deshpande link road and directed the officials to expedite the work. Misal said four kilometres of the 4.5km road – aligned along the canal – was ready. She said the remaining work would be finished soon. “I have also told PMC authorities to complete the other infrastructure work along the road – a safety wall, repairs of culverts and bridges, shifting of power utility cables and transformers,” Misal further said. Misal also reviewed other proposals for road infrastructure in the area. She said work on two flyovers on Sinhagad road – at Rajaram bridge and towards the bypass – was expected to begin soon. The facilities will provide through-and-through options for the vehicles and thus eliminate the need to halt at junctions. Umesh Mane, a Dhayari resident, said Sinhagad Road was handling vehicular traffic beyond its capacity. “This causes traffic snarls and chaos. Alternative routes are a must,” he said. Mayank Raje, a regular traveller on Sinhagad Road, said, “The entire stretch from Dandekar bridge to Nanded city has many gaps. There are traffic signals at every junction. Vehicles spend lot of time at every junction. A flyover will be.” Hemant Rasne, standing committee chairman, said Rs 1.76 crore has been sanctioned for the 1.8km Prayeja City-Nanded City road. “It will help decentralize the traffic in the area and prevent congestion,” Rasne said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-works-on-infra-to-ease-traffic-load-on-sinhagad-road/articleshow/87704167.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Ahmedabad||IIM-Ahmedabad completes 5 years of school connect||AHMEDABAD: The Covid pandemic has far-reaching impacts when it comes to formal educational sector, and the teachers and administrators across the country are waking up to it. While the leadership development programme specially designed for the principals of government-run schools in Delhi completed five years in 2021, this year’s theme – along with infrastructure development, capacity building and student outcomes – remained the ways in which the students can be engaged. Prof Kathan Shukla, a faculty member and one of the coordinators for the programme, said that just declaring the schools open doesn’t bring the students back – it needs a long-term planning and engagement. “The challenge for the educators is to re-connect and re-wire with students post Covid. We are thus focusing on social, emotional and academic climate of the school as the schools are finding newer ways to connect with the community,” he said. He added that there is a sharp focus on the foundational learning with the realization that many students might need to re-visit them to go forward. “We are attempting to gamify the student learning experience through the training and engagement with different stakeholders. Some other topics we have integrated in the course include gender sensitivity, emotional regulation, and positive social interactions,” added Prof Shukla. The programme also intends to address issues such as bullying and teasing within school environs through social and emotional audit and working closely with both students and teachers. The experts at Ravi J Matthai Centre for Educational Innovation said that the interaction has resulted in better passing rates in government-run schools, but to take it to the next level would require grassroots-based educational innovations. School educational climate assessment would be launched soon at these schools, said experts. During Covid, the teachers across India including Gujarat had shared their innovations online with the larger community to emulate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iim-a-completes-5-yrs-of-school-connect/articleshow/87704175.cms||Parth Shastri

Another of his bodyguards, Bhagatsingh, too was found dead. Intermittent firing, including unprecedented heavy firing from either side at times, went on for almost 10 hours, it’s learnt. Four C60 jawans were injured in the encounter, now their condition is learnt to be stable. On Sunday, SP Ankit Goyal confirmed the death of Teltumbde after he was identified as per the police Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) by a surrendered Maoist at police headquarters. “We have informed Teltumbde’s wife (Angela Sontakey) about his death, but she is yet to reach to take the body,” said Goyal. Some 29 weapons, including five AK-47s, one AKM with under-barrel grenade launcher, three Insas rifles, and one pistol were seized from the encounter site by C60 commandos. Substantial explosives and materials of daily use were also seized. Also, on Sunday, Chhattisgarh police launched an operation on their side of the border in the region. Sources from the district police said top cadres like divisional committee member Sukhpal Parcheki and Dandakaranya special zonal committee member Prabhakar too were probably present at the encounter site, but managed to sneak away amid heavy firing. Teltumbde, who had survived several encounters narrowly, ran out of luck this time and was cornered. Sources said C60 parties, which started the operation a day ago, had encircled the hillock and forested region in multiple layers, and laid ambushes plugging exit routes. While the hilly and rocky terrain of the forested stretch helped top leaders and cadres flee despite raining bullets, Teltumbde got trapped on the hillock. Sources said the C60 commandos were initially stunned by the unfamiliar style of heavy firing from the Maoists, who are known to be extremely frugal with ammunition. “The experienced C-60 commandos sensed something different in the volume of firing, and realized the rebels seemed to be protecting someone very important. Forces had no information of Teltumbde’s presence, but the manner in which the Maoists were aggressively firing made it a possibility,” said a source. The C-60 commandos were led by Additional SP, Operations, Somay Munde, said SP Ankit Goyal, praising the efforts of the young IPS officer. Sources further said Teltumbde was protected by a group of young cadres from Chhattisgarh, who are yet to be identified. “Though they knew their end was near, the group fought till the last breath to protect Teltumbde. Almost 80-90% of the neutralized Maoists laid down their lives for Teltumbde instead of fleeing,” said the source. He added the small group kept the C60 commandos guessing for long about their next move. “Even after firing reduced from the Maoists side, and eventually their guns fell silent, the C60 commandos had to be very cautious,” said the source. Kasansoor commander Sunnu (reward Rs8 lakh), divisional committee member Mahesh Gota (Rs16 reward on his head), DVC and company four commander Lokesh (reward Rs20 lakh) and Korchi dalam commander Kisan (reward Rs8 lakh) were among the other key cadres neutralized. The bodies and materials seized from the slain Maoists were ferried to Kotgul by C60 jawans on foot, walking through the forest for almost 10km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cornered-teltumbdes-guards-held-back-c60-commandos-for-several-hours-some-seniors-escaped/articleshow/87704720.cms||Soumitra Bose

It has put a question mark on the state’s ambitious plan to vaccinate all eligible population with a single shot in the next two weeks. Despite the start of the Har Ghar Dastak campaign, there has only been a slight uptick in daily immunisation numbers. Only 13.88 lakh jabs were administered during October 30 to November 5, followed by 27.2 lakh during November 6-12 -- both figures being the lowest in at least the last 11 weeks. The end of festivities pushed up daily vaccination in the last week, but the numbers have been lower than the weekly jabs administered during the August-September period, the data showed. Compared to October when there were 1.5 crore vaccinations, this month has seen barely 44.32 lakh administered in the first fortnight. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the door-to-door campaign was picking steam in districts and vaccination numbers have started to rise. “Daily average vaccinations have been in the range of 4.5-5 lakh doses during the last two-three weeks. However, it touched 7 lakh on Saturday and will increase further from Monday,” he said, adding that the aim was to touch 10 lakh doses every day through the door-to-door campaign. Maharashtra has an adult population of 9.14 crore, of which 6.91 crore (76%) have taken at least one dose, while 3.34 crore (38%) have taken both shots. Desai said the 2.2 crore people who haven’t taken their first shots will be covered if 10-12 lakh doses can be administered every day in the next fortnight. Besides the first dose, nearly 75 lakh beneficiaries are due for the second dose too. In Mumbai, vaccination picked up significantly after the Diwali weekend as the city recorded 1-1.2 lakh vaccinations daily last week. A civic official said that nearly 70% of the doses administered now are second doses. While Mumbai has statistically achieved 100% first dose coverage, almost 30% vaccinations are still first doses. The official said that with train travel and access to most places tied to vaccination, few would want to remain unvaccinated. After Mumbai, Pune (95%), Bhandara (92.3%) and Sindhudurg (91%) are closer to hitting the 100% single dose coverage mark. However, the slowdown has officials worried. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the number of sessions conducted by private hospitals has dropped further. “The number of private hospitals conducting daily vaccination sessions is falling significantly. It was 210 at one point, which has now come down to an average of 150,” he said. A Pune Municipal Corporation official said that with less than 10 beneficiaries turning up at private sites, many do not create sessions on certain days. If the vial contains doses for 10 people and only four turn up, six doses can go waste. Data shows that several small districts in Maharashtra with a population of less than a million are far from achieving maximum single dose coverage. Sindhudurg, which has a population of merely 5.8 lakh, has given the first dose to 91%. Among other smaller districts with less than 100% single shot coverage are Washim (63%), Hingoli (60%), Wardha (80%) and Gadchiroli (66%). All these districts have a population of less than a million each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtras-weekly-vax-count-drops-to-three-month-low/articleshow/87706649.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||Driverless operations on Delhi Metro's Pink Line all set to begin by end of this year||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is likely to start “driverless” train operations on its longest corridor—Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar)—by the end of this year. With the addition of Pink Line, DMRC’s driverless network, which currently includes the 37-km-long Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West), would become part of the world’s longest automated Metro networks. According to sources, DMRC has completed signalling work and the commissioner of metro rail safety (CMRS) will inspect the corridor for unattended train operations (UTO) this week. Driverless operations in the UTO mode will be possible after a safety go-ahead from the CMRS and it is expected that it will begin by the end of this year. DMRC took a huge technological leap on December 28 last year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the country’s first ever fully automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line. It was expected that driverless operations would also begin on the 58.4-km-long Pink Line in a few months. However, unlike the Magenta Line, the Pink Line operated as two different sections till recently due to a ‘missing link’ at Trilokpuri where DMRC had been unable to construct a viaduct. The missing link was bridged in August this year and uninterrupted train movement on the entire corridor could finally begin. DMRC has been integrating this section with the rest of the corridor’s state-of-the-art signalling system, which allows automated driverless operations. When driverless train operations begin on the Pink Line, the total driverless network of DMRC would stand at nearly 96 km, which would be 9% of the world’s total driverless Metro network, according to DMRC. The driverless network would further cross the 100 km mark when the 12.5-km-long Maujpur-Majlis Park extension of the corridor, which is being constructed as part of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV project, gets completed by 2023. Thanks to the state-of-the-art Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling technology, driverless train operations are possible in both the Magenta and Pink Lines. Compared with the technology used in older Metro corridors, CBTC allows more efficient and safe train operations. Driverless operations have been made possible due to changes in the existing General Rules for running trains that take into account the presence of a driver and the guidelines of handling any emergency involving the presence of a driver. The Metro Railway General Rules 2020, however, takes into account driverless operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/driverless-operations-on-pink-line-all-set-to-begin-by-end-of-this-year/articleshow/87704745.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The strike by MSRTC staffers entered its seventh day on Sunday. Pune division officials said they expect a breakthrough on Monday. “Higher ups and the transport department are in talks with the protesting employees. The talks are at an advanced stage and a breakthrough is expected on Monday. Of 4,000 employees in Pune who went on strike, 371 reported to duty,” an official told TOI. The official said the 371 employees were from workshops and administration staff and that none of them were drivers or conductors. “Things will not improve until drivers and conductors get back to work. MSRTC has suspended around 150 protesters in Pune so far. However, an assurance has been given that those suspended will be taken care of if they join duty,” the official said. Private buses are plying, but commuters have been unhappy with the high fares.

---||Trichy||Value addition centre lures more farmers to millet cultivation, away from GM crops||Trichy: Understanding the risks associated with the cultivation of expensive genetically modified cotton and maize crops, rainfed farmers in Perambalur district are increasingly turning towards less expensive millet cultivation. The change was possible after the state development policy council (SDPC) funded a millet development project in an administrative block of the district by establishing a value addition centre to market the produce. Now the number of farmers taking up millet cultivation has surged by about 80%. Though regarded as a traditional millet production belt, Veppur in Perambalur had extensively cultivated cotton and maize in the past few decades. Even as heavy usage of pesticides was making the cultivation expensive, adverse weather and crop loss added to the farmers’ woes. It was in this backdrop that a Chennai-based NGO called Barefoot Academy of Governance encouraged a section of farmers to take up millet cultivation. It broached the idea after conducting a study in Veppur block in 2015. Initially, only seven farmers took up the cultivation on 5.50 acres in 2015, but today it has surged to 105 acres. Around 60 farmers have cultivated millets including Kodo (Varagu), Foxtail millet (Thinai) and black sorghum (irungu solam) this year. Sensing the potential of the change, the state government also came forward to revive millet cultivation in 2020-2021. Named as Veppur Millet Mission, a value addition centre was established in Nannai village with the help of the state development policy council which allotted Rs 45 lakh for it. The millet farmers also formed a society named Nammalvar Organic Millet Farmer Producer Group to receive further support from Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission (TNSRLM). In the past two months, the group has been producing value-added millet products and selling them. “Millet rice and flour produced by our farmers are garnering overwhelming response. We are also improving our packaging and branding quality to target local and tier-I cities markets,” K Saravanan, coordinator, Barefoot Academy of Governance, said. In cotton and maize cultivation, if markets were deciding the price of the crop, farmers said they decide the cost in the case of millets even after value addition. “Low risk in cultivation and nutritious benefits encouraged our farmers to take up millets,” P Banumathy, a farmer from Perambalur, said. Mahalir Thittam department expects more farmers to take up millet cultivation as the success story is striking a chord with disgruntled cotton and maize farmers. “The value addition centre employs at least 15 women who will get assured income. Millet has a huge scope in the rainfed region,” M Rajmohan, project director, Mahalir Thittam, added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/value-addition-centre-lures-more-farmers-to-millet-cultivation-away-from-gm-crops/articleshow/87704733.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Virtual mega book fair for Delhi government schools||NEW DELHI: A virtual mega book fair was organised on Sunday for the students of Delhi government schools. The schools under the Directorate of Education (DoE) are expected to use the platform to choose from the best books for their libraries. Students and teachers alike will be able to place orders for the books online from the publishers and these would be delivered to the schools. Deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia inaugurated the fair via a video conference. “It is for the first time in the country that all schools of a state are participating in such a virtual book fair together. Books play an important role in the all-round development of children. Realising its importance, the Kejriwal government has made many important changes in its school libraries in the last five years. Our aim is to provide quality books to the children studying in government schools,” Sisodia said. Suggestions were invited from teachers and students regarding the selection of books and only those were included in the libraries that would contribute to the positive development of kids, he said. “Now, a scrutiny committee decides whether the books by a publisher are good and useful for children and whether they are required in a library, and if they would help the students in pursuing their dreams. The committee decides whether the books are worth purchasing,” Sisodia stressed. This year, the scrutiny committee has prepared a list of 8,000 books from 220 publishers. The Delhi government has allocated Rs 9 crore for 1,031 schools in Delhi. The books will be displayed on the DoE website from November 14 to December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virtual-mega-book-fair-for-delhi-govt-schools/articleshow/87704734.cms||---

Abnormal sugar levels recorded were greater than 140 mg/dl. Data from the Union Health and Family Welfare department shows that that blood sugar levels in both men and women are higher in urban areas than in rural areas. In Telangana, 21% men in urban areas had high blood sugar (greater than 140 mg/dl), compared to 16% in rural regions. About 18% of women in cities have this condition, compared to 13% of women in rural regions, while 14% of women in rural areas take medication to regulate their blood sugar levels. Interestingly, World Health Organization (WHO) data for November revealed that approximately only 25% of diabetics are correctly using their medication. The rest are either using it inappropriately or not using medication at all. “Any blood sugar level (post lunch) of 140 mg/dl is considered high though it is not diabetic. Blood sugar levels above 180 mg/dl are considered a diabetic condition. This requires lifestyle management with a healthy diet, proper medicine and regular exercising,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher. WHO also estimated that by 2017, nine million people worldwide had Type 1 diabetes (since childhood with specific medical conditions), but that 95% of patients had Type 2 diabetes, which is caused primarily by lifestyle issues and can be controlled with the help of maintaining healthy body weight. Adults with diabetes have a two-to three-fold greater risk of heart attack and stroke, according to experts. Worldwide, around 54% of potential diabetics are not identified, and in India, the figure is 49.7%. “Avoiding smoking and drinking after a certain age,” Dr Kiran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/14-women-18-men-have-high-blood-sugar-in-state/articleshow/87704748.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The ZP had demanded five acres of land in the Hinjewadi IT Park III for the project. However, the MIDC recently gave letter to the ZP citing that there was no policy to give the land parcel for such a project.. “Our headquarter has rejected the proposal/request,” stated the letter submitted by Sanjeev Deshmukh, regional officer of the MIDC. “The ZP has made a comprehensive village-wise solid waste management project for entire rural Pune. The Hinjewadi IT Park and the other nine villages are under the ZP limits. They have been facing solid waste disposal issues. Most of these agencies are dumping the garbage in open areas of these villages. This has created serious health issues at several locations. As a result, the solid waste plant is necessary to dispose off the garbage systematically,” said a senior official from the ZP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/midc-refuses-to-give-land-to-zp-for-stp/articleshow/87704223.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Trichy||No rain, but water-logging remains a pain||Trichy: Though there was no rainfall for the past three days in Trichy city, inundation in residential areas continues to irk the local people. While state highways and even city traffic police have voluntarily repaired the damaged roads, Trichy Corporation has come under severe criticism from the residents for being apathetic in resolving the road connectivity issues. Residents of various localities, particularly from the penultimate wards situated on the boundary of the city, opined that there was no respite for them from the bad roads. For the residents of Kattur near Thiruverumbur, KK Nagar, Wireless Road and E Pudur areas, commuting is still a struggle. Most of the roads were damaged due to the ongoing underground drainage work. Although the UGD work is partially completed in the residential areas that may not require further digging activities, the civic body was reluctant in taking up the maintenance work, residents said. Anticipating rainfall, the civic body could have filled the potholes and levelled the surface. Even after the heavy rain, there is no solution, the residents said. However, the civic body applied gravel mix on the damaged roads near RS Puram, but such temporary work was not carried out on all the bad roads. Even in RS Puram, the residents said that the shoddy temporary work is failing to address the purpose as two-wheelers are struggling to access the roads. “For weeks, waterlogging has been continuing near the Wireless Road vicinity. School children are also suffering, Trichy Corporation is yet to inspect our streets,” Hemant Verma, a resident of Vasantha Nagar near Trichy airport, said. A senior official with Trichy Corporation said that the roads are being temporarily overhauled in a phased manner. “Only after UGD work is finished, we can relay the roads,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-rain-but-water-logging-remains-a-pain/articleshow/87704749.cms||---

The demand for the second dose was higher at the camps. However, the response for the drive in Madurai and southern districts was poor as many of the southern districts witnessed rains on Sunday. In Madurai, around 42,000 people got vaccinated. Though the district did not see much rain on Sunday, the response was slow and marginally dull than the last mega vaccination drive, when the district recorded around 46,000 beneficiaries getting the vaccine jab. In Trichy city, the turnout started off on a dull note with poor footfall in most of the camps. However, the mobile vaccination vehicles covered the people gathering at spots with both Covaxin and Covishield. Till 6pm, Trichy district had vaccinated 67,258 people of which 39,494 took the second dose. The district was placed at fourth spot after Cuddalore, Chennai and Coimbatore. “As there was no rain in the city, demand for vaccination gradually improved by afternoon. Mobile vaccination centres on wheels did a commendable job by inquiring with people about their vaccination status and covering those eligible to get the second jab,” a medical officer with Trichy Corporation said. Of the 200 vaccination centres announced for Trichy city, over 100 were mobile vaccination centres. As the city had vaccinated many public with Covishield vaccine three months back, the demand for second dose is likely to increase in the coming days. “We are contacting those who have been skipping their second dose to appear at any of the centre to complete their vaccination,” the officer added. In Karur, 27,126 doses were administered while Ariyalur vaccinated 25,135 people on Sunday.  In Kanyakumari, despite heavy rains lashing the district in the last few days including on Sunday, 26,201 people took the jab. Of them, 22,545 were taking the second dose. In Virudhunagar, with no rainfall on Sunday, there was relatively good response from public and as 51,440 doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered.

Boundary stones and a board erected mentioning the property as owned by Malliampathu panchayat were damaged in the attempt. The land is situated in Vasan Valley on Vayalur road in the suburbs of Trichy city was identified under survey number 49/3. Sprawling for 2,200sq ft, the panchayat has records that the land, about 40 years ago, was used as a cremation ground. During an audit, as the land was found encroached by private individuals using the wrong survey number, Malliampathu panchayat approached the Srirangam taluk office to survey the site to identify the owner. On Saturday, a man had visited the site and boundaries were marked, confirming that the land belongs to the panchayat. “The worth of the property is presently estimated to be more than Rs 50 lakh and some influential people faked the survey number to claim ownership of the land for the past 12 years,” U Vigneshwaran, president, Malliampathu panchayat said. The rural local body had planned to fence the property to prevent further encroachment attempts but on Sunday morning, the boundary stones installed by the panchayat were uprooted. The panchayat council approached the Somarasampettai police station with a complaint seeking an inquiry. Revenue department officials also said that they will inquire about the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bid-to-encroach-land-in-trichy-a-day-after-panchayat-retrieved-it/articleshow/87704741.cms||---

Hetvi Mehta (11) could have unintentionally cut up a portion of a balcony net while engaged in a craft activity, said the police. There is no conclusion on how she could have fallen as the balcony does not have cameras. The balcony did not have a grill. The police recorded an accidental death case and are making inquiries.Hetvi lived with her grandparents and mother in the highrise, AHCL Homes, on Borivli Link Road. Around 4.40 pm on Saturday, passers-by heard a loud thud on the pavement outside the building. “There was a cloud of dust and it was initially unclear what had happened. We then spotted the body of a child and alerted the society management. She had hit a signpost before landing on the ground,” said an eyewitness who works in an office on the premises. Someone called up the police control room. A police team rushed the girl to a public hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. Another team stayed back to inquire about her identity. “As she was found on the pavement and the guards of the adjacent building did not recognise her, we went door-to-door to inquire whose child it was. When we reached Hetvi’s house on the 10th floor of the highrise, her grandmother was not aware of the accident. Her grandmother said Hetvi was indoors playing. We then showed her a photograph of the deceased. She was in shock and confirmed that the photo was of her granddaughter’s. Hetvi’s mother was away when the incident occurred. The family is grieving and we will record their statements subsequently,” said a police officer. Senior inspector S Kalekar of the Borivli police station said there did not appear to be any foul play. “It’s a case of an accidental fall,” said Kalekar. Hetvi studied in class VI of a suburban school and was an only child. The police will be going through CCTV footage from the society premises and commercial establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-yr-old-falls-to-death-from-10th-floor-balcony-in-borivli/articleshow/87705823.cms||Nitasha Natu

Police have begun booking miscreants and touts who are targeting tourists, North Goa superintendent of police Shobhit Saxena told reporters on Sunday. He said that tourist police have been deployed along Goa’s beaches to not only help tourists but to also address complaints of harassment. “I won’t say there is a rise in harassment of tourists, but Goa is a global tourist destination and like all global tourist destinations, there are instances of harassment,” Saxena said. “There are unscrupulous people who try to cheat tourists, who try to misguide them and we are booking a lot of these people under the Tourism Trade Act.” The SP said that police are keeping a close watch on touts, malpractices and illegal vendors who are harassing tourists. “The action is much more than it was in the previous years,” he said on the sidelines of a cycling expedition. Saxena, who also heads the crime branch, said that sleuths are also keeping a close watch on foreigners who are overstaying and who are linked to the drug trade. “We have also carried out a full foreigner survey to see who are staying here illegally. We are trying to identify them and we are trying to take action against them,” he said. In 2019, police seized drugs worth Rs 10 crore and several foreigners were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for drug possession. Police are keeping a close watch on those who were booked earlier as well as their associates. Saxena said that the police force wants to “strike hard against drugs and nip it in the bud” to ensure a safe tourism season. “We expect to see a safe tourist season for everyone. Not only the local police station staff, but tourist police are also deployed and they have recently been trained in soft skills. They are deployed not only to assist the tourists but also to take complaints from them and they are going to be a force multiplier,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-peak-tourism-season-police-to-crack-down-on-harassment-of-tourists/articleshow/87704806.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After monsoon break, all 8 zones of Corbett open now||DEHRADUN: After the monsoon break, all eight zones of Corbett will be opened to tourists on Monday. The tiger reserve was partially opened in October but three zones - Dhikala, Durga Devi and Sonanadi – were closed for night stay. Owing to a drop in Covid cases and a rise in inoculations, no curbs have been placed on visitors this year, officials said, adding that tourists are free to visit without a Covid-19 test or a vaccination certificate.“Due to easing of curbs, the response has been overwhelming. The park is fully booked for night stays and safaris for the rest of November,” an official said, adding that they are expecting a footfall of 1,000 people daily and plan to conduct 240 jungle safaris every day. The prime zones of the park will be open from November 15 to June 15. Last year too, the park saw a record footfall of 2 lakh tourists between October 2020 and March 2021, despite the fact that visitors had been asked to bring Covid-negative test reports. The critical core area of Corbett presents some of the most picturesque sights, offers scenic photography experiences and is ideal for wildlife sightings. The tiger reserve was adversely affected in the recent torrential rains in Kumaon, with several areas getting water- logged, cameras traps placed for census activities getting washed away and waste accumulating in the Ramganga river, which is the source of drinking water for many wild animals. Of the eight zones of Corbett – Jhirna, Dhikala, Bijrani, Durga Devi, Garjiya, Sonanadi and Pakhro – the first three remain the most sought after, as the likelihood of tiger sighting here is higher as compared to other zones. Among the new attractions for tourists this year is the newly-inaugurated Interpretation Centre at Dhangari, which provides information on the Corbett’s wildlife through various mediums. “At least 500 visitors have been coming to the interpretation centre every day, helping the department earn at least Rs 50,000 every day. This year, too, we are expecting a huge turnout as Covid norms have been relaxed,” said RK Tiwari, the warden of Corbett National Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-monsoon-break-all-8-zones-of-corbett-open-now/articleshow/87704229.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Who was Milind Teltumbde: He rose from mine union leader to Maoist thinktank||NAGPUR: Milind Teltumbde, who was a mine workers union leader, had risen to become the Maoists’ most trusted leader and strategy planner in central India. Former state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell in-charge Ravindra Kadam, considered an expert on Naxals, said the death of the Maoists’ apex body member would be a setback for the outfit but rebels would not leave the void unfilled for long. If Teltumbde is believed to be the sole motivator for ‘urban Maoism’ in Maharashtra, Kadam was the one who laid bare the outfits’ metro cell’s involvement in Koregaon Bhima episode with the aim of cornering the government and also spread its network in India. Teltumbde, from Karanja in Yavatmal district, was himself a cadre recruited from urban areas. His brother advocate Anand Teltumbde is in jail currently for his alleged role in Koregaon Bhima case. Teltumbde’s wife Angela Sontakey, also earlier arrested by Maharashtra ATS, was handling charge of Maoists ‘Golden triangle’ comprising states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Kadam, who had brought Teltumbde’s role to fore in Koregaon Bhima case, said the state security agencies now cannot sit basking in glory. “There is absolutely no place for complacency now,” said Kadam, who retired last year as Jt CP Nagpur. Kadam, who was the backbone of the Koregaon Bhima case, said a letters by Teltumbde, unearthed during the investigation, penned to his colleagues of Central Committee, the apex body in the outfit, narrating the success of the Koregaon Bhima case to put the government in a soup, laid bare the conspiracy to fuel the agitation. Kadam also said Teltumbde can also be credited with finding an alternative to Abujhmadh, along Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, in the safe zones of Kanha National Park, where security forces could not enter due to legal constraints. “Teltumbde had stretched Maoist presence up to Mandla, Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh and Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, starting from Gondia,” said Kadam. Police sources said Teltumbde, who was baptized into the Communist movement by advocate Sujan Abhraham, was initially part of Akhil Maharashtra Kamgar Union. He was also divisional committee member of coal belt of Chandrapur and Nagpur. After the death of Shridhar Shrinivasan, Teltumbde was made secretary of Maharashtra Rajya State Committee, which oversaw the movement in the Gondia-Balaghat-Rajnandgaon zone. After the committee was dissolved in 2017, Teltumbde was made chief of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh - Chhattisgarh (MCC) zone. Sources said Teltumbde was bringing along with him new recruits to work for MCC from places in remote Chhattisgarh when he was intercepted and killed in the encounter on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teltumbde-rose-from-mine-union-leader-to-maoist-thinktank/articleshow/87704760.cms||Soumitra Bose

The train will be highly useful for traders and the business community, they said. Mayiladuthurai MP S Ramalingam has written to the general manager of Southern Railway on operating a new train on this section. He has stated that the train should be operated via Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai and Villupuram. The Southern Railway operates only a one-day service (Cholan Express Train Number 06795/06796) between Trichy and Chennai through the mainline, which is not able to cater to the needs of the travelling public living in the section. Moreover, the Cholan Express is a fully-reserved train, which has more air-conditioned sleeper coaches, and non AC sleeper class coaches than ordinary second class coaches, he said. Moreover, the timing of the Cholan Express is not suitable for the mainline section people to reach Chennai. It is a long pending demand of the people of the delta districts to operate an intercity day train without any reserved coaches, and only with second class sitting coaches suitably to reach the capital before noon, the MP said in the letter. Meanwhile, the functionaries of Thanjavur District Railway Users Association have welcomed the MPs demand. “Presently Rameswaram-Ayodya Cantonment and Rameswaram-Banaras weekly express trains provide early daytime connectivity to Chennai on Monday and Thursday for the mainline passengers,” A Giri, secretary of the association, said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mp-demands-new-express-train-between-chennai-trichy/articleshow/87704759.cms||---

---||Delhi||Wrong to paint cops with communal brush: Delhi Court||NEW DELHI: A city court came down heavily on an accused’s lawyer for painting the entire Delhi Police with a communal brush by saying that the criminal cases related to the northeast Delhi riots have been fastened upon the members of the Muslim community alone. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said the statement was not only “highly irresponsible”, but also “patently false”. The court further said that the police appeared to have done its job with utmost integrity and certainly not on communal lines. During the hearing of a bail application of an accused in a riots case, his counsel argued that only people belonging to the Muslim community were targeted by the police in the aftermath of the riots and were arraigned in false criminal cases. To this, the court said, “These submissions... are certainly not in good taste. These are noted with immense disgust, repugnance and strong disapproval.” It said that the counsel had not pointed out any material on record to substantiate his claim that the riots were not communal in nature or were the handiwork of any political party. “It is the counsel himself, who is now painting the entire Delhi Police with a communal brush by saying that the criminal cases related to the riots have been fastened upon the members of Muslim community alone. The statement of counsel are not only highly irresponsible but also patently false,” it added in its order on November 11. The court noted that while dealing with the cases related to the riots, it had noticed that members of both the communities had been arraigned as accused and were chargesheeted by the police. In some cases, it was observed that there were witnesses belonging to Hindu community cited against the accused belonging to the same community and witnesses belonging to Muslim community cited against the accused belonging to the same community, it added. “The police appears to have done its job with utmost integrity and certainly not on communal lines. Maybe, some lapses have occurred during the investigation of these cases related, but even those lapses also do not give any slightest indication that the investigation was not fair and impartial or was on communal lines,” the court observed. “The cases before this court are very serious and sensitive in nature and require to be dealt with in a professional manner and without any communal taint,” it said. The court went on to say that the submission of the counsel that the chargesheet was only a bunch of papers was distasteful, to say the least. It added that the chargesheet had been considered in detail by the previous sessions judge, whereby charges had been framed against all the accused in the case, including the accused. "It is true that the investigating agency has kept open its right to investigate the case further, which is permissible u/s 173 (8) CrPC. It has to be borne in mind that the instant case relates to the killing of a person by riotous mob and only few persons among that mob have been identified so far against whom the chargesheet has been filed. It is the duty of the police to continue further investigation so as to identify all the remaining rioters and bring them to book (sic),” it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wrong-to-paint-cops-with-communal-brush-court/articleshow/87704763.cms||---

The toddler, who is in preschool, completed about 75% of the trek on foot. On the last leg of the expedition, the little man was carried by elders accompanying him. At this point, the air was too thin and trekking was deemed risky for the toddler by the doctor available at the last village enroute. While undertaking the seven-day long trek, the toddler looked forward to meeting Hulk and Captain America among other superheroes because his mother had told him that all the superheroes stayed near the Everest Base camp. “I am an Everest superhero, I like sleeping in the sleeping bag,” said the little trekker, speaking about his experience. Born to a trekker mother, it was she who set a goal for him to be the youngest one to trek to the Everest base camp. “I had taken him to professionals while he was an infant. They had advised me to ensure that he is not used to too much luxury. Since he began walking, I used to ensure he walked a lot and took the stairs several times a day to make him rough and tough,” said Shweta Golechha, his mother. “My husband planned a 15-day trip to Manali to acclimatize him to below zero temperatures, camping and trekking. By the time we went for the trek, he had already experienced these things,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-yr-old-treks-to-everest-base-camp/articleshow/87704766.cms||Amrita Didyala

He also announced plans to export cotton and cotton yarn from Vidarbha soon. Addressing a programme of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) on Saturday evening, Gadkari, also city MP, said, “Harris called me yesterday night. She was inquiring about our economy. She stated they want to increase trade with Hindustan as compared to some other countries. Therefore, there are big opportunities for Vidarbha that require technology and resources. Chamber and traders here should now dare and start thinking globally,” he said. Stating he has special interest in agriculture, the minister said export of oranges from Vidarbha started last year. “We exported 8,000 tonne oranges last year. This year, we target to increase it to 1 lakh tonne. Now, we don’t need to send them to JNPT, Mumbai, before exporting. From dry port started at Wardha, goods can be transported to Haldia port to Pangaon port and Dakha,” he said. The Uinion minister said that the home minister of Bangladesh had a meeting with him in New Delhi. “He assured to take oranges in huge quantum from Vidarbha. Similarly, I have plans to export cotton and yarn in huge quantum from Vidarbha this year. There is huge demand of cotton and yarn,” he said. Gadkari suggested NVCC to felicitate entrepreneurs who invest over Rs500 crore in Vidarbha and increase the limit to Rs1,000 crore. “I personally know the dignitaries who were felicitated today. Here no one invests over Rs5-100 crore. Now, scenario is changing. Nagpur is having good infrastructure now. Soon the city will become capital of logistic,” he said. He expressed satisfaction over NVCC’s plan to construct its new office. “I have planned a tunnel which will start from Cotton Market and end near the NVCC office so that people can cover the distance within 3-4 minutes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kamala-harris-dials-gadkari-wants-increase-in-trade-with-hindustan/articleshow/87704767.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

A KMC official said littering has become a major issue at major transit and tourists places owing to the food stalls. The food vendors are counselled and sensitised regularly, but the situation remains the same. The vendors have claimed that the irregular arrival of the waste collection autorickshaw tippers forces them to dump the waste along road side. Vijay Patil, acting chief sanitation inspector of KMC, said, “As per law it is mandatory for every one to segregate waste at source. Many do not practice it in reality. We have counselled the vendors from Central Bus Stand, Shahupuri, Rankala, Rajarampuri and Khau Galli to start practising segregation and storage. If they are found handing over mixed waste then we will impose fine on them and if the offence is repeated, we will cancel the license and seize the cart.” Unsegregated waste is the major concern before sanitation authorities and not the collection. With additional vehicles arrived, the door-to-door collection of waste is now a regular affair. The segregation if not done at the source, causing inconvenience to the waste handlers at the processing plant. “Since the processing plant has become operational, the waste piled up for 10 years was processed up to 60%,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mandatory-for-food-vendors-to-segregate-waste-kmc/articleshow/87705326.cms||---

Hyderabad in the last four centuries imbibed food traditions from around the world, of course, with a pinch of local tastes to suit the local palate. There are about 700 authentic Deccani food flavours, each with its signature taste and unique aroma. There are also some new entrants that are fast adapting to the local food culture with Deccani masalas and other ingredients. It’s a matter of time that these new dishes become part of the Deccani cuisine, argue Hyderabadi food experts. After Shawarma, Mandi is ruling hotel kitchens. Mandi, the Yemeni dish, was once limited to a few wedding dinners. What started in a couple of speciality restaurants in Barkas, is now being served in an estimated 2,000 restaurants. Though Mandi and its Arabic cousin, Kabsa, started off in hotels in Hyderabad around the same time in 2013, Mandi took over the Hyderabadi palate, said Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) city convener P Anuradha Reddy. The city has about 5,000 biryani joints. With more Mandi joints opening in the city, food experts feel Hyderabadis want to experiment with new foods. They, however, argue that no dish would ever beat Hyderabadi biryani, which was likely introduced by the Qutub Shahis and perfected in royal kitchens of Nizam, particularly Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII. Himayat Ali Mirza, great grandson of Osman Ali Khan, said Hyderabadi biryani evolved absorbing Deccani or Telangana flavours into it. “This evolution took place in the mega royal kitchens of Asaf Jahs,” he said adding that biryani continues to be the favourite dish of most Hyderabadis, the growing popularity of Mandi notwithstanding. Heritage and food expert Dr Haseeb Jafferi said the light masala and large quantities of meat and rice with a dash of dry fruits in Mandi is appealing. While biryani has its loyal fan base many prefer Mandi as it is light on spices. He, however, argues that biryani will remain the king of Hyderabadi cuisine but it can accommodate Mandi as a wazir (minister). Dr Mohammad Safiullah, who is currently doing research on Hyderabadi cuisine, said Hyderabadi biryani has been perfected over the decades and no dish would ever beat it. Mandi is a new flavour in the town and Hyderabadis are known for their penchant for new foods. Interestingly, Mandi has been given a local flavour and it’s not surprising that it may sooner or later evolve as Hyderabadi Mandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wazir-mandi-strays-into-biryanis-court/articleshow/87704768.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Mumbai||Installing world’s tallest saffron flag in Maharashtra, NCP dabbles in ‘soft Hindutva’||MUMBAI: NCP seems to have taken a saffron turn ahead of the local body polls as NCP MLA Rohit Pawar, grand nephew of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, installed the world’s tallest saffron flag in his constituency of Karjat-Jamkhed last month. The massive flag, weighing 90 kilogram, is hoisted atop a 74-metre-tall pole which weighs 18 tonnes and has traversed across six states before being installed in Jamkhed. Political observers said the saffron flag was an attempt by the young Pawar family scion to not just make an attempt to experiment with soft Hindutva but also lay claim to Shivaji’s legacy. Rohit told TOI that the flag pole was 74 metres tall since ‘Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation took place in 1674. “Hindutva can’t be claimed by any party and neither does it belong to any political party. This flag has travelled to 96 holy sites across 36 districts in India. The saffron flag also represents nationalism and has travelled to several religious sites all over India. There is nothing political about it. CM Uddhav Thackeray has already spoken about neo-Hindutva. The saffron flag doesn’t belong to any particular political party,” Rohit said. The flag is called ‘Swarajya Dhwaj’ or self rule flag. The flag not just relates to Shivaji’s fight for self-rule but is also seen as an attempt at soft hindutva by the NCP ahead of the local body polls. Local historians said one of the Maratha Confederacy’s last battles was fought in Kharda against the Nizam, which the Marathas own. “Kharda in Jamkhed taluka has historical importance. So the flag was installed near the Shivpattan fort here ,” Rohit said. During the 2019 polls, Rohit won Karjat Jamkhed assembly constituency by over 43,000 votes defeating BJP’s sitting minister Ram Shinde. “Rohit is now seen as NCP’s youth face. The party is expected to gain from his campaign and Swarajya Dhwaj as every family in the hinterland connects to Swarajya and the saffron flag,” an NCP functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-installing-worlds-tallest-saffron-flag-in-state-ncp-dabbles-in-soft-hindutva/articleshow/87705827.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Local MLA Dilip Bankar raised the issue and sought Pawar’s intervention in the matter after the latter flagged off sugar cane crushing at the Ranwad cooperative sugar factory, which resumed operations after six years, on Sunday. Addressing a gathering at the function, Pawar said there was a need to make by-products to make the sugar factory viable and profitable, Otherwise, farmers incur losses. Pawar said factories should also focus on producing power, ethanol, and hydrogen to make the factory profitable. “If this happens, farmers will get a better price for their produce,” said Pawar. Pawar said that there has been a drop in sugar production in Brazil and Thailand – the largest sugar producing countries in the world – and demand for sugar has increased in the international market. “Hence, there is a scope to export sugar,” he said. Citing the example of Brazil, where Pawar said factories crush 35,000 tonnes of sugarcane a day with just 100 workers, he urged sugar factories to increase production with limited manpower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pawar-for-power-to-farmers-during-daytime/articleshow/87705337.cms||Tushar Pawar

State IMA president Dr Ramkishna Londhe, who was in Chandrapur to take part in a medical conference, on Sunday claimed their delegation is visiting Ahmednagar on Monday and would discuss situation with their local counterparts and decide on going ahead with the indefinite strike. “The woman doctor and three nurses working for the government hospital have been made scapegoats in the case. The fire broke out following short circuit in power supply wire and still women doctor and nurses were booked for causing death by negligence even as it was evident that they have no role in outbreak of fire,” Londhe said. He claimed that a six monthly audit for fire, electrical system and building strength is mandatory for all hospitals. “All the private hospitals compulsorily carry out fire and electrical audit every six months. It is the responsibility of administration to ensure proper fire and electrical audits are carried out in government hospitals. If responsible administrative officers failed to comply with the norm, how come the woman doctor and nurses are responsible for that?” asked Dr Londhe. He claimed that women doctor and nurses are being treated as hardcore criminals and the police have even taken second round of their custody for further interrogation. He maintained that IMA Maharashtra unit stands strongly behind the innocent doctor and nurses, and all 47,000 members of IMA in state would go on indefinite strike with MAGMO and nurses federation crippling the entire health services in state, if charges are not withdrawn against innocent woman doctor and three nurses, he said. He also demanded Rs50 lakh compensation for the family of the final-year medical student killed in the medical college campus in Yavatmal and take security measures to ensure that such incident does not take place in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ima-threatens-indefinite-strike-over-charges-in-ahmednagar-hospital-fire/articleshow/87704772.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Mumbai||Month after he’s out of jail for murder, man held for killing another woman in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Released from prison only last month, a 41-year-old man was arrested late on Saturday in connection with the brutal murder of a homeless woman in Ghatkopar. The accused, Sagar Yadav, had been previously jailed for a similar offence in which he had murdered a woman in Navi Mumbai. On November 2, 52-year-old Shobha Soni had been found bludgeoned to death with a stone in an open space at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar. Her arms, legs and mouth were tightly bound and her clothes were in disroder.A forensic examination did not disclose any sexual assault. Soni’s sister told investigators that the family had severed ties with her as she had married against their wishes. The police said that Soni and her husband were estranged; he is an alcoholic and lives at Kalwa. For some time, Soni worked with an idli vendor but lost her job during the pandemic. She then started to beg to survive and put up near an open-air library at night. The police said they examined dozens of electronic surveillance videos around the crime scene. They found images of the accused arriving at the crime scene, but could not find any of him leaving from there “On the basis of what could be seen in surveillance footage, we made notes on the culprit’s appearance, his gait and hairdo. Based on these leads, we made enquiries in shops around and examined every route that led to the crime scene. The accused had been spotted by people moving around on pavements across the eastern suburbs and also at Mahim and Bandra-Kurla Complex,” said inspector Ghanshyam Nair, crime branch. Police established Yadav’s identity and discovered that he had been jailed from November 2016 to October 2021 for the murder of a woman in Navi Mumbai. On October 7, he had walked out of Taloja prison and started living on the streets of Navi Mumbai. A police team quizzed ragpickers and homeless individuals before zeroing in on Yadav’s location in the Mankhurd-Belapur belt. Late on Saturday, he was picked up from Mankhurd and handed over to officials of Pant Nagar police station where a murder case has been registered against him. Yadav was acquainted with Soni from a decade ago. He has told the police that Soni and her partner had looted him in 2011 and he killed her for revenge. But the police are yet to verify his claim. In an unrelated case in September this year, a 32-year-old woman had been brutally raped and murdered inside a tempo at Sakinaka. The police arrested the accused who was known to her. The chargesheet — filed within 18 days — stated that the accused was “angry” with the victim because she had gone out of the city for a fortnight and this had sparked a fight between the two of them on the fateful day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-month-after-hes-out-of-jail-for-murder-man-held-for-killing-another-woman/articleshow/87705597.cms||Nitasha Natu

The government is using a similar strategy for detecting patients with tuberculosis now. A tuberculosis search campaign will be implemented from November 15 to 25 in Nagpur district. Under this campaign, teams of the health department will visit houses in marked regions of Nagpur district and collect the samples of residents having symptoms of TB from long time. Accordingly, their X-Ray and CB-NAT testing will also be conducted. “Team members will conduct survey of all family-members. Those having cough for more than 2 weeks, fever, experiencing sudden drop in weight etc will be tested for TB,” said district TB officer Dr Mamta Sonsare. In case of diagnosis, free medical treatment will be provided by the local health institutions. All households in rural areas and selected areas in urban areas will be surveyed. Survey team will have two members. It will include Asha Swayamsevak in rural and Arogya Sevak in city areas. The National strategic plan for tuberculosis elimination 2017-2025 aims at eliminating TB in the next 4 years. “Detect – Treat – Prevent – Build” (DTPB) is the formula on which the state health department is working. Hospitals, diagnostic labs and medical stores have been directed to keep the record of TB patients and upload it on the digital platform to ensure the documentation of TB. “Till now, only medical practitioners, hospitals and laboratories were notifying TB patients to government health system. Now, all chemists will also inform about TB patients for whom they have dispensed the TB drugs,” said Dr Sonsare. TB patients are also encouraged to notify themselves. “We are planning to reach out every TB patient so that the incentives and support to patients, families and communities can be properly extended,” Dr Sonsare added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/door-to-door-survey-of-tb-patients-from-today/articleshow/87704775.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

G Baby Shalini of Kanyakumari district had filed the habeas corpus petition seeking a direction to find the whereabouts of her missing husband Duraisingh who is working as a havildar in BSF at Chohtan taluk, Barmer district in Rajasthan. Since he failed to meet her on September 15, the petitioner filed the petition alleging that he is missing. However, Kanyakumari district police, which conducted an inquiry in this regard, submitted that Duraisingh is alive and on duty. Police further submitted that he is also frequently in contact with the petitioner over phone. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that the petitioner had filed the petition with frivolous and false details so as to force her husband to come down to Tamil Nadu, which in the opinion of the court is an abuse of process of law. The judges observed that the petitioner had made imaginary allegations so as to bring her husband from Rajasthan. Such an attempt made by the petitioner by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court has to be curbed and curtailed. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition and imposed a cost of Rs 15,000 on the petitioner payable to high court legal services authority of Madurai bench within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/false-details-hc-asks-woman-to-pay-rs-15k-cost/articleshow/87704774.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Complainant Nitin Barai (59) filed the complaint with the Bandra police on Saturday almost seven years after the deal was signed after the complainant realised that the party with whom he signed the agreement duped him and failed to return the money he invested to get the franchise. Barai’s son Yash (25) who has invested money in the fitness business alleged that they were threatened when they sought their money back. The contract agreement, according to the police probing the case, was signed in 2014 and the payment was done within a month then. However, the complainant did not get any money that he had invested in the business. Based on the complaint, the Bandra police registered the first information report against the director of SFL Fitness, Kashiff Khan, actress Shilpa Shetty, her husband Raj Kundra, Darshit Shah and a few others who were a witness in the contract signed in 2014. A case under the Indian Penal Code Sections, including 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) has been registered against them and the Bandra police are probing the case.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Houses flooded at Vizhinjam||Thiruvananthapuram: Local residents at Kottapuram went through nightmarish experience on Saturday following incessant rain as it caused the Gangayaar canal to overflow and flood houses, shops and landing centres damaging fishing equipment and means of livelihood of the fishermen. Mild tension prevailed in the area as the residents, tired of their constant demand for cleaning of the canal, gathered demanding immediate action. Mayor Arya Rajendran, deputy mayor P K Raju and welfare standing committee chairman H Salim reached the spot and tried to pacify the residents. Following it, officials of the minor Irrigation department and corporation officials deployed earth movers to clean the canal and chunks of plastic waste were scooped up from the canal. Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima said that in June and July, heavy showers led to overflow of the canal and it would flood the auto stand and the locker facility of the department of harbour engineering. “Many fishing boat engines were lost and damaged. Following the flood, many street vendors had lost their means of livelihood. In addition to this, a few houses located on the ‘puramboku’ land were also submerged. The flooding that happened in the last two days was so severe that lakhs worth of fishing equipment have been lost,” said Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima. The work to revamp the canal was tendered and work was awarded recently, however, delay in implementation of the work caused flooding in the area again, Paniyadima said. He also cited the plight of residents of Mariyanagar and Vayalinkara. The septic tanks of houses in these colonies were filled and no action has been taken so far to clear the blocked tanks. The state government had in August approved the tender excess for cleaning and revamp of the canal as a special case. The work was tendered thrice, but no response was received .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/houses-flooded-at-vizhinjam/articleshow/87690412.cms||---

Now these trains will operate with regular numbers with pre-Covid fares. However, even as the mail and express special (MSPC) and holiday special (HSP) ‘special’ tag on almost all the trains have been removed, there is no clarity on various fare concessions to senior citizens, handicapped, disabled, students, etc which were allowed before Covid. Central Railway chief public relations officer (CPRO) Shivaji Sutar said, “As of now, there are no instructions from the Railway Board regarding providing concessions and other benefits, but almost all the trains will charge the fares that used to be applicable pre-Covid period. All the regular time-tabled trains which are presently operating as special trains shall be operated with the regular number and with fare and categorization as applicable.” During the last over one year after Covid, Indian Railways raked in the moolah by charging 20-30% more fare than the normal. It also saved crores by withdrawing various concessions. Of the 206 trains from which the special tag has been removed, more than 24 trains will be to and from Nagpur and several others will be passing through. These include trains like Vidarbha and Sewagram Express to Mumbai and all trains to Pune including Garib Rath and Hamsafar. Sutar said as part of railways’ efforts to normalize passenger services and revert back in a phased manner to the pre-Covid levels of service, the railways’ passenger reservation system (PRS) will be shut down for 6 hours during the lean business hours of the night for next seven days. “This is to enable up-gradation of system data and updating of new train numbers etc. Since a huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all mail and express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours to minimize the impact on ticketing services,” said Sutar. The activity will be performed starting from the intervening night of November 14 and 15 to the night of November 20 and 21 starting at 11.30 pm and ending at 5.30 am. During these 6-hour periods, no PRS services like ticket reservation, current booking, cancellation, inquiry services etc will be available. During the period, railway personnel will ensure advance charting for the trains departing during the affected timings. Except for PRS services, all other inquiry services including 139 services will continue uninterrupted, said railway officials. Basant Shukla, general secretary of registered passengers rail user body Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK), welcomed the decision but said, “It was due to pressure from various organizations the railway ministry had to bow down. But unless all the concessions are not granted there is no meaning in restoring train numbers.” “The railways should also start issuing bedrolls and blankets with caution. If the railways feel offering sops is still pinching, then it should withdraw privilege ticket order (PTOs) and reduce the number of free passes being given to its employees,” said Brij Bhushan Shukla, founder of Rail Yatri Sangh. On Friday, the Indian Railways issued an order to discontinue the ‘special’ tag for mail and express trains and revert to pre-pandemic ticket prices with immediate effect. The board said the second class of such trains shall continue to run as reserved except for any relaxation permitted in a special case. On already booked tickets in advance, no difference of fare either to be collected by the railways or any refund due to already booked passengers shall be permitted. Ever since the Covid lockdown was eased, the Indian Railways has been running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now even short-distance passenger services were being run as special trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/passenger-trains-free-from-covid-tag-fares-to-be-pre-pandemic/articleshow/87704795.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

More than 3,200 people had to be moved to safety in the 24 hours till Sunday morning and as many as 72 huts were damaged, 10 of them fully. The district recorded an average rainfall of 109.53 mm in 24 hours till 8 am. Of the 14 places that recorded more than 100 mm rainfall, three recorded more than 210 mm each. Trains were cancelled either fully, partially or short-terminated at Thiruvananthapuram and Nagercoil. The district administration declared a holiday for schools and colleges on Monday. As many as 3,278 people were evacuated from 65 inundated areas across the district till 9 am on Sunday and shifted to temporary shelters where they were provided food and basic amenities. The rescued people were from 1,004 families which included 1,620 women, 1,063 men and 595 children. The highest number of inundated places was in Agastheeswaram taluk (19). Many places in Thovalai taluk (17) and a few low-lying places in Kalkulam, Vilavancode, Killiyoor and Thiruvattar taluks were inundated. “The biggest challenge was resistance by people from inundated areas as they refused to leave their localities despite water level going up and posing a threat to their lives,” district collector M Arvind told TOI. Heavy duty motors were used to pump out water from Suchindram temple and many other places where the water could not naturally drain. Medical teams were in place to check people in the relief camps for ailments. With rain giving a break from Sunday morning, the water level in Thamiraparani river through Kuzhithurai came down. Perunchani recorded the highest rainfall of 219.4 mm in 24 hours, followed by Puthen dam with 217 mm and Kodayar Lower with 211 mm. By recording an average rainfall of 77.2 mm in 24 hours till Friday morning and 100.48 mm till Saturday morning, the district has recorded an average rainfall of 287.21 mm over a period of 72 hours, making it the heaviest downpour in the southernmost district in more than a decade. In view of the rain, the district collector also announced that the weekly grievances meeting at the collectorate on Monday will be held on Wednesday. Power supply to as many as 83,111 connections was disconnected due to the rains and inundation to avoid accidents such as electrocution. By 6 pm on Sunday connection was restored to 65,709 – that is 79% of the lines that were disconnected over the last three days. The disruption was primarily because of transformers being turned off or damaged by the rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rain-subsides-in-kanyakumari-but-many-areas-still-under-water/articleshow/87704789.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Confidential||Is CM’s trick, a treat? Has chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s outburst against the BJP helped or harmed the saffron party? While the saffron party top brass say the attack successfully projected them as the main opposition in Telangana, the talk in TRS circles is that KCR succeeded in shifting focus away from Eatala’s win in Huzurabad. The spotlight shifted to Bandi Sanjay instead, which TRS doesn’t mind. Let’s see how that affects BJP’s internal dynamics. Trolls say ‘challenge accepted’ Achampet MLA, Guvvala Balaraju of the TRS is a harassed man these days. He is inundated with calls, mainly BJP sympathisers, who are demanding that he keep his word and resign from the assembly. In a war of words, preceding the Huzurabad assembly byelection Balaraju had said he would resign as MLA if the BJP’s Eatala Rajendar won the poll. “I said I would resign if any BJP MLA also would come forward to resign if the TRS candidate won. No one came forward to accept my challenge,” Balaraju told TOI. Meanwhile, the TRS MLA has compiled a list of all the phone calls he had got ‘round-the-clock’ asking him to resign. He will take up the issue both legally and politically. Some callers got abusive and they got it back in kind. “I am an aggressive politician. If someone foul-mouths me, am I expected to suffer what they say?” he asks, obviously rhetorically. Pocket without pennies in Jubilee Hills? The rich and power of Hyderabad are known not to flinch when it comes to showing off their wealth. Or are they? With a new panel taking over the Jubilee Hills International Centre, the pricey club linked to the Jubilee Hills Housing Society, many interesting details about the cash-rich members are spilling out. A little birdie tells us that the club's food sales had increased by 30% recently, not because the membership had increased, but because members were bringing along guests and not paying for them. Members with guests would enter through one gate and exit through another without being noticed. There is only one entry and exit gate now, forcing all to clear their bills. The club has nearly 2,800 permanent members and 1,500 other members all of them influential faces of society. Do they really need to play such cheap tricks? Musical chairs for MLC seat Will someone please make Padi Kaushik Reddy a member of the legislative council (MLC)? Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has made it quite clear she will not consider his name under the quota she controls for reasons best known to her and now there is talk that the TRS government will give him the seat under the MLA quota. Just give him the seat and get it over with once and for all. That way this sad saga will end. So what if he was of no use to TRS on his home turf in Huzurabad! Citizens first for KTR ‘Sunday Funday’ on Tankbund and Charminar has become a huge hit. Though the idea was municipal minister KT Rama Rao’s, he gave credit to common citizens for it, stating that their suggestions through twitter prompted the decision. In a press meet on Saturday, he said the TRS government listens to everybody and respects their proposals. “Similarly, we changed Metro Rail timings recently, based on feedback and suggestions on twitter from commuters. The government resolved many issues after getting feedback on social media,” KTR said. On the criticism of his department, the TRS working president said civic body works are a ‘thankless job’. Though the staff work 365 days a year, if something goes wrong, they face the ire of the people, he said. Tailpiece Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) MD V C Sajjanar sending legal notices to actor Allu Arjun and a bike hailing firm over an advertisement apparently showing the corporation in a bad light has led to Twitterati chuckling. Some of them have pointed out that the bus stop in the ad is Veeravasaram in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district. If anyone should feel upset, it should be the Andhra Pradesh corporation. When an APSRTC bus has been shown in the ad, why would TSRTC get all touchy, they wonder. If the Twitter users are right, it is a question worth asking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-confidential/articleshow/87704785.cms||---

Milind Band, the general manager of NMPML, said the transport utility already had two existing centres and there will be greater demand for passes as more students will be attending classes physically after the improved Covid scenario in the city. “Hence, we are opening two more centres at Panchavati and Nashik Road divisional office buildings of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC),” he said. Currently, the NMPML has two centres at its headquarter along Timbak Road and Tapovan office. NMPML has introduced passes for students and daily commuters. Students would get a 50% concession for 30 days and a 66% concession for 90 days on fixed routes. NMPML rolled out the city bus service on July 8 by deploying 28 buses on nine routes. Now, the transporting wing has rolled out 130 buses on 34 different routes in the city. Bus driver, conductor manhandled Four unidentified people allegedly manhandled a bus driver and conductor of Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (NMPML) bus on Saturday night in the Mhasrul area of the city. NMPML has lodged a complaint with the Panchavati police station and submitted a video in this connection. The incident took place at 8.30 pm on Saturday at Mhasrul when the city bus was coming from Borgad. The four occupants of a car took over the bus and stopped the bus, manhandling the driver and conductor because the driver allegedly swerved the bus near the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmpml-plans-to-reopen-two-more-centres-to-issue-student-bus-passes/articleshow/87705363.cms||Tushar Pawar

Police officers have apprehended the woman and her cousin for the crime. The incident took place between 2pm and 6pm on November 11. The victim, Ravi, lived with family in southwest Delhi’s Gopal Nagar, located near Dwarka. He reported the theft of cash and jewellery from his house, after which an FIR was registered at Baba Haridas Nagar police station and a team formed to crack the case. During investigation, officers scanned footage of CCTV camera in the vicinity of the house for clues and also mounted technical surveillance.

He was tracked down through various cameras on the route and it was found that he had taken an auto from Najafgarh towards Dwarka mor,” DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said. The auto driver was subsequently traced and interrogated. He gave some leads. Meanwhile, technical surveillance and analysis of call detail records of the suspects revealed that the complainant’s wife was in touch with the suspect seen in the footage. The complainant also identified him as a relative of his wife. She was questioned as well, during which she allegedly confessed to the crime. The woman told cops that she was not happy with her husband and in order to teach him a lesson, she hatched this plan along with her cousin, Giriraj Sharma. She called him on the day of incident and told him the timing when there would be no one present at home and also the location of all valuables. Sharma then executed the burglary a day before Diwali. Sharma is a resident of Dausa, Rajasthan. Police have recovered Rs 78,300 in cash apart from gold jewellery from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-organises-burglary-at-home-to-teach-husband-a-lesson-arrested/articleshow/87704811.cms||---

A decision was taken at the southern zonal council meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah at Tirupati on Sunday. Stating that the state government will abide by the allocation made by Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-II), the team-Telangana comprising Home Minister Mahmood Ali, chief secretary Somesh Kumar among others said Karnataka should have no concern as the two projects were taken up with its share of Krishna river waters. It was decided to have a joint inspection to resolve the issue of submergence of lands in Karnataka due to construction of Rajiv Gandhi Sangambanda barrage by Telangana. On the claims by Andhra Pradesh government that the power utilities of Telangana owe Rs 6,015 crore towards the cost of power supplied by AP after the state bifurcation, the team-Telangana said after settling off the power purchase dues payable to APGENCO, it is Telangana state which has to get Rs 4457 crore from AP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-will-give-project-reports-to-krmb/articleshow/87704798.cms||Roushan Ali

In a letter sent to the union minister Tharoor said this highway is of critical importance as it offers vital connectivity towards its southern parts of the district and to Tamil Nadu. Though the state government has previously carried out two stages of widening from Karamana to Balaramapuram and have proposed one till Vazhimukku, the aforementioned road is still under the administration of the NHAI and this has led to a situation where the maintenance of the remaining part of the road from Vazhimukku has been severely affected. Following discussions between the state public works department and the NHAI, it has been proposed that the remaining stretch will be handed over to the state government with a one-time maintenance scheme support from the NHAI. While an estimate of Rs 23.48 crores for the expenditure that would be required for the maintenance and upkeep of the road has already been submitted, the funding is yet to be sanctioned. As a result of this delay, the maintenance, including aspects such as road resurfacing, has been adversely affected, which has, in turn, caused considerable distress for the people, said Tharoor in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tharoor-seeks-centres-help-on-nh-upkeep/articleshow/87690444.cms||---

Disaster management minister K K S S R Ramachandran, who visited the affected areas, told reporters that the government machinery will take stock of the damages caused once the water drains. Damage to crops and public property such as roads, tanks and to individual houses, cattle or other belongings will be ascertained. “We will complete the assessment in two days after rain stops and submit a detailed report to the CM,” the minister said. Ramachandran attributed conversion of paddy fields to residential plots as the main reason for the inundation of residential areas. “You have built houses in the tanks and on agricultural lands,” he said when asked if the water stagnation was due to delay in desilting waterbodies. The minister said steps will be taken to desilt, repair and remove encroachments from rivers, tanks and channels. He said that water level has gone down at many places, exposing badly damaged roads that need to be re-laid. The immediate focus of the government is to rescue people from inundated areas and provide them with essential supplies. Nearly Rs 200 crore sanctioned for the district after the previous floods two months ago is being utilized through various departments, he added. Rural development minister K R Periakaruppan said the government cannot take responsibility for encroachments on waterbodies that happened in the last 10 years, but will fight against them legally. IT minister T Mano Thangaraj and monitoring officer for the district N Jothi Nirmalasamy were also present. DGP C Sylendra Babu visited affected places and appreciated police personnel who were engaged in rescue operations. PMK founder S Ramadoss, while pressing for removal of encroachments from waterbodies, appealed to the government to expedite repair and rehabilitation works.

---||Mumbai||Western Railway could soon have 20 AC local services a day||MUMBAI: In a bid to make AC local trains seem ‘cooler’ and more accessible to citizens, the Western Railway plans to increase the number of services, as well as improve the fare structure for single-journey tickets. Nearly four years after it first introduced air-conditioned local trains on December 25, 2017, WR now plans to add eight more AC services, bringing the total up to 20 services per day. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 20,000 passengers availed of the 12 AC services that ran each day. Eight new services are now proposed on the corridor between Churchgate-Virar, with some services originating and terminating at Goregaon, Borivli and Nalasopara. The Mumbai division has already sent the proposal to WR head quarters for approval. A senior WR official said, “Of the eight services planned to be introduced, one each will be during the morning and evening peak hours.” Of the 8 services planned, one pair will be between Churchgate-Goregaon-Churchgate, two pairs between Churchgate-Borivli-Churchgate, and one service each will run from Virar to Churchgate (in the morning peak hour) and from Churchgate to Nalasopara (in the evening peak hour). The decision to introduce more AC trains was made with the hope that additional trains, especially during the peak hour, will encourage more passengers to opt for AC locals. Even though WR has a fleet of six AC rakes, it runs only 12 services with two rakes. Railway ministry has also become proactive in promoting AC trains. It has already decided that all future trains to be procured will be fully air-conditioned. Besides, it has also decided to introduce a Metro-like fare structure for single-journey tickets. WR is also planning to allow second-class and first-class ticket -holders to travel by AC train by paying excess fare to on-board ticket examiners. In a public survey undertaken recently on fares, nearly 52% of the 35,685 respondents wanted fares to be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-could-soon-have-20-ac-local-services-a-day/articleshow/87705609.cms||Manthank Mehta

The two injured— Sanjay Sonurlekar and his son Sahil, residents of New wada, Ona village in Bicholim, were rushed to the community health centre in Bicholim where they were undergoing treatment. Their house was also damaged. In Aldona, the pandal erected for the confirmation service collapsed just before the service could commence. No casualties were reported. Power supply was also affected for sometime. The 110kV line to Kadamba sub-station was affected disrupting power to Panaji and nearby areas. The supply was restored later. Fire and emergency services department said that there were reports of tree falls in Canacona and Majorda. The India meteorological department (IMD) said that the rain spell was due to two weather circulations that are bringing moisture incursion to the Goa coast. IMD said the reason for the mid-November rainfall was the circulation near south interior Karnataka and north Tamil Nadu which is a remnant of the depression that crossed over to the Tamil Nadu coast on November 11. Also, the circulation over the south east Arabian Sea is also bringing easterly winds over Goa resulting in the rainfall. Sakhali, Old Goa, Bambolim, Panaji and Aldona are among the areas that reported rainfall on Sunday. The day time temperature was rising for the past two days with the maximum temperature of 34.6 degrees C being recorded on Sunday. The rainfall activity is likely to increase in the week and could even result in heavy rainfall of 6.4cm of rain in 24 hours, the IMD said. In addition to this, a new low pressure area is likely to form by November 17 which is being observed by the IMD. Fishermen warnings have been issued for the Goa-Maharashtra coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-injured-by-lightning-as-goa-receives-thundershowers/articleshow/87704914.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Arora has taken possession of the 4,000-sq-ft flat. On November 2, the actor filed a withdrawal application with MahaRERA, stating she and the promoters had amicably settled the dispute. Arora had booked the Rs 14.5 crore flat in the ‘81 Aureate’ high-rise project in Bandra (West) in February 2017. The project is the free-sale component in a slum rehabilitation project promoted by Pyramid Developers and Ultra Lifespaces (formerly known as Satra Buildcon). Pyramid Developers had earlier run into trouble with the authorities. Arora said she had already paid around Rs 13 crore. In her complaint in October 2020, Arora alleged the promoters had committed to handing over possession of the flat on or before December 31, 2017, with a maximum grace period of six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malaika-amicably-settles-row-over-rs-14-5cr-flat-delay/articleshow/87705850.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad schools grapple with learning loss issues due to pandemic||AHMEDABAD: The ministry of education, government of India, has recently started a countrywide survey to assess learning loss among schoolchildren amid Covid-19 pandemic. In Gujarat while the state education department is planning to start a survey to evaluate the learning loss and find out measures to overcome these challenges, several schools are grappling with the issue where the writing skills of students have deteriorated and academic performance dipped immensely in the last 18 months. From issues in reading and writing skills to lack of confidence and poor show in pen-and-paper exams, the impact of disruptions in education caused by the pandemic is seen in some of the leading schools of the city. “Learning loss is a reality and there is a need to assess it. Having said this, we must also realize that learning loss is not permanent and can be worked upon. We plan to start bridge courses to reduce the learning loss. We need to identify the areas where they have fallen weak and find solutions. Once the in-person classrooms start normally we will begin work in this direction,” said Vinod Rao, Gujarat education secretary. Schools after shuttering down for a long time due to Covid-19 started reopening for the new academic year from July in a staggered manner. Most of these schools had switched to online education which still continues as government has allowed re-opening with limited student capacity. Also, parents are not willing to send their wards to school citing the risk of infection to children. Most self-financed schools in Ahmedabad are witnessing 25% attendance or even less. One of the indicators for the learning loss lie in the results of recent class tests held in pen-and-paper (offline) mode for Std 9-12 students. “In the recent exams held for Class 9 to Class 12 students, 50% students have shown significant decline in the offline test as compared to online exams held earlier. We have asked parents of such students to send their wards to schools so we can take special care to improve their learning,” said Fr Xavier Amalraj, principal of St Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall. He said that there has been lack of self-confidence and issues in written skills due to online education that has been going on for a long time now. Also, students are under mental stress due to online education. Many students who managed to get a perfect ten in the online exams held in last one and half years are seen struggling to even clear the unit test held in offline mode. C N Vidyalaya principal Hitesh Trivedi said that students of Class 9 are struggling to recite one-page from the textbooks. Students find it tough to sit for longer hours in school, he said. “Only those students whose parents have taken active interest in their studies have fared well in the written exams. The presentation skills of students have been negatively impacted. There is a 40% difference in the performance of students when the recent offline exam results are compared with online test results. All these issues can only be addressed once the schools start functioning normally,” according to Trivedi. According to Manan Chowksi, president of Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association and trustee of Udgam school, many meritorious students in Class 11 science have failed or scored below average. “We are yet to find out ways to overcome learning loss. Any remedial action is difficult at this stage for we are yet to determine areas where they have fallen behind,” said Chowksi. Indrani Banerjee, principal, H B Kapadia New High School, said that the confidence level of students has gone down. “This is reflected in their handwritings and presentation work,” according to Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-schools-grapple-with-learning-loss-issues-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/87704307.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Madurai||Madurai: Stagnant rainwater troubles vendors, customers in Mattuthavani market||MADURAI: The stagnating rainwater in some areas at Mattuthavani Central Vegetable Market is troubling customers and vendors alike besides helping mosquitos breed, said the vendors at the market. The Mattuthavani Central Vegetable Market sees hundreds of customers and vendors gather every day. Due to the recent rain in the district, rainwater has remained stagnant in the areas between some platforms. “Water keeps getting stagnant as and when it rains. Even after days, the water doesn’t get dried up and corporation workers are not doing anything. Vendors like us are forced to set up shop next to it. Customers don’t even want to buy from us as the water remains in such an unhygienic manner. It is repulsive to us too,” said N Shanthi, a vegetable vendor. Vendors said that it is also leading to breeding of mosquitoes. “With dengue cases being reported in Madurai, we are worried as stagnant water can easily become a ground for breeding dengue-causing mosquitoes. Not just mosquitoes, other insects are also attracted to the water making it difficult for us to be so close to it with our vegetables. But still we have no choice,” said M Mayee, another vendor. It was also alleged that the corporation workers did not come regularly to collect the wet vegetable waste from the market but only once in a few days and are also not collecting it from all interior areas of the market. Further, due to rain, the path to the public restroom used by vendors has also turned muddy and slippery with stagnant water. Madurai City Corporation commissioner KP Karthikeyan, meanwhile, said that separate teams are in place for cleaning the Central Vegetable Market and they will appropriately take measures to resolve any issue if complaints are raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stagnant-rainwater-troubles-vendors-customers-in-mattuthavani-market/articleshow/87704816.cms||---

Dhami has been selected as a standby player among the 20 players selected for this month’s Junior Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar. Eighteen players are part of the final squad while two players, including Dhami, are selected as standby, but will be with the team for the entire duration of the junior WC in Bhubaneswar. Though many hockey players from the state have represented the country, all of them were from the timewhen Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh. Notably, no male international hockey player has ever come from the Pithoragarh district until Dhami. Coming from the Katiyani village which lies on the outskirts of Pithoragarh district, Dhami had been on the radar of the national selectors for a while now after he won gold in the U-17 Nehru Cup tournament and a bronze medal at the junior nationals representing Haryana. Coming from a humble family, Dhami was brought to Tanakpur by his hockey enthusiast uncle Prakash Singh in order to avail better hockey facilities. Later, Dhami was enrolled at Doon’s Maharana Pratap Sports College in order to avail good coaching and better facilities. “Financially, we were not strong and therefore, we had to send Bobby to the Doon sports college where facilities are for free and an athlete gets a complete diet. My lifetime dream is finally achieved after my nephew has been selected for the WC,” said a jubilant Singh. The 20-year-old forward was sent to SAI Sonepat in 2018 for advanced training. There, he went on to represent Haryana in age group teams. Recently, Dhami has been selected for a job in the Indian Air Force under sports quota and will officially join after the World Cup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-its-1st-ever-mens-player-selected-in-wc-bound-national-hockey-team-in-21-years/articleshow/87704314.cms||Mohammad Anab

At least the panchayat should give us some relief,” one stakeholder said. Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes said he would look into the feasibility of the proposal. Gram sabha attendees also called for police to act against nuisance makers on the beach. Many tourists take liquor bottles to the beach and dump the empty bottles there, especially at night. The broken bottles then pose a danger to others, they pointed out. Villagers also said touts and pimps continue to be active on the beachfront, despite the presence of the tourist security force. Stakeholders also pointed out that 99% of the tourists visiting Candolim are moving around without masks, but none are being fined. The sarpanch said he would write to the police to take action. A number of other issues, including haphazard parking of vehicles on the roads and large resorts bringing in outside vehicles, thereby depriving local taxi owners of business, were also raised at the meeting.

The police identified the accused as Rahul of Memala near Vithura. The police said that the alleged fraud was reported at Vithura Fuels located at Chennanpara between March, 2020 and July, 2021.

---||Madurai||Diabetes cases likely to go up further in Tamil Nadu, say docs||MADURAI: Diabetologists have highlighted that cases of diabetes are increasing every year and with the impact of Covid-19, the disease burden can increase especially among the young population. “As per the data from the the National Family Health Survey, two decades back the prevalence of diabetes in adult population was around 3 per cent in rural areas and 5-6 per cent in urban areas in Tamil Nadu. However, it has now risen to 8 per cent in rural areas and 12-14 per cent in urban areas. The numbers are expected to increase further, especially as obesity is now on the rise among adolescent children,” said Dr Subbiah Eagappan, head, department of diabetology, Government Rajaji Hospital. He added that due to the lockdown, adolescent children are more prone to obesity and girls and women are at more risk. At Government Rajaji Hospital, an awareness programme was organized on Saturday with doctors addressing on diabetes, in which Tamil orator G Gnanasambandam delivered a special address. Dr AJ Asirvatham, chairman of Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India, said that the pandemic has made it difficult for patients to go for check up and hence it is difficult to spot and monitor diabetic patients. “Further, Covid-19 can predispose patients to diabetes. It can push pre-diabetic patients to diabetic status. The causes are mainly stress and use of steroids in treatment of Covid-19. The recovery period is six weeks. If a person shows no high blood sugar in that period after getting Covid-19, it is unlikely they’ll develop diabetes,” he said. At the same time, SARS nCoV-2 virus can damage pancreatic cells as well which can lead to diabetes but it is reported in only around 1 per cent of cases. “At GRH alone, we had a couple of cases wherein pancreatic cells were damaged. Covid-19 unmasks diabetes and it has been seen that around 36 per cent of Covid-19 patients are newly diagnosed with diabetes. Even if these patients didn’t get Covid-19, they’ll still be diabetic later in a few years,” said Dr Subbiah Eagappan. Dr CR Magesh Babu, senior consultant at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre said that people who have a family history of type 2 diabetes should go for screening test once they cross the age of 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/diabetes-cases-likely-to-go-up-further-in-tn-say-docs/articleshow/87704831.cms||---

Police said the accused was arrested by a woman cop along with other team members. Police identified the accused as Arman. He fired three shots at the cops with his pistol and in self-defence, the woman cop and another constable also fired at him, due to which he received an injury on his left leg. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Shankar Chaudhary said that on Saturday, woman sub-inspector Saroj was deployed as a decoy target in plainclothes wearing a gold chain to lure the potential snatchers at an isolated stretch between Sector-13 Dwarka Metro station and Vegas Mall, Sector-14. “Other team members, also in plainclothes, were deployed in close vicinity to keep a watch on any suspicious movement. Around 8.40pm, one person on a black motorcycle reached near her and tried to snatch her gold chain,” DCP Dwarka said. However, she put up a resistance and the team present nearby quickly surrounded the accused and asked him to surrender. However, he tried to escape, but his motorcycle skidded and fell on the road. “Not giving up, he took out a pistol and threatened to fire, and tried to flee. Saroj and constable Sandeep chased him, after which he turned back and fired three rounds at them,” the officer said. One of the rounds got stuck into the bulletproof jacket worn by Sandeep. “Saroj and Sandeep fired one each round in self-defence. One bullet hit the left knee of the accused. He fell at the spot and was overpowered by the team,” the officer said. A PCR call was made on 112 and the injured accused was rushed to a hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-with-25-criminal-cases-hurt-in-exchange-of-fire-with-police/articleshow/87704834.cms||---

Sources said the Covid-pandemic and rains impacted the pace of work, but now there is significant progress. “We are confident of the stretch getting ready and the next Republic Day celebration will be on the revamped stretch. There is additional deployment of workers and the pace of progress is much better,” said an official. The CPWD had awarded the project to construction major Shapoorji Pallonji last year and had set a 300 days’ deadline for completion. The tender condition had a provision that the senior engineer concerned dealing with the project could extend the timeline taking into consideration the situation. Officials said the long spell of rains till last month somehwat disrupted the timetable. The revamped 3-km-long stretch between Rashtrapati Bhavan and India Gate will have huge refurbished lawns, redeveloped canals and designated walkway throughout the lawns and along the canals. The stretch will have roadside furniture such as proper seating and also public conveniences. Moreover, there will be proper parking facilities and designated space for vendors.

The germplasm conservation centre – built by the research wing of the forest department over three years using compensatory afforestation (CAMPA) funds - displays scientific, ecological, medicinal and cultural information related to all 90 grass species. Officials involved said some of the grass species housed at the centre, which is divided into seven segments, play a key role in controlling forest fires while others are good at averting human-wildlife incidents through their pungent grass-blade smell. The conservatory, which has segmented grass species into aromatic, medicinal, fodder, ornamental, religiously- important, agricultural and miscellaneous, aims to recognize the role of various types of grasslands in the ecosystem and promote threatened species. Authorities said carbon sequestration, the process of vegetation capturing and storing atmospheric carbon, has gone down due to urbanization, deforestation and intensive mining. Chief conservator of forests (research wing) Sanjiv Chaturvedi, whose idea it was to build the conservatory, told TOI, “Grasslands hold more than a third of the world’s land-based carbon. Most of that carbon is not touched by wildfires, which typically just burn through above-ground vegetation. In fact, fires can even promote the growth of grasslands and even help them store carbon more efficiently. In forests, severe wildfires release large quantities of carbon into the air and it can take trees decades to recover from that. Certain species of grass stop wildfires.” The conservatory houses the fire-resistant “Thysanolaena maxima” species, also known as tiger grass or broom grass. “Found along steep hills, ravines and sandy river banks up to an altitude of 2,000 metres in Uttarakhand, its dry flowering stocks are used as brooms by locals and the green portion, which grows round the year, as fodder. The perennial species also prevents erosion on steep slopes and is planted to revive barren lands. This grass is widely being planted across Nepal for slope stabilization and soil moisture retention,” Chaturvedi added. The scientist in-charge of the Doon office of the Botanical Survey of India, SK Singh, lauded the initiative. “Some species of grass, which serve as fodder for livestock, as well as some bamboo species that have multifarious utility, do require germplasm conservation,” he told TOI. Notably, the fragmentation of grasslands in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the population of the Great Indian Bustard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-develops-indias-1st-grass-conservatory-at-ranikhet-with-90-species/articleshow/87704347.cms||Shivani Azad

The highest rainfall in the state was recorded in Ernakulam with Cochin airport area and North Paravur receiving 19cm rainfall. Aluva followed close behind with 15cm while Konni in Pathanamthitta and West Kallada in Kollam recorded 14cm of rainfall each. The IMD had issued a red alert on Sunday for Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur districts. A very heavy rainfall warning has been sounded for six districts on Monday---Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod. “The two main systems bringing rainfall to Kerala region are a cyclonic circulation over Southeast Arabian sea extending up to 3.1km above mean sea level and a trough that runs from the cyclonic circulation to southwest Bay of Bengal across north Kerala up to the same level,” said P S Biju, scientist, India Meteorological Department, Thiruvananthapuram. Thunderstorms with lightning accompanied by gusty wind speed reaching 30-40kmph are very likely at one or two places over Kerala on Monday. Fishermen have been advised not to go to sea as strong wind with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60kmph is likely to prevail over southeast and east-central Arabian Sea. Two other systems are also approaching the peninsular region, one on the east coast, as a low-pressure area lies over central parts of Andaman Sea. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over west-central Bay of Bengal by November 17. On the west coast, a fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over east central Arabian Sea off south Maharashtra-Goa coasts around the same time. The Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) has asked district administrations to shift people living in landslide and flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places or relief camps as there is a possibility of widespread rains in the coming days. The southern railway informed that due to the landslip between Kuliturai and Eraniel railway stations in Nagercoil-Thiruvananthapuram sections, train services along the route have been totally cancelled or partially cancelled. It said that the restoration work at the landslip spot is in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rains-to-continue-for-next-few-days/articleshow/87704345.cms||---

The meeting directed the district collectors to decide whether the schools should be allowed to function in those districts where a red alert has been sounded. At present, a red alert has been declared in Ernakulam, Thrissur and Idukki. Idukki and Kakki dams have been opened. The irrigation and power departments have been asked to closely monitor water levels in all the dams. Currently, four teams of national disaster response teams are camping in various places. Four more teams will be reaching the state on Monday. Two teams of defence security corps are ready in Kannur and Wayanad. They will be deployed to districts in an emergency. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) representatives who participated in the meeting said heavy rains were likely to continue for the next three days and rains were caused due to westerly winds. All the districts have been asked to follow the instructions and take necessary actions as laid out in the orange book. So far, seven landslides have been reported in the state after November 10. However, no casualties have been reported. The meeting also asked the district collectors to evacuate people from landslide-prone areas to relief camps and safer locations. Financial relief to the eligible should be disbursed at the earliest, the chief minister instructed. In addition to the chief minister, the meeting was attended by local self-government minister M V Govindan, devaswom and SC/ST welfare minister K Radhakrishnan, water resources minister Roshy Augustine, power minister K Krishnankutty, chief secretary V P Joy, additional chief secretaries of revenue and LSG departments, state police chief Anil Kant, disaster management commissioner A Kowsigan, representatives of IMD, Navy, fire force and other stakeholder departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-holds-high-level-review-meet/articleshow/87704363.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Youth need awareness on reproductive health: Experts||HYDERABAD: Although Telangana sees 23.5% of women get married before the age of 18, with most child marriages taking place in parts of Hyderabad and districts, experts say that there is a need to spread awareness on reproductive health among the youth and adolescents. Speaking at the launch of ‘Momentum Country and Global Leadership: India-Yash’, an initiative to engage adolescents and youth in taking decisions with respect to their reproductive health and well-being, experts pointed out the need to increase awareness about family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH). The initiative was launched by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “Through this four-year project, India-Yash will focus on family planning and reproductive health for those in the age group of 10 to 29 years and leave behind scalable and sustainable models for young people to take charge of their sexual and reproductive well-being,” said Dr Koki Agarwal, director, Momentum Country and Global leadership. One of the key highlights of the initiative which sets it apart from many others is that it includes the much neglected 10 to 15-year- olds in the dialogue on sexual and reproductive health, who are often left behind. It will be done by involving youngsters in identifying problems specific to these age groups and designing solutions for the same. “The project will support the FP/RH needs of India’s marginalized youth in urban and rural areas of Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in the first phase and later on it will be replicated in other parts of the country,” said Sangita Patel, director, health office, USAID/India, adding that although Telangana is better placed than many other states, more awareness is needed. To include the youngsters in the dialogue, an innovation challenge will be held to invite ideas, hand-hold them and provide incubation support to help them turn into scalable models. “With this we will bring about a shift in power dynamics from health market players to clients (young people) and support an enabling environment for adolescent and youth-friendly health services,” said Dr Somesh Kumar, country director, Jhpiego India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-need-awareness-on-reproductive-health/articleshow/87704874.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Opening of flyover likely to get delayed||Vijayawada: Commuters may have to cope with the traffic problems on Ramavarappadu ring road for a few more days as the opening of Benz circle flyover is likely to delay. The project which was slated for inauguration on Sunday got delayed in view of the busy schedule of Union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari. Travelling on NH-16 from Benz circle to Ramavarappadu is the toughest task for the denizens. The five-km ride usually takes around 35 minutes and minor road mishaps are prevalent on this stretch. People had been demanding a flyover for the last two decades and the Union government approved the proposal in 2016. Construction of the first flyover took around 2 years and traffic problems reduced significantly after it became functional in 2020. Traffic towards Chennai is easily passing through the Benz circle junction in five minutes while traffic towards Kolkata is taking around 30 minutes in peak hours. The agency finished the works of the second flyover in a record time of one year and completed load testing. Officials launched the trial run on November 6, 2021 and are waiting for the road transport minister’s appointment for inauguration. “City police are permitting vehicles for a limited time in the name of trial run. We are still facing traffic problems though works have been completed ahead of the deadline. NHAI should inaugurate the flyover soon,” Md Naggor, a techie, said. Meanwhile, NHAI authorities said they are waiting for a convenient date for both chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Union minister Gadkari to inaugurate the flyover virtually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/opening-of-flyover-likely-to-get-delayed/articleshow/87704361.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Child dies after falling into canal||THRISSUR: A three-year-old boy lost his life after he fell into a canal in Kottanellur in Mukundapural taluk on Sunday. The boy, identified as Arrow Heaven, ran away from his mother while she was taking him for a bath and accidentally fell into a canal. Police said though the mother jumped into the canal she was not able to rescue the child as he was swept away in the strong currents of the canal flowing in full spate in the wake of the heavy rains in the region. Police and fire-brigade personnel launched a joint search operation for the boy but they were able to retrieve the body only by the evening and it was later shifted to the General Hospital in Irinjalakuda. Meanwhile, the sluice gate of Poringalkuthu Dam was reopened following rise in the water level in the reservoir. A KSEB official in charge of the dam said the dam was opened after the water level in the reservoir rose above 420 meters. The release of about 3000 cusecs of water from Parambikkulam was a major reason for the rise in the water level in Poringalkuthu Dam. However, the water level showed signs of receding after the rain abated over the day. Water level in the Chalakudy River rise to 3m following the opening of the sluice gate of the PoringalkuthuDdam. However, the authorities said there was no need for panic as the water level in the river is well below the danger mark. Shutters of the Peechi dam have also been raised further, following the rise in the water level in the reservoir. Several low-lying areas near Kodungallur were flooded in the incessant rains that lashed the district, where a red alert has been issued on Sunday afternoon. Relief camps have been opened at Athirappilli, Pariyaram and Edavilangu, and altogether 64 people have been shifted from the area. Visitors have been banned in the beaches and night travel has been banned in the hill ranges, official sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/child-dies-after-falling-into-canal/articleshow/87704370.cms||---

---||Delhi||Doctor who? Recognition for man who helped Delhi breathe easier||NEW DELHI: An ace clinician, mentor to hundreds of top doctors, trendsetter and researcher whose pathbreaking study gave Delhi a chance at fighting pollution, Dr Jitendra Nath Pande was all these and more. The pulmonologist succumbed to Covid-19 in May 2020 but he was remembered with gratitude when being conferred the Padma Shri last week. “I will never forget a call I received as a teenager one evening from the then prime minister's secretary, letting me know that the PM was on his way to see his wife, hospitalised with a mild illness in my father's ward at AIIMS,” recalled his son, Aman Pande, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, US. “My dad, who had poured himself his evening's whiskey, calmly took the phone and informed the caller that his senior resident would be happy to update the PM.” What most doctors who have known Pande remember is how he provided the same treatment and care to the poorest of the poor and the highest of the high. “He treated princes and presidents with the same empathy that he showed the poor,” Aman told TOI. “He was known for seeing the crowds of patients at the clinic strictly in the order they arrived. He almost took pleasure in telling those who tried to jump citing their status to get to the end of the line.” Born in UP’s Shikohabad in 1941, Pande did his MBBS and MD from AIIMS, specialising in pulmonary medicine. At 48, he was one of the youngest to be appointed a professor of medicine. He served as head of the department of medicine at AIIMS from 1993 until his retirement in 2003. He also served as an expert on several government bodies, including the Indian Council of Medical Research, and was actively involved in the investigation of the Bhopal gas tragedy. After his retirement, he continued to practice pulmonary medicine as a consultant at Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research. The capital city will have Pande to thank for finding the correlation between air pollution and emergency room visits by people. “The study that established this was his brainchild. It found a 20-25% rise in emergency visits with acute asthma, chronic inflammatory lung disease and heart attacks with increased levels of air pollution in the previous 48 hours,” said Dr G C Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, and member of the study team. The Supreme Court took cognisance of this study in its 1998 order banning diesel buses from the streets of Delhi and replacing them with CNG vehicles and packing off small-scale industries from residential areas. Before things again took a turn for the worse, Pande’s research gave Delhi a chance to curb pollution. Khilnani says Pande took respiratory medicine to the next level in India. “He performed the first fibre-optic bronchoscopy in India,” the doctor revealed. Pande also established the country’s first medical intensive care unit at AIIMS in 1993. Dedicated as he was to medicine, Pande enjoyed teaching even more. “He would happily take the ‘introduction to medicine’ class for third-semester students,” said Khilnani. Among Pande’s many students is Dr Anoop Misra, executive chairman, Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences. Misra recollected Pande excelling in everything he did, even repairing medical gadgets. Remembering the pulmonologist’s brilliance in clinical diagnosis, Misra said, “He had an extra-clinical sense and made quick diagnoses and was always bang on.” Pande’s students now practise across the globe. “He was instrumental in helping us establish pulmonary medicine in Nepal,” wrote Dr Narendra Bhatta, head of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. Some of Pande’s students and acquaintances feel the Padma Shri is “too little, too late” for such a legend but most have welcomed the government’s move. “He is the most suited for this award and I am really overwhelmed that the government has recognised his contribution to the field of medical education and healthcare,” says Khilnani. He will be remembered for being extraordinarily honest to the profession and for never giving in to any pressure, political or whatsoever, says Misra. “This is what Pande taught us, and this is the legacy we carry forward,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctor-who-recognition-for-man-who-helped-delhi-breathe-easier/articleshow/87704875.cms||Yudhajit Shankar Das

The fact came to light when the police verified the content on the mobile phones of the accused. The phones used by the accused cost atleast Rs 60,000. “In the phones of these accused, we found photos of them using high-end cars and bikes,” sources in Mancherial police told TOI. The accused Robin Khan, Sahib and Harish are from Nuh district and Ejaj Ahmed Khan is a resident of Palwal in Haryana. The accused used to earlier steal tyres from vehicles parked on highways. Later, with the help of some of their villagers, they learnt the various methods of stealing cash from ATM machines including cutting the ATM cash chest with a gas cutter. “So far, we have seized 60 ATM cards from the possession of the accused. The accused claimed that in their village, ATM cards are given on rent by many people on a commission of Rs 1,000 per card. When we verified the bank transactions, we learnt that there were lakhs of rupees in each account,” police said. In Mancherial, the accused were arrested for breaking open the ATM of a public sector bank with a key they had bought from abroad. The key helps access a button through which one can turn the ATM machine on and off. The accused would turn the machine off when the mouth of the cash dispenser is open and just before the ATM machine dispenses the cash and the cash-dispensing sound. Using fingers, they would pull the cash out and lodge a complaint with the call center claiming that a sum of money from their bank account has been deducted but they did not get the money and successfully received the reimbursement. A suspect sheet was opened against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/atm-heist-accused-own-high-end-cars-and-bikes/articleshow/87704881.cms||Srinath Vudali

Of this, nearly Rs 18 crore was collected as fines from the suburban section of the CR which extends from CSMT to Panvel/Karjat/Kasara/Khopoli.This is the recovery of fines between April 1 and November 6, said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar.  “We had conducted several checks, including fortress checks at railway stations, to ensure that those not authorised to travel during the lockdown and even after that were caught by our ticket checkers and imposed with hefty fines,” Sutar said. When the Railways allowed the general public -- with double vaccination and having completed 14 days after the second dose -- to travel from August 15, the CR conducted a series of drives to nab those who were not double vaccinated but still travelling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cr-collects-over-rs-100cr-fines-from-ticketless-travellers-in-7-months/articleshow/87705621.cms||Somit Sen

Out of 15 puppies, four puppies were adopted by the visitors. All Animals Foundation, an NGO, organised the programme to promote adoption of stray puppies for the first time at the park. “We often found that most of the puppies would roam on the roads and die after coming under the wheels of vehicles. To protect them and to promote the adoption of stray dogs, we have decided to give puppies to people who are interested in adopting them,” Santosh Reddy, one of the organisers, told TOI. The organisers said that most people prefer different dog breeds and spend lakhs of rupees to get them, but animal lovers who cannot afford to spend too much money to buy dogs can adopt these puppies for free. “We have nearly 1,500 fosters in the city who pick these puppies from the roads and hand them over to us. We vaccinate these puppies soon after they are taken from the fosters to protect them from diseases. We accept only puppies that are 30 days old,” said Reddy. Though the puppies are given free of cost, Rs 350 is collected towards the cost of the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stray-puppies-find-home-in-adoption-drive-at-kbr-park/articleshow/87704892.cms||---

The complainant, GR Ramachander, is posted with 66 Medium Regiment. The complainant, along with his wife and friends, had visited a pub on November 6 near Madhapur Metro Station. “While entering the pub, I handed over my car to driver Rajesh at valet parking. At that time my wife had kept her belongings including her mangalsutra and Rs 1,000 cash inside a bag in the rear seat of the car. On November 7, valet parking driver Naveen brought the car when we came out of the pub and we went to a friend’s office in Prashasan Nagar. There, my wife noticed the items were missing,” the complainant told police on November 11. A case was registered under Section 379 of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mangalsutra-stolen-from-pub-parking/articleshow/87704889.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Shatabdi fare to drop by Rs 90||Chandigarh: With reduction of Covid-19 cases across the country and pressure from passengers over the hike in fares, the railways has decided to discontinue the ‘special’ tag and restore operations of all Shatabdis, mail and express trains to their earlier schedule and revert to pre-pandemic ticket prices with immediate effect. The railway board announced trains will now be operated with their regular numbers and fares will revert to normal pre-Covid prices. As per this railway ministry decision, fares of Shatabdi, mail and express trains will be restored within this week as per the software upgradation, said Ambala divisional railway manager Gurinder Mohan Singh. The train fare for Chandigarh Shatabdi Express under special category is Rs 670 (under flexi fare) per passenger, which after removal of the special tag, will come down to Rs 580 per ticket. For train from Chandigarh to Amritsar, the fare existing during the special category is Rs 480 in AC chair car. It will come down to Rs 430 per ticket. An official statement read that Covid-19 restrictions, which were imposed during the pandemic, will continue. Curbs such as temporary restrictions on concessions, bedrolls and meal services will remain in effect but the fare will be restored. However, sources in railways said the fare once restored will not be refunded to those who have already booked tickets for special category trains. The status of special trains will be removed from all the MSPC and the HSP trains giving a major relief to passengers. "The first digit will now not be zero as was in the case of special trains,” another official said. Since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, the railways has only been running special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now even short-distance passenger services are being run as special trains with “slightly higher fares” to “discourage people from avoidable travels”. The railways had stopped passenger services in March last year due to the pandemic, gradually resuming services from May 2020 in a phased manner. However, most of the resumed trains were operating as ‘special trains’ for which ticket prices were higher than regular trains, without concessions for senior citizens. The number for these train numbers began with ‘0’. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has been asked to make necessary changes in the software to reflect the changes. Additionally, each zonal railway has been directed to ensure that necessary arrangements are made to make the details available to all the concerned staff well in advance and necessary changes are made in the database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shatabdi-fare-to-drop-by-rs-90/articleshow/87704377.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kochi||Idukki dam opened, TN issues first warning at Mullaperiyar||Idukki: Just about two weeks after closing down the shutters of the Idukki dam, authorities opened one of them again on Sunday following heavy rains. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine said the dam’s shutter number three was opened before the water level reached the red alert mark to avoid a flood risk. The shutter was raised by 40cm releasing 40-50cusec of water when the water level rose to 2,398.90ft. As per the rule curve, red alert is declared when the water level goes up to 2,399.03ft while the upper rule level has been fixed at 2,400.03ft. The minister said more water will be released from the dam if the rains continue. KSEB had earlier opened three shutters of the dam on October 19 following continuous rainfall in the catchment areas and closed them on October 27. A KSEB dam safety official said the dam was opened in anticipation of the heavy rainfall predicted in the region. This is the first time that the dam has been opened in November. “The dam was opened before the waters reached the red alert mark to avoid flood risk. It is a lesson we have learnt from the 2018 floods,” said James Wilson, a member of KSEB advisory board. “The dam was opened in 1981 and 1992 not to control the flood situation. But in 2018, the dam was opened to prevent flooding following extreme rains,” he said. Even as a shutter has been opened the water level has been continuing to rise and crossed the red alert mark, reaching 2399.06ft at 7pm. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has issued the first flood warning at Mullaperiyar Dam with the water level reaching 140ft on Sunday morning. Idukki collector Sheeba George said as there is a possibility of opening the spillway shutters of the dam those living close to the river banks should take precautionary measures. The upper rule level fixed by the Central Water Commission till November 20 is at 141ft and the maximum storage level is 142ft. The ban on mining, quarry and tourism activities will continue. The collector also stopped MNREGA works and plantation sector works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-dam-opened-tn-issues-first-warning-at-mullaperiyar/articleshow/87704397.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Retail prices scalding pockets||AHMEDABAD: This year’s Navratri-Diwali festive season spelt good news for many industrial and consumer products segments as pent-up demand pushed up sales volumes. Even though consumers splurged on festive shopping sprees, they paid higher prices for a range of commodities. An increase in raw material prices for cotton, oilseeds, coal and natural gas or even steel, semiconductors, metal and other basic chemicals, caused end product prices to rise in many sectors. While apparels are expected to get costlier in the coming fortnight, the price of consumer electronics, ceramic tiles, real estate properties and even edible oil prices are on the boil. Prices of apparel, made-ups to rise by 15%With prices of cotton touching record-high levels of Rs 68,000 per bale, and that of dyes and chemicals used for textile processing almost doubling in the span of a month or two, the prices of cotton apparel and made-ups will increase by 15-25% in a fortnight or so, suggest industry players. “Higher prices of cotton are hurting manufacturers, many of whom have temporarily stopped buying cotton to reduce cost-pressures. With cotton prices increasing, even yarn prices have increased due to increased demand from China, where there are production shortages. These being major raw materials for manufacturing textiles, apparels and made-ups, it will certainly lead to an increase in prices,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council. Basic chemicals used in textile process houses have also become costlier. “Besides the cost of dyes and chemicals, the prices of coal – which is used to operate boilers – have also increased. This has added to our cost of production and it is not viable to do business without passing them on. To keep basic liquidity, we have no choice but to increase the job charges which will add to the cost of polyester sarees, fabrics and dress materials,” said Pramod Chaudhary, ex-president, South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA). Industry players have also raised concerns over the GST Council’s proposed plan to implement an increase in GST rates on fabrics and garments from 5% to 12% effective January 1, 2022. “If the GST rates increase, apparel and made-up will get even more expensive and this in the longer run may affect cost-competitiveness of apparel makers and hit order volumes and demand,” said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India (CMAI). Consumer electronics, home appliances get dearerCome Diwali and a lot of people wait for the annual Diwali discounts on a range of consumer products and home appliances to make their purchases. However, this Diwali, consumers have paid at least 15% more on televisions, air conditioners, washing machines and given the semiconductor shortage and rise in prices of other raw materials. Bhavesh Waria, president, Ahmedabad Electronics Dealers’ Association (AEDA), said, “From April to October 2021, a slew of raw materials including copper, aluminium and plastic parts became expensive. These are widely used in manufacturing of consumer electronics and home appliances and over the past six to seven months, the consumer electronics have become costlier by at least 10-15% due to costlier raw materials.” Makers of electronics and home appliances are battling production woes amid a steep semiconductor shortage, which is affecting production in a big way. “At present, dealers are not facing any issues because the demand has not remained so great even during the festive season. However, the shortage of semiconductor is getting worse for manufacturers with demand only increasing. Therefore, consumers who plan to buy electronics may buckle up for another likely increase in prices by 3-5%,” Waria added. Edible oil prices on the boilEdible oil prices rallied substantially in the domestic market over the past one year. High prices of imported oils such as sunflower and palm oil, as well as a surge in oilseed prices amid Covid-19 induced disruptions, kept edible oil prices on the boil. The retail prices of sunflower oil (packed) in Ahmedabad shot up by 55% to Rs 160 per kg on November 10 this year from Rs 103 per kg on the same date last year, according to the data compiled by the union ministry of consumers affairs. During the same period, the per kilogram price of soya oil firmed up by 46% to Rs 150 from Rs 103. While mustard oil price jumped 75% to Rs 175 from Rs 100, palm oil increased 28% to Rs 110 from Rs 86. “Edible oil prices remain high only when oilseed prices are high. Most importantly, high prices of imported oils such as sunflower and palm also kept domestic oils such as mustard at firm levels,” said Sameer Shah, president, Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (GSEOOSA). Sunflower, palm, and soya oil price fluctuations are dependent on international market trends. Worldwide, the supply of these oils was lesser than the demand. Also, a significant chunk of these vegetable oils went into biodiesel production, which further affected its availability. High prices of oilseeds kept edible oil prices firm amid less supply of vegetable oils around the world. India’s 65% edible oil demand is met through imports. However, groundnut oil prices were less volatile as groundnut production was plentiful. Groundnut oil prices rose only 9% annually as of November 10, 2021. Ceramic tiles prices rise 30-40%Faced with back-to-back surge in prices of natural gas and higher transportation and raw material costs, tile makers in Morbi, India’s largest cluster of ceramic tile industry, have raised the prices of their finished products by an average of 30-40%. Since the beginning of August this year, the price of industrial piped natural gas supplied to the tile manufacturing units in Morbi has firmed up to Rs 58 per standard cubic meter (SCM) for 3-month minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO) from Rs 33.14 per SCM (excluding tax). The tile makers revised prices of tiles — vitrified, wall and floor tiles — thrice to pass on higher production to consumers. As a result, retail prices of various ceramic tiles have also surged by 30-40% in tandem with the wholesale prices, said tile makers in Morbi. Property gets 10-15% dearerWith key raw materials such as cement, steel, hardware and sanitary ware as well as transportation becoming costlier, real estate developers have seen their production cost moving up by an average of 20%. “The raw material price surge has pushed up construction costs by at least Rs 300 to Rs 500 per square feet in Ahmedabad. On an average the cost has gone up by 20%. It will increase further,” said Chitrak Shah, vice-president of CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers. “However, the developers have not passed on the entire burden onto consumers. Hence, the retail prices of properties, mainly residential ones, have risen by 10-15%,” added Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/retail-prices-scalding-pockets/articleshow/87704393.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Power panel okays purchase from SECI||AMARAVATI: Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has stamped its nod for the purchase of power from Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). The distribution companies wanted to purchase about 7,000 mw of power from the SECI. The APERC has asked the state government to ensure that the annual procurement does not increase the maximum ceiling of 17,000 million units.  Discoms have filed an application with the APERC seeking approval for an interim power procurement with a plan purchase of 7,000 MW of solar power from SECI in a phased manner commencing from September 2024. Discoms have also requested ERC to allow them into a tripartite agreement along with state government and SECI for procurement of power for a period of 25 years.  In their request, discoms said that Centre has pledged in Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 to 35% between 2005 and 2030 at COP21 deliberations and to that effect it has been focusing on accelerated use of clean and renewable energy by 40% by 2030. Centre had also set a target to achieve 450 GW renewable energy installed capacity by 2030. It felt that there is a need to reduce the cost of service while ensuring quality power and 9-hours daytime free power supply to farmers in view of the state government’s mission of achieving sustainable agriculture while lowering cost of cultivation and increasing farmers’ income.  It has been estimated that the subsidy support for free power supply to agriculture is likely to increase from Rs 8,900 crore in 2020-21 to around Rs 17,819 crore by 2030-31 considering release of new connections of 50,000 per year. With a view to de-risk the discoms as soon as possible from the burden of agricultural consumption, the government wanted to ensure direct payment through an exclusive payment security mechanism for purchase of power for agriculture needs.  The commission said it has examined the request of the discoms and the approved load forecasts and resource plans. Commission said the demand forecast is comparable to the indicative forecasts of the resource plan. “Therefore, the commission finds that the proposed quantum of procurement is in accordance with the projected requirements. Further, as justified by the discoms, the country’s march towards integrating more renewable sources is the need of the hour in view of the COP21 commitments,” said the commission. It further observed that procurement of the proposed energy is necessary and in the best interests of the power sector in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/power-panel-okays-purchase-from-seci/articleshow/87704389.cms||Samdani MN

The modalities regarding hostel accommodation are also pending with the varsity. Speaking to TOI, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said before reopening, the varsity also had to keep in mind the large number of outstation students from states where the Covid-19 caseload was still high. “Our situation is very different as we have a large number of students from various states. There are a good number of Covid-19 cases in some states. Before reopening, we need to consider these aspects too. It will mean that students from such states will have to travel to Delhi. For schools, it’s a different matter as they are more localised and students are from the city itself. We will wait for a couple of weeks before taking a call,” added Singh. For outstation students, accommodation in hostels, where they usually share rooms, is another concern. While several college principals said they were waiting for detailed guidelines, senior DU officials said it was unlikely that colleges would reopen for all courses at one go. Rajeev Gupta, dean of students’ welfare at DU, said, “Currently, several MPhil, PhD and postgraduate students are already living in the university hostels. Most hostels have taken the call to not take fresh admissions for now, so undergraduate students have not been admitted. We will wait for a few more weeks to get clarity.” “Once classes star, we will see if it’s possible to call students from science courses or those requiring practical work to the campus. It’s too early to say as we need to first identify who all will be called. However, if only students requiring laboratories are called, it will cut down the numbers requiring the hostels. They might not have to share rooms, but the final call will be taken later,” Gupta explained. Suman Sharma, principal of Lady Shri Ram College for Women, said, “While it’s difficult to comment right now, based on the current pandemic situation it looks like sharing rooms will not be possible. The rooms may have to be converted into single occupancies. However, we will decide on this later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-colleges-yet-to-take-final-call-on-reopening-hostels/articleshow/87704901.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Police suspect that the accused could be the victim’s relatives and financial disputes could be the reason behind the murder. The deceased, Mohammed Arif, was a businessman from Payeen Bagh in Jahanuma area of Falaknuma. Arif ran a cell phone sales business and lived alone in his house at Payeen Bagh. At around 11.30 pm on Saturday, a few persons attacked Arif on the head with a blunt object and caused multiple bleeding injuries. Arif collapsed near the main gate of the compound wall inside the premises of his house. Alerted by locals, police rushed to the spot and shifted the victim to Osmania General Hospital in an ambulance. “Arif succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment during the early hours of Sunday,” Falaknuma inspector R Devender said. During the preliminary probe, police found that three persons on scooters had attacked the victim and fled from the spot. Based on the complaint of the victim’s brother, Ghouse, police registered a murder case. Family members of Arif said that he had borrowed around Rs 40,000 from relatives for his business and that they might have killed him as he could not return them the money.

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has taken up various civic works including building retaining walls, road levelling, levelling of service roads and other works at the Road under Bridge (RuB) at Tukaram Gate. Locals of Tukaram Gate, Addagutta, and other colonies are irked by the inordinate delay in completion of works. “How long do we have to suffer with dust pollution. Moreover, the earthmovers make loud noises and create nuisance even late in the night,” said B Giridhar, a resident of Tukaram Gate. The residents said that the works were halted during the last two months due to heavy rains and the site became soaked with rainwater. Though the RuB works had begun in end of 2020, the project an into delays due to several hurdles such as land acquisition, finalisation of designs, court cases, heavy downpour, shortage of workers and pandemic. The residents also alleged that the by-lanes adjacent to the RuB have become congested as the construction waste is being dumped in these lanes. “We cannot park our vehicles in our premises or move them out due to the dumping of concrete waste,” said V Prabhakar Rao, another resident of Tukaram Gate. However, GHMC executive engineer, B Gopal said that if all goes well, the RuB will open to the public by next summer. “The RuB project should be completed by March and if that does not happen, then latest by June,” the officials said. Over 1.5 lakh commuters are expected to benefit with the construction of the RuB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slow-pace-of-work-at-tukaram-gate-rub-irks-locals/articleshow/87704897.cms||Sunil Mungara

The condition is more severe in non-science students than science students. While 84% non-science PhD students showed some signs of depression the corresponding figure was 62% for science students. Students belonging to economically weaker sections, having limited knowledge of local language and earning less than Rs 20,000 were more likely to report moderate to severe depressive disorders. In addition, analyses of interviews of PhD students showed that financial hardship, disagreement with supervisors, compromised students’ support services and an uncertain job market were the key factors affecting the mental health of students and inhibiting academic performance. “Given the growing prevalence of depressive disorders among PhD students and limited systematic studies in the Indian context, we decided to conduct the study. In post-Covid times, it is most likely to have increased, especially due to the fear of lack of employment opportunities,” said Dr KR Thankappan from department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Central University of Kerala, who was part of the team that conducted the study about the prevalence of depressive disorders in PhD students. For the purpose of the study, a total of 240 PhD students from science and non-science streams of two public universities of Kerala one in Kasaragod and another in Thiruvananthapuram were interviewed. “The study found that there is a growing concern of depressive disorders among doctoral students in Kerala. While some of the factors causing depressive disorder may require attention at the university level, there were other factors such as financial issues and fear of unemployment that required systemic and policy interventions in a coordinated manner,” added Dr Thankappan. Educationists and psychiatrists said there is an immediate need to look into the mental health of students, both at school and university levels. “Our PhD students are a neglected lot. Permanent job opportunities are few, leading to frustration and crisis in career and life,” said educationist RVG Menon. “Our research set-up is more job oriented. Hence, though we have many research papers published from Kerala there are very few that make it to renowned international publications. Due to this, often a committed student faces not just performance bias, but biases of other kinds that lead to anxiety and depression,” said psychiatrist Dr CJ John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/68-phd-students-suffer-from-depression-study/articleshow/87704400.cms||Preetu Nair

Police identified the accused as Anish Ahmad and Suhaliya for plotting an extortion bid in order to clear their debts. Police said Ahmad knew garment trader Vibhu Gupta and worked as a staffer in his shop located at Panchvati Circle in Raja Park. Investigators claimed that Ahmad’s prior experience as an electrician came in handy while designing a ‘dummy bomb,’ which was a scare tactic to extort money from the trader. “The had accumulated a lot of debts and thought that Gupta would be an easy target if he could be scared into paying him some hefty amount,” an official said. The incident had taken place on Friday afternoon when an e-rickshaw driver delivered the cake in a box at Gupta’s shop. When Gupta opened the suspicious box, he saw some wires jutting out of it and a note asking him to travel in the same rickshaw with Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh. The letter also threatened that if he failed to pay, the bomb would explode. Shaken after reading it, Gupta refused to take delivery of the box and returned it to the driver. The driver then took the cake home and found a digital watch, batteries and wires inside it. He panicked and threw it near a culvert. Police on Saturday early morning recovered the box and detained the driver, he told cops that a woman had paid him Rs 50 to deliver the box to Gupta’s store Police said the device did not have any explosives or detonators but contained small batteries and a few nails. Police then constituted a special team led by SHO Panna Lal to track down the woman and unearthed the entire conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-held-for-sending-fake-bomb-to-raja-park-trader-for-extortion/articleshow/87704922.cms||---

This is the seventh time KTR has written to the Centre urging it to sanction the project. In the latest letter, KTR pointed out that Sircilla has been a major hub of handloom and textiles activity for several decades and has the requisite ecosystem, including trained manpower required for such a mega powerloom cluster. He also pointed out that the state government has initiated several measures such as 40% input subsidy linked wage compensation scheme, thrift fund to handloom and powerloom weavers to boost this sector. He said that with the Centre’s support the state will not only be able to compete with other states but also other countries. “Over the past few years we have been observing that the Union government is announcing schemes and assistance to states which lack the necessary ecosystem or resources. All this at the expense of fast developing states like Telangana… I make an earnest appeal on behalf of people of Telangana to sanction the Mega Powerloom Cluster at Sircilla without further delay,” he added. --||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-urges-centre-to-sanction-mega-powerloom-cluster-at-sircilla/articleshow/87704425.cms||---

However, in most of the states, Congress is adopting a softened Hindutva policy to fight BJP. In Kerala, Congress member Rahul Gandhi took on a CPI candidate in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” a politburo member remarked. “Electoral understanding with Congress isn’t the only issue the politburo discussed. Congress’ policy on farmers’ issue is the same with BJP,” the member said. On reports that the party state secretariat has been allowed to take a call on Kodiyeri Balakrishnan returning as the state secretary, the leader said the politburo didn’t take up the matter for discussion. The draft of the party’s political resolution will be discussed at politburo before placing it before central committee to be held inJanuary. Once the central committee approves it, it will be circulated to all party committees for discussion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cpm-to-take-state-wise-call-on-poll-ties-with-congress-to-fight-bjp/articleshow/87706063.cms||---

The jawan, identified as Ganesh Kumar, belongs to Ashthawan in Nalanda district. The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of state police and intelligence agencies found some sensitive documents saved in his cellphone which should not have been there. He is on leave, sources said. City SP (west) Ashok Kumar Mishra said he was working as a nursing staff at AFMC, Pune. “Formal procedures of his arrest are being made after lodging an FIR against him,” Mishra said. Intelligence sources said Kumar came in touch with a Pakistani operative over WhatsApp around two years ago and was honeytrapped to pass on information about order of battle (ORBAT), which means location of Army units on ground. “Till now, investigation shows that Kumar didn’t either receive any monetary benefits for passing on the information or was blackmailed for it. He was purely honeytrapped after which he got involved in espionage. The PIO had posed as Indian Navy medical team staff to extract information from him,” a source said. Sources said the ATS, Patna police, Intelligence Bureau and Military Intelligence personnel were quizzing the soldier to know about the information and documents he shared related to Army units’ movement and location in the last couple of years. They said the cellphone found in his possession would be sent for forensic test so that any deleted chats and documents sent to the Pakistan operative over WhatsApp could be retrieved. “Further legal process is underway. Nothing much can be disclosed at present,” a source privy to the investigation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/army-jawan-held-for-sharing-documents-with-pak-intelligence-operative/articleshow/87704447.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Devotees will be allowed to have darshan only from Tuesday, on the first day of the Malayalam month of Vrishchikam. Due to the prevailing climatic conditions, the state government has decided to restrict the entry of devotees to Sabarimala in the initial days. Even though it was decided to allow 30,000 devotees for darshan per day, it has now been decided to restrict the number due to the adverse situation prevailing in Pathanamthitta district. The police and Travancore Devaswom Board will be taking a decision on how many devotees can be allowed each day, on Monday. Since a decision has been taken to restrict the number of devotees, the people who booked through virtual queue system will be given alternate dates for darshan. The police department has been asked to make necessary arrangements for this. It has been decided that devotees will not be allowed to take a ritualistic dip at Pamba until the water level decreases. Even though there was decision to begin spot booking at Nilackal, it has been temporarily postponed to reduce the rush of devotees. The authorities have decided to ensure that Swami Ayyappan trekking path is safe for trekking for devotees during the heavy rains. Travancore Devaswom Board and state health department have made it mandatory that the devotees coming for darshan should carry the Covid vaccination completion certificates or RT-PCR negative certificate of tests conducted 72 hours before the travel. For devotees choosing spot booking (when it starts), they should carry all the relevant documents to prove their address and identity. On Monday, the incumbent Melshanti V K Jayaraj Potti will open the sanctum sanctorum of the temple at 5pm and will light the lamp.

Requests for exemption should be made by candidates through schools, backed by medical reports. The first lot of such requests have to be made by November 25 by the schools. The CBSE circular that has reached schools, announcing these exemptions, also says that children who are participating in sports events recognised by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and those who have been selected to participate in the International Olympiads recognised by the Homi Bhaba Centre for Science Education, scheduled during the term one exams, are also eligible for this exemption. Candidates will have to furnish these details with letters from SAI and the Homi Bhaba Centre. No separate term one examination will be held for such candidates and their performance in term two exams will decide their results, the circular said. The reason for including sports in this category is to promote the spirit of sports among children in the country, the circular said. Schools will have to forward these requests to the regional offices of CBSE (Bhubaneshwar in case of West Bengal), which will scan these requests for their genuineness and then send confirmations to the respective schools. “Though there is no child with Covid as of bow among the board examinees, we have kept an isolation room ready with a doctor and a nurse in attendance. If any child develops symptoms we will move him to this isolation room and do the needful. Often not all cough and cold is Covid and an isolation room helps. The circular will put tense parents at ease too and they will not push a sick child to write the test,” said Loveleen Sehgal, principal of Birla High School. “We are all praying that none of our board examinees fall sick and are able to write term one but at least this assurance from the Board would help children relax in case they contract the virus despite all efforts,” said Asian International School principal, Vijaylakshmi Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jhimli-cbse-first-term-exception/articleshow/87704459.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Nikith Mascarenhas, who runs a stationery shop and makes bulk sale of attendance registers in Vittal, had no business since the start of the pandemic. “Sales have improved from the past one month. Depending on the Covid situation, it may take at least a year for business to get back to normal, like in the days before the pandemic,” says Nikith, who is continuing his family business. The smiles on faces of proprietors of eateries and shopowners near educational institutions, who had little or no business, are back, as the educational institutions have reopened. Raj of Vihar Restaurant situated at St Aloysius College shares that business has improved since the reopening of colleges. However, the rise in the prices of raw materials including gas, is a burden on them. “We are in a Catch-22 situation as we cannot increase prices. Even if we hike prices, other shops situated nearby should also increase prices uniformly, or else students go to those places where prices are less. We cannot burden students too, whose families have suffered financially due to Covid-19,” he said, while recounting the difficulty of small eateries that cater to students. Normally eateries near educational institutions do business only when schools or colleges are open. “There is no business when students have holidays,” said the owner of another eatery near Car Street. “When schools and colleges are open, we have good demand for evening snacks. Parents who come to pick up their children from schools pay a visit to our shop,” said an eatery owner near Sri Venkataramana Temple in Car Street.

They also blew the mud house by dynamite. The incident came to light on Sunday. According to locals, the Maoists raided the house of Saryu Singh Bhokta at around 7pm on Saturday. They shot his two sons — Satyendra Singh Bhokta and Mahendra Singh Bhokta — and their wives Manorama Devi and Sunita Devi. The Maoists stayed there for around two hours till 9pm. The Maoists left a pamphlet there, stating that their action was to avenge the March incident this year when four of their cadres — Shivpujan Kumar, Amresh Kumar, Sita Kumar and Uday Kumar — had been neutralised by the CoBRA battalion 205 at the same place. They alleged that the cadres were given poison in the meal, which caused their death. But in the police record, they were killed in an encounter. The Maoists blamed the Bhokta family for the fake encounter and alleged that they acted as police informers. Four AK-47 rifles had been recovered from their possession. The village is on the border of Gaya and Aurangabad districts. Spokesperson of Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh (BJNCUP) Simant Regional Committee of the banned CPI(Maoists), Manas, in a press statement said that had they lost four brave comrades in a fake encounter. “We do not remorse the loss of lives if the supreme sacrifice is made in war field, but they were killed by betrayal in cold blood which warranted revenge,” Manas said. The Maoists also released two sets of photographs along with their statement. While the first set of four photos shows their slain cadres lying here and there in the house of Bhokta, the second set of four photographs shows four members of the same house hung by their neck in the courtyard. “We have avenged the betrayal and this would be the fate of anyone who backstabs our men,” the Maoists said in the press release. Police have launched a massive combing operation in the area. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar told a private news channel that the incident took place at the same house where an encounter took place in March this year in which four Maoist commanders were killed in an encounter. Earlier also, the Maoists had tried to find Saryu. On Saturday, when they did not find Saryu, they tortured his sons and daughters-in-law and later hanged them outside the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-kill-4-of-a-family-in-gaya/articleshow/87704464.cms||---

Shinde was interacting with the media a day after 26 hardcore Maoists, including key Naxal leader and Yavatmal resident Milind Teltumbde, were gunned down on Saturday in one of the biggest police encounters of the year in Gadchiroli. “The action is a huge jolt for the Naxal movement not just in Maharashtra but across the country,” Shinde told the media in Thane. “We have already laid out a plan to bring the Naxal-infested areas into the mainstream and also chalked out rehabilitation plans for those who have surrendered. I have issued directions to allocate special Rs 10 crore in the district planning funds for ensuring these Naxals can start their own businesses and be self-reliant. We want them to be part of our initiative in bringing Gadchiroli on the development map,” he said. Speaking about the nine-hour encounter, the minister said the operation started after the Naxals opened fire on our teams. The slain Naxals, including Teltumbde, were involved in several killings of civilians and the police and were wanted in many states where their operations were active. “Our teams managed to break in through the three-tier cover around Teltumbde and managed to kill him. Following the death of Teltumbde, we are positive about weakening the Naxal movement in the area. Teltumbde was a major driving force for the Maoists operating in the region and nearby states of Chattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh as well and was a key person in their operations,” he said. Shinde lauded the efforts of the police teams, saying that despite injuries they still faced the Maoists. “Four of our police staff suffered injuries and were admitted to the local hospitals for treatment. I have spoken to the CM and home minister about rewarding the force working there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minister-announces-rs-10-crore-for-naxal-rehab-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/87705889.cms||Manoj Badgeri

A most wanted criminal in Colombo, Chanuka was a close aide of Lokka.A CB-CID source said, “During inquiry, we learnt that the Chennai city police had arrested Chanuka in 2017. District CB-CID deputy superintendent of police P Sivakumar and team recently got a tip about Chanuka and were camping in Bengaluru city since November 6. They traced the whereabouts of Chanuka to Banaswadi with the help of CB-CID cyber cell and Karnataka cyber police.”The source said the team had conducted a door-to-door search to nab Chanuka. “When they showed Chanuka’s photo to a housemaid – Nagaraj – he confirmed the whereabouts of Chanuka. The team arrested Chanuka from an apartment at Banaswadi on Friday (Nov 12) along with 46-year-old T Gopalakrishnan alias Jayapal, a native of Srivilliputhur in Tamil Nadu, for providing him shelter at his younger sister’s apartment.”Jayapal, the source said, had introduced Chanuka to his sister as Nannan from Tamil Nadu and told her that he would stay for a few months for business purposes. “Her maid Nagaraj was instructed to provide food and all the essentials to Chanuka.”The source said the Kancheepuram Q-branch police had arrested Jayapal six months ago for providing shelter to Sri Lankan drug smuggler Suresh. He had come out on bail within two months of the arrest. The team had brought both Chanuka and Jayapal to the city on Saturday after obtaining the prisoner transit warrant from a Bengaluru court. “They were produced before chief judicial magistrate (CJM) M Sanjeevi Baskar the same night and remanded in judicial custody. We will file a petition before the CJM court on Monday, seeking their custody for seven days.” Lokka, who was wanted in more than eight murder cases and drug smuggling cases in Sri Lanka, had come to Tamil Nadu in 2017 by an illegal ferry. He was residing in a rental house at Saravanampatti initially and then moved to another house at Balaji Nagar in February, 2020, along with his lover Amani Dhanji. They had help from lawyer Sivakami Sundari and her friend Dhyaneswaran.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||PG medicos not to take up pilgrimage duty||Thiruvananthapuram: The health department has deputed post-graduate medical students for Sabarimala duty as specialist doctors in the medical centres that have been set up at various places from Nilackal to Sannidhanam. However, the PG medicos decided not to join duty as they allege that they are being exploited instead of appointing senior specialist doctors for the pilgrimage season duty. “The Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association has decided not to comply with the decision taken by the health department to send PG residents for Sabarimala duty disguised as specialists,” said Dr Naveen R, state secretary of the association. “We have been exploited to the limits and this has to stop. We have sacrificed our specialty training period for the past two years as the state was in crisis due to the pandemic situation,” said Dr Athul Ashok, state president of the association. The PG residents have been taking extra duties in all medical college hospitals and in several Covid centres as the situation demanded it. There are only two batches of PG medicos presently in the state and NEET PG counselling for the fresh batch is yet to commence. Instead of posting qualified specialists with postgraduate degrees in the respective specialty from the directorate of medical education or directorate of health services, the authorities are trying a gimmick using the existing, heavily overworked PG students, said Dr Naveen. The virtual emergency medicine department planned at Sabarimala is being set up with the service of PG residents by pooling them from different departments of various medical colleges. There is a lack of permanent staff in the emergency medicine department and hence the PG medicos are being exploited to cover up these shortages. This is against our curriculum laid down by the Kerala University of Health Sciences and most of us have already completed the required casualty duties. Hence the health department will have to make alternate arrangements instead of putting us on Sabarimala duty, said Dr Akash, secretary of Thiruvananthapuram medical college unit of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pg-medicos-not-to-take-up-pilgrimage-duty/articleshow/87704472.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For the same, after close scrutiny of the biodatas of the aspirants trying to get party tickets from the 12 assembly seats of the district for the 2022 UP assembly polls, the district, assembly constituency and main sector in-charge committees of the party have sent 60 applications to BSP chief Mayawati. Besides, these committees have also recommended the names of 18 prospective candidates for nine assembly seats of the district in their report. These nine seats are Phaphamau, Soraon, Handia, Meja, Karchhana, Allahabad West, Allahabad South, Bara and Koraon. Candidates for the remaining three assembly seats of Allahabad North, Phulpur and Pratappur are believed to have already been finalised by the party, with two Brahmin and one Muslim faces, said a senior BSP leader privy to the information. Abhishek Gautam, the newly appointed BSP Prayagraj district unit president, confirmed that names of probable candidates have already been sent to the party headquarters. “Now, our national president Mayawati ji and senior leaders will take a final call in this regard,” he added. Party insiders say the BSP chief is likely to meet the ticket seekers before putting the final seal on the names of candidates for which the party has started calling potential candidates to Lucknow for interview. A senior BSP leader, requesting anonymity, said this time the party might delay naming candidates for many seats till close to election so as to field worthy candidates, while taking into account the candidates named by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Samajwadi Party. If party leaders are to be believed, BSP may field a leader of Pal community from Allahabad West seat to make up for its former MLA Puja Pal, who lost the elections from the seat in 2017 to BJP’s Sidharth Nath Singh, having left the party. On Allahabad West and Allahabad South seats, the BSP committees have forwarded the names of three leaders each as potential candidates, including two Muslim leaders each on both seats. Party leaders claim that name of a Brahmin traders’ leader has already been finalised by the party to contest from Allahabad North seat. The most intense fight is for the seats of Pratappur and Soraon from where party’s sitting MLAs Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hakim Lal Bind (the only two seats that BSP could win in 2017 out of 12 in Prayagraj) have defected to Samajwadi Party. Party leaders say BSP can field a Muslim face from Pratappur, and will be fielding a Brahmin leader from Handia seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bsp-district-machinery-sends-60-names-for-12-assembly-seats-of-district-ahead-of-22-polls/articleshow/87704944.cms||---

Addressing a press conference in Kushinagar, Akhilesh said BJP is full of lies and arrogance and he will reply to BJP’s JAM with butter. Akhilesh started his Vijay Rath Yatra from Gorakhpur on Saturday and addressed people at Hata after reaching Kushinagar in the evening. Akhilesh said, “As far as we understand, in BJP’s JAM, J is for jhooth (lies), A is for ahankar (arrogance) and M is for mehngai (inflation). BJP is answerable for JAM, but it is trying to divert people’s attention. We will reply to JAM with butter, and you will soon know what butter is.” “People have decided to change this government, which only changes names and colour and has forgotten issues like price hike, unemployment and plummeting value of rupee,” he added. Referring to the foundation laying of a university in his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh, he said, “They have laid the foundation of the university, but they should also tell about its budget. They are running a medical university in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the ninth floor of the medical college built by Samajwadis otherwise they would have been running it in a tin shade. The agriculture university we gave to Azamgarh was dragged to Gorakhpur by Baba ji. They are only inaugurating the work of SP.” Unemployed youth, farmers and people are facing the heat of price rise and have decided to vote this government out in 2022, he added. “BJP doesn’t care about farmers and is forcing three black laws. Farmers were waiting to see their income double, but were crushed under the wheels. A BJP minister’s son is accused. The payment of sugarcane farmers is pending and wheat is not being purchased anywhere. We will work on Lohia’s principle of ‘Daam Bandho’,” he added. Earlier, BJP always raised the issue of falling value of rupee against dollar, but is now silent when the rupee is on tailspin. They should at least tell us how much investment has come to the country, he added. “They are selling institutions like railways, airports, ships and ports and filling the pockets of the rich. We have progressive thoughts but their beliefs are regressive. They will give ration to the poor only till elections, but we Samajwadi will give free ration for the full five years,” the SP chief said. Defending his party MP, Akhilesh said, “BJP is falsely accusing Azam Khan saheb, all the cases are fake and they are torturing him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhilesh-flips-bjps-jam-says-it-denotes-jhoothahankar-mehngai-wait-for-our-butter/articleshow/87704955.cms||Arjumand Bano

Kabeer Ullal, a resident of Millat Nagar in Ullal, stated in his complaint before the commission, that the Mescom authorities disconnected power supply to his house, in spite of paying the bill on time. As a result, the food items stored in the refrigerator perished during the absence of family members in the house. After the hearing, the commission directed Mescom officials to pay Rs 4,000 to the complainant as compensation, and also pay Rs 5,000 as litigation charges. Kabeer told TOI that he was very regular in paying electricity charges to Mescom. “A bill of Rs 1,787 was issued to my house on June 12, 2018, and the same was payable on or before June 27, 2018. However, I have paid the bill on June 14, 2018. Thereafter, I along with my wife and children went to our in-law’s house on June 15. While going, I had stored fish, mutton, chicken, vegetables ice cream and other items in the fridge, since I was expecting the visit of my relatives after our return. The total value of the items stored in the fridge was worth Rs 6,000. On my return on June 19, 2018, I found a foul smell emanating from the fridge, and that the items kept inside had perished,” Kabeer said. On verifying the meter board outside the house, Kabeer noticed that the fuse was removed, and the supply of electricity was withdrawn, he said. “I contacted a lineman and got to know that the fuse was removed as per the instructions of his higher officer. Hence, I moved the DCDRC through my advocates G K Parameshwara Jois and Mohammed Ansar. The commission has ordered the assistant executive engineer, Ullal sub-division and executive engineer, division No1, Mescom Attavar, to pay the compensation and litigation expenses,” Kabeer said. In the order signed by Prakash K, president, Dakshina Kannada DCDRC, members Lavanya M Rai and Lingaraju P V, the opposite parties have been directed to pay the compensation jointly within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/food-in-fridge-rots-mescom-officials-asked-to-pay-compensation/articleshow/87703718.cms||---

---||Goa||Chicalim youth farmers harvest 64 sacks of paddy||VASCO: A group of farmers in Chicalim reaped what they had sowed, but this was a special harvest. The 14,000 sqm field area that was cultivated had been lying fallow for many years and the farmers who revived it were a group of youth who took to farming to inspire others. The Chicalim Youth Farmer's Club (CYFC ) on Sunday happily and proudly harvested their paddy crop, gathering a yield of 64 sacks of 25 kg each. Of these, 50 bags were of the Jyoti rice variety and 14 bags of the Karjat variety. The harvesting process was conducted by a farmer from Nagoa, Greg Fernandes, while eight teachers from St Joseph Vaz College, Cortalim, helped the youth. Interestingly, earlier too, the young farmers received help from Goenche Shetkar during the process of sowing and transplanting. Part of the harvested paddy will be distributed among the members of the club and the rest of it will be sold in the market once it is processed into rice. Parish Priest of Chicalim Church, Fr Bolmax Pereira, who founded the club and guided members said, “We have 35 youth registered with us. Few are studying and others are working. While many have contributed as and when they afforded time, 15 youth have been continuously engaged in the activity." Stating that overall, nearly Rs 1 lakh has been spent on the programme, Pereira said that the local community sponsored the activity. To honour the achievement of the young farmers, a team from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, Old Goa (ICAR) and basmati rice growers from Haryana visited the harvesting site. The Haryana team told the youth that Haryana exports 60% of its basmati crop to Arab countries and that growing Basmati is possible in Goa. The team also assured the young farmers of help during the next sowing season. ICAR has also offered assistance to the club to grow Beyer and newly-researched varieties while also assuring that other inputs will be provided next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-youth-farmers-harvest-64-sacks-of-paddy/articleshow/87704987.cms||Ruvina Khan

His body was found in his car near a community health centre on NH-98 on Sunday morning, police said. Palamu Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar Sinha said the body had a small but deep piercing wound beneath his right earlobe. “As per autopsy report, it is a bullet wound,” he said. The deceased ran a lodge-cum-hotel in Harihurganj. A civilian phoned the Harihurganj police station about a body in the car in the morning after which police swung into action. “Police rushed to the site and retrieved the body and seized the car,” said officer in charge of Harihurganj police station, Sudama Kumar Das. Prima facie it appears that someone shot him outside and then placed the body in the passenger seat, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjym-treasurer-shot-dead-in-palamu/articleshow/87704595.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Kishan da, wife sent to Seraikela jail||Ranchi/Jamshedpur: Founding member of the CPI (Maoist) and the outlawed party’s politburo member, Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, his wife Sheela Marandi alias Sheela di — the only woman member of the party’s central committee — along with their four aides were forwarded to the Seraikela divisional jail on Sunday after they were produced before the court of Seraikela sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), Kavitanjali Toppo. Earlier, all six were brought to the Seraikela Sadar Hospital, (SSH) for a medical examination before their production in the court amid tight police security. The four aides were identified as Virendra Hansda, Raju Tudu, Krishna Bahanda and Gurucharan Bodra. Carrying a reward of Rs 1 crore on his head, Bose was wanted in more than 50 cases lodged in different police stations of Jharkhand and an almost equal number of cases filed in different police stations of Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Sheela di has nearly two dozen cases filed against her and is out on bail in most of them. She was earlier arrested in 2006 and came out of jail in 2016. She has been currently arrested in a fresh case bearing number 67/21 registered under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act with the Kandra police on November 13, 2021. Addressing the media at the Khukhri guest house of Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP), DGP Niraj Sinha said police have recovered an ocean of information from the couple which may warrant months to be analysed. “The volume of information and documents we have recovered is enormous. We are likely to include several other sections of the IPC and the UAPA in the case against the couple after proper analysis of the information,” he said. Police said the entire operation of nabbing the top-rung Maoist leaders was a mind game involving no firepower. “We had specific inputs about the Scorpio with its registration number in which the suspected Maoist leaders were travelling from Giridih to Chaibasa,” Seraikela SP Anand Prakash said, adding that personnel of the CRPF were also part of the operation. Police also said the six persons, including the woman (Sheela di), did not reveal their identity initially. “After sustained interrogation and verification, we were able to establish their identity,” state police spokesperson A V Homkar said. Sources in the police department said the arrest was possible only after the force has been successful in breaking into the Maoist rank and file and placing moles to provide inside information. It is believed that the recent surrender of area commanders, Bailoon Sardar, Suraj alias Gaju Sardar and Raimuni, who were active along the tri-junction of Ranchi-West Singhbhum and Seraikela, helped the police team to cross-verify the insider information about the movement of the Maoists leaders. The DGP, however, refused to go further into the details of the operation but said they are hopeful of arresting the only politburo member (PBM), Misir Besra, who is left after Bose’s arrest. “We have laid our hands on the encyclopedia of the Maoist organisation, their plans, successful and failed operations and several other crucial information that would help us pull down their entire structure soon,” he said. Sinha also said he remembered the dreadful incident of the Maoist attack on the JAP camp in Topchanchi in Dhanbad during Diwali in 2001 when many personnel were killed. “We lost 15 JAP policemen in the Maoist attack lodged by the team of Bose which was led by their women wing under Sheela Di. At that time, I was here on this premises attending the Diwali mela. Exactly 20 years after that incident when we are addressing the media about the arrest of the mastermind and attacker of that ghastly incident, it gives a sense of closure,” he said. On the physical and mental condition of Bose, DGP said though he was in his late 70s, Bose was not frail as was believed. “He is physically sound and mentally alert than anyone of us in ‘this room’. He still has the spark to convert any mind to become a Maoist. He is an ideological think tank which should not be confused with his rank of PBM. He is the brain behind the merger of the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) and the CPIML-People’s War. It was because of his influence in this part of the country that despite having bigger firepower and cadre strength, the People War faction agreed to give him command over the eastern region by constituting the Eastern Regional Bureau,” Sinha added.

The Rs 2.30 crore-project will include a double-storeyed building spread across 10,674 sq.ft area. The new building will have an air-conditioned retiring room, a first-class waiting room, a counter for booking tickets and an ATM kiosk, among others, under one roof. Apart from this, an RPF post, a GRP outpost, a parcel room and a godown will also come up. A wifi facility and a battery-operated vehicle for ferrying passengers within the platform are also in the offing. Besides, a foot over-bridge at the station and extension of the platform will also be done as part of the renovation project. “Amenities at the station are based on the volume of traffic and with the growth of passenger traffic the amenities will be upgraded,” an RVNL official preferring anonymity said when asked about the amenities that are likely to come up at the station. Situated 10km away from Tatanagar on the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai rail line, as many as 35 pairs of long distance and short distance trains, mostly west and north-bound ones, pass through Adityapur every day. Although no passenger train originates from Adityapur, nearly two dozen trains have a stoppage there. With two platforms and six tracks, the station largely caters to the residents of Adityapur and Kandra in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district. “Two important Bihar-bound trains, namely the Tata-Chhapra express and the Tata-Patna express, have many takers at Adityapur but ever since the pandemic struck, these trains are not stopping at the station any more,” local Congress leader Sureshdhari said. Earlier, a representation was given to the divisional railway manager, requesting him for constructing a makeshift washroom at the station. “In the run up to the renovation project, two toilets were dismantled at the station a few months ago, thereby, causing problems for the passengers,” Adityapur resident S K Tiwary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/foundation-stone-laid-for-adityapur-rly-stn-revamp/articleshow/87704637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Panchayat polls unlikely this year, too||Ranchi: The election to the state panchayat bodies, which are pending since December 2020, is likely to be delayed further due to the state government’s “sarkar aapke dwar” campaign (government at your doorstep) scheduled from November 16 to December 28. The culmination of the “government at your doorstep” programme will also mark the second anniversary of the Soren government on December 29. According to sources, the ruling alliance government is eyeing to strengthen its base at the grassroots before the panchayat poll bugle. A call on the panchayat polls will only be taken after the mega public outreach drive even though the ruling parties have pinned the onus of announcing the dates on the state election commission, the sources added. Talking to TOI on Sunday, state rural development minister Alamgir Alam said, “We have already said we are serious about holding the panchayat polls and held meetings with the state election commission in the past to begin the groundwork. Now, they will have to announce the dates. Sooner or later, it will happen but from Tuesday onwards, the government’s entire focus will be on holding the ‘sarkar aapke dwar’ programme.” Notably, over 4000 panchayat bodies in the state had received the second extension of their tenure in August this year through an ordinance as the Jharkhand Panchayat Raj Act, 2001, doesn’t permit two extensions. Earlier in January, the state government had extended the term of elected panchayat bodies for six months as the election was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Alam had said they were eyeing to hold polls by this year-end but had upset the opposition BJP. State BJP president Deepak Prakash had accused the state government of deliberately delaying the panchayat and municipal body polls, claiming “fear of its shrinking ground”. “The government is aware that it has done no good to the public since it came to power two years ago except blaming the Modi government and crying fund crunch. Hence, it is not ready to hold the polls despite the Covid-19 situation stabilizing. We have decided to begin stirs for holding of the polls soon,” he said. Meanwhile, sources in the state election commission said they are ready with the groundwork and will notify the dates after getting the go-ahead nods from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/panchayat-polls-unlikely-this-year-too/articleshow/87704558.cms||ASRP Mukesh

During the launch of the campaign, state leaders of the party, which is part of the ruling alliance, braved the rain and cold and organised ‘prahatferi’ at Piska More at 7am and later held a ceremony at the Nehru Park in HEC area to formally kick-start the event, which will continue till November 29. Sunday’s event was attended by Congress leaders and cabinet ministers Rameshwar Oraon (finance), Badal Patralekh (agriculture), Alamgir Alam (rural development) apart from a host of party MLAs and workers. Addressing the event, state party president Rajesh Thakur said the ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ was part of a nationwide campaign by the AICC to “expose” the Modi government. He said, “Today is the birth anniversary of Pandit Nehru, one of the architects of Independent India. He was also one of the towering figures who led the freedom struggle. However, the Narendra Modi government and BJP since 2014 have launched a campaign to rewrite history and demean the contributions of scores of freedom fighters. Hence, the Jan Jagran Abhiyan is aimed at reaching out to the people across the state to make them aware about our history and expose the Modi government.” Thakur added, “The current burning issues of the country, be it inflation, sale of PSUs, contentious agriculture laws, unemployment and others, are part of the campaign. In last seven years, the country has never experienced such a policy paralysis like it is undergoing now under the current regime.” After the formal launch, all district units rolled out different programme in their respective areas. In Morhabadi, the party held a street play titled ‘Jago Janta Jago’ to take a dig at the Union government and to commemorate Nehru’s birth anniversary.

---||Nagpur||Labour dept paves way for reinstatement of 570 workers||Nagpur: Some 570 workers of Gopani Iron and Power Limited, Chandrapur, heaved a sigh of relief as they were reinstated to their jobs this week following the intervention of state labour ministry and the labour department. The dispute between Tadoli MIDC Sponge Iron Workers Association, and Gopani management was amicably settled after a fresh agreement was signed with a hike of around 25% in wages along with inclusion of payment of Diwali bonus component, it’s learnt. Sources in the labour department said the Gopani management had terminated 570 workers through a notice on September 3. Services of five contractors were also withdrawn. It’s also learnt that the unit was shut down subsequently on September 7 due to shortage of raw materials. Earlier in August, the company production had reduced by almost 50% after work was hit by shortage of raw materials. Apart from the paucity of basic raw materials, the company had cited poor run of the steel market in the backdrop of the economy sickened by the Covid onslaught in the country as another ground for their drastic decision. The retrenchment of workers had fuelled an agitation over the workers’ demand for renewal of wage agreements which had been discontinued due to Covid pandemic. Sources said the workers, through their association, were demanding a 60% hike in wages leading to the deadlock. Labour office sources also said that the workers were demanding salaries for July and August, which had not been paid. Assistant labour commissioner Rajdeep Dhurve said the management decided to settle the arrears of one month salary in instalments along with a new service agreement and bonus. “The labour ministry was supposed to hear the matter once again as there was a deadlock over the issue of ‘no work, no wages’,” he said. “The workers and their association were demanding wages since work was discontinued due to the unilateral decision of the Gopani management. The issue was amicably resolved after intervention of the minister and the labour department,” said Dhurve, whose efforts under the supervision of addditional labour commissioner Nitin Patankar helped resolve the dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/labour-dept-paves-way-for-reinstatement-of-570-workers/articleshow/87704960.cms||Soumitra Bose

Once they complete the course, they will be eligible to offer their services in any cricket tournament. Apart from eight girls from Gujarat, the other participants are from Maharashtra, Orissa, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. All 22 girls will undergo a six-day training from Monday in the city wherein they will be taught both theory and practical. They will have to appear for an exam to score at least 80 per cent to get the certificate. “We have been given level 1 coaches and umpires by the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) for training these girls,” Nitendra Singh, chief coach and director (cricket operations), Divyang Cricket Control Board of India (DCCBI) told TOI. “Once they pass the course, these women will be able to stand in as professional umpires and scorers in the cricket tournaments. We will ensure that they get to serve in the differently-abled cricket tournaments at state, national and international level,” he said. “But my aim is to get the differently-abled umpires in mainstream cricket tournaments. This will not just give full-time employment to these women but also make cricket a more inclusive sport. I am in talks with some state cricket associations to give such umpires a chance. To start with, they can umpire or keep score in local tournaments,” Singh, who is fondly called Munna in cricketing circle, said. “When these women start umpiring and scoring, they will get at least Rs 1,500 per day when the matches are played apart from train tickets for air-conditioned coaches. We will try to treat them at par with other umpires and scorers,” Singh added. About two dozen differently-abled men too will be trained in umpiring and scoring at this camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-umpires-with-difference-soon/articleshow/87704102.cms||Tushar Tere

During these hours facilities like ticket reservation, current booking and inquiry services won’t be available. The railway ministry said this is being done as part of its efforts to normalise passenger services and revert in a phased manner to the pre-Covid levels of service. On Friday, it announced to do away with the “special” tag attached to all trains and had also said the train numbers won’t have “0” as the first digit. On the shut down of PRS services, it said, “This is to enable upgradation of system data and updating of new train numbers. Since huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all mail/ express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours in order to minimise the impact on services,” it said. Except for PRS services, all other services will continue uninterrupted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railways-passenger-reservation-to-be-shut-down-for-6-hours-for-1-week/articleshow/87706088.cms||---
---||Nagpur||50 held on day 2 of Amt curfew, situation ‘tense but under control’||Amravati: Around 50 people from two opposing factions have been arrested in connection with the last two days’ violent activities in the city, even as the situation was “tense but under control” on Sunday, the second day of curfew, according to official sources. Guardian minister Yashomati Thakur told TOI that “nothing untoward” had happened in the city as well as in the district. “Everything is balanced and under control. People should observe peace and restraint,” she said. The minister urged all citizens to cooperate with the administration to help establish normalcy in the city. The city has been in grip of terror since Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Amravati bandh turned violent on Saturday, which resulted in stone-pelting, loot and arson, wherein business establishments of the minority community were targeted. Though the police have made elaborate arrangements to cope with the situation, eight platoons of state reserve police force and additional police force from Jalna, Wardha, Nagpur and Buldhana had to be summoned and deployed at various places in the city. Police ensured heavy bandobust in sensitive areas on Sunday and took out a route march in the evening. In the afternoon, a meeting of the peace committee was held at Nagpuri Gate police station which was addressed by guardian minister Thakur and police commissioner Arti Singh. Both of them urged members from either community to observe peace. A district bandh call given by BJP received fair response in Morshi and Warud pockets on Sunday. Police rounded up eight BJP activists from Warud while they were shouting slogans in front of their office there. Police also detained former agriculture minister Anil Bonde, BJP district president Nivedita Chaudhary and MLC Pravin Pote. Meanwhile, curfew has been imposed in Achalpur, Anjangaon Surji, Teosa, Warud and Morshi towns, it was learnt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-held-on-day-2-of-amt-curfew-situation-tense-but-under-control/articleshow/87704979.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No permission but many coaching insts start classes||Nagpur: Quite a few coaching institutes in semi-urban areas have started operations even though the state government has not issued any permission for reopening. Repeated pleas by owners of the coaching classes seeking reopening permission have fallen on “deaf ears”. Owner of an coaching institute based in the city said, “I know a few in other districts who have started classes. It has been months now and our association has repeatedly written to various government officials as well as public representatives, but to no avail.” TOI tried speaking with a few such institutes which had reopened, but only two agreed to share their reasons, on condition of anonymity. These are standalone coaching institutes without the frills and infrastructure that either the national-level franchisees or big brand local classes boast of. An institute owner from Wardha said, “I only called my students twice before Diwali, and now in small batches for doubt clearing sessions for those who are in Std XII.” The owner said online classes are not feasible “because this is preparation for a competitive exam”. “Understanding the concept is one part of the preparation, the other is how to approach the exam in the limited time. The required pressure simulation cannot be done online,” he said. Another class owner from Nagpur said, “I have stopped now till board exams of CBSE X and XII get over, but yes some students will have to be called back. Right now the focus is on completion of course and online mode has slowed down the process. If the course completion gets delayed then we may never be able to do full justice to our students, in terms of preparing them for the exam next year.” Coaching institute associations across the state have been lobbying to get the reopening permission, but authorities have been non-committal. A coaching association member said, “Civic authorities say permission has to come from Mumbai. When we write to chief minister’s office, they forward that correspondence to higher and technical education department even though we are not under them. So, in this bureaucratic maze, coaching classes are now the only establishment in entire Maharashtra to remain shut.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-permission-but-many-coaching-insts-start-classes/articleshow/87704974.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Gaurav Sharma and his associates are alleged to have entered the premises “with their shoes on” by climbing over wall at midnight and filming the area. As per popular belief, no one is allowed to enter the temple at night since it is held that Lord Krishna and Radha perform ‘raslila’ at night at the place and they shouldn’t be disturbed. As per SP (city) MP Singh, Sharma said he has been running his YouTube channel for past five years and earns Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 per month from it. He has around 45 lakh subscribers. “My cousin told me there’s a place in Vrindavan, where no one enters at night, as it is believed that misfortune strikes those who do so. I decided to make a video of the area around midnight,” he said. He confessed to uploading the video too. Soon after it was uploaded, an FIR was registered against unidentified persons under IPC and IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/influencer-in-14-day-custody-for-entering-temple-at-night/articleshow/87706106.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Environment minister Nilesh Cabral, in a letter to the Union government, stated that Goa is in the process of preparing a 100% renewable energy plan with assistance from the Union ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE). Goa requires approximately 540MW power during the day and 640MW during peak hours, 6pm to 11pm. The government has notified a solar policy with 50% subsidy on benchmark cost. However, till date, only about 15MW installations have been completed. “The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) is the nodal agency which interacts with MNRE for implementation of centrally sponsored schemes as well as schemes of the government of Goa in the field of new and renewable resources,” Cabral said. The state government has decided to set up floating solar power plants at Selaulim, Amthanem, Anjunem and Chapoli dams on a design, build, finance and operate model for a period of 25 years and has invited expression of interest (EoI) for selection of solar power developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-preparing-100-renewable-energy-plan/articleshow/87705014.cms||---

According to ministry sources, the details will be announced by December-end so that aspirants and institutions can start the preparations. The exams, as envisaged in the NEP 2020 are likely to be conducted twice a year. The computer-based common entrance test for the central universities, which includes the likes of JNU, BHU and DU, would comprise of three hours of testing divided into two sections -- Common Aptitude Test (50 questions) and Domain Specific Test (30 questions each)— and will eliminate the individual exams that many of the universities conduct presently. According to sources, the ministry is finalising the proposal based on the report of the committee set up by the UGC and the admissions to the central universities for the 2022-23 will be based on the CUCET score. “The ministry is ready to implement the CUCET from 2022 as planned under the NEP 2020. The details and the dates will be worked out soon. The ministry is planning to announce the details as early as possible so that the candidates and universities get time to prepare,” said the official. The official said that Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has asked the officials to work on the recommendations of the UGC to roll out its implementation without any further delay. “The exams were scheduled for implementation from 2021 and the ground work was completed in March 2021. However, due to the lockdown it couldn’t happen. While to start with the plan was to conduct it once, from 2022 the plan is to conduct it twice for the benefit of candidates,” said the official. According to the NEP 2020 document, “the National Testing Agency (NTA) will facilitate a single entrance exam for admissions to universities across the country. It will offer a ‘high quality common aptitude test’ like SAT examination, as well as specialised common subject examinations at least twice every year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/education-ministry-finalising-details-of-2022-entrance-test-for-central-varsities/articleshow/87706126.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Goa||‘Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time’||Arnold Rodrigues was at the peak of his prowess when he went ‘missing’ in 1984. The star midfielder was in terrific form as Goa won the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy outright for the first time that year. Arnold was named the best midfielder and player of the tournament. When India were scheduled to tour West Indies, he was the first name on the selectors’ list. But while the Salgaocar Sports Club medio happily left for the tour, he did not return to India. “Since the journey was long, we had a one-day stopover in London,” remembers Arnold. “My mum was there (in UK) and she came to the airport to take me home where I could spend the holidays. It was off-season for football in India, so I thought this was a good idea.” What started as a month or two of holidays took a dramatic turn when his mother hid the passport, leaving Arnold with no choice but to continue in UK. He stayed back reluctantly, calling his employers, Salgaocar, after 10 months to tell them that he won’t be able to represent the club again. Everyone was shocked. After all, Arnold, then aged 30, was among the best midfielders in the country. He was clearly at the top of his game, yet, even 36 years later, there are no regrets. “Many former players told me that I took the right decision. I can see many struggling (financially, after their playing days),” says Arnold. Why his mother – who moved to UK in 1975 -- decided to hold Arnold back is also understandable. Born in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, Arnold grew up watching his father, a prominent football referee, officiate matches in the National league. He took to the sport like fish to water, playing on the streets with a tennis ball. While Arnold was grabbing attention on the streets with his skills and goals, the late nights of football under streetlights didn’t help his cause at home. They were all concerned. When Arnold just wouldn’t stop going out even at night to play football, he was packed off to a boarding school in Goa. “At first glance, this place looked just like Africa,” says Arnold. Things were not the same, though. At the St Anthony’s High School boarding in Monte de Guirim, football plays an important part of any boarder’s life and it didn’t take too much time for the magician from East Africa to show that he was cut from a different cloth. “Since I had come from Dar es Salam, playing with the sturdy African boys, it was easy for me here,” says Arnold. Word soon spread about the special talent and he found himself doing duty for Panvel Sports Club after club secretary Antonio Botelho showed up at the boarding and asked him if he wanted to play in the top division. “That was my dream,” says Arnold. He lived his dream with Panvel SC for two years (1972-74), famously winning the Bandodkar Gold Trophy with the club. Salgaocar then came calling and he spent 10 hugely successful years, captaining the club to a triumph at the Puttaiah Memorial Soccer, their first major outstation trophy in 1978. “I must have attended about 16-17 national camps but was dropped on many occasions. I don’t blame anyone. India had great midfielders at the time and there was place for just two (in the starting 11),” says Arnold, who was a regular with the state team from 1975 to 1984. Arnold, though, was not to be denied his chance of representing the country. In 1977, he was part of the India team for the Goodwill tour to Zambia and Kings Cup in Bangkok. After a six-year hiatus, he made it to the top again, this time representing the country for the President’s Cup in Dhaka and Super Soccer in Delhi. “Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time,” says Arnold. “For us, there were no facilities, no coaching, no infrastructure. The grounds were so hard. They players now get to train and play on fantastic grounds. When they play, people across the world can see them live in action on television.” Fans here watched Arnold only on the ground with no footage available of how brilliantly he pulled the strings from midfield. All that remains are memories which old-timers happily recall. Arnold, they say, was terrific in Madras, now Chennai, when Goa won the Santosh Trophy in 1984. He made India take note of his talent but, sadly, that was the last time fans here saw him play for either the club, state or country. After that, he simply went ‘missing’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sometimes-i-think-i-was-born-at-the-wrong-time/articleshow/87705151.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Bombay HC says 4-year-old not competent witness in Pocso case, frees man||MUMBAI: Quashing a 2019 conviction under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), the Bombay high court said the sessions court had given “undue importance to a stray statement’’ of a four-year-old without ascertaining first whether the child could be a competent witness. Mumbai sessions court had convicted the accused to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in 2019. He was one of two accused in the case. The co-accused had been acquitted by the trial court. The HC said, “A child is a competent witness provided he is capable of understanding the questions put to him and is able to give rational answers.’’ But in this case, the child was barely four years old and of a tender age, and “it was obligatory” on the judge to ascertain first whether the child can depose as a competent witness, which the trial judge had not done, the high court added. The prosecution’s case was that the accused, who was hired to paint a room, had made the child sit on his lap. It was alleged that at 9.30pm, he then touched her private part and that the other man had slapped her. The child, who did not have the cognitive skills to remember, recollect and narrate an alleged sexual abuse by a painter-workman, had later in her cross-examination by the defence lawyer also said she was deposing as told by her mother, observed Justice Anuja Prabhudessai while acquitting the man convicted in the 2017 case. The prosecution’s case was based mainly on the child’s testimony. “Conviction can be based on the sole testimony of a child witness provided the witness is competent to depose to the facts and is a reliable witness,’’ said the HC. The man had been convicted under section 10 of Pocso for aggravated sexual assault, where minimum punishment is five years’ RI. Both the accused had pleaded they were not guilty. Observing that the trial court had “failed to evaluate competency’’ of the child as a witness, the HC scrutinised her evidence to ascertain whether her deposition can be relied on. The HC judgment noted that the child “was not trying to conceal the truth’’ and the tenor of her answers during trial indicate she lacked the intellectual capacity and maturity to understand the nature of questions and to give rational answers, hence she “cannot be considered to be a competent witness.” Besides, there is no confirmation of the identification of the accused in the case, the HC noted as the date of painting work was a day after the alleged crime, said the room owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-hc-says-4-year-old-not-competent-witness-in-pocso-case-frees-man/articleshow/87706135.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Sister to contest assembly polls, my time hasn’t come yet, says Sonu Sood||BATHINDA: Actor-philanthropist Sonu Sood, who emerged as a real-life hero for thousands of migrants during the lockdown, on Sunday announced his sister Malvika Sood Sachar’s intention to join Punjab politics, but added he has no such plans for himself. Sood, who is from Moga district, said his sister has done a lot of amazing work in the past and wanted to amplify her activities. Speaking to media persons in Moga, his hometown, Sood said Malvika would contest the next assembly elections. “The election manifesto, where political parties make a lot of promises but most of the time complaints keep coming up of (parties) not fulfilling these promises, should be a sacred document and parties must give a guarantee of fulfilling what they promise in a timely manner. Malvika will give an affidavit of standing by what she promises to the people. And if she fails to deliver, she will give up (politics),” he said. Sood, however, did not say from which party she would be joining, saying it will be announced at an appropriate time. Asked whether he would join politics, Sood said for now, he would support his sister to serve society in a better way. About their agenda for entering politics, he said education, health and unemployment would be the core areas for him and his family, and they would keep working for basic needs of quality education, affordable medical treatment and providing employment to the needy. For some time now, after he met Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi in August, there has been speculation about Sood testing the political waters. He had recently met Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh and his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh before that. He also plans to meet SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal soon. He called all the political leaders he has met as “wonderful people”, but had a special word of praise for Channi, saying he was a very humble and polite person. It is being said that PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu is also in touch with Sood and may meet him soon. Malvika has been working for people of Moga. Malvika said she had not considered joining politics and was more into charity. But there are expectations of the people and now the effort would be to serve them with full might, she said. Sood said after Covid-19, he has been concentrating on providing relief to people suffering from dengue, especially those needing dialysis. “A dialysis facility has been started from today,” he said, adding that anyone needing it should contact his family or the family-run Sood charity foundation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sonu-sood-says-sister-to-contest-punjab-assembly-elections/articleshow/87705135.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Channi’s RSS attack: Nat’l minorities panel chief says Golwalkar made ‘Punjabi as mother tongue’ appeal||Jalandhar: National Commission for Minorities chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura in a recent post on Facebook claimed that during the census of 1961, which also took into account regional languages, government enumerators would write Hindi in the mother tongue column for a Hindu person even when they would mention Punjabi. Just a day after Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi criticised the RSS in the state’s legislative assembly, Lalpura, in the post on November 12, asked “who was in the government” when the 1961 Census was carried out. The Congress was in power at the time. Lalpura’s assertions com at a time when the Congress-led Punjab government has been able to ensure the passage of ‘Punjabi and Other Languages Education (Amendment) Bill, 2021’ and ‘Punjab State Language (Amendment) Bill 2021’ in the state legislative assembly — a move which is being seen as a way to reach out to sections demaning implementation and propagation of Punjabi language. “A news report says that at that time, RSS chief Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar asked Punjabis to mention Punjabi as their mother tongue,” Lalpura wrote. Lalpura said in the 1960s, even as Punjab suffered the most during Partition, the then entire leadership of Congress, including the Prime Minister, backtracked from its promise to form a Punjabi language state. He also mentioned that police entered Darbar Sahib during Punjabi Suba agitation. “RSS is enemy organisation of Punjab,” CM Channi had said in state assembly on November 11. Describing the RSS as “a non-political, social organisation”, Lalpura said in the post: “Under what rules allegation is being levelled against an organisation which is not present in the assembly to defend itself. Which other social organisations have been discussed by the legislatures? Is it not aimed to create divisions in society? If members of the assembly and their leaders would come to this low level of debate and knowledge of issues of the state, who can save Punjab? Punjab is facing multi-organ failure,” he wrote. He has also written about the Naxalite movement in Punjab of 1960s. He said that Naxalites, at the time, would say that paddy should be grown in the sarovar (holy pond) of Darbar Sahib. In an apparent dig at Shiromani Akali Dal, he said all its noise on crucial issues of Punjab would fall silent after it came to power. Mentioning the days of militancy, Lalpura, who remained a police officer in Punjab and also served in intelligence department and as an SSP in the state police, said fake encounters took place during militancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channis-rss-attack-natl-minorities-panel-chief-says-golwalkar-made-punjabi-as-mother-tongue-appeal/articleshow/87705157.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Amarinder rubbishes claims of proposed meeting with Gandhis||Chandigarh: Former chief minister of Punjab Capt Amarinder Singh has dismissed the claims made by one of the cabinet ministers that he will return to the Congress and would soon be meeting the party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. “These are malicious and mischievous assumptions apparently made with an ulterior motive,” said Amarinder. He added that there was no question of his looking back ever since he was busy shaping up his party and giving the finishing touches to its organisational set up. “We are waiting for the registration of our party — Punjab Lok Congress — by the Election Commission of India and the allotment of the party symbol,” he added. Earlier in the day, social justice minister Raj Kumar Verka had made a statement in Amritsar that Amarinder could return to the Congress soon. The former chief minister had on November 2 tendered his resignation from the party stating that he was hurt by the conduct of Sonia and her children – Rahul and Priyanka. He had also revealed the name of his new political party the same day. Amid political turmoil in the Congress, Capt Amarinder had submitted his resignation as chief minister to Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on September 18, ahead of the Congress legislative party’s meeting stating that he was continuously humiliated for the past two months by the party high command. Meanwhile, Congress MP from Patiala and Amarinder’s wife Preneet Kaur met chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday, along with some municipal councillors from Patiala. The councillors claimed that they had met the chief minister to apprise about the local issues of Patiala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-rubbishes-claims-of-proposed-meeting-with-gandhis/articleshow/87705184.cms||---

Sharma said: "The festival is on November 19 and the followers of Guru Nanak must be allowed to travel to his birthplace in Pakistan. The corridor was opened on November 9, 2019, at the BJP’s initiative. The historic gurdwara is a mere 4.7 kilometres from the Indian border and should have been negotiated to be part of the Indian territory during Partition in 1947."

The visa-free corridor was closed due to the pandemic last year, as travel restrictions were imposed. The BJP delegation included party vice-president Sudan Singh, Punjab affairs co-incharge Dushyant Guatum, general secretary Tarun Chug, Narinder Singh Raina, RP Singh, Dyal Singh Sodhi, Harjit Grewal, Rajinder Mohan Singh Chinna, Santhok Singh Gumtala, and Vikramjit Cheema.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/reopen-kartarpur-corridor-by-gurpurab-punjab-bjp-to-pm/articleshow/87705188.cms||---

Sood, who is from the Moga district, said his sister has done a lot of work in the past and wanted to amplify her activities by contesting the forthcoming state assembly polls. "Malvika will give an affidavit of standing by what she promises to the people. And if she fails to deliver, she will give up (politics),” Sood said. Sood, however, did not spell out which party she would be joining, saying it will be announced at an appropriate time. Asked whether he would join politics, Sood said for now he will support his sister to serve society.

---||Goa||Under house arrest, pandemic hits kids’ mental health: Experts||PANAJI: Mental health repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic have been immense for children and adolescents. Several issues stem from them being away from school for a prolonged period. Chairperson of the state commission for protection of child rights, Peter Borges said the pandemic brought a complex array of challenges which have had mental health consequences, including grief, social isolation, fear, uncertainty, increased screen time etc, negatively impacting the mental health of children. Strong stabilising forces for children, friendships and family support were also dismantled during the pandemic, he says. Children have been coping with anxiety, stress and emotional tension due to physical inactivity, says pediatrician and member of the Goa chapter of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Sushma Kirtani. Under house arrest, they have been suffering from psychological problems, anxiety disorders, psychosomatic diseases, aggressive behaviour as well as panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder when they’ve lost a loved one in their family. “Many children and adolescents developed Covid obesity and have put on 10-12kg since the pandemic began from watching TV, surfing the internet, playing games online and snacking too often. Their parents are happy to see them chubby but there are many side effects of diabetes and high blood pressure, among others, that they must be cautious about,” she says. A child who came in with an upset stomach, vomiting and belching was found to be waking up at 12pm, having breakfast at 1pm and lunch at 5pm. Besides eating disorders, the excess screen time has meant that children have been presenting with neck and back pain, watering and redness of eyes and internet addiction disorders. With classes moving online and parents and in-charges of childcare institutions unable to monitor children’s internet usage, the state’s child welfare committees have received several cases of online abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents, especially girls. Several also accepted friend requests from strangers, got influenced and even ran away, chairperson of the child welfare committee North Goa, Esther Torrres said. They’ve also borne the brunt of domestic violence and have had suicidal ideation. “For the highly vulnerable group like children with special needs or marginalised or with chronic disorders, such as disabilities, already existing mental health problems, trauma experiences, children with HIV, cancer, and those from migrant background and low socio-economic status, this has been a more challenging time,” Borges says. The state needs to invest on scaling up mental health and psychosocial support as Covid-19 pandemic response, especially for vulnerable children, he says. “Otherwise, this will result in outcomes such as suicide, inability to live independently, school dropout, substance use, physical health problems, etc,” he said. Children of some migrant families were badly affected and have missed out on school altogether. “Some haven’t returned. Some have returned with a single parent after the father abandoned them, who want to put their children in a child care institution. There are cases of children finding it difficult to integrate into the culture and with the people of their home state as they grew up and studied here,” Torres says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/under-house-arrest-pandemic-hits-kids-mental-health-experts/articleshow/87705223.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Bengaluru||Drugs, alcohol caused one suicide every hour in 2020||BENGALURU: Deaths by suicide attributed to drug abuse and alcohol addiction continue to increase with 2020 seeing over 9,000 such cases at the rate of at least one every hour. Just two states, Maharashtra and Karnataka, account for more than 43% of cases. Psychiatrists and psychologists say people could be pushed to the brink either by underlying mental conditions amplified by alcohol and drugs, or the action could be influenced by other issues including financial distress and family problems. The number of such deaths increased by nearly 17% in 2020, compared to 7,860 reported the previous year as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. In 2019, suicides because of drug abuse and alcoholism accounted for 5.6% of over 1.3 lakh suicides across the country. Comparatively, such cases account for 6% of over 1.5 lakh suicides reported in 2020. Of 9,169 such deaths, 3,956 were from Maharashtra and Karnataka. Analysis of data from previous years shows that while Maharashtra has been topping the table since at least 2015, cases in Karnataka have been growing and brought the state to second place since 2018. It was in the third place in 2017. Between 2015 and 2020, nearly 40,000 deaths by suicide have been attributed to drugs and alcohol. Other than Maharashtra and Karnataka, three other states — Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala — also reported a high percentage in these years. In 2020, these states together accounted for 7,356 (over 80%) of total such deaths. There has been a consistent increase of such cases in the past five years with 2015 only reporting 3,670 cases. It is not just total number of such cases, but such suicides as a percentage of total suicides too has gone up. In 2015, such cases accounted only for 2.7% of total suicides. Multiple psychiatrists TOI spoke to said patients who are depressed and addicted to alcohol are prone to suicide and long-term use or consumption of large quantities can also cause substance-induced psychosis which can lead to suicide. While Maharashtra has seen a consistent growth in cases, Karnataka, which only had 94 such cases in 2015, has seen more significant spikes. The annual increase in Maharashtra has been in the range of 7% and 29%, while it’s been between 30% and 300% (2015 to 2018) in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drugs-alcohol-caused-one-suicide-every-hour-in-2020/articleshow/87706192.cms||Chethan Kumar

He said he was yet to take a decision about contesting the 2022 assembly election from Navelim constituency. “My interest will always be Goa and Navelim constituency. I will take an appropriate decision in the interest of the party, of my people and of Goa,” Faleiro said when asked if he would contest from Navelim for the assembly polls. TMC has nominated Faleiro for the Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal left vacant following the resignation of Arpita Ghosh nearly two months ago. He will file his Rajya Sabha nomination papers on Tuesday for the elections to be held on November 29. With TMC’s tally in the Bengal assembly rising to 218, Faleiro’s passage to the Rajya Sabha is but a formality. Speaking to TOI from Kolkata, Faleiro said that upon his entry into Rajya Sabha, “Goa will find a voice in the Parliament as TMC is the second largest opposition party.” Special status for Goa, recovering Rs 35,000 crore mining loot, and the three linear projects are the issues he will raise in the Parliament, he said. His nomination to the Parliament triggered speculation that it was a “broad hint” the party might not field him in the 2022 Goa assembly polls. Though Faleiro said he was currently undecided about contesting from Navelim, sources said that TMC was considering fielding a candidate propped up by Faleiro from Navelim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-decided-on-contesting-from-navelim-yet-luizinho/articleshow/87705240.cms||---

We do not want to do caste politics. We do not want to discriminate between people and make politics out of it. Priests present here must have seen the development in Aldona constituency,” he said during the Sarkar Tumchya Dari programme. “We have not referred to people with religion, but now some are trying to differentiate them as Hindu, Muslim, Christian among others,” Sawant said. Last week, after promising a list of populist schemes ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, in a bid to get the arithmetic right ahead of the electoral fray, AAP promised to appoint a chief minister from the Bhandari community if it wins the elections. Sawant said that till date BJP has never discriminated based on religion and Goa has never seen fights among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. “We are moving ahead with development,” he said. He said that all beneficiaries of different social security schemes will get regular payments from December 31. The CM said that a lot of people promise freebies in view of elections, but the people of Goa are smart. “It is very easy to come to Goa and announce something, but during the pandemic when the revenue to the state government was reduced, the state government did not stop any social welfare scheme,” he said. He said that the power tariff in Goa is the cheapest in the country. “Goans are not aware of power shutdowns. We have never had a power shutdown. When some people come from outside and speak about power, we believe them. People should check with their relatives about power issues in neighbouring states, especially in Delhi and we need not go to West Bengal,” the chief minister said. Sawant said that after BJP formed the government at the Centre, the state received Rs 20,000 crore for infrastructure development. He also said that Goa is the number one state in infrastructure development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-want-to-do-religion-caste-politics-says-sawant/articleshow/87705268.cms||---

Organised by the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) at Pragati Maidan in the national capital, IITF is one of the most awaited trade fairs in the South-Asian region. Goa is being represented by the department of information and publicity (DIP), Goa Investment Promotion and Facilitation Board (Goa-IPB), Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) and the department of tourism along with several other departments. “Apart from the day-to-day activities, there will be cultural performances by the Goan folk artists depicting the rich cultural traditions and sale of Goan handicrafts and artifacts by the artisans. Besides the rich cultural heritage, Goa’s hospitality sector will be projected and efforts will made to promote Goa as an international tourist destination and attract investment to boost industrial growth and tourism activity in Goa in a big way,” the government said in a statement. The trade fair could not be held last year due to the pandemic.

---||Guwahati||Wives of former poachers ladle out a ‘potboiler’ in Assam sanctuary||MANAS: When their husbands decided to forgo their dangerous life as poachers, women living in villages around Manas National Park of Assam had to soup up their traditional culinary skills to earn for their families. The journey of these women from the indigenous Bodo community has become an example today for others. Their decision to take up the job of keeping the family pot boiling after their husbands were brought back into the mainstream is now being showcased as a model by other community members. These women in and around Basbari range used their traditional culinary skills by offering Bodo dishes to tourists coming to the famed Manas National Park, known for one-horned rhino and royal bengal tiger, but the endeavour initially floundered due to absence of entrepreneurial skills. Mitali G Dutta, a culinary entrepreneur, came to know about their attempts and came forward to help the women in association with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) by skilling them and helping them market. “I started working with them in 2017 and began with giving tips on how to present a dish to a customer,” Dutta said. The women know their dishes best and no training is given to cook the items, but lessons are imparted on how much should be served, how the plates should be arranged and most importantly on the pricing to make it a sustainable business model, she said. “The Forest Department helped us by providing us space at the Bansbari Anti-Poaching Camp. There different villagers come and set up small food stalls,” Dutta said. The women formed ‘Gungzema Kitchen’ — an enterprise to showcase traditional and authentic Bodo food and cultural performances — during the Manas Spring Festival. Bhadri, one of the staff at Gungzema Kitchen, said that earlier survival in itself was a concern for them, but now all of them are earning and are self-dependent. A traditional Bodo platter served by Gungzema Kitchen contains about 7-8 items and is priced at Rs 500. Another member, Sharmila said, “When tourists sample our food, they usually tell us of how they relished our platter. It encourages us and makes us happy!” The off-seasons are utilised by the women to farm grains, vegetables and tend to poultry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/wives-of-former-poachers-ladle-out-a-potboiler-in-assam-sanctuary/articleshow/87706215.cms||---

The Goa Forward Party (GFP) legislator told reporters that there is drug trafficking in the coastal area and “a Pablo Escobar” is controlling it. For the trade to end, the CM has to act against the person who, he said, has brought a bad name to BJP. Paliencar, a former minister in the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government, said that the minister in question is pointing fingers at others for lack of development but “the fact is that there is a lot done by me in this Siolim constituency”. Further hitting out at the minister, Paliencar said that the type of development work that he has done since he became Siolim MLA has not been done in the adjoining constituency either. “Siolim has a history, the people here do not accept outsiders,” he said. Paliencar said that sub-stations have been be set up in the constituency and underground power lines have also been laid, besides hot mixing and asphalting of roads thta were neglected for many years. The process of setting up a 30MLD water project is about to start, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-min-to-stop-drug-trade/articleshow/87705307.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The North Goa collector has approved delayed entry and exit and half the usual capacity along with masks, sanitisation and social distancing of the faithful. Rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, Fr Patricio Fernandes said the ‘maddi’ will commence the celebration of the novena and feast of St Francis Xavier after the mass in the pandal at 6pm on November 23. The novenas begin on November 24 and continue through to December 2, culminating in the feast on December 3. The theme this year will be ‘Stay with us lord, to love communion, participation, mission like St Francis Xavier’. The high mass on the feast day will be celebrated by archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and emeritus bishop Alex Dias along with other priests at 10am. Pilgrims who occupied the corridors have been permitted to come and stay by registering themselves. Those who overflow from the corridor will be accommodated in the pilgrim tent to the south of the Basilica. “This year on account of the ban on fires and cooking, the pilgrims can avail themselves of food packages from our canteen,” Fernandes said. “For nearly two years devotees of Goemcho Saib have not freely visited the shrine or participated in the novena and feast, especially in the last year. But this year, special arrangements are made to encourage the faithful to safely come and pay their respects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/st-xavier-novenas-from-nov-24-amid-covid-protocols/articleshow/87705317.cms||---

Josh was high. And if you stood outside any of the exam centres, one thing was conspicuous by its near absence — parents chaperoning the girls. In fact, many of those TOI spoke to laughed and said their parents had no clue they were trying out for NDA. Others said they didn’t need to convince their parents — they were quite thrilled to hear their daughter wanted to be in uniform. The turnout was impressive — around 75% of the girls who had registered showed up for the test. Those who qualify will head for a five-day SSB — one of the most gruelling and unforgettable ‘interviews’ in the country. Many of them had set off from far-off districts in the wee hours to be on time for 8.30am muster. In Indore, Class 12 student Divya Patel, who had come from Pithampur, looked around and said: “It feels good to be here, like being part of history. I’m hoping I’ll get through, but even otherwise I can say I was among the first.” Some of the candidates were from military backgrounds, but most — over 60% — aim to be first-time faujis in their families. The candidates felt that they didn’t get enough time to prepare for the test. “We didn’t know if girls would be allowed from this year or the next,” said Bhaskar. It was on September 22 that Supreme Court rejected the government’s request to defer the exam till next year. “We gave hope to the girls. We cannot deny them that hope now,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/josh-high-as-first-batch-of-girls-sits-for-nda-exam/articleshow/87706236.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Goa||Cycling 6,800km to highlight marine pollution||PANAJI: At a time when fuel prices continue to burn a hole in everyone’s pocket, four men have decided to cycle over 6,800km along India’s coastline with a simple message ‘Burn Fat Not Fuel’ while also documenting the extent of plastic and marine pollution. Led by 56-year-old naval veteran Milind Tambe, the four cyclists will pedal across nine states in their bid to promote sustainable travel. The expedition began on Sunday with two riders pushing off from Goa’s capital with the other riders joining in at various stages of the Indian Coastal Cycling Expedition. Over the next 101 days, the cyclists will traverse through Karnataka and Kerala until they hit Kanyakumari for their first major pit stop. The next major pit stop will be at Visakhapatnam till they push on to Kolkata. From there, they will courier their cycles to Gujarat and pick up the trail from Bhuj. “The first objective is to promote sustainable travel. That’s why our hashtag is burn fat, not fuel. We want to promote sustainable travel,” said Tambe. The second objective of the entire team is to monitor the plastic pollution along the beaches. “So basically we would be mapping beaches wherever we find them to be excessively polluted. We will see what kind of plastic pollutants are there,” said Tambe. He is joined by 49-year old Pune resident Shriram Kondhawekar. The other two cyclists are 43-year-old IT professional Mandar and 30-year-old software designer Aakash Sinha. The Union ministry of sports and youth affairs has recognised the expedition under the Fit India movement. The ministry has asked the quartet to promote the concept of fitness. The four cyclists are part of a photography club and met in December 2020 during a visit to Brahma Tal in Uttarakhand, where they decided to cycle along the country’s coastline. Earlier this year, Tambe and Sinha tested their resolve by cycling from Mumbai to Goa. “The experience is going to be a lot richer than what it was in the first leg, and we’re looking forward to it,” said Tambe. Along the way, they will pitch their tents wherever possible or stay at homes of their local hosts while also doing some sightseeing. “We want to photograph each and every light house as best as possible. During the entire expedition, we hope to map the lighthouses, we may not be able to map some for security reasons, but wherever we can we would be taking pictures of each and every one that we come across,” said Kondhawekar. The expedition was flagged off by commandant 2 Signal Training Centre Brigadier A S Sawhney and superintendent of police (North) Shobhit Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cycling-6800km-to-highlight-marine-pollution/articleshow/87705330.cms||Newton Sequeira

Rane said both, Congress and BJP, have failed at development, leaving AAP as the only option. “Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane has been MLA for 50 years and was chief minister for more than 17 years. Despite this, he has failed to give the people of Poriem basic necessities,” he said. Sattari locals say that his decision will affect BJP in the 2022 polls since he has many supporters in Poriem. “My motivation for joining BJP then was Manohar Parrikar’s vision. Since the current government has lost that vision, I feel Arvind Kejriwal’s vision alone can transform Goa. Therefore, I have decided to join AAP.” “Many Sattari residents gave their land for the dam with the hope of 24X7 water supply. Unfortunately, they still struggle with water shortages. They rely on tanker supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-vishwajit-krishnarao-rane-to-join-aap/articleshow/87705340.cms||---

The ball is now in the Congress court.” Addressing reporters during the induction of two former BJP workers from Fatorda into GFP — Dattaprasad Mandrekar and Vanita Madkaikar — Sardesai disclosed his party’s plans of holding booth workers meetings soon, an exercise which he said would culminate on December 19 with a “yatra” across the state. Sardesai welcomed both new entrants in GFP’s fold. Fatorda Block president Peter Fernandes was also present. Sardesai added that he never did discrimination on party lines when it came to development of Fatorda. “During my tenure as MLA of Fatorda for the past 10 years, I have never harassed any BJP worker. We have put our efforts to take Fatorda forward.” He said that the ‘Future Ready Fatorda’ concept is to give a better future for children. “Proactive, positive and forward-thinking people are joining us, because they know that we are going forward by protecting our Goem, Goemkar and Goemkarponn,” Sardesai said. He said that the ‘development by consent’ which is taking place in Fatorda will take Goa forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clarity-on-alliance-by-dec-19-says-vijai/articleshow/87705344.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: At wind's mercy, nation capital breathes a sigh of relief, AQI 'very poor'||NEW DELHI: The capital got some relief on Sunday with air quality improving from "severe" to "very poor" category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 330 against 437 on Saturday. It is likely to remain in the "very poor" category for the next few days. Though the farm fire count remained high at 3,445, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 reduced from 31% on Saturday to 12% on Sunday due to reduction in transport-level wind speed. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said, "AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as winds at transport level are slowing down, resulting in lesser intrusion of farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi." Track the pollution level in your cityThere was also an improvement in the air quality owing to an increase in mixing layer height and decrease in moisture content. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, "There was no change in local winds as they were mostly light or calm in the last 24 hours at Safdarjung, while it was around 5-7kmph between 11.30am and 3pm at Palam. Reduction of moisture continued over Delhi with a relative humidity of 30-55%. However, anti-cyclonic wind pattern, which impacted the moderate to severe smog conditions, has shifted to southwest Delhi." Met officials said the visibility in smog was 1,000-1,500 metres over Safdarjung, while at Palam it remained at 1,500-2,200 metres since Saturday evening. No fog was reported on November 13 night or the next morning. The minimum temperature dropped to 10.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather said, "As the smog layer thinned, the sun increased insulation and warming of the atmosphere, thereby lifting the mixing layer height." Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas said, "The adverse air quality was also greatly impacted by a dust storm moving in from the southwesterly directions of Thar desert, which amplified the PM2.5 and PM10 levels significantly." SAFAR said air quality was likely to remain in the "very poor" category for the next few days. "If lockdown is implemented for the next two days, air quality may improve a little. However, it is likely to remain very poor for the next two days if the stubble burning share doesn't increase. AQI is likely to deteriorate from Tuesday night due to calm winds. On Wednesday, it is likely to be in the upper end of the very poor category."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-winds-mercy-delhi-breathes-a-sigh-of-relief-aqi-very-poor/articleshow/87706225.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||New private forest areas come to light||Panaji: The review committee carrying out ground verification of additional private forest areas in the state, as identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees, has found in the process new private forest areas. The body’s sub-committees carrying out the groundwork have found land adjacent to areas identified as private forests by the committees. The ground officers have told the review committee that these new areas also appear to qualify as private forests. The review committee has decided to inform the state government about these new private forest areas. “The member secretary invited the attention of the committee members that as per the patches provided by the Forest Survey of India, there are large green areas of more than 5ha and more than 40% canopy density found outside the survey numbers provisionally identified by Thomas & Araujo committees. However, the review committee is reviewing only the areas provisionally identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees as per the mandate given to the committee,” the review committee was informed at its meeting in August this year. The sub-committees felt that the ground verification can only be complete if these adjoining new patches of forests are taken into account. “It is also noticed that in some cases, the patch extends to the areas adjacent to the survey numbers which are not identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees and that the review can only be completed if the entire patch is verified in the field,” the review committee was told. The example of two survey numbers at Velim in Salcete taluka were shown to the committee. However, the review committee decided that it will only work within the mandate provided to it for now. “The committee observed that its mandate is to review only the areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees, but this issue may be brought to the notice of the government,” the review committee has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-private-forest-areas-come-to-light/articleshow/87704829.cms||---
---||India||SC ruling may deter builders from challenging Rera orders||NEW DELHI: In what could be a relief for homebuyers and deter builders from the usual practice of resorting to long legal recourse by challenging orders of Rera authorities, the Supreme Court in a recent judgment has upheld a provision in the real estate law, which makes it mandatory for builders to deposit full compensation and interest ordered by the regulator or at least 30% of the penalty as a pre-condition for challenging any such order before the appellate authority. The court has also upheld the provision that the appellate authority has the freedom to increase the mandatory deposit beyond 30%. While the penalty imposed by the Rera authorities goes to the Consolidated Fund of India or the state account, the refund is the entitlement of the customer. Homebuyers’ organisations said this judgment by a three-member bench, led by Justice U U Lalit on Thursday, will put an end to harassment of customers as builders found it a better option to challenge the Rera orders than paying the refund amount to the buyers. The SC held that the condition of pre-deposit imposed on promoters for filing appeals under Section 43(5) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act is neither discriminatory nor a violation of constitutional provision. The court observed: “The intention of the legislature appears to be to ensure that the rights of the decree holder (the successful party) is to be protected and only genuine bona fide appeals are to be entertained…the intention of the instant legislation appears to be that the promoters ought to show their bona fides by depositing the amount so contemplated.” Abhay Upadhyay, president of PFCE, an umbrella body of homebuyers, said, “This is a landmark judgment. We can now hope that this plugs all the loopholes and the builders must deposit the full refund ordered by the Rera authorities before going for any appeal. This will also filter the appeals which were intended only to harass homebuyers.” The pre-deposit provision was made to ensure that the money which has been computed by the authority must be safeguarded so that consumers don’t have to run from pillar to post to get their due, if the appellate authority passes order in favour of the buyer. The SC also upheld the retroactive application of Rera to the real estate projects which were ongoing at the commencement of the Act. Earlier, the Bombay HC had passed a similar order when different builders had challenged the applicability of the law to projects which had already started by the time the law was notified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-ruling-may-deter-builders-from-challenging-rera-orders/articleshow/87706263.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||‘Bizarre’ eligibility norms for posts put docs with disabilities in a bind||NEW DELHI: You are ineligible for the post of ENT, urology or dental surgeon if you cannot use both legs, but eligible if your disability affects both arms. “Why are those with both legs affected barred from these surgical specialties while allowing those with both arms affected? Do they conduct surgery with their legs?” asked a doctor with disability about the bizarre identification of posts. The strange identification of posts for doctors with disabilities came to light when the organisation Doctors With Disability: Agents of Change (DwDAoC) raised the issue of institutes of national importance including all the AIIMS advertising posts for recruitment without including the latest identified posts for persons with disabilities. Though a January notification of the social justice and empowerment ministry has identified hundreds (593) of more posts for those with disability than the last notification in 2013, DwDAoC has challenged the very concept of identifying posts, especially in the medical field. “The identification of posts for doctors with disabilities continues to categorise people according to body parts such as OA OL BL (one arm, one leg, both legs) rather than seeing their functional ability. Unlike post-graduation in other disciplines, in medicine, it combines active duty with studies. No matter what their disabilities, if they have a post graduate degree in a specialty, it means they are capable of carrying out the job for which they have specialised. However, many such specialists cannot get a job as posts in their specialty have not been identified as being open for persons with their specific disability,” explained Dr Sharad Philip, a DwDAoC member. The January notification identifies posts in urology and ENT (ear, nose, throat), two surgical specialties, as open to OA, BA, OL (one arm, both arms and one leg) but not for someone with both legs affected (BL). There is a surgeon super specialising in urological surgery both of whose legs are affected who conducts surgeries using a standing wheelchair. However, he will be ineligible for any post as he is ‘BL’. Similarly, in the case of psychiatry, persons with visual disability are excluded. However, Dr Philip, who has low vision due to retinitis pigmentosa, has completed post-graduation in psychiatry in the premier institute for mental health in India, NIMHANS, Bangalore. Going by the government’s notification, he will not be eligible for any faculty post in psychiatry. However, the notification identifies the post of faculty of medicine for persons who are blind or have low vision. There are also essential activities listed against each post. These include S (sitting), ST (standing), KC (kneeling and crouching), MF (manipulation with fingers), SE (seeing) and C (communication). Of these, kneeling and crouching is listed as a functional requirement for posts in surgical specialties like ENT and urology and for psychiatry. Senior residents in psychiatry do not have to kneel or crouch, but have to be capable of bending and lifting. DwDAoC’s letter pointing out these “absurd” stipulations has been forwarded to the social justice and empowerment ministry for “appropriate action”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bizarre-eligibility-norms-for-posts-put-docs-with-disabilities-in-a-bind/articleshow/87706266.cms||Rema Nagarajan

---||Nagpur||After grad constituency debacle, BJP taking MLC polls seriously||Nagpur: Wary after its crushing defeat in the graduates’ constituency elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not taking the December 10 MLC polls lightly. The party’s strategy makers have already started preparing for not only the Nagpur seat, but also others at Mumbai, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Buldhana, and Washim. The saffron leadership’s apprehensions are not ill-founded. In 2009 elections, former minister Rajendra Mulak won with a wafer-thin margin of just four votes against sitting BJP MLC Ashok Mankar. That time too the BJP had more numbers in the local civic bodies and was ruling Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). BJP city president Pravin Datke told TOI that the party wouldn’t be taking any chances even though their victory was a foregone conclusion due to advantage of about 65 seats. “In view of our defeat in graduates constituency polls in December last year, we would be careful while devising poll strategies. We will ensure that there is no overconfidence among activists and leaders while going to the polls,” he said. For BJP, winning the seat is also a prestige issue considering that two of its biggest leaders – Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who is also former chief minister – hail from the city. Any defeat in their home town directly affects their credibility. In graduates’ constituency polls, Congress Abhijit Wanjari defeated former mayor and favourite Sandip Joshi by a big margin of 18,910 votes, even though the seat was a BJP bastion ever since it was formed and represented by party heavyweight Gadkari. The unexpected loss for the first time on this MLC seat in 58 years had jolted the saffron party from within and raised several questions on credibility of its biggest leaders. Earlier, the party suffered a defeat in 2019 assembly elections in the district as it managed to win just six seats out of 12 in comparison to 2014, when it won 11, when state minister Sunil Kedar was the lone winner from Congress. Speaking on the party’s loss in 2009, sitting MLC Girish Vyas said cross voting by four Kamptee councillors had turned the tide in opposition’s favour that time. “We will ensure that such situation is not repeated. I am launching a book on Friday highlighting my work in the constituency in last six years. It would be unveiled by Gadkari and other top party functionaries at Suresh Bhat Hall. We have really done a commendable job during the Covid-19 crisis by not only spending funds, but also providing all kinds of help during the emergency,” he told TOI. BOX # WHAT BJP IS WARY OF * Suffered humiliating defeat in its own den in graduates constituency polls * Seat was BJP’s bastion since beginning, since 58 years * Heavyweights like Union minister Nitin Gadkari had usually won seat * Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) would be contesting polls with full might * In 2015, Congress withdrew its candidate after an unofficial pact with BJP * In 2009 polls, Congress’ Rajendra Mulak won by just four votes * He managed to defeat Ashok Mankar due to cross voting by Kamptee councillors * Party failed to retain seats in 2019 assembly polls * It managed to win just 6 of 12 seats, as compared to 11 in 2014||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-grad-constituency-debacle-bjp-taking-mlc-polls-seriously/articleshow/87704894.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Airport director Gagan Malik said there is quite a lot about Goa that people do not know and that the airport authorities are attempting to highlight those facets. As part of the initiative, the arrival lounge and the aiprort’s compound wall have art work showcasing various heritage sites of Goa. The entrance gate, meanwhile, has been given a carnival look with face masks decorating the area and colourful illumination at night. “People feel that Goa is about beaches and merry-making. But Goa is also a serious destination that is rich in heritage. It’s nice to see people taking selfies at the entrance gate of airport. Visitors are also often seen exploring Goa at the airport itself,,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/visitors-to-get-feel-of-goa-right-from-airport/articleshow/87704903.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||As air turns fouler, Haryana asks schools in 4 NCR districts to shut for a week||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Sunday directed four NCR districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonipat — to shut down schools and halt construction activity for the next seven days in the wake of deteriorating air quality. The order, in line with a similar directive by the Delhi government on Saturday, was issued by additional chief secretary SN Roy. The order said the air quality across NCR and neighbouring areas were far below the “accepted norms” and could prove to be detrimental to the health of children all the more. On Saturday, the Supreme Court had taken cognisance of the foul air quality in the region and directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent steps to reduce AQI levels, asking “how will people breathe?” Following the apex court’s observation, a meeting was convened by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas. Apart from asking schools to stay shut, the Haryana government also directed offices to instruct their employees to work from home. “After considering the present situation, the government of Haryana has decided to take quick action with a view to lower the air pollutants immediately. For the next seven days in the four NCR districts, it has been directed that all schools remain closed. All government, private establishments operate their non-essential activities from home. The idea is to reduce 40% vehicular load from the roads,” Roy said in the order. Construction and demolition activity, according to the order, must be stalled immediately. The government also asked the authorities to ensure there was no instance of waste burning in the open and manual sweeping. The civic bodies, it said, will have to ensure regular sprinkling of water on the roads to help the dust settle down. After staying in the “severe” category for the last two days, Gurugram’s air quality slid to “poor” on Sunday because of better wind speed. On Sunday, the AQI in the city was at 287, down from 441 on Saturday. But since November 2, Gurugram’s air quality has hovered around the “very poor” to “severe” mark. Officials in the pollution department said the AQI might again dip to “very poor” in the coming week. On Sunday, only one of four air monitoring stations in Gurugram recorded AQI in the “very poor” category. While Gwal Pahari recorded the highest AQI of 302 (very poor), Sector 51 clocked 292, Vikas Sadan 297 and Teri Gram 257. According to the central Pollution Control Board, a “very poor” AQI can lead to “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”. Several private hospitals in the city have already been reporting a surge in cases of respiratory illnesses. The state pollution control board officials said the civic authorities and other agencies were following all measures as laid down under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). “All civic agencies are managing the situation on the ground to ensure the air quality becomes breathable again. Although there was an improvement in AQI on Sunday, their air quality is likely to drop in the coming days because of a dip in the temperature,” an official said. He also pointed out that the air was better on Sunday because there were fewer vehicles on the road. Gurugram, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), recorded a minimum temperature of 11°C on Sunday. When the mercury is low, it prevents the dispersal of pollutants closer to the ground. The AQI across NCR wasn’t any better. Delhi, meanwhile, registered “very poor” air on Sunday, with an AQI of 330. On Saturday, the AQI was 437 (severe) in the capital. The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 also reduced to 12% on Sunday from 31% the previous day, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR). Faridabad, too, had “poor” AQI (298). On Saturday, it was 423. The AQI in Sonipat was 288 on Sunday and 324 on Saturday. Jhajjar recorded an AQI of 296 on Sunday against 416 a day earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-air-turns-fouler-hry-asks-schools-in-4-ncr-districts-to-shut-for-a-week/articleshow/87704825.cms||Ipsita Pati

The protesters outside the complex stuck to their guns demanding the use of the existing building site for the new home. Various speakers at the protest said they would not allow the felling of decades-old trees for the centrally-funded project. Former MLA Victor Gonsalves said a new project at the cost of trees would impact the heritage site. Sanjay Ghatwal, an activist from Merces, said that while pursuing such projects proper assessment of environmental damage is not done and this is triggering disasters. “We are not against development but it should be done with minimal damage while protecting trees,” he said. After a series of protests in September, the issue heated up again after Provedoria sought police protection to axe the trees. Local activists Ana Gracias, Tukaram Kunkolkdar, Michael Dias and others spoke during the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chimbel-locals-continue-to-protest-against-tree-axing/articleshow/87704929.cms||---

In a variation from regular celebrations, the youngsters, along with their parents, headed off to Colva beach early Sunday morning, but instead of an expected swim in the sea or building of sand castles, the group undertook a clean-up of the beach. Within just about an hour, the children had collected 10 kg of waste from the beach. The parents of these children, mostly professionals, organised the clean-up in a bid to provide a meaningful celebration of Children’s Day for their kids. The idea was conceptualised by IT professionals Salomi and Samir Utagi. who are parents to Saanvee, 9, and Shloke, 5. “On the occasion of Children’s Day, we usually think of giving something to the children and it’s mostly food, it could be cakes or goodies. So, instead, we thought of giving them the idea of a safe and healthy planet for their future, making them responsible for it and setting an example by being a part of the cleaning activity with them,” Samir said. The children love the beach and seeing it littered isn’t a great sight. But why stop and complain when you can make a difference, he added. The group started out at 7.30am and managed to collect a total of 10 kg of waste. “The children left the beach feeling proud of their small yet impactful contribution to a cleaner country and a sustainable environment,” said Salomi. Small steps like these from each one of us every day can make a huge difference in the long run, said Saawni Kunde, the mother of the youngest participant, three-year-old Keya. “Being a part of the activity was fulfilling not just for me but for my three-year-old as well. It’s been my goal to make my daughter Keya aware of the environmental issues and protection,” she said. Aarav, Aaryaansh, Kanishka, Akshat and Kamaxi and their parents were the other participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-childrens-day-little-hands-achieve-big-feat-at-colva/articleshow/87704952.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Nagpur||PWD spent Rs1.1k cr to widen Nagpur, Gondia, Bhandara roads||Nagpur: Even as roads in some parts of the city are in bad condition, the state’s public works department (PWD) has concretized/asphalted and widened a few inter-district roads in Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia districts at the cost of Rs1,103 crore in the last two years. Two major roads in the city are part of PWD’s project. As per data available from the office of PWD superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh, over 95% works of six packages approved under hybrid annuity model (HAM) have been completed in these three districts. Minor works including footpath, road-divider, markings etc are likely to be completed soon. Under six packages, 378.48km long roads have been widened, concretized/asphalted — 136.22km in Nagpur, 130.36km in Bhandara and 111.9km in Gondia. The PWD came up with the HAM model for the first time in 2019 to execute large number of works simultaneously. Earlier, it used to execute works only on limited roads every year due to low budget. Under HAM, the private contractors gets 40% payment after project completion and remaining 60% in equal instalments in 10 years. The work is supposed to be completed in one and a half year. The contractors will have to maintain the roads for 10 years. The PWD will pay Rs20.71 crore for operation and maintenance of these six packages. North Ambazari road from Rani Jhansi Square to Vivekananda Memorial and the road from Ambazari T-point to Nagpur University Campus Square have been widened wherever required and concretized. Both these roads were in a sorry state. North Ambazari road was also damaged to a great especially after works of Metro Rail corridor. Now, minor works like road-divider etc are going on between Ambazari T-point and Campus Square. There are sprawling lakes, tiger reserves, religious places, water fountains etc in Bhandara and Gondia districts.

The pachyderms, believed to be from Baikunthapur forest, travelled along the Teesta river bank, went into Paharpur, crossed the busy NH31D and walked into the town. Although the administration imposed Section 144 of CrPC, its implementation was poor as thousands tried to get a peek at the jumbos. The elephants were discovered around 3am on Sunday by the night guard at a Covid hospital in Biswa Bangla Krirangan, in the heart of Jalpaiguri town. Hearing noises, Bibhuti Roy grabbed his lathi and came out of his shelter, thinking there were thieves on the prowl. “Two elephants were roaming around on the Biswa Bangla Krirangan campus. It was difficult for me to believe what I was seeing. I came back my senses on hearing one trumpeting,” Roy said. The jumbos entered Topamari area in ward no.2, breaking the gate of the Jalpaiguri BL & LRO office on the way. They then entered Biswa Bangla Krirangan campus, broke open its fencing and crossed the Karala river to enter ward no.24. From there, they went behind Arabindu Byamagar O Pathagar Club through Pabitra Nagar colony to take refuge in a graveyard. To distract the elephants from raiding Pabitra Nagar colony, power was cut. “These are maljuria elephants. Such jumbos have the habit of trying to explore new routes. But they often turn ferocious when they do not get enough food after being holed up for long,” said state wildlife advisory board member Animesh Bose. Foresters from Lataguri and Moraghat range, Ramsai, Binnaguri, Belakoba, Malbazar, Airawat and Sukna WL squads and Jalpaiguri Mobile Patrolling Party could not drive away the animals till late evening. “We are trying to make the elephants return to the forest. But it’s not an easy task, especially in places where there is a thick habitat,” said Mridul Kumar, divisional forest officer, Jalpaiguri division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-jumbos-enter-jalpaiguri-town-prohibitory-orders-imposed/articleshow/87705333.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

Subramaniam, a 34th-batch alumnus of the post-graduate programme, expressed his gratitude to the institute, saying it taught him the “ability to think from first principle” and apply it to the country’s economic recovery after Covid. Narasimhan, a 21st-batch alumnus, urged students to challenge their limitations and “do something to make the planet a better place to live in”. Sambamurthy, an 18th batch alumnus, said: “The two most important words are ‘integrity’ and ‘fun’. It is up to us to live a life of integrity and give back to the institute but at the same time, we need to seize the moment and enjoy the company we have.” Alagh, a 3rd-batch alumnus, said people should not focus on how to live but plan how to die. “Real happiness comes from how you plan to die, how people are going to remember you after your death,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, Shrikrishna Kulkarni, chairperson of the IIM-C board of governors, emphasised the need to prepare managers not just for industrial, financial and commercial enterprises but also as enablers of social change and national development. The Diamond Jubilee Lecture was delivered online by noted social scientist and IIM-C alumnus Dipesh Chakrabarty on ‘Business Education in the Anthropocene: Some Questions For Our Times’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iim-c-confers-prestigious-award-on-its-four-alumni/articleshow/87705381.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

BJP did not immediately respond to the allegations or the video of the meeting shared by Trinamool. TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev demanded immediate arrest of the Ramnagar MLA. Trinamool spokesman Kunal Ghosh said Dutta needed to be arrested as he had violated a Supreme Court directive and was threatening TMC candidates. He said all these showed that BJP was afraid of Trinamool. The video clip tweeted by Tripura Trinamool Congress showed MLA Dutta asking BJP partymen to chase away Trinamool candidates. He said as BJP had faced torture in past three decades, the same should be paid back. He even mentioned that he was shot at seven times in the past. Trinamool also tweeted the letter of BJP MLA Sudip Roy Burman written to the DGP on Saturday on the law and order situation in Tripura in which he asked for ensuring free and fair polls so that voters can vote fearlessly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-seeks-arrest-of-tripura-bjp-mla-over-threats/articleshow/87705377.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cash-for-candidate audio raises political pitch in civic poll run-up||Kolkata: A cash-for-candidate allegation surfaced on Sunday with Trinamool Congress releasing an audio clip on its Twitter handle in which a person is heard negotiating for Rs 1 lakh each for nomination of 12 candidates in the upcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls. One among the persons in this conversation was allegedly South Kolkata BJP worker Pritam Sarkar, who had defected from Trinamool to BJP several months ago. Sarkar claimed the audio clip was fake and denied having any such conversation in the first place. He also threatened legal action. Police said no complaint was lodged till Sunday evening. Bengal BJP, however, kept Sarkar off any organizational work until he could clear himself of the allegations. On Sunday morning, Trinamool posted an audio of a purported telephonic conversation between a person alleged to be Sarkar and another unidentified person that went viral. In the clip, a conversation is heard to broker a deal. One speaker – alleged to be Sarkar – is also heard saying he is close to Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar and will have a word with him over selection of candidate for the forthcoming civic poll. He also demanded from the other person Rs 1 lakh each for 12 candidates. Majumdar termed the incident a ploy to tarnish BJP’s image. “The person (Sarkar) who is heard on the clip was a Trinamool Congress worker earlier. He used to organize several fairs and other events for Trinamool,” he said. Trinamool tweeted: “@BJP4Bengal is demanding Rs 1 lakh for each candidate. @DrSukantaBJP, is this how you collect funds for your propaganda?” Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said BJP had reached a state of desperation and alleged that its workers were collecting funds this way. As the clip went viral, Sarkar said he would take steps to bust the fake news. “This is fake audio and I got it last night. My photo was used in the video and that was fake. I am nowhere associated with such a conversation. Definitely someone has circulated it with political motives. Someone is trying to tarnish my image,” he said. “This is not the first time such fake videos about BJP leaders went into circulation,” Sarkar continued. “A few days back, someone had put up banners in the name of the South Kolkata district president of BJP. Such attacks are normal for BJP workers.” Sarkar joined BJP barely a year ago. He was not given any official responsibility, but was seen participating in debates and youth parliament workshops. “We have asked him not to participate in any organizational work till he proves himself innocent. It is a duty to clear himself of charges,” said Shankar Sikdar, BJP’s South Kolkata president. “There are many who have joined BJP and it is not possible to keep a tab on each. He is a mere karyakarta. But we will allow him to join any organizational work after he proves himself innocent,” Sikdar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cash-for-candidate-audio-raises-political-pitch-in-civic-poll-run-up/articleshow/87705323.cms||Rohit Khanna

While some of the animals were driven 11-12km from Bhalki’s Pratappur jungle, mothers and calves remained far behind. Forest staff on Sunday said their plan to herd out the pachyderms had to be stalled because of rain around 4pm. At present, the herd is roaming in separate groups between Pratappur jungle and Jamtara jungle under Ausgram (II). Forest officials and hulla parties have been deployed to different positions. Arup Middya, anchal sabhadhipati of Bhalki panchayat, told TOI: “We are also ready with a 100-member team. We have this big a group because elephants have entered Bhalki jungle several times. Our teams also cooperate with the forest department and administration. They guarded the villages with burnt tyres at night.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/burdwan-elephant-herd-now-split-in-two/articleshow/87705387.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||World||‘Afghanistan doesn’t want conflict with any country, including India’||ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s interim foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, in an interview to BBC Urdu, has said that his country does not want conflict with any other country, including India. He added that the Islamic Emirate now controls the entire country and Daesh (the militant Islamic State group) has been eliminated from most of Afghanistan. “We do not want Afghanistan to have a conflict with any other country or have challenges arise that could affect our nation. When we participated in the Moscow conference, the representatives of India, Pakistan and several other countries were also present. We had a positive conversation with New Delhi and others,” Muttaqi responded when asked about relations with India. Calling Daesh a threat, the Afghan minister said the Taliban government has eliminated it from a major part of the country. “Previously, 70% of Afghanistan was under the control of the Islamic Emirate and the Daesh only had presence in areas ruled by the former Afghan government. After the Taliban took over, the government took effective measures to control them and confine them to certain areas,” he added. The Afghan minister further said that his country has been acting as a mediator between Pakistan and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the desire of both parties. “The two sides have not yet reached an agreement, but the process has had a good start, leading to the announcement of a month-long ceasefire,” Muttaqi said, adding that he was hopeful that the process would not face obstacles in the future and that relations between the Pakistan government and TTP would improve. Dispelling the impression that women were being excluded from education and work in offices in Afghanistan, Muttaqi said: “Women have 100% inclusion in the health sector. They are also in the education sector. They are working in every sector where they are required. Our government has not fired any female official who had worked under the previous government.” “We have no such policy to deny women of their rights in any field. Their salaries, as well as opportunities for education and employment, were also not affected,” he added. Muttaqi claimed that the Taliban government has fulfilled the international community’s demand for an inclusive government. He said that since the Afghan government consisted of representation from all areas and ethnicities, the world should recognise it. “The incumbent Afghan government comprises staff and workers from the previous set-up that come up to approximately 5,00,000 people. If the world had recognised the previous government as an inclusive government, then why not us? If they mean a cabinet representing all areas, then we have a minister from Panjshir. People from Badakhshan, Faryab, Kandahar, Nangahar and Kabul are also present in the cabinet. Therefore, every country has its own definition of an inclusive government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistan-doesnt-want-conflict-with-any-country-including-india/articleshow/87704609.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The annual music and dance festival is also celebrating the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav this year and will feature artistes and performers from all over the country. Kaushalya ReddyRonu MajumdarThe hybrid event was held at Natya Tarangini, which has been established by celebrated Kuchipudi exponents Raja and Radha Reddy, who also performed at the event. From sanitisers placed at the entrance to having socially distanced seating, the amphitheatre was set to welcome its eager audience. Artistic collaboration was the focal point for this year’s festival, and one of the highlights of the evening was an enthralling jugalbandi between flautist Ronu Majumdar and Kuchipudi dancer Yamini Reddy. Yamini said, “During the pandemic, we saw everybody coming together and helping each other. This is our way as artistes to represent the same sense of unity.” Emphasising on the importance of a live audience for any musician or performer, Ronu Majumdar said, “We were all really missing the feel of a live concert, weren’t we? I hope this is one of many collaborations and live concerts we have.” Raja Reddy elaborated on the message that the artistes were trying to convey through the festival and said, “Plant seeds of love in your heart, let them grow into trees of service – trees that bloom fruits of joy and then share that joy with everybody.” Yamini Reddy Shruthi Parasa, a lawyer and entrepreneur, was quite excited to be in the audience. “I have waited for events to come back to the stage. The online experience is nothing compared to what performers can do live,” she said. Chinmaya Iyer, a classical vocalist, said, “I’m an artist myself, so I know the importance of a live audience and feel that offline concerts should definitely make a comeback.

The twin ordinances amend the Central Vigilance Commission Act and the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, which govern the ED and the CBI, respectively. They pave the way for extension of the terms of the chiefs beyond the mandatory two years by another possible three years, through three extensions of a year each. The amendment to the CVC Act overrides a recent Supreme Court order where the apex court had held that the government could not prolong the tenure of the current ED chief SK Mishra beyond November 18 when his extended tenure runs out. With the changed law, the government can, if it so desires, extend Mishra’s tenure for another two years, through two extensions of a year each. As per the ordinances, any extension for chiefs of the agencies beyond two years will have to be recommended by a committee which ought to record in writing the reasons explaining why prolonging the tenure would be in “national interest”. A 1984-batch IRS officer, Mishra was first appointed as the director of ED on November 18, 2018 as principal special director and was promoted as additional secretary: the rank assigned until then to the ED director. Mishra was subsequently promoted to secretary and, accordingly, the post of ED director also got elevated to the same rung. Mishra, the first IRS officer chosen to head the anti-money laundering agency after LK Singhvi who held the charge in 1992, is seen as one of the most powerful government functionaries. The profile of ED, which had so far remained under the shadow of the CBI, has risen considerably under him. The CBI is not going to be impacted by the ordinance immediately as its chief, Subodh Jaiswal, a 1985-batch officer, is in the first year of his two-year tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-chiefs-can-now-be-in-office-for-up-to-5-years/articleshow/87705130.cms||---
---||World||Glasgow climate deal reached, progress made but not enough||GLASGOW: After facing tense moments in the final hours when India had its way in replacing a reference to “phasing out” of coal with “phase down”, a change that reduces the mandatory nature of the wording, the COP26 concluded with the Glasgow Climate Pact late Saturday night calling countries to further strengthen their 2030 emission reduction targets by next year. As with the emissions targets where progress was made but success remained elusive, the decision on “loss and damage” lacked a clear plan for a funding facility, much to the disappointment of climate vulnerable countries. Work on having a definite plan to compensate disaster-hit countries will now be shifted to COP27 in Egypt next year. Some nations criticised India’s insistence on a softer reference to fossil fuels, but Indian officials said the country has voluntarily set aggressive green energy targets and there is need for an overall view of issues, including finance to developing nations. The pact also moves on finalising the last piece of the unfinished agenda — a mechanism for a carbon market (Article 6) and transparency — of the Paris Agreement rulebook. The declaration also promises to deliver greater amounts of finance to developing countries by deciding to double the quantum for adaptation by 2025 and take steps to help vulnerable countries deal with losses and damages from climate impacts. The overall pact was finally adopted when the COP26 presidency accommodated India’s concerns where the country objected to phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. The change from “phase-out” to “phase-down” with respect to coal power use in the final text was agreed during the last-minute amendments to build the consensus. Just before convening the final plenary, UK COP26 president Alok Sharma and his team members were seen trying to convince India’s environment minister Bhupender Yadav over the text as the latter strongly objected to it on the reference of coal and fossil fuel while intervening during the stock taking. Both leaders were even seen looking at the amended version which Yadav finally proposed and the plenary accepted. India, in fact, got the amended paragraph by opting “phase-down” for coal in the final text instead of “phase-out” and even included points on “targeted support to the poorest and the most vulnerable in line with national circumstances” while referring to fossil fuel subsidy, even as Switzerland and EU objected to it before reluctantly agreeing on it as a compromise to finally arrive at the Pact. It was quite an emotional moment for Sharma who chaired the plenary that finally adopted the COP26 decision. It reflected the difficult moments which he negotiated as he sought to bring all countries on board through little compromises on different fronts. Though smaller island nations and Mexico, along with Switzerland and EU, criticised India’s move on watering down the text on coal and fossil fuel by calling it a bad economic choice, Indian delegation defended the country’s position. A senior official from Indian delegation said, “All fossil fuels are bad for the environment. Singling out coal without talking about other fossil fuels like natural gas is not the best way forward. But India, in the spirit of compromise, helped evolve language that was acceptable to all. This language takes care of concerns of many developing countries including India.” He further said, “India has always maintained that it does not favour sectoral targets. We have taken on economy wide target like reduction in emission intensity of GDP. This gives countries more flexibility to meet mitigation targets in line with the national circumstances and developmental needs. One size fits all approach is not the best way to evolve consensus on global issues.” China too wanted clarity on coal and fossil fuel references. However, it was India which decided to call it out during the stocktake and finally Yadav suggested the amended paragraph which was adopted by all countries. Nevertheless, it was for the first time the coal and fossil fuel subsidies found place in the COP decision text, making the issue much more important in the context of the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius at a time when the world would try to collectively achieve ‘net zero’ (carbon neutrality) by 2050. In any case, India’s substantial focus on renewable energy and its commitment to increase non-fossil fuel installed electricity capacity to 500 GW by 2030 and achieving 50% of cumulative electric power installed capacity from renewable energy by 2030 are testimony of the country’s own efforts to gradually reduce its dependence on coal without compromising with its current development trajectory. The outcome of COP26 is also significant in view of finalising the rulebook for 2015 Paris Agreement after six years of discussions. The rulebook provides guidelines for full implementation of the Paris deal. This will allow for the full delivery of the landmark accord, after agreement on a transparency process which will hold countries to account as they deliver on their targets. The final rulebook now includes rules for carbon markets (Article 6), which establishes a framework for countries to exchange carbon credits through the UNFCCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/glasgow-climate-deal-reached-progress-made-but-not-enough/articleshow/87705231.cms||Vishwa Mohan

They also blew up the family’s mud house with dynamite. The incident came to light on Sunday. Locals said the Maoists raided the house of Saryu Singh Bhokta around 7pm on Saturday. They shot his two sons — Satyendra Singh & Mahendra Singh — and their wives Manorama Devi and Sunita Devi, calling them police informers. Killed 4 for poisoning cadres: NaxalsThe Maoists stayed there for around two hours till 9pm. The Maoists left a pamphlet there, stating that their action was to avenge the March incident this year when four of their cadres — Shivpujan Kumar, Amresh Kumar, Sita Kumar and Uday Kumar — had been neutralised by the CoBRA battalion 205 at the same place. They alleged that the cadres were given poison in the meal, which caused their death. But in the police record, they were killed in an encounter. The Maoists blamed the Bhokta family for the fake encounter and alleged that they acted as police informers. Four AK-47 rifles had been recovered from their possession. The village is on the border of Gaya and Aurangabad districts. Spokesperson of Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh, UP Simant Regional Committee of the banned CPI(Maoists), Manas, in a press statement said that had they lost four comrades in a fake encounter. “We do not remorse the loss of lives if the supreme sacrifice is made in war field, but they were killed by betrayal in cold blood, which warranted revenge,” he said. The Maoists also released two sets of photographs along with their statement. While the first set of four photos shows their slain cadres lying in Bhokta’s house, the second set of four photographs shows four members of the same house hanged by their neck in the courtyard. “We have avenged the betrayal and this would be the fate of anyone who backstabs our men,” the Maoists said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-shoot-4-of-a-family-hang-their-bodies-in-gaya/articleshow/87705360.cms||Alok Kumar

The PM responded positively to our request to reopen the corridor soon,” said BJP state general secretary Dayal Sodhi, who was part of the delegation. The Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage was suspended in March last year after the outbreak of Covid -19. Ashwani Sharma, chief of BJP’s Punjab unit, said that PM assured the team that he would look into the demand for the resumption of the pilgrimage to the shrine before Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary on November 19. Sodhi recalled Modi visiting a gurudwara in Delhi to mark the 400th martyrdom day of Guru Tegh Bahadur, and said that the team extended thanks to the PM for taking several initiatives for Punjab and the Sikh community. “The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor was opened in his tenure, which Congress could not do in 70 years. Besides, It was during Modi’s tenure when those responsible for Sikh massacre in 1984 were sent to jail,” BJP Kisan Morcha Punjab president Vikramjit Singh Cheema said. The Kartarpur Corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kartarpur-yatra-likely-to-restart-as-punjab-bjp-netas-meet-pm/articleshow/87705446.cms||---

At the 29th meeting of the southern zonal council attended by the CMs of Andhra, Karnataka and Puducherry; senior ministers deputed by CMs of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana; and LGs of Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, Shah described the nationwide administering of 111 crore doses so far as a big achievement and “an example of cooperative federalism”. At the same time, he urged the member states to speed up second dose vaccinations below sub-division level, with CMs and officers personally monitoring the progress. Shah also requested the southern states to involve officials and experts in firming up their inputs on the proposed amendments to Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act, and submit them soon. Among the other issues that Shah underlined for follow-up by the member states were creation of an independent director of prosecution to speed up prosecution; priority to tackling spread of narcotics and drugs usage; establishing at least one forensic science college with a syllabus in their local language, so that manpower can be trained to meet needs of forensic investigation; adherence to 60-day timeframe for investigating sexual crimes against children; observing November 15 as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas by developing an action plan to showcase the contribution of tribals to India’s freedom struggle and development of their states. In his opening address at the meeting, Shah reiterated the Modi government’s commitment to promoting Hindi alongside all regional Indian languages. He in fact urged the delegates to speak in their own state’s language, with arrangements also having been made for translation of proceedings into the languages spoken by member states of the council. Shah said the zonal council meetings, which involve consultations on issues of federal concern at the highest level, have been able to solve many issues despite being advisory in nature. The home minister made it a point to praise the ancient culture, traditions and languages of the southern states and underlined that India’ development cannot be imagined without the “very important contribution of states of Southern India”. Shah recalled that the zonal councils have met 18 times in the past seven years, compared to very few meets held earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-chaired-meet-of-southern-states-heads-resolves-40-of-51-pending-issues/articleshow/87705468.cms||---

The heavily-fortified border district, which remains in limelight for faceoffs with Chinese troops, will soon get a 80-seat theatre for a population of nearly 50,000 people. “Jadooz, which targets small and remotest cities of the country, will open its first fully-air-conditioned screen with a high-end virtual reality facility in Tawang. The theatre will not only be used for screening movies but will also double up as a platform for virtual teaching classes as each seat will have a cordless microphone and a camera for interactive sessions to bridge the education gap,” Rahul Nehra, founding managing director of startup Jadooz, which plans to open seven screens in Arunachal in coming years, told TOI. It is quite an irony that Arunachal Pradesh, which is a treasure trove of cultural diversity and traditions and famous for monasteries, currently has just 3-4 small theatres, including one in Itanagar, but none in Tawang. In fact, Arunachal movie ‘Water Burial’, whose storyline was based on a dark ritual of a local tribe, won the best film award on environment conservation at the 67th National Films Awards 2021. “The screen, built at a cost of Rs 35 lakh within two months during the pandemic period, will provide entertainment to the local population at a cheaper price. Unlike expensive theatres and multiplexes in big cities, the Tawang theatre will sell tickets for just Rs 100 but will provide quality entertainment,” Rahul Nehra said, while adding that Jadooz targets to open 11 screens in Arunachal and Assam together. Soon, Tawang will also get to watch the latest Bollywood movies as this theatre will have the facility of ‘first day, first show’, he said. “Currently, 50 Jadooz screens are either under development or ready for launch across the country, and we plan to open 1,000 screens by December 2026,” he told TOI. In India, there are less than 10,000 single movie screens, mostly confined to cities — which means only one screen for every one lakh Indians. So, over 90% of India is devoid of any entertainment destination. “Jadooz wants to bridge this gap as it is building entertainment zones mostly in tier-2 and tier-3 towns and villages. Its aim is to provide entertainment with the feel of a multiplex at a convenient location and affordable price to the hinterland,” the startup founder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heavily-fortified-tawang-to-get-its-first-cinema-theatre-on-november-20/articleshow/87705492.cms||Surendra Singh

Their last stand in the forest of Mardintola in Dhanora subdivision, near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, also helped some other top cadres escape. Teltumbde, in-charge of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh zone, was among 26 Maoists killed. Among the dead, six were women, including Vimla alias Imla, who was Teltumbde’s bodyguard. Another of his bodyguards, Bhagatsingh, too, was found dead. Intermittent firing, including unprecedented heavy firing from either side at times, went on for almost 10 hours, it’s learnt. Four C60 jawans were injured in the encounter, but their condition is learnt to be stable now. On Sunday, SP Ankit Goyal confirmed the death of Teltumbde after he was identified as per the police Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) by a surrendered Maoist at the police headquarters. “We have informed Teltumbde’s wife (Angela Sontakey) about his death, but she is yet to arrive to take the body,” said Goyal. Some 29 weapons, including five AK-47s, one AKM with under-barrel grenade launcher, three Insas rifles, and one pistol were seized from the encounter site by C60 commandos. Substantial explosives and materials of daily use were also seized. Sources from the district police said top cadres, like divisional committee member Sukhpal Parcheki and Dandakaranya special zonal committee member Prabhakar, too, were probably present at the encounter site, but managed to sneak away amid heavy firing. Sources said C60 parties, which started the operation a day ago, had encircled the hillock and forested region in multiple layers, and laid ambushes plugging exit routes. While the hilly and rocky terrain of the forested stretch helped top leaders and cadres flee despite raining bullets, Teltumbde got trapped on the hillock. Sources said the C60 commandos were initially stunned by the unfamiliar style of heavy firing from the Maoists, who are known to be extremely frugal with ammunition. “The experienced C-60 commandos sensed something different in the volume of firing, and realized the rebels seemed to be protecting someone very important,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-maoist-leader-with-rs-50-lakh-bounty-killed-by-commandos/articleshow/87705511.cms||Soumitra Bose

She said Congress workers have been asking her to do anything but join hands with other parties, adding that she respects the views of partymen. Congress will give a chance to its dedicated workers who have worked for the party over the years, she said. Addressing over 7,000 Congress workers from Meerut, Agra and Aligarh zones during the party’s ‘Pratigya Sammelan’ held in Bulandshahr on Sunday, she said the BJP government doesn’t understand the rights of the people and the meaning of independence because they haven’t fought for India’s freedom. While praising BR Ambedkar for his contribution in drafting the Constitution, she also mentioned the contributions of Indira Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Sardar Patel in freedom struggle. Priyanka — who had recently bumped into SP chief Akhilesh Yadav while they were on a flight, and also met Mayawati on Sunday to offer her condolences after the death of the BSP chief’s mother — had sparked rumours of alliance with these parties. During the dialogue with party office-bearers, she chalked out the strategy of polls. Priyanka had asked all ground-level workers to form WhatAapp groups and run Congress’s campaign on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-to-go-solo-in-up-polls-next-year-priyanka-gandhi/articleshow/87705644.cms||Ishita Mishra

This comes soon after external affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence secretary Ajay Kumar’s visits to the country. Naravane, during his first visit to Israel from November 15 to 19, will meet the country’s senior military and civilian leadership to discuss “avenues for further enhancing defence relations,” said an official on Sunday. “He will hold meetings with security establishment officials and exchange views on various defence-related issues. He will interact with the service chiefs and visit the headquarters of the ground forces element of the Israeli defence forces,” he added. The visit comes soon after India and Israel agreed to form a joint task force to formulate a comprehensive 10-year roadmap to identify new areas in defence cooperation in the 15th meeting of the joint working group. The meeting was chaired by Kumar and director-general (retd) of Israeli defence ministry Major General Amir Eshel in Tel Aviv on October 27. Israel has been among the top four arms’ suppliers to India for almost two decades with annual military sales worth around $1 billion. The Indian armed forces are inducting the next-generation Barak-8 surface-to-air missile systems under three joint DRDO-Israeli Aerospace Industries projects worth over Rs 30,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-chief-to-help-boost-defence-ties-with-israel-during-5-day-trip/articleshow/87705715.cms||---
---||India||Income from carbon credits sale taxable? SC to decide||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Saturday took up an interesting question related to global warming — is money earned from trading of carbon credits by green industries taxable? — and said this will have a far reaching impact on industries. The issue could have a bearing on India’s ‘net-zero by 2070’ pledge at Glasgow Climate Summit. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M Trivedi caught the significance of the issue raised by additional solicitor general N Venkataraman and counsel Akanksha Kaul challenging a high court decision that money earned from trading of carbon credits be treated as ‘capital assets’ not liable to income tax. Justice Khanna said this would have a far reaching impact on the future industrial scenario given the rising clamour against global warming. Venkataraman said, “The issue could be — whether trading in carbon credits trading is part of the business activities of an industry? Today it may be capital assets but it may become a revenue asset as the carbon credits trading income could be classified as income from other sources.” He said, “If you classify carbon credits trading as income from other sources, there could be a problem. If these are going to be treated as business assets, then the issue will arise in several cases.” The bench didn’t elaborate more as it issued notice to Lanco Tanjore Power Corporation Ltd, which was granted exemption from tax liability on income accrued to it by selling carbon credits to foreign firms. With these new regulations in force, the pressure on businesses to find ways to reduce their carbon footprint is growing. Most of today’s interim solutions involve the use of the carbon markets. What the carbon markets do is turn CO2 emissions into a commodity by giving it a price. When a company buys a carbon credit, usually from the government, they gain permission to generate one ton of CO2 emissions. With carbon credits, carbon revenue flows vertically from companies to regulators, though companies who end up with excess credits can sell them to other companies. In the case in hand, Lanco Tanjore Thermal Power Company Ltd was saddled with a tax effect of Rs 567 lakhs for its earning from trading in carbon credits for the assessment year 2010-11. After the case meandered through the tax tribunals, the Madras HC in February termed the earnings capital assets and ruled it was not liable for tax. The Centre posed this question before the SC, “Whether the HC was justified in holding that the sale of carbon emission reduction, also known as carbon credits, is to be considered as capital receipts and not liable to taxation, without appreciating that carbon credit is revenue in nature as is obvious from Section 115BBG inserted in the Income Tax Act?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/income-from-carbon-credits-sale-taxable-sc-to-decide/articleshow/87705734.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||People need fast justice, not erudite lawyers: CJI||NEW DELHI: After reaching out to nearly 70 crore people during a 45-day campaign by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) to make them aware of their legal rights, CJI NV Ramana said common litigants grinded by resource and energy sapping litigations need quick and inexpensive relief and not colossal court buildings or well-dressed erudite lawyers. Speaking at the valedictory function to mark the end of the intense campaign to spread legal awareness in the nook and corner of the country, he said, “People who are suffering don’t look for well dressed, erudite lawyers or colossal court buildings. All they want is to be relieved of their pain quickly, without exhausting all their resources. We have to work together to promote a sense of belonging with the justice delivery system, among the public.” As a first step, he said, judges must remain “bold and independent” and write in simple language to enable common litigants to comprehend the judgments and orders easily. “Since our decisions have a huge social impact, they should be easily comprehensible and must be written in clear language,” the CJI further said. “It is, primarily, the ability of Constitutional courts to function with absolute independence and necessary boldness in the face of adversity, that defines the character of our institution. Our ability to uphold the Constitution sustains our impeccable character. There is no other way to live up to the faith of our people,” the CJI said. He said the schemes and activities of NALSA act as a necessary bridge ensuring access between the benefactor and the beneficiary. “Today, I can say that we all have sincerely worked to live up to the aspirations of the framers of Constitution,” he said. NALSA executive chairman Justice UU Lalit came in for special praise for working tirelessly and travelling to all corners of the country to infuse energy into those paralegal workers and law students who fanned into the countryside to touch nearly 70 crore people with the legal awareness campaign and ensure that theme of the campaign ‘Ek Mutthi Aasmaan Par Haq Hamara Bhi Toh Hai’ (the marginalised have a right over a slice of hopes, opportunities and aspirations of the country), resonated vibrantly in the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/people-need-fast-justice-not-erudite-lawyers-cji/articleshow/87705759.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Press Association reported that counter-terrorism police said the three men, whose ages ranged from 21 to 29, were detained in the Kensington area of the city. Police were called to reports of a blast involving a taxi at Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday morning. Police said the explosion had not been declared a terrorist attack, but counter-terrorism police were leading the investigation and the men were detained under the Terrorism Act. ``So far we understand, the car involved was a taxi, which pulled up at the hospital shortly before the explosion occurred,`` Merseyside Police said in a statement. ``Work is still going on to establish what has happened and could take some time before we are in a position to confirm anything.`` The male passenger of the car died and the driver was being treated for non life-threatening injuries. Police said they were ``keeping an open mind'' about what caused the explosion. The Liverpool Women's Hospital said it immediately restricted visiting access until further notice and diverted patients to other hospitals ``where possible.'' Fire services said they extinguished the car fire rapidly, and a person had left the car before the fire ``developed to the extent that it did.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-3-detained-in-car-explosion-outside-liverpool-hospital/articleshow/87705782.cms||---

The astronauts, who have already finished the basic training at the Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center in Moscow and begun portions of their India leg of the training are returning to Russia for activities relating to crew module seats and space suits.The TOI had reported earlier this year that the astronaut-elects would be returning to Russia. A senior scientist from the Isro Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC), which is spearheading Gaganyaan, said: “Each one of them will be there for about a week. The first one is expected to return in the next couple of days after which another would go. They are not all going together.”Among activities planned there crew seat moulding, which needs to be done as per their body structure; flight suit trials, including depressurisation checks, etc. Isro will be receiving the seats to be used on the crew module from Russia and the space agency has placed orders for four seats, while Russian research, development and production enterprise — Zvezda — will be supplying the space suit. After their initial training in Russia, which lasted for more than a year, the astronaut-elects have completed some basic modules in India, including training in aerospace medicine at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and “continuity training” of flying at Bidar.However, they are yet to begin their mission-specific training, which will be scheduled after they return from Russia again.“The syllabus for their training is in place. The training will be in different stages with each stage dealing with specific requirements of their journey. We will also have simulators that will emulate the crew module and other instruments they will require to handle during the mission,” the HSFC scientist said. As reported by TOI earlier, the Indian module of their training will happen in multiple cities and with the help of multiple agencies, including all three services of the armed forces.For instance, the Gaganyaan module-specific training — different conditions and reactions they need — will all happen in Bengaluru, while buoyancy and water survival tests and training will happen at NIOT (National Institute of Ocean Technology) in Chennai. The flight and other training will be provided by the IAF, while Isro has also roped in the navy. Some of the centrifuge tests will happen at the IAM, while physical and some simulator training will happen at Isro facilities. The advanced training will involve familiarisation of systems, including launch vehicles. This will mostly be theory that will help astronaut-elects understand various systems that will launch them into space and bring them back safely.After this, they will start flight simulation where they’ll be taught how to use safety instruments, intervene manually to operate flight systems in case something goes wrong, how to take photographs of Earth and so on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gaganyaan-one-astronaut-to-return-from-russia/articleshow/87705790.cms||---

They were found later and sent to the rescue centre at Bannerghatta Biological Park, police said. The incident came to light when a private bus service staffer came to the police station with eight boxes of tortoises and claimed they were found abandoned outside their office. The staff said the bags were not part of the parcels received at the office. “We are scanning CCTV footage from the area to check who brought the tortoises there. The private buses had, on Friday morning, ferried passengers from Hyderabad, Mumbai and other places to the city. But the bags don’t have any receipt on them and were not entered in the ‘parcel’ register of the buses. We suspect someone who was not a passenger brought them near the office,” an officer said. Sources said the star tortoises are barely two months old and could have been brought from the forest areas in Chikkaballapur district and from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. Such tortoises are sometimes smuggled to foreign countries to be reared as pets. According to wildlife activist Sharath Babu, trafficking Indian star tortoises is a crime under the Wildlife Protection Act and punishment for offenders is jail term of up to three years and penalty of up to Rs 25,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/170-star-tortoises-abandoned-in-bags/articleshow/87705792.cms||---

Complainant Ramesh (name changed), a resident of Jeevan Bima Nagar, east Bengaluru, lost his wife to cancer in August this year. According to Ramesh, his wife’s condition deteriorated rapidly after she was treated with the ayurveda medicines and she died in a month’s time. Claiming he was depressed over his wife’s death and that delayed filing of complaint, Ramesh told Ulsoorgate police that the ayurveda shop owner and others not only caused his wife’s death, but also cheated him. Ramesh’s complaint stated that his wife was treated at a private hospital on Old Airport Road for cancer for more than a year. During one such hospital visit, one Santosh approached Ramesh and enquired about his ailing wife. “Santosh told me his friend Shankar Yadav’s wife was suffering from a similar cancer and was cured with ayurveda medicines. I believed him and shared my mobile number. A few days later, a person identifying himself as Shankar Yadav called me over the phone and reiterated what Santosh had explained. Yadav assured me that my wife would get cured with the ayurveda medicines and shared the details of Shiva Shakti Ayurveda shop on Cubbonpet Main Road,” Ramesh stated. Accordingly, Ramesh purchased the medicines suggested by Yadav from Shiva Shakti Ayurveda shop on August 1. “By month-end, my wife’s condition worsened and she died. Now I have realised that Santosh, Yadav and the ayurveda shop owner Kumar Gowda cheated me. I had purchased medicines worth over Rs 2.2 lakh. Yadav asked for my help and I transferred Rs 49,900 to his bank account and gave him gold coins worth Rs1.7 lakh,” Ramesh’s complaint copy read. Cops have booked Kumar, Yadav, Santosh and others under IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). “It looks like the work of an organised crime syndicate,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/prof-blames-ayurveda-druggist-2-others-for-wifes-death/articleshow/87705793.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt awaits Rs 3,000 crore MSP dues from Centre||BENGALURU: With Karnataka’s food subsidy bill rising, the state has been mounting pressure on the Centre to immediately release outstanding minimum support price (MSP) dues amounting to Rs 3,025 crore to lessen its financial burden and enable it to make fresh procurements. The state government, through its agencies, buys large quantities of paddy, ragi, maize and jowar from farmers at MSP rates, and gives them out to beneficiaries through the public distribution system (PDS) at subsidised rates. This is primarily how farmers benefit from the MSP system. However, the Karnataka government largely buys only ragi, wheat and jowar and purchases only token quantities of other produce like paddy and tur. “The delay in release of funds has resulted in increasing burden on the state food and civil supplies corporation,” said Kapil Mohan, additional chief secretary, food and civil supplies department. “We cannot afford to procure fresh crops from farmers until the Centre clears pending dues,” he added. Though CM Basavaraj Bommai has promised farmers that paddy would be procured under MSP, the government is yet to make a formal announcement as it is waiting for the Centre to clear the pending dues, sources said. Bommai along with food and civil supplies minister Umesh Katti met Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Piyush Goyal during their visit to Delhi on Thursday for the second time in three months, seeking clearance of dues. The minister has reportedly assured to look into it. Seeking personal attention of the Union minister, Bommai requested the former to take measures for one-time clearance of the state’s outstanding dues, including interest burden which is due to delay in the release of subsidy, sources privy to the discussion said. Under decentralised procurement, the state government has been procuring paddy, ragi and jowar on behalf of the Centre for a decade. The responsibility assigned by the Centre under decentralised procurement comprises procurement, storage and distribution of all three. The cost pertaining to the entire operation consists of minimum support price, taxes as payable and other incidental expenditure incurred in acquisition and distribution, said officials. The dues were in small amounts till last year, officials said. However, the state government obeyed the diktat of the Centre and procured ragi, maize and jowar in large quantities to support farmers hit by the Covid -19 pandemic, as result of which the dues went up by five times, they explained. “We cannot afford to procure crops under MSP until we get reimbursement from the Centre. But we are confident that it’s just a matter of time now,” said Mohan. He also said that the state government buys ragi and white jowar in large quantities as both are adequately grown across the state compared to paddy and maize, which are limited to just a few districts. Meanwhile, farmers who have harvested their crops are keenly waiting for the government to start procuring the same under MSP. “We will launch a protest if the government fails to buy paddy in another week,” said farmer-leader Kurubur Shanthakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-awaits-3k-cr-msp-dues-from-centre/articleshow/87705795.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Harvest season hit as crops decay in rain||BENGALURU: The extended southwest monsoon that has seen incessant rain continuing through the winter season has left farmers in the lurch as they are unable to harvest crops in wet conditions, despite the bumper production following record sowing. The well-distributed rainfall during kharif season (June to October) saw sowing being completed on 78.7 lakh hectares. While this is the second successive year of record sowing, foodgrains production is expected to be over 138 lakh tonnes, as against the target of 135.5 lakh tonnes. However, with unrelenting rain, standing crops are decaying. “Production of crops, especially paddy, ragi, jowar and maize, is extremely good this time but the tragedy is farmers cannot harvest them as they’re still wet on the fields,” said GC Bayya Reddy, president of Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha. “About 30% of crops have already been damaged. If the situation continues for a week or so, the consequence will be more severe.” With paddy being sown on 10.2 lakh hectares, as against the target of 9.7 lakh hectares, production of about 18.5 lakh tonnes is expected. Ragi and jowar have been sown on 6.9 lakh hectares and 0.6 lakh hectares, respectively. Need for survey“The government should immediately conduct a crop survey and chalk out a relief scheme,” said Kiran Kumar Vissa, national co-convener of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. On their part, agriculture officials say they will shortly undertake the survey and farmers can report to the department and claim crop insurance. “Farmers can upload details of crop damage on the Parihara app so that they will be eligible for relief under SDRF (State Disaster Response Fund) norms,” said Manoj Rajan, commissioner, Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority. Bayya Reddy, however, said 80% of farmers have not paid premium for crop insurance this time because of procedural hassles, and the onus is on the government to help them. While a few farmers have harvested their crops, the government is dithering on procuring them under MSP (minimum support price) scheme, leaving stockpiles of paddy and ragi sprouting after getting wet in the rain. Traders are taking advantage of the situation as price of paddy in the open market has fallen to Rs 1,350 per quintal, way below the MSP of Rs 1,960 for A grade and Rs 1,940 for common grade. To the dismay of farmers, the government on Friday issued an order to open procurement centres for paddy only in four districts — Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Koppal, and Raichur. “The government will look into concerns of farmers of other districts tool. While we have got approval to procure 3.3 lakh tonnes of paddy, we have sought the Centre’s approval to procure 7 lakh tonnes of ragi and 6 lakh tonnes of jowar,” said food & civil supplies commissioner Shamla Iqbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/harvest-season-hit-as-crops-decay-in-rain/articleshow/87705797.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Listing out the contentious projects in the presence of Union cooperation minister Amit Shah, he appealed to the Centre not to approve them. “Tamil Nadu is going ahead with the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link project, which is inadmissible in law. The Karnataka government, in a letter dated February 17, urged the Centre not to approve the proposal. We reiterate our stand that no statutory clearances should be given to projects planned in violation of water tribunal awards,” he said. He asserted Karnataka’s rightful share in Cauvery, Krishna and Pennar basins as the state has already communicated to the National Water Agency about the Godavari-Cauvery link project on July 26, 2019. The CM also mentioned the Rajiv Gandhi Sangama Banda barrage proposed by Telangana and the Gundrevula project undertaken by Andhra Pradesh across Tungabhadra river, and highlighted their “illegitimate” status. “No projects in Telangana or Andhra Pradesh in Krishna water are permissible if they are not part of allocation,” Bommai pointed out. Earlier, delivering his speech at the first meeting of southern state chief ministers, held in Tirupati, Bommai said a strong foundation for nation-building needs the Centre and states resolving long-pending issues through cooperation. “Southern states are among high performers in almost all sectors. However, some regions have remained backward, like erstwhile Hyderabad-Karnataka. The Prime Minister has directed us to follow the ‘aspirational districts’ model for developing backward taluks. My government is taking steps in this regard,” he said. The CM requested Shah to speed up the inter-state reciprocal transport agreement between Karnataka and the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-asks-centre-not-to-approve-illegal-water-projects-of-other-states/articleshow/87705798.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Police offer to give self-defence lessons to govt school girls in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: If the police department has its way, three girls each from 720 select government schools and PU colleges in Bengaluru will get training in self-defence techniques. The department’s proposal to the education department is part of the Safe City project, a programme initiated by the ministry of home affairs to create a safe environment for women. The department of public instruction has called for a meeting with the police department to discuss the matter. As per the proposal, 240 constables of city police will be trained in self-defence, gender sensitisation and laws related to women apart from counselling skills and public speaking required for trainers. Trained constables will coach the select students and they will in turn teach their peers in their schools, creating a chain. “The training will not be in martial arts as it is not easy to master the technicalities in a short duration. This will be situation-based training. Students will be trained in practical ways of getting out of certain situations that couldarise in daily life. Let’s say, if someone holds a girl by the wrist, or grabs her by the hair; it is not about strength here, but how to get out of the situation by immobilising the opponent for a short duration to escape,” explained Nisha James, DCP (administration), Bengaluru. The constables will further act as a bridge between the student community and police department for any issues henceforth. The constables will be trained daily for 4-5 hours for 64 days. One of the issues the education department is likely to raise is the feasibility of a young child teaching the rest of the kids. “We have written to the commissioner of public instruction and the director of the department of pre-university education. Schools and PU colleges will select master trainer students. We have given a guideline on what kind of student has to be selected. She has to be bright, confident, have a good rapport with the student community and character traits of a leader,” she added. Karnataka had earlier launched a plan to teach karate for high school girls. Schools were given funds to hire trainers too. However, the programme faced fund crunch and post Covid outbreak, it came to a halt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/police-offer-to-give-self-defence-lessons-to-govt-school-girls/articleshow/87705800.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP’s exorbitant sapling tenders draw ire of greens||BENGALURU: Environmentalists are unhappy with BBMP floating exorbitant tenders worth crores of rupees for planting and maintaining saplings across the city. Responding to a TOI report — Tenders floated for 62k saplings, BBMP ready to pay Rs 930 for each — published on Friday, citizens and environmentalists said the civic body doesn’t have a planned approach to address the issue of increasing the city’s tree cover. On World Environment Day, the Palike launched Koti Vruska Sainya programme, which envisages planting 1 crore saplings in the city in three years and declared that it will ensure the plants survive. Harish Gowda, an environmentalist, alleged BBMP failed to maintain the existing saplings and protect tree guards. “The civic body can neither maintain the existing trees, nor tree guards. Why float tenders to raise new saplings and install tree guards?” wondered Gowda. “A sapling can be planted and grown for just Rs 200. The Palike’s inflated estimate of Rs 930 per sapling camouflages vested interests at work,” he alleged. In areas like Indiranagar, Vidhana Soudha, Sanjaynagar and parts of Dollars Colony where there is VIP movement, the civic body makes an effort to plant saplings and guard them, while in remaining parts of the city the saplings are allowed to die, said another senior environmentalist. “Winter isn’t the right season to plant saplings as survival chances are little,” said Akshay Heblikar, director of Eco-watch. Heblikar suggested it would be better if the civic body initiates the same project in March or April, after which monsoon would nourish the saplings. Heblikar added that lack of coordination between civic agencies affects the growth of saplings. “Every time there is road cutting or other construction work, debris is dumped on the saplings, which then eventually die,” he said. Involving NGOs, government institutions and schools in afforestation drives would have been a better idea, he said. Dattatraya T Devare, another environmentalist, said more than planting saplings, ensuring their survival is important. “BBMP does not have the mechanism to monitor a plantation drive, as a result of which saplings end up being planted at the same spot every year and the whole thing is reduced to a joke,” Devare said. “BBMP is using bamboo guards, but they won’t survive. It needs to use iron tree guards to ensure the saplings survive,” he said. Shankar Reddy Babu, special commissioner (estates, forest, education), BBMP, was unavailable for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmps-exorbitant-sapling-tenders-draw-ire-of-greens/articleshow/87705801.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 67-year-old sues KSRTC for failing to pick him up from bus stop, wins Rs 1,000||BENGALURU: A 67-year-old man, who was not picked up at a designated bus stop in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu by a Karnataka State Road transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus on which he had booked a ticket to travel to Bengaluru, took the utility to a consumer court and has now won a refund and compensation of Rs 1,000. S Sangameswaran, a resident of Banashankari 3rd Stage, had booked return tickets online on KSRTC Airavat Club Class from Bengaluru to Tiruvannamalai. As planned, he left Bengaluru on October 12, 2019 and was scheduled to return to the city the next day. He reached the designated bus stop around noon. However, despite waiting for over an hour, there was no sign of the bus. Sangameswaran had received an SMS from the state transporter mentioning his bus details, including the conductor’s contact number. When he called the number, he was told that the bus had left Tiruvannamalai as he failed to turn up at the new temporary stop and it was 30km away on its journey towards Bengaluru. The dejected senior citizen had no choice but to take another KSRTC bus from Tiruvannamalai and reach Hosur by paying Rs 131. From there he took another bus to Bengaluru for Rs 69. Enraged by the fact that a senior passenger like him with a pre-booked sleeper ticket for the premium service wasn’t informed about the change in bus stop, Sangameswaran approached the Bangalore 2nd Urban Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Shantinagar with a compliant against the managing director and general manager (traffic), KSRTC. The litigation commenced on October 30, 2019. Sangameswaran presented his case, while the KSRTC lawyer claimed the complainant wasn’t maintainable by law. The attorney also stated that the case should be dismissed by the forum as the place where the alleged incident happened was Tiruvannamalai and beyond its jurisdiction. He further said the conductor of the bus had sent an SMS to the complainant about the local TN police temporally shifting the bus stop to an outer location to manage crowds during the full moon day and it was a mistake on the part of the complainant, who failed to be present at the spot. He also claimed that 23 other passengers had boarded the bus, but not the complainant. The judges of the consumer forum, however, didn’t accept the state transporter’s version as it failed to provide proof to substantiate its claims. The utility also failed to produce the bus conductor before the forum. In their verdict pronounced on October 26, 2021, the consumer court ordered the managing director and GM (traffic) of KSRTC to refund Rs 497 towards the complainant’s Airavat ticket and Rs 131 and Rs 69 for the alternative bus journey he was forced to take to return to Bengaluru. The court also ordered the officers to pay the senior citizen a compensation of Rs 1,000 for the trouble caused. All payments to the Bengalurean must be made within 30 days of the order, the court ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/67-year-old-sues-ksrtc-for-failing-to-pick-him-up-from-bus-stop-wins-1k/articleshow/87705803.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Election code derails induction of electric buses and mobility card||BENGALURU: Many government initiatives and projects awaiting launch are being delayed because of the model code of conduct (MCC) in force due to elections in the state. The code for the December 10 legislative council elections kicked in on November 10. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is likely to hear a petition on holding BBMP elections in the first week of December. This could lead to another MCC being imposed in the city. Awaiting official launchBMRCL sources said they are waiting for the chief minister to give a date to launch the much-delayed National Common Mobility Card. BMRCL, along with RBL Bank, will issue NCMC to Metro users only after the official launch. In March 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched NCMC to enable travel and payment of parking and toll charges through a single card. However, its implementation in the city has been delayed by over two years for various reasons. NCMC can be used to shop and pay for parking and integrated with other modes of transport such as BMTC, cabs and autorickshaws. The closed-loop cards like the ones currently used in Namma Metro cannot be used for other purposes. BMRCL has installed one or two new automatic fare collection gates at each Phase 1 Metro station. The new AFC gates accept both QR-code and open-loop NCMCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/election-code-derails-induction-of-electric-buses-and-mobility-card/articleshow/87705805.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Inflated water bills vex Jogupalya residents||BENGALURU: A building inhabited by 10 people in Jogupalya, near Ulsoor, received a water bill of a whopping Rs 78,830 for the month of October. Owner Sunil Kumar S generally gets a bill of Rs 3,000. Jogupalya residents claim 80% of households in the area faced a similar issue in October. Besides Sunil, TOI spoke to one more resident, Sai Narasimhan, who also complained of excess billing. BWSSB officials conceded that billing has been among the most-discussed issues at its weekly water adalats. They said the board will need to use technology to resolve the matter. Sunil Kumar said, “I don’t run a water supply business to get such a huge bill. When I went to the BWSSB ward office, they said they wouldn’t be able to come to a conclusion without a ball valve. An official who came to read the meter behaved rudely when I said I didn’t have a ball valve. I have been living here for six years and never have I experienced something like this. They asked me to attend a water adalat so that I could get a concession of Rs 20,000 or so. But why should I?” Jogupalya residents say middle-class people have been getting water bills of Rs 15,000-16,000 and the BWSSB must take responsibility for it. Sai Narasimhan, another resident with a faulty bill, said, “I live with one other person in a small house with a bedroom and a kitchen. I have been living in this house for seven years and haven’t paid more than Rs 520 for water bill. I received a bill of Rs 13,000 for October. As an autorickshaw driver from a middle-class household, I don’t see why I should pay so much when it is not my fault. When I approached BWSSB ward officials during a water adalat, they said I could pay amount in instalments!” A BWSSB official admitted there have been a lot of complaints about billing from across the city. “But we are not changing the system as we have water adalats and more to help such people,” he said. “Sometimes people don’t realise the water tap is on. This is why we tell them it is important to have a ball valve to avoid wasting water. Regardless of how much water gets wasted, the Rs 78,000 billed to the Jogupalya resident is very steep and there seems to have been a lapse from our end. I will send our special squad to the location on Monday and have the meter tested,” the official said. The official added sometimes arrears not cleared may push up the monthly bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/inflated-water-bills-vex-jogupalya-residents/articleshow/87705807.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

It said the focus should be on creating a conducive learning atmosphere for children after the pandemic-induced disruption.Pointing out that children will need at least two years to catch up, the educationists said: “The short ‘bridge courses’ of 1-2 months announced by many governments will not adequately prepare students. The haste to resume ‘business as usual’ will pressure teachers and students. Resuming grade-level teaching too soon will do more harm to children’s learning.”The focus should on strengthening learning-to-learn abilities and re-establishing connections among them , they added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/experts-syllabi-completion-should-be-secondary-now/articleshow/87705808.cms||---

It will have four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City-Yelahanka-Devanahalli (Sampige), Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur-Chikkabanavara (Mallige), Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield (Parijaata) and Heelalige-Yelahanka-Rajanukunte (Kanaka).TOI had published an article, ‘Year after Centre’s nod, Bengaluru suburban rail project still on drawing board’ on October 21. However, Garg said the project is on track. “We are planning to float the first civil work tender (Kanaka Line) in a few days. All preparatory tender work is complete. We are planning to finalise the civil work tender of Kanaka Line by December 15 and to commence civil work by February 2022,” he said. He said around 85% of the land is ready. “The remaining 5-6% land from the state government and 7-8% from individuals will be acquired soon,” he added. While acquiring land in core city areas, felling of trees was a challenge for Namma Metro and building suburban corridors along existing railway tracks is likely to be a major issue for K-RIDE. The operations department of the railways rarely permits construction along operational tracks.Garg said: “We had to finetune the alignment after consulting South Western Railway which took some time. But all hurdles have been cleared now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/k-ride-set-to-float-civil-work-tenders-for-suburban-rail/articleshow/87705810.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Eating right is cricketers’ mantra||Bengaluru: Eating right is not just a diet fad for sportspersons, it is a lifestyle pattern. To ensure players stay healthy, the Karnataka State Cricket Association has roped in sports nutritionist Divya K Purushotham to monitor the daily intake of the senior men and the U-25 teams. The Karnataka teams are among the rare groups in the country to seek the services of an expert.Divya , a Chennai-based sports nutritionist, has been coordinating with team hotels to ensure the players stick to their diet charts and interacts with the players individually to implement the plan. The nutrition expert is a necessity for teams now, especially since they spend 5-6 days in quarantine before the league and knockout phases of all domestic competitions.Speaking to TOI about what goes into planning a team’s diet, Divya, who has over a decade’s experience of working with athletes across sport, explained: “They get boxed meals in quarantine but what we have to factor in is that they will be training in their rooms. We coordinate with the chefs in team hotels, the trainer and the individual players to understand the requirements. Also, their dietary preferences have to be factored in since a few of them are vegetarians.”On coordinating with the team hotels, Divya pointed out, “We request the chefs to change the menu according to the dietary requirements. Sometimes they give them desserts, which is banned during a tournament. Instead, we opt for an extra portion of sautéed vegetables.”Divya also revealed that the diet plans vary depending on the player's specialisation. “The diet plans change according to the position they play. It’s different for the batsmen compared to the bowlers. Even among bowlers the nutrition requirement of the pacers is different from spinners. Pacers get more carbohydrates and proteins which is very essential for their recovery.”To help players avoid unhealthy food, Divya revealed energy bars have been made available. “We have introduced custom-made energy bars, which are rich in antioxidants which help in recovery and also supplements,” she added.It is not just food, even hydration of players has been zeroed in on. “In hydration we had to bring about a change because the right amount of energy drinks need to be consumed. We have given energy drinks in measured portions to players individually,” she said.DO-IT-YOURSELF KITSWith resources limited amid the pandemic, players have been given a checklist of basic ingredients to be carried on tour. While it is yet to be implemented for the senior team, the U-25 team has been given a list of ingredients for their Do-It-Yourself (DIY) kits.“The U-25 players have been asked to carry cinnamon powder, turmeric and pepper which are immunity boosters. They will have to mix the ingredients in water and drink before going to sleep. Going forward we will request the senior players also to do the same,” stated Divya.‘NUTRITION PLAYS MAJOR ROLE IN PLAYER’S CAREER’Karnataka senior team’s strength and conditioning coach AT Rajamani Prabhu said, “Nutrition plays a major role in a player’s career. During the course of a tournament if they put on even 500gm, it affects them drastically, reducing their reactive time and speed. It is also essential for recovery. With a nutritionist on board, we are now able to monitor the players’ daily intake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/eating-right-is-cricketers-mantra/articleshow/87705815.cms||Manuja Veerappa

But he fell prey to militant bullets like his father died in the hands of insurgents in once violence-hit Bodoland Territorial Council area 14 years ago trying to broker peace. Assam cabinet minister Urkhao Gwra Brahma on Sunday evening announced that the state government will give Rs 50 lakh to Suman’s family. “The chief minister has told me to make an announcement of Rs 50 lakh. Besides, his family will get its dues from the Union government,” said Brahma. But money cannot heal the wounds of the family which lost two of the bread earners at the hands of militants within 15 years. When Suman’s body was about to reach his paternal home at Thekerakuchi village on Sunday night, his family members were inconsolabe. The kid was unaware of the harsh reality he had faced at such a tender age and was playing in the lap of his mother with a lollipop in his mouth. “My husband said he will surely come in December to see our son on his next birthday. But everything is finished,” said Suman’s wife, Juri. Suman returned to duty on July 15 after a few days’ break. Due to the poor mobile network near the international border along Myanmar, where he was on duty, getting a phone call from Suman was also a pleasant surprise. His last phone call to his wife was on the morning of the day of the ambush, hours before the militants launched the all-out attack on their convoy. “We are constructing a new concrete house. He was so concerned about the family and asked whether we needed more bricks to complete the house. It was a brief conversation that day,” said Juri. Suman joined the forces almost a decade ago with a resolution after his father was gunned down by insurgents in 2007 at their home. His father was heading a local peace committee during the troubled days when Bodo militancy could not be quelled despite all-out efforts by security forces. “Suman’s father was gunned down in the evening by suspected insurgents for being part of a peace initiative,” said a relative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/jawans-father-too-had-fallen-to-terrorists-bullets/articleshow/87705848.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The fair held on the bank of Gandak river near Sonepur in November-December every year is also known for trading animals since the ancient era. Tourism minister Narayan Prasad said in view of the possibility of the third wave of Covid-19, the state government has not given permission to organize the Sonepur fair, which attracts huge crowd. “Even though the restriction has been eased, fair and big cultural gatherings are not allowed. However, considering the importance of the fair and the sentiments behind it, the prayer service and rituals will be held while maintaining social distancing and other safety protocols,” he told this newspaper. He added: “The district administration of Saran has been asked to make all the arrangements for the devotees as per the Covid-19 protocol.” On the day of Kartik Purnima, a large number of devotees from different places visit the Hariharnath Temple at Sonepur to offer prayers and take a dip in the holy Gandak and Ganga. This year, the Kartik Purnima is on November 19. Saran DM Rajesh Meena said the official fair will not take place because of Covid-19, but the religious prayers are allowed, so the Hariharnath Temple will be open for the devotees on Kartik Purnima. “All the necessary arrangements will be made to ensure peaceful celebration of Kartik Purnima as large number of devotees will start congregating from November 18. Ghats are being cleaned and being barricaded to ensure safety of devotees. Arrangements for lighting, watch towers, changing rooms, urinals and drinking water facilities will be made at the ghats,” Meena said. The DM told this newspaper that adequate security personnel will be deputed. “A team will be formed for crowd management and regulating devotees in view of the Covid-19,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-sonepur-fair-for-2nd-consecutive-year/articleshow/87703978.cms||Faryal Rumi

The bandh, however, remained peaceful. The charred body of Avinash, strapped in a gunny bag , was recovered on Friday night. His brother Chandra Shekhar Jha had lodged a missing report at Benipatti police station on November 11, apprehending his kidnapping. In fact, Avinash had been missing since November 9. When this reporter visited Benipatti on Sunday, Avinash’s cousin Vikash Jha said the protest was a spontaneous reaction to the reported statement of Madhubani SP Satya Prakash to a news channel that a love affair might be the reason behind the alleged murder. This infuriated the locals who viewed this as an attempt to divert the people’s attention and save the culprits. Addressing a press conference at Madhubani, Benipatti SDPO Arun Kumar Singh said Chandra Shekhar, the son of Dayanand Jha, informed the police on November 10 night that his younger brother Buddhinath, 23, had been missing since the previous night. Acting promptly, the police took out the call details of Buddhinath’s mobile phone and found that he had his last telephonic conversation at 10pm with one Purnakala Devi, a nursing staff of Anurag Healthcare on Kataiyya Road, he said. The SDPO said when she was questioned, the woman lied that she was at her father’s place in Brahmpura village under the Arer police station area that night. This claim was found to be untrue on technical verification, which proved that she was at Benipatti. When interrogated further, she admitted that Avinash had come to the nursing home at about 10.15pm and met her. After sometime when they came out of the nursing home, five people waiting there kidnapped Avinash and took him towards the nursing home of K K Chaudhary. She identified the kidnappers as Raushan Kumar Sah, Bittu Kumar, Dipak Kumar Pandit, Pawan Kumar Pandit and Manish Kumar. They all have been arrested. An FIR (243/21) has been lodged against them, the SDPO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bandh-in-benipatti-to-protest-rti-activists-murder-five-arrested/articleshow/87703953.cms||---

I found the same zeal and intimacy to maintain the individual relationship in him (PM) like my late father,” Chirag tweeted. Lauding his father and former Union minister late Ram Vilas Paswan for holding personal relationship above the party lines, Chirag said the departed leader remained always connected with the people and their welfare. “Logon aur unke hiton se jude rahne aur apnatva ka wahi jajba aadarniye Narendra Modi ji mein bhi dekha hai,” the Jamui MP tweeted. The tweet came barely two days after the lone LJP MLA from Langthabal in Manipur, Karam Shyam, joined the BJP ahead of the assembly polls there. On being asked, Chirag said, “This happens in every political party during elections and the LJP is no exception.” He, however, claimed that three prominent leaders from other parties would join the LJP (Ram Vilas) in Manipur soon. “We will disclose their names at appropriate time,” he revealed. At a press conference in Patna on Saturday, the Jamui MP said his faction would contest the next election in alliance with a formidable political group. He, however, hastened to add that the name of the political group that his party would tie up with would be disclosed at the right time. The change in the stand to fight election in alliance is considered to be a fallout of the byelection results in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly seats recently. The party candidates ranked third after JD(U) and the RJD. “We clinched more votes in both the assembly constituencies in comparison to a national party,” Chirag revealed. The Chirag faction of the LJP had earlier contested the 2020 assembly election solo and won only one seat. He again predicted a mid-term poll in Bihar. When reminded that he seldom attacked the BJP, Chirag said, “It is not that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-shares-his-picture-with-pm/articleshow/87703920.cms||Ramashankar

The ancient culture, traditions and languages of the South enrich India’s culture and ancient legacy. He said the Modi government respects all regional languages and, therefore, at today’s southern zonal council meeting, facilities for translation into all languages of the states that are in the Southern Zonal Council have been made, he said. Shah said he would be happy to see delegates feeling free to speak in the language of their states in the future. “We have been able to achieve 111 crore vaccine doses as of today during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a big achievement and an example of cooperative federalism. It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to leverage cooperative and competitive federalism to achieve all round growth in the country,” Shah said. He added, “In the last seven years we have held 18 meetings of zonal councils, compared to which very few meetings were held earlier. Now meetings of zonal councils are convened regularly and this could happen only with the cooperation of all state governments as well as central ministries and departments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-respects-all-regional-languages-says-amit-shah/articleshow/87704654.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Globally, IP filings — including patents, trademarks and designs — rebounded in 2020, indicating the resilience of human innovation despite dire global and economic turmoil during the Covid pandemic, latest data from World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) showed. In contrast, during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, both patent and trademark filing activity had contracted sharply. Globally, trademark filing activity rose by 13.7%, patents 1.6% and designs by 2%, according to the World Intellectual Property Indicators report, which compiled new data from 150 national and regional authorities. While China’s IP office recorded the highest volume of trademark filing activity, India overtook Japan to become the fifth largest country for trademark filing activity. The strong growth in global trademark filing activity is driven by robust growth in products and services related to advertising & business management, pharmaceuticals, surgical, medical & dental goods. The share of filings related to pharmaceuticals increased from 4.1% in 2019 to 4.6% in 2020, while that of surgical, medical & dental goods increased from 1.5% to 2.3%, the data said. These trends were mirrored by certain countries that saw large increases of trademark filing activity. For instance, India’s 15.4% growth in trademark activity was driven by resident filings in pharmaceuticals. Further, worldwide patent-filing activity returned to growth in 2020 after the first dip in a decade in 2019, due to a decline in China. In 2020, China’s IP office reported growth again with 1.5 million patent applications, followed by the US, Japan, Republic of Korea and the European Patent Office. Together, these five offices accounted for 85.1% of the world total. Among the top 10 offices, only three — China (6.9%), India (5.9%) and the Republic of Korea (3.6%) — recorded growth in applications in 2020. Germany (62,105), India (56,771) and the Russian Federation (34,984), among others, also featured among the top 10 offices. Commenting on the particularly strong growth in trademark filings in 2020, WIPO director general Daren Tang said, “This shows how enterprises across the globe have brought new products and services to the market, as reflected by the double-digit growth in trademarks filing activity in 2020 despite the massive economic shock.” Interestingly, IP’s centre of gravity has shifted to Asia now with an increasing number of applications from the region, the latest data from WIPO showed. While a decade ago, half of overall 10 IP applications were filed in Asia, last year this number was close to seven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indian-patent-filings-grow-despite-pandemic/articleshow/87704869.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Only those who are working on the post of professor under the university service in Bihar and have at least three years of university service left are eligible to apply. Applicants are supposed to submit their biodata along with an affidavit to the effect that they are neither facing any charge nor involved in any criminal case. Candidates having administrative experience would be given preference. Welcoming the government decision, Bihar State Higher Education Council’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha said it would ensure fairness and transparency in the system of selection. Earlier, appointment to the post was made on the recommendation of the chief minister or education minister, he said. Working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, also hailed the new system of appointing the director. Under the changed socio-political scenario, higher education needs drastic improvement and the director of higher education would have to play a crucial role in it, he said. It may be mentioned here that the post of director of public instructions (DPI) in Bihar was created way back in 1874 and the senior most official of the Bihar Education Service (BES) Class I used to occupy the chair. This system continued till the early ’70s when university teachers opted for the university service in lieu of BES. Eminent academics like Gorakh Nath Singh, N S Nagendra Nath, Kalimuddin Ahmad, Ramola Nandi and Damodar Thakur had the distinction of serving as the director in the past. Later, the office of DPI was divided into several directorates. Today, we have directors of primary, secondary and higher education besides those of administration, research and training, mass education, and midday meal. The director of higher education happens to be an ex-officio member of the senate and syndicate of all the conventional universities in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-recruit-professor-as-director-of-higher-education/articleshow/87703740.cms||B K Mishra

Once again, a question mark is put on Sanskarinagari’s ‘safe city for women’ tag. Recently, a rape accused in Surat was sentenced within a month of the crime he committed, while the two balloon sellers – Kishan Mathasuriya and Jaso Solanki – who are in jail for the Navalakhi Compound crime are still under trial. Sources close to the case said that the duo’s trial is at evidence stage as 38 witnesses of the prosecution have been examined so far. The prosecution had a list of 98 witnesses for examination, but most of the names have been dropped. The two investigating officers, one of whom is the assistant commissioner of crime branch, will be examined next. After their examination, if the defence will have any witnesses then they will be examined and after the final arguments of both sides, the court will pronounce its order. The heinous crime had taken place on November 28 night in 2019 and police filed a chargesheet on January 22 last year. The case trial began five days later on January 27. Maximum delay was due to the pandemic and the lockdown as the courts were only taking up urgent matters for several months. During the course of trial, the defence lawyers used different tactics by submitting three applications. One of the applications was regarding investigation of the place of offence by the court which was rejected. Later, another application was done to make the survivor’s fiance a co-accused, which was also turned down and the accused were fined. The last application was done to re-examine the girl, her mother and the doctor who did her medical check-up, which too was turned down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-years-on-navlakhi-rape-accused-still-under-trial/articleshow/87704018.cms||Jay Pachchigar

One of the critical patients is in AIIMS, Delhi and two in PGIMER. With the transplantation of retrieved corneas restoring the sight of two corneal blind patients, five lives have been impacted in all. PGI director Prof Surjit Singh said, “It is an extremely hard decision but families like that of donor Manmohan Singh are a ray of hope, a silver lining in the dark lives of organ failure patients. It is through their magnanimity that hundreds of people each year are given a second chance at life. We are overwhelmed by their ‘spirit of giving.” On November 7, Manmohan, who was riding a two-wheeler met with an accident when his bike skidded on a bumpy road and his head hit the pavement, leading to grievous head injuries. Manmohan was shifted to PGI in critical condition on November 9. However, after three days of hospitalisation, the patient was declared brain dead. Transplant coordinators at PGI approached Rano Devi, the bereaved wife, who gave consent for the transplant. Rano Devi said, “We said yes to organ donation because it is far better to give someone new life rather than reducing these organs to ashes. That’s why despite the heartache that we are going through, we knew it was the right thing to do." Following her consent, the heart, liver and kidneys were retrieved from the donor for transplantation in matching recipients. As there was no matching recipient for heart in PGI, Regional Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (ROTTO) PGIMER approached National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) in Delhi and with NOTTO’s intervention, retrieved heart of the donor was allocated to AIIMS Delhi for the matching recipient. It was sent from the institute on Saturday through a green corridor for International Airport, from where it was airlifted for its destination. Prof Vipin Koushal, nodal officer, ROTTO, PGIMER, said, “With NOTTO’s proactive intervention, the heart was airlifted as soon as it was retrieved. Green corridor was created from PGIMER to International Airport with active cooperation and liasoning of department of hospital administration, PGI Security, UT administration and Police.” Later, the liver and kidneys retrieved from the donor, through transplantation of simultaneous liver and kidney in one recipient and another kidney in the second recipient, enabled fresh lease of life to two more patients battling for survival here in PGIMER. With the transplantation of retrieved corneas, restoring the sight of two corneal blind patients, five lives have been impacted with the latest case of organ donation here at PGIMER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/organ-donation-saves-3-lives-restores-sight-in-2/articleshow/87704475.cms||---

Popular wedding destinations along East Coast Road (ECR), Kodaikanal and Yercaud have been sold out till November 2022. With guest restrictions gone, premium resort properties are seeing a rush. Those getting decked up on ECR include ITC Kences Palm Beach, Taj Fisherman’s Cove, GRT property Radisson Blu Temple Bay, InterContinental and Chariot Beach. Other hot wedding destinations include Dunnottar Bunglow on the lakeside in Kodaikanal and a couple of locations in the Shevaroy Ranges. Says Zubin Songadwala, GM of ITC Grand Chola and area manager, ITC Hotels-south: “We (Kences Palm Beach) are booked for almost all wedding dates until March, and more are on the way." Shubhangi N, GM sales and marketing, GRT Hotels & Resorts, adds that wedding bells are back at Radisson Blu resort Temple Bay. We have bookings up to November 2022, and that’s more than pre-Covid 2019." GRT’s yet-to-open property in Puducherry is getting inquiries for weddings next year, while Dune Resort is doing events with 100 guests or less for ‘high profile clients’. Vidya Gajapathi Raju Singh of Sumyog Wedding Planners says after the larger properties are taken, smaller beach properties are sought after. The cost of a wedding at a beach resort can cost Rs50 lakh to Rs1 crore, depending on the bells and whistles. Equally happy is Matrimony.com CMD Murugavel Janakiraman. “We have made a good comeback of weddings this year, and this includes demand for beach weddings,” he says. Tamil Nadu’s wedding planners are also looking at mountains and lake-view destinations. “Kodaikanal has emerged as a great destination for weddings. The Tamara is the latest property, while the Carlton by the lake has been popular,” says Vidya Singh. “Unlike the ceremonies of south Indian Hindu weddings, which start early in the morning, those from the northern states have late evening or night wedding ceremonies. Many couples from Kolkata and Delhi want a beach as the backdrop,” she says. Due to travel restrictions several families have chosen to conduct the weddings in a driveway location to give a sense of exclusivity and experience,” says GRT’s Shubhangi. Apart from the location advantage, resort weddings are also more popular now because of the hygiene and the cuisine on offer. Says ITC’s Songadwala: “Our location, cuisine, and health and hygiene initiatives are big draws.” And homestays are getting their share of business. “Dunnottar in Kodaikanal is a beautiful homestay bungalow that has enough rooms to accommodate a large family gathering, and is set on a lake with large grounds so perfect for a small wedding,” says Singh. GRT is getting calls for its Great Trails Resorts in Yercaud and Kodaikanal, besides its Mamallapuram property. The resorts offer a wedding specialist or wedding planners tie up with a property to coordinate the event. A hillside wedding can cost Rs 25 lakh upward for a night, which includes food, mehendi, music and basic reception décor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wedding-bells-ring-again-on-sandy-beaches-pristine-hills/articleshow/87704504.cms||---
---||Business||Loyalty, conscience and dedication cement his place||Chennai: The story of south India’s largest cement maker was scripted by a man from a small town educated in the Tamil medium. Over the 40 years A V Dharmakrishnan has spent at the company, Ramco Cements’ production capacity has increased from 0.4 million tonnes from a single factory in Virudhunagar, to nearly 20 million tonnes across nine factories (including a capacity addition to be completed in three months) without diluting a rupee in equity. Its capital has been unchanged since 1962. "Life was not any struggle, it was easy paced," says Dharmakrishnan, who was born in a family of farmers, went to the government high school in Rajapalayam, and to Madurai’s Vellaichamy Nadar College to study BCom. He then went to Chennai to pursue chartered accountancy. After that, he chose Madras Cements (now rechristened Ramco Cements) as his parents saw the promoters Rajhas (from Rajapalayam) as people who followed a good value system. "SAIL was offering a job for Rs 1,600, but I joined Madras Cements for Rs 1,200 a month," he recalled. He joined the group as accounts officer. Four years later he was CFO and became the MD by 2012. AVD, as his close friends call him, follows what he calls the LCD principle in management -- loyalty, decision making with a conscience, and dedication to work. "Loyalty to the place (Ramco group), and all decisions must satisfy my conscience, and dedication to work will drive my work life," he says. Early on in his career, when cement manufacturing was seen as dull and drab, Ramco went on a massive digitisation drive, initially undertaken to reduce accountancy lag from six months. "The ERP project of Ramco Systems (a group company) has helped the company significantly," he says. "The world is waking up to ESG (environment, sustainability and governance) now. We set up our wind farm (capable of generating 166MW) way back in 1990," says Dharmakrishnan. His goal was to make Ramco a benchmark of efficiency in every parameter. "Today. we are among the most efficient cement makers and also the benchmark on shareholder returns for other companies to emulate," he said. To create price advantage, Dharmakrishnan spearheaded two key actions __ focus on cost reduction and commodity branding by introducing Ramco Supergrade. "I am happy that we were able to achieve both and that is because of a solid team at Ramco". The entire senior management has been with him for more than 25 years. "If I am not in the office I am at home, spending time with my granddaughter. With the pandemic, I have stopped my routine meditation at Ramakrishna Mutt, which allowed me to declutter my mind. I shall restart once things settle down," he says. Dharmakrishnan’s next goal is to sell the right type of cement to the buyer and provide concrete solutions. "If you visit a stockist you will see him dump some cement on the buyer. We have now developed 12 types of cement, each one for a different application. A buyer needs to be given the right product for the right application. It cannot be one size fits all. Things will change and we will evangelise this," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/loyalty-conscience-and-dedication-cement-his-place/articleshow/87704468.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

A new report from app intelligence firm AppAnnie puts India fourth globally in terms of highest daily time spent in apps after Indonesia (5.5), Brazil (5.4), and South Korea (5). The bulk of app adoption this year was driven by gaming , fintech, health and fitness, and e-commerce categories with crypto apps gaining huge ground, AppAnnie's data showed. India was the world’s largest market for mobile gaming in the first half of 2021 with users here installing 4.8 billion games compared to around 2.2 billion in the US and just around 1 billion in China. India downloaded one in five of all mobile games downloaded globally this year, AppAnnie said. Homegrown Ludo King app by Gametion Technologies continues to top the charts as it was the top game for the first half of 2021 in terms of downloads and active users. FAU-G (Fearless and United Guards) stood at second spot. Battle Royale game Free Fire came in at eighth spot. Despite Ludo and FAU-G, India’s mobile gaming scene lacks the local flavour, AppAnnie’s report notes, as domestic game apps barely figure in the charts with just 7.6% of the top 1000 games in India made by homegrown publishers compared to China where the home grown ratio is 60%. In the case of finance apps, indicating growing awareness around investing and crypto, Upstox Pro, WazirX and CoinSwitch emerged as the apps with the greatest growth in downloads in the quarter ended June. Interestingly, crypto trading apps also have healthy (around 60%) one-month user retention rates among Indian users. UPI has made India a “true pace-setter in mobile payments,” the report notes. The total downloads of merchant utility apps (the likes of KhataBook, OkCredit, BharatPe etc.) in India saw a 48% increase YoY in April-June 2021 to surpass 124 million. In shopping, AppAnnie’s data shows that the digital prowess of brick-and-mortar retail chains is nowhere close to the digit-first retail brands. Digital-first shopping apps saw 23 average sessions per user each month compared to just 10 in Bricks-And-Clicks retail (omnichannel) brands. Overall, India continues to hold firmly to its market leader status in the app economy emerging as the second largest market for app downloads after China. With 24 billion app downloads this year so far compared to around 24.3 billion apps in the whole year 2020 and around 18.9 billion in 2019, India is steadily growing as a mobile-first economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/desis-spent-5-hours/day-on-apps-this-year-report/articleshow/87704438.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

And through that door, a clutch of leather footwear makers in Tamil Nadu could march into an overseas market. The lockdown in Vietnam from July to October forced about 90,000 businesses to shut and a manufacturer of sports shoes could not supply five million pairs on time to a US-based global brand. Now, several Taiwanese companies that outsource manufacturing and coordinate supply for top global brands in the US are looking at Tamil Nadu, given its traditional strengths. Taiwanese company Fengtay, which makes Nike shoes, already has a foot in the state through a tie-up with Lotus Footwear in Cheyyar and is now expanding into Bargur and Tindivanam. More recently, Mohib Group, a traditional leather enterprise, signed an MoU with the TN government to invest `500 crore in a non-leather footwear unit in association with a Taiwanese company. It is expected to employ 20,000 people at a facility near Ambur. "We have to unlearn what we did yesterday and continuously evolve if we have to grow," says Mohib group chairman Mohammed Mohibullah Kottai. "While we maintain our growth in leather, we will not ignore new opportunities. Being in the fashion industry, we have to embrace change." Globally, 86% of the footwear sold is non-leather. The leather industry in Tamil Nadu, which accounted for 45%-50% of the annual Indian leather exports of $5.09 billion in 2019-20 and estimated to touch $5.9 billion in 2021-22, is looking at a growth opportunity. "An opportunity came our way around 25 years ago, but we missed it for various reasons. Indonesia and Cambodia benefited then. A bigger opportunity is now coming our way. We should swiftly grab it," says industry veteran and Farida Group chairman M Rafeeque Ahmed. "Let the industry continue to focus on leather, which has now become a niche segment for markets such as the US. Meanwhile, a bigger growth is happening in non-leather footwear and the industry here should expand its operations to this emerging segment," says Ahmed. "For India, the US is a big market. But for the US, we are only sixth or seventh on the priority list (Indian leather sector exports to the US touched $645.6 million in 2020-21 or 17.5% of that country’s leather exports). Hence the onus should be on us to chase this opportunity, rather than expecting them to come knocking here." And the industry expects support from the state government. "It should make available plug-and-play industrial sheds to enable units to quickly move in and establish assembly lines, besides setting up micro-parks for component units," says Ahmed. Council for leather exports (CLE) executive director R Selvam says global companies are looking at India for joint ventures. "It will take time to turn this into reality, but green shoots are visible. If not for the air travel restrictions, delegations from Southeast Asian countries would have been here," says Selvam. Industry representatives say Tamil Nadu should formulate a policy to catapult it into a major footwear destination, conduct roadshows in countries where big supply chain integrators and big brands are present. "The state should declare the non-leather footwear industry as a sunrise sector," says N Mohan, chairman, non-leather footwear panel to promote Make in India by CLE and co-chairman, Assocham for leather and footwear industries. "Given the success Tamil Nadu has achieved in other sectors, I am sure in two or three years all major players will be here." Tamil Nadu is planning to establish half a dozen ‘leather clusters’ across the state, including in places such as Ambur, Manaparai, Ramanathapuram and Manallur. An official said the government is aware of the potential. "Non-leather footwear is a green industry and labour intensive, but not water intensive. It will be promoted in earnest. The industry recently submitted a policy document and we are looking into it," the official said. Pooja Kulkarni, MD & CEO, Guidance Tamil Nadu, says the athleisure category is fast growing. "While leather will continue to remain a niche and luxury product, it is the non-leather footwear that will offer tremendous growth opportunities for at least the next 10 years. We have the capability and we are on the job. We need to create clusters so that we attract not just OEMs but also their numerous vendors, as happened with the automobile industry. We are in touch with the industry and their requirements for ready-built industrial sheds could be handled through Sipcot and Sidco," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/this-boot-is-on-the-right-foot/articleshow/87704489.cms||D Govardan

He said in the past, Padma awards were presented only to those with references who knocked on the doors of power but the culture of administration and governance has changed under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. Amit Shah attended the bi-decadal anniversary celebrations of the Swarna Bharath Trust at Venkatachalam in Nellore district on Sunday. Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, founder of the trust, presided over the ceremony. Addressing the gathering, Amit Shah lauded the services of Venkaiah Naidu in protecting Indian democracy. “Venkaiah-ji had played a very crucial role in clearing the abolition of Article 370 in Rajya Sabha. He has always lived as a commoner despite reaching great heights,” said Shah. Addressing the session, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said parents should try to pass on to their children the message of service orientation and kindheartedness in extending help to the poor, and added that trying to help others is the biggest asset that elders could leave as an inheritance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/commoners-bringing-home-padma-awards/articleshow/87704647.cms||Samdani MN

The guidelines, which come into effect on March 30 next year, bring the NBFC classification norms on a par with that of banks. The guidelines were notified by the central bank in the form of clarification on its prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisions (IRACP) pertaining to advances. “To ensure uniformity in the implementation of IRACP norms across all lending institutions, certain aspects of the extant regulatory guidelines are being clarified and/or harmonised, which will be applicable to all lending institutions,” the RBI said in its circular. Two classifications will directly affect NBFC norms. The first one pertains to when a delinquent borrower, who has been classified as an NPA, can be upgraded. In a bank, if borrowers default long enough to be classified as an NPA, they will have to repay all due principle and interest that has remained unpaid to shake off the NPA label. In case of NBFCs, some of them have been upgrading accounts if the borrower gets back on the repayment schedule and pays past interest. “The NPA upgradation criteria has been tightened for NBFCs. This could lead to a spike in NPAs as loans that were upgraded from NPA to SMA (special mention account) 2 can no longer be classified as standard,” said ICRA VP Anil Gupta. He added that banks were in any case upgrading NPAs to SMA only after all the overdue amounts with respect to principal and interest were received. This difference in asset classification is also the reason why banks that acquire NBFC portfolios end up reporting a small spike in NPAs. The other change — that lenders will have to classify borrower accounts as overdue according to their day-end process — forces for the due date irrespective of when the process is done. Many banks have been following a process where they classified a loan as default only if money was not received at the month-end. This would mean that a borrower who does not meet their payment obligation on say 15th of the month would be immediately classified as delinquent but if there is a payment on the 17th it would be upgraded. This would mean more work for banks in terms of reporting but overall the delinquency may not rise. Bankers say that if the same day default rule is applied there would be a lot of defaults as almost a third of borrowers don’t have enough balance on the due date. This is seen in the 31% bounce rates in auto-debit payments based on standing instructions. To increase awareness on the importance of timely payment, the RBI has asked all lenders to place consumer education literature on their websites, explaining with examples, the concepts of date of overdue, SMA and NPA classification and upgradation, with specific reference to the day-end process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbis-new-norms-may-lead-to-surge-in-nbfc-bad-loans/articleshow/87704854.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||Tejashwi seeks Leshi’s resignation, minister refutes allegations in FIR||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday demanded resignation of food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh for her alleged role in the murder of former Dhamdaha district board member, Vihwajeet Kumar Singh alias Rintu Singh, in Purnia distrit on Friday evening. Addressing a press conference, Tejashwi said CM Nitish Kumar should drop Leshi as her name figured in the FIR lodged by Rintu’s widow Anulika Singh with the Sirsi police station. Leshi, her nephew Ashish Singh alias Ahiya and Sudesh Singh are among the four named accused in the FIR. Anulika has accused Leshi of hatching a conspiracy for the murder of Rintu as he was planning to contest the next assembly election from Dhamdaha against her. Tejashwi alleged that Rintu had submitted a written complaint with the local police apprehending his murder after an abortive attempt on November 3. However, the police didn’t take any action against the offenders, leading to his murder on Friday. The leader of the opposition in legislative assembly demanded that the CDR of the alleged conversation between Leshi and the Sirsi police station SHO should be made public. The SHO’s suspension is an eyewash, he alleged. Reacting to Tejashwi’s allegations, Leshi said investigation was underway and she was ready to face any action if found guilty in the probe. “Merely naming somebody in the FIR does not prove his/her involvement in any crime,” she said, asserting that her name was dragged in the case to tarnish her image. “The Nitish Kumar government does justice with everybody. Tejashwi should wait for the police investigation to be completed,” she told this newspaper over the phone. Taking a swipe at the RJD leader, Leshi said even Tejashwi was accused of harassing a Purnia Dalit, who was subsequently killed. “Did he resign or was arrested merely on the allegations?” she asked. Leshi got support from her cabinet colleagues Ashok Choudhary, Shahnawaz Hussain and BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, who said law will take its own course in the case. Earlier, Tejashwi alleged that murders, kidnapping and loot have become a routine affair in the state. The criminals were roaming free while Nitish’s police were watching as mute spectators. To drive home his point, he cited the murder of an RTI activist and web portal journalist, Buddhi Nath Jha alias Avinash Jha, in Madubhani. The victim’s kin had apprehended Jha’s kidnapping for murder. Yet the police remained idle and did precious little to search him. Tejashwi also cited several examples of police inaction, including that of a girl’ death in police custody in East Champaran district, murder of the nephew of former minister Raghunath Jha in Sheohar and rape of a girl in Nalanda during Chhath. “Nothing has happened in these cases as well,” he alleged. He further alleged that around 500 members of the business community have been killed in the past one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-seeks-leshis-resignation-minister-refutes-allegations-in-fir/articleshow/87704036.cms||Ramashankar

It will help pedestrians, who find it difficult to cross the busy and congested Station Road to reach Patna Junction. It will also be the first pedestrian subway with escalators in the city. The subway is a part of Railway Station Area Redevelopment Project of Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) and will come up by utilizing the funds to the tune of Rs68 crore. According to sources, the subway will be built around 8 metres deep. PSCL’s managing director-cum-Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the agency has been selected and the work will start once the foundation stone for the project is laid. “This subway will connect three important points, including Patna Junction, multimodal transit hub and multi-level car parking. People will find it convenient to travel to and from Patna Junction without facing the traffic rush near the Mahavir Mandir roundabout. The plan is to take pedestrians underground as much as possible and let motorists use the road. It will also ease off the traffic rush on Station Road,” he said. Sharma said the multimodal transit hub, in which different modalities of transport like private cabs, autorickshaws, buses will be catered, is also a part of the Railway Station Area Redevelopment Project. “A five-storey building will bring seamless passenger transfer. The detailed project report of the building is being prepared by the building construction department and soil testing at Bakri Bazaar was done on Saturday (November 13) by the officials concerned,” he told this newspaper. An overbridge connecting the second-level of multi-level car parking with Station Road flyover (between pillar 7 and 8) will also be constructed for proper utilization of the existing parking space. Commuters coming to Patna Junction would use this overbridge to park their cars directly at MLP without facing any congestion near the Budh Marg. The estimated cost of the overbridge is around Rs17 crore. Meanwhile, the construction work on Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) building on the Patna SSP office premises near Gandhi Maidan has been completed under the Smart City Project. L&T has been selected to set up an IT-based monitoring system to provide various smart services and solutions. PSCL’s public relations officer Harshita said the company will lay optical fibre, develop server room and other software to provide smart services to the city residents. The ICCC will integrate all civic and essential services into a single platform aimed at monitoring and addressing public issues in real time. The total cost of the project is around Rs221 crore while Rs15 crore has been spent on the construction of ICCC building. According to sources at PSCL, the ICCC building will be inaugurated this month by chief minister Nitish Kumar, who will also lay the foundation stone for the subway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-to-construct-subway-with-escalators-near-patna-junction/articleshow/87703672.cms||Faryal Rumi

The explosion damaged the houses of Suleiman Ansari (80) and his neighbour Ayaz Khan (64) and shattered the windowpanes of houses belonging to Nasim Ahmed, Bhola Sao and Ashok Sao in the neighbourhood. Khan’s wife Zaida Khatoon (60), Ansari’s wife Saddrina Khatoon (75) and her grandsons Abdul Ahmed (2) and Mohammad Shahid (9) were injured in the explosion. Injured Zaida told this newspaper that she was cooking food when the blast took place and the outer wall fell on her. Eyewitnesses said they spotted a greenish-white smoke billowing from the explosion spot with strong gunpowder smell. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, SP (west) Ashok Kumar Mishra and Danapur SDPO Syed Imran Masood reached the spot with forensic experts for investigation. Masood said Ansari’s two sons, Shafiq Ahmed and Taufiq Ahmed alias Fasiq Ahmed, and Khan’s son Mohammad Golu have been detained for interrogation. He did not rule out the possibility of explosion from any low-intensity bomb. “Investigation is being carried out from all angles, including if cooking gas leakage caused the explosion,” he said. Masood, a young IPS officer, said forensic experts have collected samples from the explosion site and their analysis will make things clear. “There is no splinter, shrapnel or severe burn injury from the blast,” the SSP said. Sources said preliminary tests carried out by the forensic experts could not immediately establish the presence of any explosive substance. Ansari’s family is into garment stitching business while Khan sells clothes on roadside in Danapur. Broken bricks from walls, acting as projectiles, damaged the household items of both the families. Zaida has received at least eight stitches on her head while Abdul’s ears were damaged due to explosion shockwaves which resulted in severe bleeding. He was initially taken to Danapur primary health centre from where he was rushed to the PMCH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-injured-in-explosion-at-danapur-3-detained/articleshow/87703853.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The gap between the minimum and maximum temperatures narrowed to just three degrees as the cloud cover persisted throughout the day. It drizzled occasionally in some areas as well. Moderate rain has been predicted by the Met office on Monday under the impact of a low-pressure trough that stretches between Tamil Nadu and Gangetic Bengal. Kolkata could receive between 20mm and 40mm rain over the next 24 hours, but the skies could start clearing up from Tuesday. Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 25.8°C and a minimum of 22.3°C on Sunday. The maximum was five notches below normal. “We expect a persistent and more intense spell of rain either late on Sunday or Monday morning. The low-pressure trough and easterly winds have combined to turn conditions favourable for a rainy spell. The trough will fizzle out by Tuesday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director G K Das. The temperature had started sliding below 30°C last week. “When a cloud cover remains, some of the sun’s rays are reflected back into space. This reduces the volume of the sun’s energy and heat reaching the Earth’s surface, pushing the temperature down. This is what we saw on Sunday and this was responsible for a difference of just three degrees between the maximum and minimum temperatures,” said a weather scientist. The minimum temperature may start sliding down from Tuesday as the cloud cover recedes. But it could be a very slow and gradual drop. “The mercury may drop by a degree, so we don’t expect the weather to turn chilly immediately. Onset of winter is still some distance away. The minimum temperature has to slide below 15°C for three consecutive days for winter to officially set in. It rarely happens before December 15,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/max-temp-at-25-8c-as-city-wakes-up-to-cloudy-sunday/articleshow/87704385.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Chona is not alone. A lot of affluent families from the city are now migrating to foreign countries after the outbreak of the pandemic. “With better infrastructure, I have moved here at least for a period of two years so that my children can get a better life and education,” said Chona, who is the managing director and co-founder of HRPL Restaurants Private Limited. Chona already has a thriving business back home and now he is also eyeing business opportunities in the foreign land. “While I and my family have just settled out in this city, I am looking for investment opportunities in the food and beverage as well as FMCG segment, which has been the expertise of our business back home as well. With greater connectivity and a gateway to the world’s market, I am sure it will be a strategic location,” he added. Ever since the pandemic struck, many businesspersons and professionals are shifting their base overseas seeking better opportunities for education, work and business as well as a better quality of life. Apart from Dubai, Canada is another most preferred destination. Pankaj Shah, who owns a 22-year-old business in designing of embedded software, robotics and AI, said, “We started an office out of Canada some two-and-a-half years ago and my son has been handling that for some time now. Our family is in the process of transitioning to Canada. We are looking at better opportunities for our business and it will be good for the younger generation too to get some international exposure.” Immigration consultants suggest there has been a spike in people seeking out work opportunities in countries like Dubai, Canada and even Singapore. Ahmedabad-based businessman Mignesh Parekh shifted to Canada last year with his family. “Due to the nature of my business I used to travel to Canada at least thrice a year. It was last year when I decided to shift base, with a planned transition. My kids will get better exposure and education whereas my wife, who is a physiotherapist, also has better work prospects here,” he said. Sajid Teli, CEO of an Ahmedabad-based immigration consultant, said, “We have received a sizeable number of requests since the beginning of 2021, and the number of clients approaching us has almost touched pre-Covid levels. Even professionals who get a better opportunity are looking to move abroad. For instance, Aman Kumar, a hospitality-sector professional, said, “I have worked in the hospitality sector for several years in India with different brands. However, Dubai being a market driven by tourism, the opportunities are far better here and the biggest positive is a better work-life balance due to which I decided to move there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/affluent-amdavadis-migrate-abroad/articleshow/87704498.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Pedestrian crossings on Bypass may get manual drop gates soon||KOLKATA: Manually operated drop gates are likely to be introduced at pedestrian crossings on Bypass. In the past two-and-a-half months, Bypass has witnessed 10 accidents, which led to the death of three persons, including two pedestrians. The pedestrian cross-over volume has increased sharply between Highland Park and Ruby crossing, the stretch between VIP Bazar and Panchannagram, and between Chingrighata and Bengal Chemical. “At the multiple accident review meetings at Lalbazar last week, pedestrian cross-over challenges on some stretches were cited as a major concern,” said an officer. Other problems, like lane jumping and dangerous riding, were also pointed out, said sources. According to the new proposal, each major crossing with a portable drop gate will have at least four to five cops present during peak hours. At the less important crossings, two cops will be deputed. “Unlike automated boom barriers that open and close in sync with traffic signals, manually operated drop gates allow police more flexibility in easing pedestrian pressure. This will remain a stop-gap solution at crossings that handle huge pedestrian movement till FOBs or subways are planned,” an officer said. “In addition, police will ensure the median dividers are barricaded — except at crossings — to stop illegal crossovers,” said an officer. The cops have also proposed collecting fines from pedestrians who jaywalk. Cops have also requested KMDA to ensure future subways do not force pedestrians to climb up and down too many stairs — the primary reason why people avoid them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pedestrian-crossings-on-bypass-may-get-manual-drop-gates-soon/articleshow/87704407.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Among four others arrested in the case, three are women — Dalia Nath, Priya Chakraborty and Anita Gupta. Residents of Rahara, the Mitra sisters were known as daughters of a former Army personal. The duo had been arrested earlier on similar charges of fraud, said the CID. The CID cyber cell added that though multiple such call centres had been busted earlier, this is the first time they have come across an all-woman gang. “The arrested are the owners and main operators of the fake call centre, which they started after renting the property. We have seized multiple phones, incriminating documents, bank documents and registers,” said a CID statement. A case in this regard has been initiated. The sisters had made a name for themselves in Baguiati’s Loknath Park for providing employment to women for the past five months. On Friday, however, their crimes were revealed when the CID’s cyber cell came calling. The sisters had told their employees to call up people to ask if they had vacant plots or empty rooftops and were interested in renting out the space for mobile towers, the officer said. “They targeted people in the districts and other states and would offer incredibly high returns for small spaces.” The accused would convince those interested to pay a huge sum as “registration fee”, “no-objection fee” and “GST charges”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/all-women-con-gang-busted/articleshow/87704401.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The city’s current meteorology is also conducive and good flow of air is not allowing pollutants to settle in the lower strata of the atmosphere. However, the sustained cloud cover can change the pollution level drastically. Times ViewWe must learn from Delhi and do everything we can to preempt such a situation here. Kolkata, too, has several bad-air days in a year, with vehicular emission being a key contributor.On Sunday, the city’s ambient air quality improved from ‘moderate’ to satisfactory, with AQI plunging below 100 across stations. “Satellite monitoring of crop residue burning proved extremely effective last year. We managed to activate the local administration the moment we located a flame and it was doused before it could pollute the air. This year, we are also receiving data to help the administration trace fires and take action on the ground,” said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra. Track the pollution level in your cityCrop residue burning in Punjab and Haryana has left Delhi gasping for breath and Kolkata faces a similar situation when crop residue is burnt in Hooghly, Burdwan or North 24 Parganas. WBPCB is also monitoring the dump yards of Dhapa and Pramod Nagar so that fire fuelled by constant generation of methane can be doused immediately. WBPCB has moved the proposal of deploying fire tenders at these dump yards. “Because of the burning of assorted garbage, the fumes are noxious and extremely harmful,” said a WBPCB scientist. “I dread peak winter when lower radiative temperature at the ground causes calm wind conditions lowering the vertical wind speed below 2m/second. Then no amount of pre-emptive measure will work as pollutants hang at the lower strata of the atmosphere and pile up every day,” said Rudra. WBPCB has started distributing gas ovens to food vendors to replace biomass burning with LPG. Besides, WBPCB will soon float tenders for water sprinklers, which will spray unfiltered water mixed with dust suppressant chemicals that will make dust particles join together into a bigger particle, not allowing them to float in air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pcb-takes-steps-to-prevent-del-like-pre-winter-pollution/articleshow/87704396.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: VMRDA master plan lays focus on heritage conservation||VISAKHAPATNAM: The ‘zoning and development promotion regulations’, framed as part of the recently approved Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) master plan-2041, has laid a special focus on heritage conservation in the region. A heritage conservation committee has to be constituted for advising the VMRDA in preparation of a list of heritage sites in the region and for their conservation/preservation. The earlier master plan of the VMRDA identified nearly 100 heritage sites and structures in its jurisdiction, including over 40 from Vizag city. Of these heritage sites, six sites including Bavikonda, Thotlakonda, and Sri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple are under the protection of the department of archaeology and museums. But a majority of the heritage sites remain without protection from any authority. According to a close observer of the developments with VMRDA, the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (which has been upgraded to VMRDA) for the first time had envisaged a master plan for 15 years from 1986 and 2001 without paying any attention towards the heritage structures. The revised master plan-2021, with expanding horizons of the Vuda, laid down regulations for the effective conservation of heritage sites. As per the VMRDA master plan-2041, a list of heritage sites is to be prepared. This will be supplemented by the development authority on the advice of the heritage conservation committee. Before being finalised, objections and suggestions of the public have to be invited. And on the recommendation of the heritage committee on the objections and suggestions, the state government will accord the final approval to the list of heritage sites. The listed heritage buildings and precincts may be graded into three categories, including grade-I, II and III.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Plans afoot to set up granite mining zone in Prakasam district||AMARAVATI: Setting its focus on unexplored mining areas, the state government has decided to close down the existing state highway for a distance of about 4 km near Chimakurthy in Prakasam district. This will facilitate the government to create an exclusive mining zone. The state government is planning to lease out the land, which is expected to hold vast reserves of black galaxy granite, to private developers. The land on which the state highway passes through on the outskirts of Chimakurthy is the only stretch that has been left unexplored in the region. Thousands of acres of land in the villages of Rajupalem, Lakshmipuram and Budavada, close to Chimakurthy have already been excavated since the discovery of galaxy granite in the region. Sources said reserves in areas on both the sides of highway are almost empty and the local granite industry is finding it difficult to extract quality stone. However, studies by the Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) has found that about 250 to 400 acres of land underneath the state highway holds huge granite reserves. Although the previous TDP government wanted to lease out the area to private developers, it backtracked following protests from locals against plans to close off the roads. Then roads and buildings minister and granite industrialist Sidda Raghava Rao took the initiative to create a bypass road to Chimakurthy. But with the construction of the bypass road getting delayed, plans to take over the state highway land did not materialise. Upon learning about the issue, the state government had now decided to close down the highway to take over the land for mineral extraction. Sources said the state government has already transferred the stretch to the APMDC to initiate the lease process. Meanwhile, the roads and buildings department, which manages the state highway, has been directed to lay a bypass road to connect both ends of the state highway. Sources said another bypass would be laid to connect the existing bypass road near the NSP canal. A flyover on the NSP canal will also be taken up. Sources said the vehicles carrying granite would be diverted via the bypass road without being allowed to enter Chimakurthy town. Passenger vehicles, including APSRTC buses, will be allowed to enter the town from the bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/plans-afoot-to-set-up-granite-mining-zone-in-prakasam-dist/articleshow/87704612.cms||Samdani MN

Even after 10 days of the 18-year-old Navsari girl’s alleged gang rape in Vadodara and recovery of hanging body in suspicious condition from Gujarat Queen Express coach, Valsad police are clueless about perpetrators of crime. Police received the postmortem report on Sunday on 10th day, but they are non-committal if she was was raped, murdered or she committed suicide. Her body was found hanging on November 4. In the postmortem report, three injury marks were found on lower back, thigh and waist. “The injury marks are of scratch and around four to five days old according to the postmortem report. She must have suffered the injuries during rape,” said a police officer part of investigation. Cops are yet not clear if the girl was killed or committed suicide. During investigation, it was found that she urinated while hanged. Police also found that her legs were touching the floor and it is not possible for anyone to hang herself in this position. She was found hanging to the luggage shelf using her dupatta. “There are no signs of strangulation or injury due to resistance if someone killed her. It is possible that the dupatta loosened after a while and her feet touched the floor,” said a police officer who ruled out the possibility of murder.  “We are yet to receive viscera and vaginal swab results from the forensic science laboratory. Only after the report things will get clear,” said a senior police officer. Supervision of the case has been handed over to Subhash Trivedi, in-charge IGP CID crime and railways. Trivedi arrived in Vadodara on Sunday and collected progress reports from various investigating teams. Multiple agencies of police including Valsad railway police, local crime branch (LCB) of Government Railway Police, Vadodara, detection of crime branch (DCB), Vadodara city and DCB Ahmedabad city have also joined the investigation. “Police are working to gather some important details only after that we will get a clear idea of who is involved. We will soon come out with facts,” Trivedi told TOI. Police investigation revealed that a few hours before the girl’s death she visited Surat city on the night of November 3. She is believed to have reached the city by bus from Navsari. She had informed her mother about plans to visit Maroli. She spent some time at Surat city bus depot and then went to Surat railway station. Her movement was captured by cameras at the railway station. She boarded the Gujarat Queen Express and did not get down at Navsari. Later her body was found early on November 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/injuries-on-private-parts-reveal-rape/articleshow/87704137.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Goa||Anwar Ali’s dream now just a heartbeat away||Panaji: Anwar Ali is smiling again. He’s training with elite players at FC Goa, enjoying, and it seems only a matter of time – 46 days to be precise -- before he takes the field in Indian football’s top-tier where he clearly belongs. It all seems like a dream now. Exactly two years ago when he sat across the table from Dr. Francois Carre at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire in France, Anwar couldn’t believe what the leading expert on cardiology in sports was telling him. Dr. Carre, head of sports medicine at the hospital, told Anwar, then just 19, that the “practice of a competitive sport in competition presented an excessively high risk of serious cardiac accident.” Anwar, 21, was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition where the heart muscle wall becomes abnormally thick and affects the pumping of blood. For footballers, it’s a risky proposition with even the seemingly fittest – England midfielder Fabrice Muamba, for example – collapsing on the field. “When I heard the doctor, I thought the world was ending for me,” Anwar tells TOI, recalling that evening in Rennes. “I was shocked to hear and didn’t know what was happening. Since childhood, all I have done is play football.” Anwar grew up herding cattle just as his father and family had done in Punjab. Football was his passport for a better life, and he seemed on the right track, particularly when he played every minute of India’s campaign in the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017. In the words of his mentor, Ranjit Bajaj, “Anwar is a once in a generation footballer.” The talent seemed lost when doctors in France reiterated their opinion. Anwar, all of them said, couldn’t play competitive football. “From France, I made a phone call to Ranjit sir and my family. They told me not to worry, and just be patient. They motivated me. It’s only because of them that I am here today. Otherwise, I don’t know what would have happened to me,” says Anwar. Since being forbidden to play by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under its umbrella, Anwar shut himself in his room at home. His reaction, in his own words, “was off.” The lockdown imposed to control Covid-19 in March didn’t help. In-between, AIFF officials got in touch with his father and explained the consequences of Anwar continuing to pursue competitive football. They offered him a job – he could choose to become a youth coach, scout or administrator. “I didn’t want any of those jobs,” says Anwar. “My mentality was not for coaching. I was focused only on playing. Coaching job is fine, but not right now. I was meant to be a player and I wouldn’t stop for anything or anyone. I made it clear that if not at the top, I’d play in lower divisions, non-recognised football tournaments, anything. But I would not stop playing.” He didn’t, and backed by Bajaj, owner of the Minerva Football Academy in Punjab, started training all over again. He sought advice from other doctors who provided him hope. When AIFF were not willing to budge, he continued to knock on every door, including the Delhi High Court. To take care of his congenital heart condition, Anwar listened to experts and made adjustments to his lifestyle. Growing up on a non-vegetarian lifestyle, he quit meat, turned vegan and stayed away from energy drinks too. It was tough. “Meat is something I’ve enjoyed since I was a kid. It’s very dear to me,” he says with a hearty laugh. Anwar quit his vegan diet after six months. When the Delhi High Court offered a lifeline and allowed him to play after more than a year, Anwar grabbed the chance. He played in lower divisions in Uttarakhand, Punjab, and later Delhi. Bajaj, meanwhile, hired top experts from London to plead his case and the AIFF medical committee eventually cleared him to play if he could “produce an affidavit claiming full responsibility, along with details of the medical precautions to be taken by him, and his prospective club to make him eligible to play competitive football.” For a year, FC Goa had tracked him. He seemed a natural fit for a club which loved to play football on the front foot; Anwar, a defender, was top scorer in the recent I-League Qualifiers. When the path was clear, invited him to train. Anwar will officially sign for the club when the transfer window opens on January 1. He is expected to make his much-awaited debut in the Indian Super League (ISL), the top-tier of Indian football, 24 hours later against Kerala Blasters. “I am very excited,” says Anwar. “I have been waiting to play again at the top for a very long time. Everyone knows I was forced to play lower divisions but that turned out to be an experience for me. Whatever happens, happens for the best.” Anwar is ready to “start all over again.” That it will be with Goa is just what he had dreamed all along. “I have played more games in Goa than anywhere else. We trained here for the under-17 World Cup, then Indian Arrows. We played a lot of (friendly) matches with FC Goa. They have a good style, they keep the ball and entertain. I saw the coach (Juan Ferrando) at the Durand Cup and he’s also good. “Honestly, I can’t express how excited I am. My family and those close to me have gone through a lot. Ranjit sir too. They are all just as excited as me. Having waited for so long for this opportunity, I will not let it slip out of my hands,” says Anwar. Everyone’s waiting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/anwar-alis-dream-now-just-a-heartbeat-away/articleshow/87724294.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The body of the third and elder brother was also recovered by Sahil. On November 9 Sahil’s mother Ranjana and sister Shraddha, who were washing clothes on the bank of the Mhadei river in their village at Betkekar wada saw three brothers drowning after they were swept away by currents. They immediately alerted Sahil who jumped into the river and managed to save two of the three brothers. Unfortunately, the elder brother lost his life in the river, Sahil managed to pull out the two brothers from the river. Valpoi residents have praised this act of bravery and appreciated him for his selfless act while requesting the government to honour Sahil with a bravery award. Narrating the incident Sahil said that he felt sad when he saw the body of the older boy floating in the river. He said that while he managed to save the two, one life he could not save. Sahil who is a student of Class XII at the Government Higher Secondary School, Valpoi, said, “My mother and sister came running to me and told me that due to strong currents the three brothers were getting swept into deep water. My uncle Sagar and I jumped into the river and started looking for the three.” He added that after 10 minutes he managed to bring out the 10-year-old boy who was in a semi-conscious state and administered him first aid and later a local shifted the youngster to Valpoi community health centre in his vehicle. “I went in again and started searching in the river. I saw the second brother who was holding on to branches in deep water. I swam and brought him safely to the bank of the river and ventured again and continued looking for the third boy but sadly I found a floating body deep into water which I fished out,” he said. Sahil was felicitated by the Valpoi police station and a local NGO. Valpoi police inspector Harish Gawas said, “There are very few people who help others by risking their own lives and Sahil is one of them. This boy has done a commendable job by saving two lives,” Gawas said. Health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane said, “I am really proud of Sahil Laad, a youth from Valpoi who, without even a thought jumped into the river to save two precious lives. I will be recommending to the chief minister to present Sahil Laad with a bravery award to honour his bold act.” Councillor of Valpoi Municipal Council Idris Shaikh said that the courageous act is highly appreciated. “I am very proud that Sahil is from my ward. I request the state government to kindly consider Sahil’s name for the bravery award as he dared to dive into the deep river to bring back the drowning children from the brink of death,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teen-risks-life-to-save-duo-from-drowning-awarded-for-bravery/articleshow/87704997.cms||Afaq Khan

A conference of ministers and senior officials from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were convened by devaswom and SC/ST welfare minister K Radhakrishnan on Tuesday, wherein the participating states discussed and raised their requests to ensure a safe and secure pilgrimage season. In the meeting, G Vani Mohan, principal secretary (Hindu religious and charitable endowments) department of Andhra Pradesh, requested that Kerala should consider favourably allotting land at Nilackal for setting up a rest house for devotees from Andhra, as about 50% Sabarimala devotees are from there. In exchange, it would allot land for Kerala at Tirumala-Tirupati, a major pilgrimage centre in Andhra. Telangana too requested for land allotment at Nilackal In September 2015, the UDF government had decided to give five acres owned by Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) at Nilackal to Telangana to build and operate accommodation and facilitation centre for the Sabarimala pilgrims from there, with land ownership vesting with TDB. The state government had also allotted five acres to Karnataka government through an agreement between TDB and Karnataka government. In return, Telangana government had assigned one acre at Mahendra hills in Hyderabad for setting up Kerala Bhavan to provide accommodation and tourism facility for visitors from Kerala to Hyderabad. However, the allotment of land for other states had run into legal complications. The decision of the state government was then stayed by the high court. “The land at Nilackal was supposed to be used for the development of Sabarimala. The matter has since been stayed by the court. Now that the requests from other states have been made again, the Travancore Devaswom Board will discuss the matter on the further steps to be taken,” said TDB president N Vasu. In the meeting on Tuesday, Puducherry PWD and law minister K Lakshminarayanan said that more than 50,000 devotees are expected to arrive at Sabarimala from Puducherry. Senior officials who represented Telangana and Tamil Nadu in the meeting, requested the state to open control rooms at major centres enroute to Sabarimala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/other-states-seek-land-for-pilgrim-facility-centres/articleshow/87704496.cms||KP Saikiran

Hazel’s swimming expedition was an attempt at spreading awareness about the need for cleaner oceans for the sake of environment. A state-level swimming champion who recently passed out of Smt Sulochanadevi Singhania School in Thane, Hazel was felicitated by Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha as she came out of the water at Gateway. Her coach, Umesh Uttekar, lauded her maiden attempt in long distance swimming. Talking to TOI, Hazel said, “I wanted to swim from Elephanta to Gateway as I strongly feel about the poor condition of our seas and oceans. A lot of plastic trash, polluting industrial waste and domestic sludge is daily dumped into the oceans, which is not good for the environment. Even as I swam today, I had to be careful to avoid floating plastic bottles, waste paper, cardboard cartons and general garbage. It’s very unfortunate.” She added, “Our oceans are the origin and engine of all lifeforms of our planet, yet we uncaringly dump a lot of plastic and chemical into them. I know many swimmers who avoid swimming in the open seas because there is a lot of visible dirt and pollution. Let us not turn our seas into a dump yard.” Her proud father, Mitesh Raikundalia, said, “Hazel wants to swim across the legendary English Channel in the next two years, which is why it is important to first swim locally along the Mumbai coast. However, the dirty condition of the Arabian Sea deters many. I am happy my daughter has the will and dedication to swim long distances.” Coach Uttekar pointed out that the recent lockdowns were tough phases for Hazel as she could not access any of the swimming pools. However, as soon as circumstances improved, she again started her rigorous training in pools before making her debut dive into the sea. She was accompanied by pilot boats consisting of observers, time-keepers, her coach and family members. Annually, we offload over 180 million tonnes of toxic waste into the sea. Around 8 million metric tonnes of plastic trash (which is equivalent to 57,000 blue whales) is also annually dumped into the oceans which is disastrous for the marine biodiversity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-maiden-attempt-teen-swims-14km-to-save-the-seas/articleshow/87705667.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Mangaluru||Rain pattern worries farmer documenting rainfall since decades||Mangaluru: A Sullia farmer who has been manually recording rainfall for the past four decades has expressed concern about the changing rainfall pattern in recent years. Since 1976, Pataje Govindayya Sathyanarayana Prasad, 63, an agriculturist from Balila in Bellare, approximately 85 kilometres from here, has been keeping track of rainfall in his backyard. The region receives 165 days of rain on average each year, but so far this year, the region has received 177 days of rain, and is likely to cross 200 days by the end of the year. The depression that has formed in the Bay of Bengal may bring rain to the region over the next few days. The region witnessed 200 days of rain in 1978. Rainfall has also been recorded every month from March 2020 to November this year, which was not the case previously, he said. Every day, the farmer broadcasts rainfall details for his village on his Facebook page and Whatsapp groups, as well as rainfall statistics and zodiac signs. Since 1976, he has not missed a single day of recording rain from 8am to 8am (24 hours) and has served as an inspiration to many people. The rainwater is collected in a glass jar that rests securely on a three-foot-tall pedestal. In Sullia, Puttur, Kadaba, Karkala, Belthangady, and Udupi, there are currently about 50 people who record rain the traditional way. The aim is to get at least 100 more people to record rainfall in their backyards. The region receives an average of 4,500 mm of rainfall every year, with this year's total expected to exceed 5,000 mm. “Also, in general, if we have abundant rainfall for three years in a row, the fourth year is expected to get less rainfall. However, in recent years, we have seen a shift in this pattern, with rainfall increasing. If at least three people document rainfall in a village, we will be able to understand the exact pattern,” he said. The destruction of the western ghats and the El Nina effect, according to Prasad, are to blame for the change in rainfall pattern and climate change. Agricultural activity will be affected due to this, as well as the quality of arecanuts, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rain-pattern-worries-farmer-documenting-rainfall-since-decades/articleshow/87703750.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

But seemingly, fate too got adventurous leaving not only the duo, but their kin too, with an unforgettable mid-sea nightmare. Ajit Kathad, a health worker of a village primary health centre, and his wife Sarla, a teacher went for parasailing ride at Nagoa beach in Diu on Sunday morning. Just a minute into the ride, the couple had a close shave while floating several metres up in the air mid-sea with only their lifejackets and an uncontrollable parachute above their heads to hang on to after the rope tied to the boat broke. Kathad and his wife did not realize immediately, but his elder brother Rakesh, who was recording a video on his mobile phone, screamed in horror seeing his brother and sister-in-law flying away on their own. As the shocked couple safely landed in the sea, they were rescued immediately and brought ashore. “I was recording the video and had no idea what to do when the rope broke. I could see my brother and sister-in-law falling from a great height, and I never felt so helpless as I did at that moment,” a teary-eyed Rakesh said. Owner of Palms Adventure and Water Sports, Mohan Lakshman told TOI, “This is first time that an incident like this has happened in the past three years because there were heavy winds on Sunday. We have well-trained staff for rescue operations going by the guidelines and they have all been trained in Goa.” Lakshman operates similar waters sports in Daman too. Later, Rakesh told reporters that he had noticed that the rope was weak, and fearing it may snap with weight, he had even warned the people managing the ride about it. However, they assured him that nothing would happen and that the damaged part of the rope would not even go up in the air, he added. Sarla was in such a state of shock that she could not speak for few minutes. “My wife and I were talking when the rope snapped, but we did not realize it. After a few seconds we understood that we were on our own,” Kathad said.  “We could have fallen in the sea or even on the land. But when we questioned the staff, they arrogantly brushed off their responsibilities,” he alleged. The families had taken their children too, on the boat, but the ride operators did not have lifejackets for children. “Initially, they gave faulty jackets, but after insisting twice they gave us the right-sized jackets for the children,” Kathad said. The family went to the police station to raise the issue of negligence, but did not file any complaint. “We wanted to ensure that no other person should face the same experience as us. The company should take up the responsibility,” Kathad added.

---||Amritsar||Change in air: How some exceptions in Punjab fields are holding out hope||LUDHIANA/PATIALA: It wasn’t fog that obscured the view as one entered the lush Punjab Agricultural University in Ludhiana on this not-so-fine November morning. The smell was not that of fresh air and the eyes hurt, the thick smog diminishing the magnificence of the Dr Manmohan Singh auditorium. A big flex banner outside the auditorium read, “Stop burning paddy stubble”, indicating an acknowledgment of the crisis at hand. Gurpal Singh, a farmer from Tarn Taran, looked closely at one of the many farm machines on display, even as he and his friends from various parts of the state shared notes on their results elsewhere. Gurpal told TOI that he had been using happy seeder -- a tractor-installed “zerotillage” agriculture machinery employed to sow wheat following the paddy harvest that also does in situ management of the stubble -- for three years now. “It is common knowledge that burning the farmland hampers its fertility. It also kills a lot of mitr-kitanu (friendly insects). I stopped burning the paddy stubble in 2018. Yes, the cost (of happy seeder) is a bit high, but the long-term benefits are promising,” said Gurpal. The 60-year-old recalled that his father didn’t burn the paddy either: it was only in the early 90s that the practice became popular as the cost of farming spiked. “Opting to burn the stubble was out of helplessness and not a permanent solution. Earlier too, we didn’t burn the stubble and rather mulched and mixed it in the soil. Then, people started burning paddy stubble to cut costs. Now that we have access to the seeders, the first thing I decided to do was switch to the old ways using the latest machinery,” said Gurpal. He also pointed out that the new techniques had considerably reduced the irrigation requirements for his 20-acre field. His friend and fellow farmer, Satnam Singh, who had 25 acres under his plough, agreed. “There has been no difference in the wheat yield in the last two years. Rather the water requirement has come down as the soil holds moisture better,” said Satnam, who, however, rued the high cost of diesel. All the same, at a time when smouldering farms have become a common sight in rural Punjab, a few exceptions where the stubble is not burnt but managed in situ or ex situ, have come as a silver lining. Though small in number, some farmers have realised that burning the stubble only hampers the cultivability of their fields and costs them more in the long run. A few of them even grudgingly agree that the stubble burning is not only impacting Delhi’s air quality but also their own quality of life. Jaspreet Singh Jaggi, a 35-year-old third-generation farmer from Nabha, agreed. After the recently concluded harvest, while his brother was busy getting the paddy processed at a small mandi in the village, Jaggi was inspecting his latest smart seeder. “We have been using both the happy seeder and its variant, super seeder. But the access to such machines is limited to a few,” said Jaggi, adding that he was trying to dissuade others from burning farm stubble. He, however, admitted that the new alternatives were yet to catch the imagination of people. Harpal Singh’s is among the few success stories, though. The “foreign-returned” 34-year-old from Ramgarh Sivia village in Ludhiana drives a modified 50-horse-power Ford-3620 tractor, with a happy seeder attached, on his 25-acre land. He pointed towards a farm next to his that mulched straw and proudly told us that “this year, they also did not burn the stubble, while I have been following this practice since 2018”. Harpal said while the whole exercise cost him Rs 3,500 per acre, he had been following the “zero-tillage” farming for four years now and the benefits far outweighed the costs. “The cost of irrigation has dipped by more than a half. The usage of potash and urea has also come down. The soil fertility has increased over the years,” said Harpal. Under “zero-tillage”, one does not mix the mulched straw into the soil and, instead, keeps it covered on the field. As the happy seeder cuts deep into the soil, the mulched straw retains the moisture and decays eventually, thereby increasing the soil fertility. “These are our farmlands and no matter how educated the new generations become, there will always be a dearth of employment. So, the young men will have to pick up the ploughs and become farmers. We cannot risk losing our land’s value by burning it,” he added. Not everyone is convinced. Hriday Pal Singh (39) from Soniwal Kalan in Ludhiana said he was subject to taunts from not just other villagers, but also his own father. “I am the only one using a happy seeder here. Even my father thinks that I am crazy,” he said. According to BS Sidhu, Punjab’s director of agriculture, people are slowly seeing the light of the day. “Traditionally, we did not like burning. But in the early 90s, things started to change. To reverse the trend, we need to extend incentives. The high cost of diesel is a major deterrent,” Sidhu said. “It’s the farmer who is the biggest loser as the farm stubble burning kills most of the micro flora and fauna in the soil layer that augments productivity,” he added. Agricultural engineer Dr Harminder Sidhu, who developed the happy seeder way back in 2007, said India was lagging behind other countries. His machine was first introduced in 2012 and it was only until 2017-18 that it started reaching the farmers. “When I developed the happy seeder, I thought of all constraints, that is, feasibility, economy, sustainability and scalability. It is one of the best zero-tillage machines currently being used in the country, but not many know about it. So, while a farmer in one village may be using a seeder, another in a nearby village may not be aware of it,” he said. Giving a rough estimate, he said of the about 80 lakh acres under paddy culativation in Punjab, less than10 lakh used zero-tillage. This, he said, wasn’t even a fraction of what was being done in countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/change-in-air-how-some-exceptions-in-punjab-fields-are-holding-out-hope/articleshow/87704506.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cautious start to first trade fair of Covid era||NEW DELHI: On the first day of the 40th edition of India International Trade Fair (IITF) at Pragati Maidan, exhibitors from across states and a few countries saw a gradual influx of visitors. However, due to the pandemic, only nine countries turned up against the 23 participants in 2019. For the exhibitors from Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Tunisia, Sri Lanka, Turkey and UAE, the event is of a major significance as it is being held after a one-year gap. The key highlight was the participation of artisans at the Bihar stall, the event partner state, and at SARAS 2021 being organised by NIRD and Panchayati Raj. ITPO, the event’s organising agency, claimed that the fair would see the participation of over 1,500 artisans and 130 self-help groups (SHG) in sync with its theme “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. Artisans and SHGs from across 28 states displayed their items at the SARAS mela. Silk and cotton sarees from Odisha, Bihar and Chhattisgarh, bedsheets from Uttar Pradesh, Kantha sarees from West Bengal and bamboo art and water hyacinth products from Assam were displayed there by MSMEs. Inside the newly inaugurated exhibition hall, the Bihar stall presented its traditional Madhubani, Manjusha and Sikki art forms on terracotta and textiles. “We have 41 stalls representing Bihar this year against 34 in 2019. We will have a live demonstration of Madhubani paintings by Dulari Devi, an artist from the lowest strata,” said Ashok Sinha, organising director. Uttar Pradesh, a focus state at the fair, had 124 exhibitors from across its districts representing it as a brand. Among the 30 states and Union Territories, Nagaland and Karnataka did not turn up. Jharkhand was another focus state. A few visitors were seen confused at the Hunar Haat pavilion of the ministry of minority affairs. All state and country stalls were scattered across the new exhibition halls 2, 3, 4 and 5. “The four halls are interconnected and appear like one big hall. It is difficult to figure out the stalls without any help,” said Seema Kumari, a visitor. An exhibitor at the Turkey stall, Harulla Karpus, who had put up a display of handmade ceramic items, said, “The exhibition is hardly seeing visitors on Day 1 compared with past years. There are only three exhibitors from Turkey this year.” There were 20 exhibitors from Afghanistan displaying dry fruits. The country’s exhibitors didn’t travel to India because of the travel restriction amid the political turmoil in their country. Maria and Khaliza, exhibitors at the Iran stall, were hopeful of selling their traditional gold-plated jewellery, but sale was low for them on Day 1. There was a live performance of Fusion Yoga by practitioners from Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, free medical consultation by experts of various Ayush streams and display of various food items promoting nutrition and good health at the pavilion of the ministry of Ayush. The activities revolved around the theme of holistic health. Various institutes and research bodies of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy streams had set up their counters in hall number 10. While there were boards on display reiterating Covid-19 precautions, thermal detectors and sanitisers were not available at the entry gates. Many exhibitors and visitors were seen without masks. Till Friday, the fair would be for B2B participants and open for the general public from Saturday. The price of entry passes would reduce to Rs 80-120 from Friday against the current Rs 500. More crowds are expected on the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cautious-start-to-first-trade-fair-of-covid-era/articleshow/87705002.cms||Zumbish
---||Coimbatore||Train service resumes after 20 months||Coimbatore: In a big relief to those who commute daily for occupational and educational purposes, the much-awaited Coimbatore–Pollachi passenger train resumed service after a gap of 20 months on Sunday. The train (number 06419) started at 6.15pm from the Coimbatore Junction and reached Pollachi at 7.30pm after stopping in Podanur and Kinathukadavu railway stations. Pollachi Lok Sabha MP K Shanmuga Sundaram visited Podanur Junction to witness the first trip of the train. He had given representation on several occasions for the restoration of the train service over the last few months. For T Krishna Balaji, a resident of Pollachi, resumption of train service has come as a big relief. Working in an IT company in Saravanampatti, Balaji had preferred working from home as the train service was halted. Flyover work near Athupalam and Ukkadam has been causing frequent traffic jams making the road travel from Pollachi to Coimbatore hectic. While monthly season train ticket would cost just Rs 270 from Coimbatore to Pollachi, the same would cost Rs 1,800 in bus. Though the train was expected to be operated with an electric engine as the broad-gauge line from Podanur to Pollachi was electrified recently, it was operated with diesel locomotives. K Jayaraj, a member of Divisional Railway User's Consultative Committee (DRUCC), Salem division, cited rake sharing arrangement with the Pollachi–Palakkad passenger train as the reason for not operating electric engines. Since the Pollachi–Palakkad section is yet to be electrified, Coimbatore – Pollachi passenger train is operated with diesel loco. Operation of electric engines will further reduce the travel time between Coimbatore and Pollachi, he said.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/train-service-resumes-after-20-months/articleshow/87705010.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This has been proven time and again when cops’ selfless activities helped saved many a life during the pandemic induced lockdown. And their good work didn’t end there when another of their ilk, constable Kishan Rathod working in DySP office Modasa, has shown yet again what charity begins at home truly means. Rathod was inspired to do charity when the group organized collection to help donate for the poor. This time, he did the charity work himself, albeit from his own purse. It all began with Rathod saving a portion of his salary every month to buy sweaters and save lives of underprivileged children this winter. Talking to TOI, Rathod said, “I decided to serve the children by sparing a bit from my salary. Their faces remind me of my own poverty that our family suffered and the smile I receive after getting the gift itself gives me a lot of satisfaction. I have been doing so for the past five years and after my pay increased, I also increased my contribution. This winter, the number of beneficiaries has gone up to 50 children.” Dy SP Bharat Basiya said, “Kishan Rathod has been providing yeoman service for the past five years. He identifies needy or orphaned children and their families writing in cold and distributes sweaters which he buys from his own savings. He is a writer holding the post of constable in my office. Rathod and his brother, who hail from ordinary background themselv es, are truly helpful in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/policemans-charity-work-keeps-needy-kids-warm-in-winter-season/articleshow/87704510.cms||---

Hubballi-Dharwad Smart City Limited (HDSCL) has started construction of a new two-storey building at a cost of Rs 19 crore. The demolition of the 120-year-old structure was already initiated by a construction company from Udupi. The building was converted into a hospital in 1936 and was known as Rao Bahadur Srinivas Balaji Chitaguppi Dispensary from 1894. In 1998 Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation celebrated its centenary year. Since then, the hospital has been catering to the needs of people of Hubballi and also its surroundings. Demolition of the main building demolition is underway. Once it is completed, the construction company will start work for the new building. HDSCL managing director CW Shakrel Ahemad said, “In the place of the main building a new building with ground first floor will be built. It will have parking place for 28 cars and 40 two-wheelers in the basement. The building will be constructed on 16,485 square meters.” The ground floor will have 26 sections including lobby, injection room, medical check-up room and others. The first floor will have 17 sections including nurses rest room, sterile store room, nurse station, group D room, nurse changing room, doctors changing room and others, he added. Manish Chitaguppi, a regional manager in a pharma company said, “Chitaguppi Hospital served the purpose of our ancestors. We expect a large number of needful people to get benefit from the hospital run by the civic authorities, mainly the poor.” Legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti said the Chitaguppi hospital building was built during the British rule and is a landmark in the city. “I personally feel the authorities should try to design the building like the old structure itself, so that the legacy will continue. I visited the hospital last in 2018,” he said. According to sources the authorities had tried to retain some part of the hospital but could not as wood and Mangalore roof tiles were used to build it. HDSCL is taking up development of the hospital in three phases. It will have a maternity block on 1,068 square metres, administrative building on 2,215 square metres and hospital building on 1,648 square metres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/chitaguppi-hospital-set-to-get-a-major-facelift/articleshow/87703766.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The presence of Croatian visitors was just the trigger. It took them centuries back to the time when travellers from the country left behind their footprints in this tiny village. Croatians, according to records, had built the beautiful church on the scenic hillock on the banks of Cumbharjua canal, about five kilometres east of Old Goa A three-member team from HRT Croatian Radiotelevision was at the historic church at the invitation of Goa tourism, filming a documentary on the erstwhile relationship between the European nation and Goa. A Croatian indologist Zdravka Matisic had found the reference to her country’s Goa links while studying Sanskrit in India. Fr Walter D’Souza, one of the three concelebrants at the Mass, while delivering the homily, reminded the parishioners about how Croatians had planted the seed and how they grew in faith. The chapel dedicated to St Blaise — Sao Braz in Portuguese — was built in 1541 and elevated to church status in 1563, said parish priest Fr Albino Mendonca. He was a concelebrant at the Mass with Fr Joaquim Loiola Pereira, secretary to the archbishop. The Sao Braz Church is a smaller version of Sveti Vlaho Church in Dubrovnik, Croatia. “We have shown the team a few things. The church bell, statue of St Braz and other antiquities that are part of our rich history,” Mendonca said. While the crew flitted about and cameras zoomed in on the Sunday celebrations and the parishioners, they tried to keep themselves rooted to the present. “The villagers are happy and thrilled to see the Croatians. A few years ago, they had collected donations in Dubrovnik church that helped our church restoration work,” villager Braz Silveira said. For the visitors, the trip will be a memorable one. “It is a learning experience for me and my colleagues about our country’s rich past,” Croatian journalist Dragan Nikolic said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/croatian-documentary-teams-visit-stirs-up-gandaulims-historic-past/articleshow/87705040.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KIIFB, CAG differ on off-budget borrowings||T’puram: Kerala infrastructure investment fund board is an annuity-based economic model and not an entity created for off-budget borrowing, KIIFB said in response to the observations made by the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) in its report that was tabled in the assembly last week. Government has entrusted KIIFB to implement projects worth Rs 70,000 crore that were announced in the budgets of previous years. For this purpose, government gave a legal assurance that petrol cess and half of the collection of motor vehicle tax will be paid to KIIFB as a growing annuity. In other words, KIIFB is an organization with a strong revenue source. The statement further added that 25% of the projects undertaken by KIIFB are revenue yielding and they include loans provided to KSEB, K-FON and industrial parks. This revenue along with the revenue shared by government will ensure that KIIFB will never become debt-ridden. KIIFB has also developed an asset-liability software that will calculate the liabilities of each project. In addition, revenue that will reach KIIFB in the coming years can also be calculated in advance. KIIFB director board will clear projects only after ensuring that its liabilities will never affect its revenue and it is functioning on the basis of asset-liability matching model. Government has not conceived KIIFB as a model that can avail loans outside the budget, but as a body corporate that is required to find resources for the development of infrastructure in state. It further said that the comments made in CAG’s 2020 report was one-sided and doesn’t conform to the facts about KIIFB. In the period that was discussed in the CAG report, Centre also has made transactions on annuity basis. Till 2019-20, KIIFB availed Rs 5,036.61 crore as loans and repaid Rs 353.21 crore as interest on loans. The government shared Rs 5,572.85 crore with KIIFB collected from motor vehicles tax and petroleum cess. This would mean that KIIFB received more funds from the government than it paid in its liabilities. For these reasons, the loans availed by KIIFB needn’t be construed as an off-budget borrowing or government’s direct liability, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-cag-differ-on-off-budget-borrowings/articleshow/87704520.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sharma has been accused of trespassing into a Krishna temple, Nidhivan, in Vrindavan, where entry is forbidden at night. Sharma and his associates are alleged to have entered the premises "with their shoes on” by climbing over the wall at midnight and filming the area. As per popular belief, no one is allowed to enter the temple at night since it is held that Lord Krishna and Radha perform 'raslila' at night at the place and they should not be disturbed. According to SP (City) MP Singh, during interrogation, Sharma told the police that he has been running his YouTube channel under the name of ‘GauravZone' for the past five years and earns Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 per month from it. He has around 45 lakh subscribers. “I had visited my uncle’s place in Mathura on November 6. My cousin Prashant told me that there is a place in Vrindavan, where no one enters at night, as it is believed that misfortune strikes those who do so. I decided to make a video of the area and arrived at Nidhivan around midnight with my cousin and his friends and after shooting the video for 15-20 minutes, we came out,” Sharma told the police. He confessed to uploading the video on his channel on November 9 and added that when he came to know about the FIR lodged against him, he immediately deleted the video from his YouTube channel. Soon after the video was uploaded, an FIR was registered against unidentified persons under sections 295 (destruction, damage, or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with intent to insult the religion of a class of persons) of IPC and section 66 of the IT Act at the Vrindavan police station on a complaint filed by a priest at Vrindavan's Banke Bihari temple. The complainant stated that the accused tried to "disrupt religious harmony" with an intention to hurt sentiments and popular beliefs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-youtuber-remanded-to-14-day-judicial-custody-for-entering-into-krishna-temple-in-vrindavan-at-night-filming-video/articleshow/87703768.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Goa||Sangita ruled out of Asian Cup with ACL injury, Bala doubtful||Panaji: India’s preparations for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 have been dealt another blow as midfielder Sangita Basfore is ruled out of the tournament with an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury. “Sangita has an ACL injury so she is definitely out of the tournament. That’s sad because she is a super good holding midfielder,” coach Thomas Dennerby told TOI. Sangita picked up the injury during India’s recent tour to Sweden. “She is very strong with her defence, the best player to intercept balls and win them back for the team. She is someone who makes the players around her look better, always protecting them,” said Dennerby. Sangita’s injury comes after another star player – Bala Devi – is on the verge of being ruled out of the tournament, also with ACL. Bala, the country’s biggest name in women’s football, picked up an ACL injury during her stint with Rangers FC in Scotland and was operated on September 3. She is currently undergoing rehabilitation in Bengaluru but is yet to start jogging. With the tournament drawing near, it now looks unlikely that she will be able to make the cut. “I am a little bit doubtful to be honest (about Bala),” said Dennerby. “There is no final word, but she is not here at the camp. She is still on rehabilitation. If you really work hard, you can make a return after six months, although it takes six to nine months before you are 100 percent fit. The doors, though, are not closed yet.” Participating teams have to submit the final list of 23 players to AFC before January 10. India have been handed a tough draw for the Asian Cup, clubbed alongside eight-time champions China, two-time winners Chinese Taipei and Iran, who they face in the opener on January 20 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sangita-ruled-out-of-asian-cup-with-acl-injury-bala-doubtful/articleshow/87724366.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Kochi||Kochi: Now, laity protests against uniform mode of Holy Mass||KOCHI: Protests over unification in the style of conducting Holy Mass in Syro-Malabar Church escalated further on Sunday as hundreds of churchgoers held a protest march to the Church headquarters on Sunday evening. The protesters were laity from the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. The issue pertains to the differences in celebrating Holy Mass in various dioceses of Syro-Malabar Church, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in some dioceses and facing the altar in others. The unified way is a combination of both. As per the Syro-Malabar Church synod’s decision, the uniform mass would come into effect from November 28. According to the protestors, for the past five decades in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese, the priest conducts the ceremony facing the people. The protest took place under the banner of Almaya Munnettam, an organisation of laity members of the Church. “We have warned of stronger protest forms in the coming days if a favourable decision is not made before November 20. Sunday’s march was attended by nearly 1,000 representatives from various parishes of the diocese,” said Riju Kanjookkaran, PRO of Almaya Munnettam. On Friday, around 200 priests from Palakkad, Irinjalakuda, Thrissur, Thamarassery, and Ernakulam-Angamaly dioceses had marched to the Church headquarters, raising the same issue. The priests were denied entry into the compound of the headquarters even as the curia chancellor of Syro-Malabar Church accepted a memorandum detailing their concerns. The protesting laity members on Sunday criticised the Church authorities for denying entry to the priests and demanded an apology. However, as per officials of the Church, the uniform mode of conducting the Holy Mass is a decision approved by the bishops and the Pope. The second summit of the 29th synod of Syro-Malabar Church had envisaged a complete transformation into the new way of conducting mass by the Easter Sunday of 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-laity-protests-against-uniform-mode-of-holy-mass/articleshow/87704536.cms||---

Ghazipur superintendent of police Ram Badan Singh told TOI on Sunday, “The permission sought by Samajwadi Party could not be given as the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), which has executed the project, has not opened it for general commuting since its inauguration is due. Hence giving permission was not possible for the district authorities.” In response to the application seeking permission, Ghazipur DM MP Singh and SP sent a letter to SP saying the inauguration of Purvanchal Expressway by the PM in Sultanpur and a public meeting will be held between 2pm and 4pm. “UPEIDA had not allowed general commuting on the expressway for security reasons in view of the PM’s visit. Movement of public vehicles will be allowed only after the inauguration,” the letter stated. Expressing inability in granting permission, the officials suggested the SP chief reschedule the event on November 17 or on any day later. Reacting to the denial of permission, SP spokesman Manoj Rai Dhoopchandi said, “The party had planned a public meeting at Pakhanpura (Haidaria) between 11.30am and 12.30pm after which the Vijay Rath Yatra had to proceed to Azamgarh through the expressway, a project launched by former chief minister in his regime, but the BJP government is trying to grab its credit.” The officials have denied permission under pressure of the government, alleged Rai, claiming huge turnout of people in support of SP chief in the state has made BJP nervous and hence it is putting hurdles. SP Ghazipur district unit president Ramdhari Yadav said the expressway event has not been permitted but public meetings will be held at Pakhanpura, Varachavar, Kasimabad, Haiderganj and Harikarna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhileshs-attempt-to-hold-parallelshow-on-purvanchal-e-way-jolted/articleshow/87704535.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Agra||Kasganj custodial death: Cops gave Rs 5 lakh to keep quiet, says father||AGRA: In a twist to the Kasganj custodial death case, the father of deceased Mohammad Altaf has claimed that he was paid Rs 5 lakh cash by the policemen after coercing him to put his thumb impression on paper and telling him to keep quiet hours after his son was allegedly found hanging from a 3ft-high water pipe in the washroom of the police station lock-up on Tuesday afternoon. Chand Miyan claimed the policemen told him that the money was from the government, and asked him not to proceed with the matter. Miyan also claimed that he was provided the cash in bundles of Rs 500 notes in presence of senior officials of the police and the administration at the Goraha police outpost. Miyan on Sunday said the money is still with him. “I am ready to return it. All I want is justice for my son,” he said. The father said that, in the paper (which has now gone viral), it was written that his son was suffering from depression and committed suicide in the washroom of the lock-up at Kotawali Sadar police station. Miyan further claimed that his relatives were also warned not to speak about the matter to the media and ensure the body is buried peacefully. Altaf was buried amid heavy police presence on Wednesday. “Station house officer (SHO) Virendra Singh Indolia (now suspended), along with some some other policemen, a sub-divisional magistrate and a local activist was present at Goraha police outpost when the money was handed over to Altaf’s father,” said an uncle of Altaf. Kasganj superintendent of police (SP) Botre Rohan Pramod said, “Police did not give any cash to Altaf’s father. A request was made to the district magistrate (DM) to consider providing monetary assistance to the family,” said Pramod. When asked about the matter, DM Harshita Mathur said, “As of now, there is no declaration of monetary compensation for the deceased’s family. We have sent a proposal to the state government in this regard. We will also try to give a job to one of the family members of Altaf.” ADGP Rajeev Krishna said, “I have no knowledge about any such transaction. Even if the cash was handed over to cover-up the entire matter, it is irrelevant now. An FIR has been registered on a complaint by the deceased man’s father. The focus of the investigation is on custodial death. A magisterial and departmental probe is also being conducted.” In his complaint to the police on Saturday, Chand Miyan referred to the viral letter and said that he was "detained" at Goraha police outpost after his son’s death. “The policemen made one of my relatives write a letter, which was dictated by them. The cops forced me to put a thumb impression on a piece of paper, saying that if I do not do it, the body of my son would not be handed over to me and that I would not be allowed to leave the outpost. I had no idea what was written in that paper,” the complaint read. Meanwhile, Kasganj police recovered the 16-year-old Hindu girl who was allegedly kidnapped by Altaf and an “unknown friend”. She will be produced in court to record her statement on Monday, a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/kasganj-custodial-death-cops-gave-rs-5l-cash-to-keep-quiet-claims-father/articleshow/87703795.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Leopard cub reunited with mom on Children’s Day eve||MUMBAI: It was a happy reunion on the eve of Children’s Day for a rescued leopard cub. Three days after the black wild cat was rescued from an empty tank in Sindhudurg, it walked away with its mother who had been looking for it in a forested stretch at Kudal on Saturday. For two days, forest officials had waited for the mother to take it away. After its rescue on Thursday, the cub was kept in a cage. The cage was connected by wireless cameras and rescuers kept watch from a distance. The door had a long rope attached so it could be swung open if the mother leopard came near the cage. On Friday, a team had surveyed the stretch around the cage to look for signs of the mother’s presence, like pugmarks. “The mother leopard did come looking for the cub, but our Internet connection snapped at that time, we did not pull open the door as we could not watch what was happening at the spot,” said range forest officer Amrut Shinde. A team from an NGO in Pune, ResQ, had also moved in to assist in the reunion, said Shahaji Narnavar, deputy conservator of forests. The cub had been rescued from the empty tank atop a hill at Goveri village. The spot from which the cub had been rescued is nestled on a forested area on a hilltop with a good prey base. “It’s perfect for survival of wildlife,” said Shinde. The leopard cub is referred to as ‘black panther’ due to the hue of its hide. It has excess of melanin pigment which determines the colour of the hide. A rare find, these wild cats have been spotted in Maharashtra, Goa and at Kabini National Park in Karnataka, said forest officials. On Saturday evening, around 8.30, the mother returned to look for her cub. “We could hear her loud roars,” said Shinde. Stationed about 500 metres away, the team watched the mother inch close to the cage and pulled the rope to open the door. The cub hopped out on all fours, its mother in tow, and both vamoosed into the thicket of green, said Shinde. It was a happy reunion, Shinde told TOI, adding, “Seeing the mother and her lost cub together again made us quite emotional.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-leopard-cub-reunited-with-mom-on-childrens-day-eve/articleshow/87705689.cms||Alex Fernandes
---||Hyderabad||Centre mum on pleas for powerloom cluster: KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: Industries minister KT Rama Rao has shot off a letter to Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goel pointing out the Centre’s indifference to repeated representations from Telangana government to sanction a mega powerloom cluster. This letter to Goel on Sunday is preceded by the ruling TRS’ state-wide protest against the Centre over paddy procurement issue on Friday. In the letter, KTR said the youth of Telangana are eagerly waiting for employment opportunities that will be created by projects like the mega powerloom cluster at Sircilla under the comprehensive powerloom cluster development scheme. KTR, who also represents Sircilla assembly constituency, had earlier written seven letters on different dates to the Union government for a mega powerloom cluster, but no action was taken, he said. Sircilla has been a major hub of handloom and textiles activity for several decades. The state government initiated several measures for gainful employment to the weaver community, he said. This town has the necessary ecosystem and trained manpower required to set up a mega powerloom cluster, KTR said. The minister sought to bring to the notice of the Union minister that the flagship initiatives, including 40% input subsidy linked wage compensation scheme, thrift fund to handloom and powerloom weavers, providing continuous work to powerloom workers, have resulted in revival of this industry with major increase in earnings and wages. Even the Union government had appreciated these initiatives on various occasions, he said. KTR highlighted that Telangana has been able to attract some marquee investments into the textiles sector. Also, the state government has earmarked additional budget for the handloom and textiles sector and has taken up world class projects like Kakatiya Mega Textile Park. “Over the past few years, we have been observing that the Union government is announcing schemes and assistance to states, which lack the necessary ecosystem or resources. All this at the expense of fast developing states like Telangana,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-mum-on-pleas-for-powerloom-cluster-ktr/articleshow/87705051.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Four killed as truck crashes into a wedding in Bhilwara||JAIPUR: Four persons were killed and three injured when a speeding truck ploughed through guests at a wedding function in Bhilwara on Sunday evening. Hanuman Nagar police station identified the victims as Neeraj, Kuldeep, Manoj and Rajendra. The driver sustained severe injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment. Police said a medical examination will ascertain if he was drunk. The incident took place at Kuradiya village in Jahazpur tehsil where the wedding functions of Shankar Lal Meena’s two daughters were about to start. Around 6pm, a truck coming from Deoli began to flounder before it careened off the road, crushing several people under its wheels. Police said the wedding celebrations were being held at a house next to the road. Locals told police that there were shocking cries for help as people were pulled out from under the wheels. Many wounded were covered in blood, screaming in pain and horror even as the truck’s engine continued to rumble. Several guests ran out of the house to check on the howls of cries and held the driver so that he could not flee from the scene. Once all the injured were taken to hospital, the incident draped the entire area in a veil of silence where celebrations were in full swing just a few moments ago. Local leaders and senior police officials came in droves to take stock of the situation. SHO Mohammad Imran told TOI that the driver was also ferried to the hospital along with other injured. Police said the bodies were being moved to a mortuary. “Injured were taken to hospital immediately after the accident, but four of them succumbed to their injuries,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/four-killed-as-truck-crashes-into-a-wedding-in-bhilwara/articleshow/87705073.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Illegal structures, garbage blocking Gangayaar’s flow||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Gangayaar canal which overflowed and caused flooding in houses, shops and fish landing centre at Vizhinjam in the heavy showers on Saturday is a sore reminder of unauthorised construction of structures and dumping of waste blocking the water flow. The officials with the minor irrigation department said that one of the main reasons for the overflow of the canal is the accumulation of sand at the portion where the canal flows close to the sea. There have been small bridges constructed unscientifically across the canal without obtaining any sanction from the authorities concerned. These bridges are located at a low level and without vertical clearance. Frequent dumping of waste in the canal causes the trash to get blocked within the structures, obstructing the flow of the canal. Absence of retaining wall on either side of the canal is also cited as a reason for flooding. The residents, street vendors and the fishermen have long been at the receiving end whenever the canal overflows during the rainy season. The fishermen who keep their expensive fishing equipment in the landing centre and locker room often end up losing their source of livelihood as the canal would flood all the buildings in the neighbouring areas. It was in 2020 that a sanction was given for the revamp of Gangayaar canal at a cost of Rs 89 lakhs. The tender was invited twice for this work and in the third tender there were two participants. The lowest quote was recorded at Rs 1.05 crores. The quoted amount was 32.74% higher than the estimate of Rs 79.46 lakhs. The water resources department had considered the request for tender excess and assessed that the higher amount quoted for the project was fair and the amount was approved in August 2021 as a special case on the condition that the government will not have any financial liability and that the chief engineer may scrutinize the measurements. As per the scheme, the desilting process will be carried out for a distance of 1 kilometre. A new bridge will also come across the canal. One of the unauthorised bridges was damaged in the heavy rains on Saturday. In order to prevent unauthorised dumping of waste, fencing shall be erected on both sides. A core wall will be constructed from the canal into the sea for a distance of 60 metres. This will be constructed in the same alignment of the canal and would be similar to that of breakwater. The officials said that work on the canal restoration will begin as soon as approval is received regarding the levels. On Saturday after the flood waters entered shops, houses, and landing centres damaging fishing equipment and means of livelihood of the fishermen, Mayor Arya Rajendran, deputy mayor P K Raju and welfare standing committee chairman H Salim visited the spot. Following it, officials of the minor irrigation department and corporation officials deployed earth movers to clean the canal and chunks of plastic waste were scooped up from the canal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/illegal-structures-garbage-blocking-gangayaars-flow/articleshow/87704544.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court acquits accused who fatally ran over dog with bike||Mumbai: In a rare trial conducted for offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, a magistrate court recently acquitted a 23-year-old Wadala man for running over and killing a female dog with his bike in 2018. The court said there is no evidence on record to prove that there was intention to kill the “bitch” to commit mischief. Acquitting Juber Shah, metropolitan magistrate JP Shirale said, “Prosecution is required to prove that accused intentionally killed bitch, which is not the case of prosecution itself. Prosecution comes before with case that accused drove motorcycle in a rash or negligent manner and not that accused had an intention to kill the bitch.” Three witnesses deposed during the trial. Shah was also acquitted for offences under the IPC relating to causing mischief by killing or maiming an animal. The court also acquitted him on charges of driving in rash or negligent manner as to endanger human life and personal safety of others. The complainant in the case, Veral Pandya, deposed that on January 13, 2018, at about 10pm, when he was standing on the road at Wadala, the accused drove his motorcycle in a rash and negligent manner and hit the canine. He said he took the dog to hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The court, however, said the investigator had not conducted the test identification parade, so identification merely by witness “cannot be accepted as trustworthy of credence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-acquits-accused-who-fatally-ran-over-dog-with-bike/articleshow/87705928.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad honorary wildlife warden: Diverse bird population sign of healthy biodiversity||Aurangabad: A diverse bird population is a good sign of healthy biodiversity, said Kishor Pathak, the honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad. “As different birds dwell on different trees and prefer other natural habitats, including water bodies, scrublands and greenlands, the varied and rich population of birds imply towards the presence of such habitats in an adequate manner. Such habitats as a whole form healthy biodiversity, which is good for human beings,” he said. Pathak, while addressing the valedictory event of the ‘Bird Week’ celebrations organised by the forest department here, stressed on the need to protect various habitats of birds. “It is a general notion among commoners that birds reside on large trees alone. While such a green cover is essential for birds, other habitats, including water bodies, marshy lands, bushes, creepers and climbers also serve as habitats for different birds,” he said. The rich population of birds is essential for humans. “Many birds feed on insects and pests that prove a menace to the agricultural sector. The birds, thus, act as natural insecticides and pesticides,” he said. During his presentation, the honorary wildlife warden also enlightened the audience about different local and migrant birds found in and around Aurangabad. The Bird Week celebrations, which saw nature trails and awareness seminars, was organised under the guidance of deputy conservator of forest Amit Mishra and assistant conservator of forest Rajendra Nale among other officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-honorary-wildlife-warden-diverse-bird-population-sign-of-healthy-biodiversity/articleshow/87703274.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hubballi||Bifurcation of milk union to cause milk shortage in Dharwad||Dharwad: The state cabinet’s decision to bifurcate Dharwad Milk Union (DMU) by creating a separate milk union for Haveri district will cause shortage of milk in Dharwad, Gadag and Uttara Kannada districts. DMU covers Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag and Uttara Kannada and a major part of the milk comes from Haveri. It is feared that separating Haveri from DMU and creating new Haveri Milk Union (HMU) will hit Dharwad badly. The process of bifurcation will begin now and HMU will be functional from December 2022. Already the work on setting up an Ultra High-Pressure Pasteurization (UHP) unit at a cost of Rs 99 crore has commenced in Haveri. DMU, established in 1984, has 12 directors with each district sending three directors. With the creation of new Haveri Milk Union, the number of directors in DMU will come down to nine while Haveri will have a new president, three directors and one managing director along with new office and staff. It is possible that additional staff from DMU will be shifted to Haveri Milk Union. DMU gets 2.75 lakh litres of milk every day from four districts and Haveri contributes 1.75 lakh litres. The daily sale of milk from DMU is one lakh litres of which about 10,000 litres is sold in Haveri district. When the new Haveri Milk Union becomes functional, DMU will face a shortage of milk to the extent of 1.75 lakh litres per day. Meanwhile, Haveri Milk Union will have to increase sales in Haveri district to remain economically feasible. DMU president Shankar Mugad said the idea of bifurcating DMU and creating HMU is not new and the work has already commenced. DMU will continue to get 1.75 lakh litres of milk everyday till the end of December 2022, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bifurcation-of-milk-union-to-cause-milk-shortage-in-dharwad/articleshow/87703805.cms||---

The officials said with elections a few months away, they have been unable to adopt a strict attitude towards defaulters. Against the capacity of slaughtering 50,000 birds in a day, around 1,000 to 1,200 birds are being taken to the slaughter house while 50 to 60 goats/sheep are coming against a capacity of 500 in a day. The municipal corporation (MC) has fixed Rs 10 for poultry, Rs 100 for pig and Rs 150 for goat/sheep as slaughtering charges, which are to be paid by the shopkeepers. The slaughter house located on Hambran Road was inaugurated in February after almost a delay of one year. It also included five model shops where people can buy meat slaughtered in a hygienic manner. Five air-conditioned vehicles were also provided to the firm for transportation of slaughtered meat from slaughter house to shops. The cost of this project was Rs 19.50 crore. An official, requesting anonymity, claimed that they had kicked off a drive against slaughtering in shops. During the drive, we discovered that some shops had kept 2-week old meat in the refrigerators. From one shop, at least one quintal of such meat was seized. He said there is a need to seal a few shops where gross violation is being reported. Additional commissioner Aaditya Dacchalwal said, “There is slight improvement as number of birds as well as goats being brought for slaughtering has increased. We will continue with the drive against the slaughtering in the open as well as shops.” He appealed to the public not to buy meat from shops unless it is slaughtered in a hygienic manner. According to National Green Tribune (NGT) guidelines, it is not allowed to throw animal waste in the sewerage system. At present, shopkeepers throw everything into the sewerage. The NGT had asked the MC to stop this practice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/illegal-slaughtering-still-rampant-as-modern-abattoir-yet-to-gain-popularity/articleshow/87703806.cms||---

The eco-friendly device is expected to convert the surplus fish coming in during an over catch into dried fish. Traditionally, fishermen dry the fish in the open under blazing Sun, but often such a method is vulnerable to dust and rains and attack from insects, pests and microorganisms therefore compromising on the quality. “The area where the solar-powered fish dryer is to be installed has been identified. Fishermen will be given permission to dry their fish over there following the installation of the device,” a fisheries officer said. The dryer runs on the power of the Sun generated through a solar panel to dry the fish. Using this method, fish are preserved by removing moisture from them, thereby arresting the growth of bacteria, action of enzymes and chemical oxidation of the fat. “The device also takes up lesser time to dry the fish, unlike the traditional method,” the fisheries officer said. Initially, the setup was planned at the fisheries sub-office at Colva. In August this year, the directorate notified that fishermen who, since 2015, have been paying a nominal lease amount of Rs 100 per year for using a 100sqm platform to dry fish at the government facility at Colva will now have to pay a whopping Rs 3,000.

The forest department has a plan to help citizens enjoy trekking, jungle safari. It is providing accommodation to let people spend a day in the wild. The Tiger Stay Package will allow one to explore the flora and fauna. There are chances of spotting tigers, leopards, Sambar, Spotted Deer, Wild Dogs, and other wild animals and rare birds during safari and trekking. Those going on safari will get to see the breathtaking view of the region from Farahabad view point. “The intention behind this package is to create awareness among the visitors for developing a sense of responsibility to protect nature and wildlife,” said Rohith Gopidi, forest divisional officer, Amrabad Division. He said that through the initiative, they also intend to generate local employment to prevent people from resorting to poaching and other forest damaging activities. Gopidi said that trekking, safari, and other activities will be conducted in areas having minimal disturbance to wildlife. “We are sure that this will turn into one of the go-to getaway destinations for Hyderabadis and others in Telangana. People of all ages will enjoy their stay here. It would be better if people do not come herewith a sole intention of spotting a tiger as we have a vast area under ATR and safari covers only a small part of it,” said Gopidi. During the trekking, which covers about 3.5 km to 4 km stretch, people will be able to spot various species of birds, get to learn about various plants. The trek will culminate at the Uma Maheshwaram temple, which is the northern gateway of Srisailam — one of the jyotirlings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amrabad-tiger-reserve-to-host-trekking-safari/articleshow/87705067.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Delhi||Gopal Rai: Curbs aimed at bringing down dust, vehicular pollution||NEW DELHI: After chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced certain restrictions to curb pollution, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the environment department has issued orders on Sunday regarding closure of schools, stopping construction activities and work from home for government employees under the Environment Protection Act of 1986. “The severity of pollution was quite high on Saturday, compared with which Sunday seems a bit of a relief. However, it has been estimated that the pollution levels are only going to escalate in the coming days. Keeping this in mind, the Delhi government has decided that all schools, colleges, coaching institutes, skill development and training institutes and libraries will remain shut till November 20. The only exception will be made for institutions already in the process of conducting examinations. Secondly, all construction projects and demolitions taking place in Delhi will be halted till November 17, be it at any scale — small or large construction sites. Thirdly, all offices, corporations and autonomous agencies under the Delhi government will remain shut till November 17 and all officers will be expected to work from home for the week,” said Rai. He added that the purpose of shutting offices and such non-emergency institutions is to cut down on vehicular pollution. An advisory has been issued to private offices to follow suit and help this initiative have an effective impact on pollution levels.

The 32-year-old woman had taken the auto from Bisalpur town to Pilibhit city on Friday night. There was only one “co-passenger” in the shared auto. As the auto entered the state highway, she realized that the other “passenger” was the driver’s helper and both men were drunk. As the vehicle sped on the highway, the helper seated next to her allegedly started misbehaving with her. Her protests turned to screams as the auto driver accelerated the speed. At that time, constable Sachin Kumar Tyagi and home guard Suresh Pal, who were on patrolling duty on their bike, happened to pass by the auto in the opposite direction. They heard the woman screaming for help. They immediately turned their bike around, chased the auto and rescued the woman. Both men were arrested and handed over to police. Later, Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit superintendent of police, felicitated both constable and home guard and announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 for their good work. Police have registered an FIR under IPC sections 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman), 376D (gang rape) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against auto driver Rajat Kumar and his helper, Shivam Chaudhary.  SP Dinesh Kumar told TOI, “The woman was rescued by constable Sachin Tyagi and home guard Suresh Pal. The department has decided to reward them for displaying courage in saving the woman’s honour and rescuing her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/cop-home-guard-save-woman-from-being-raped-in-moving-auto-driver-aide-nabbed/articleshow/87703819.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||Four-year-old not competent witness in abuse case: Bombay high court||MUMBAI: Quashing a 2019 conviction under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), the Bombay high court said the sessions court had given “undue importance to a stray statement’’ of a four-year-old without ascertaining first whether the child could be a competent witness. Mumbai sessions court had convicted the accused to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in 2019. He was one of two accused in the case. The co-accused had been acquitted by the trial court. The HC said, “A child is a competent witness provided he is capable of understanding the questions put to him and is able to give rational answers.’’ But in this case, the child was barely four years old and of a tender age, and “it was obligatory” on the judge to ascertain first whether the child can depose as a competent witness, which the trial judge had not done, the high court added. The prosecution’s case was that the accused, who was hired to paint a room, had made the child sit on his lap. It was alleged that at 9.30pm, he then touched her private part and that the other man had slapped her. The man had been convicted under section 10 of Pocso for aggravated sexual assault, where minimum punishment is five years’ RI. Both the accused had pleaded not guilty. The child, who did not have the cognitive skills to recollect and narrate an alleged sexual abuse by a painter-workman, had later in her cross-examination by the defence lawyer also said she was deposing as told by her mother, observed Justice Anuja Prabhudessai while acquitting the man in the 2017 case. The prosecution’s case was based mainly on the child’s testimony. “Conviction can be based on the sole testimony of a child witness provided the witness is competent to depose to the facts and is a reliable witness,’’ said the HC. Observing that the trial court had “failed to evaluate competency’’ of the child as a witness, the HC scrutinised her evidence to ascertain whether her deposition can be relied on. The HC judgment noted that the child “was not trying to conceal the truth’’ and the tenor of her answers during trial indicate she lacked the intellectual capacity and maturity to understand the nature of questions and to give rational answers, hence she “cannot be considered to be a competent witness.’’ Besides, there is no confirmation of the identification of the accused, the HC noted, as the date of painting work was a day after the alleged crime, said the room owner. The HC held that the trial court had “grossly erred’’ in delivering its guilty verdict. The man was on bail during the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-year-old-not-competent-witness-in-abuse-case-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87705691.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra inoculation count drops to 3-month low in last 2 weeks||PUNE: Maharashtra’s vaccination count in the last two weeks dropped to a three-month low (since mid-August), CoWIN portal data showed. Only 13.88 lakh jabs were administered during October 30-November 5 period, followed by 27.20 lakh during November 6-12 — both figures being the lowest in the last 11 weeks. Festivities ending pushed up daily vaccination in the last week, but the numbers have been lower than the weekly jabs administered during the August-September period, the data showed. State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai, however, told TOI that the daily average has been over 5 lakh shots during the last two-three days, which is set to increase further from Monday. “Next week is likely to see higher daily vaccination targets, with an aim to go up to 10 lakh doses administered every day through the Har Ghar Dastak programme,” he said. Another state health department official said nearly 75 lakh beneficiaries were due for the second dose. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the number of sessions conducted by private hospitals has dropped further. “One concern is the number of private hospitals conducting daily vaccination sessions falling significantly. This number was 210 at one point in time in Pune district, which has come down to an average of 150. Though these hospitals are still part of the drive, the daily session count by private hospitals has reduced,” he said. Dr Deshmukh said footfall for vaccination in the district has remained low despite festivities ending. A PMC official said with less than 10 beneficiaries turning up at private sites at any point in time, they do not create sessions on some days. If the vial contains doses for 10 people and only four turn up, six doses can go waste. Another PMC official said the civic body received higher number of doses in August-September from the district authorities and nearly 10-12 lakh first doses were administered in the PMC limits during that period. “The due date for second doses of all these beneficiaries will come by November-end-December, which would increase daily vaccinations considerably in the coming period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-inoculation-count-drops-to-3-month-low-in-last-2-weeks/articleshow/87704607.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Two supporting MSRTC bus strike attempt immolation near Maharashtra secretariat||MUMBAI: Two men supporting the MSRTC strike tried to immolate themselves in front of the state secretariat on Sunday. Another suicide attempt by a bus corporation employee was reported in Palghar. The strike entered its 18th day as the deadlock continued and talks failed, while Bombay high court will hear a contempt petition filed against striking workers on Monday. Few days back, transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab had said some workers want to return to work. Since he promised police protection, till Sunday, nearly 4,000 workers resumed duties, while 88,000 continued with the strike. With 195 drivers and 77 conductors back at work, MSRTC operated 79 buses on 60 routes on Sunday and ferried 1,746 passengers across Maharashtra. This included 500 passengers by Shivneri AC buses (Mumbai-Pune). In the immolation bid case, two have been booked for abetment to suicide under IPC, and Marine Drive police detained them along with four women who protested on the road. A senior police officer said two men from the group tried to immolate themselves by pouring kerosene while four women sat on the road around 11am. Officials caught hold of the two. Agency reports stated that on Saturday evening, a driver from Jawhar depot in Palghar allegedly consumed poison at home, a police official said. His family took him to Jawhar sub-hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. Senior officials said commuters were happy that 3,987 workers were back at work. Many passengers complained that private buses and other vehicles were “overcharging”. “We expect more workers on Monday and we will operate more than 100 routes if all goes well,” said a top official. Parab assured workers government was looking into salaries being brought on par with state government employees. A committee has been formed to look into key demands of workers who want merger of MSRTC with state government. The panel will decide within few weeks, sources said. MSRTC union leader Shashank Rao said, “They have issued suspension orders to over 2,000 workers. We have informed these workers that the union will stand with them in their fight. We will also fight a legal battle, if need be.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-supporting-msrtc-bus-strike-attempt-immolation/articleshow/87705948.cms||Somit Sen

Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia and municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi flagged off eight anti-smog sprinklers, 40 tractor-mounted water sprinklers and eight mechanical sweeping machines from the 1090 Crossing. These machines will sprinkle water to clear air and settle the dust on the roads, besides cleaning the streets in a mechanised manner. LMC staff will also be deployed to make people aware about measures to be taken to improve air quality. TOI had highlighted earlier that LMC has only eight trucks for sprinkling water on roads and five for antismog spray. These vehicles cover around 80-85 km of road networks daily. However, LMC has 236 km of road network in the city, of which a large number are in bad shape and hence the measures taken by the civic body are proving to be insufficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-launches-special-drive-to-improve-citys-air-quality/articleshow/87705076.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

---||Lucknow||Construction sites flout NGT norms||Lucknow: A day after Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) imposed monetary penalty on seven private contractors in the city for violating National Green Tribunal (NGT) norms regarding construction work, TOI in its reality check found rules being violated in several areas. As per the NGT norms, the construction sites must control dispersion of dust into the atmosphere by covering the sites with green nets and sprinkling of water. The measures are important because the huge amount of dust raised from construction sites combines with the mist/fog in the winters to form smog, which in return deteriorates air quality, causing several health issues among people. The district administration had also issued strict instructions to all civic and development agencies on Friday for implementation of NGT guidelines. However, TOI found norms being ignored at several private construction sites in many areas, including Rajajipuram, Alambagh, Jankipuram Extension, Gomtinagar Extension, Indiranagar, Niralanagar, Raebareli Road, IIM Chauraha, Aashiana and LDA Colony. Abhishek Gupta, a resident of Rajajipuram, said, "My grandmother, who is already suffering from asthma, gets really troubled due to the under-construction house in my locality especially during these winter times when fog and smog makes breathing difficult." People also complained that the construction debris piled up on the roads also became a cause of accidents and traffic jams. “I was returning home from the college on a two-wheeler with my brother when we lost balance and got injured due to the sand and stones left unattended by workers of a construction site near my house,” said Deepika Joshi, a resident of Nirala Nagar. Not only some private developers, construction norms were also not being followed at the construction work of a flyover on Rae Bareli Road. The local contractor at the site refused to comment when TOI asked about the reason. Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said that teams under command of executive engineers have been deployed in all eight zones of the city to impose monetary penalties on developers violating NGT norms at construction sites.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to discuss fuel VAT cut in cabinet meeting on Tuesday||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said the government would convene a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to take a call on reducing Value Added Tax (VAT) on fuel among other things. The state government is under intense pressure from the opposition to cut VAT on fuel following reduction in excise duty by the Centre recently. “I have written to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to further reduce excise duty on fuel to stop the competition over prices of petrol and diesel among states. The issue will be discussed in the cabinet and whatever is possible will be done. Every state has reduced the VAT differently, which has created a big difference in the price of fuels,” said Gehlot. He accused the Centre of increasing the fuel price by almost Rs 25 to Rs 30 and then slashing it by Rs 15-20. Explaining the fuel mathematics and its implications, he said states are already experiencing a slash in their revenues due to the Centre’s move to reduce excise duty. “The reduction in excise duty by the Centre will lead to a revenue loss of around Rs 1,800 crore,” said Gehlot. He slammed the Union government for disrupting the principle of cooperative federalism by challenging and changing the share of states in centrally sponsored schemes. “Earlier, the share used to be 80:20 between the Centre and the state. Now it has become 50:50 and puts additional burden on the states to carry out development works,” said Gehlot, who argued that the Centre should understand that states have limited sources to generate revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-to-discuss-fuel-vat-cut-in-cabinet-meeting-tomorrow/articleshow/87705090.cms||---

The deceased infant was allegedly thrown in the river by her mother Sahin Shaikh (39) on Friday after she fought with her husband. However,the woman later fabricated the story of her daughter’s kidnapping and lodged a fake complaint in Sachin GIDC police station on Saturday. During questioning, the woman kept changing her statements multiple times before confessing to the cops that she had flung the girl child into the river from Hope Bridge. The woman told the police that she was upset due to the disputes with husband Haroon and was upset with her own parents who refused to help her in settle the disputes with her husband. “Body of the child was found from under Jilani Bridge on Sunday. After completing a few formalities, an offence will be registered. Police will take further action once the complaint is registered,” said a police officer in Rander police station. Accused, who had separated from her first husband around a year ago going against her parent’s wishes, started living with Haroon, an autorickshaw driver, in Unn Nagar area. Meanwhile, she gave birth to the baby girl recently. The couple had developed differences in the past few weeks and would fight over petty issues. “On Friday, Shaikh went to her parental home to complain against Haroon, but her parents refused to support her. Angry at not being supported, the woman then went to the bridge and flung the infant in the river,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/upset-mother-throws-18-day-old-infant-girl-in-river/articleshow/87704156.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kochi: Despite closure order, abattoir functions sans basic facilities||KOCHI: Despite the Kochi corporation issuing orders to the contractor who manages the slaughterhouse owned by the local body at Kaloor to close down the facility in five days from October 29, the slaughterhouse is still functioning. The pollution control board (PCB) had issued closure notice to the corporation in August as the slaughterhouse doesn’t comply with hygiene norms. But, then the corporation authorities didn’t take strong action. TOI had carried a series of articles regarding the pathetic condition of the slaughterhouse and the PCB issuing closure notice. It is following the demand by Anticorruption People’s Movement, an NGO, that the corporation issued closure notice to the contractor on October 29, 2021. “We are planning to take legal recourse as the corporation and PCB continue to fail in ensuring the closure of the slaughterhouse,” said Anticorruption People’s Movement general secretary N S Unnithan. “In fact, the PCB also has powers to close down the slaughterhouse on its own. But the PCB authorities are not exercising the powers rested with them,” Unnithan said. The PCB had conducted several inspections prior to October 2020. Then, it was found that the slaughterhouse lacks the bare minimum hygiene facilities. Though the PCB officials gave instructions to put in place proper facilities, the corporation authorities didn’t act. In October 2020, the PCB officials again conducted an inspection at the slaughterhouse. The slaughterhouse has been functioning without an effluent treatment plant for the past several years. Blood from the slaughter house is being drained out to Thevara-Perandoor canal. Moreover, the animals are being culled in an unscientific manner. The PCB asked the corporation to take corrective measures immediately. The corporation authorities informed the PCB that they would set up an effluent treatment plant by March 2021. In July 2021, the PCB again conducted an inspection only to see that the corporation authorities had done no rectification measures.  A few years ago, Kochi corporation authorities mooted a project for the renovation of the slaughterhouse. The project will be funded by the KIIFB scheme. But the corporation authorities couldn’t even float tenders for the project so far. “For starting the work, the vendors in the slaughterhouse should be rehabilitated. But they are not ready to move out. Though we offered them temporary rehabilitation, they moved the court challenging our decision,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf. He said that measures had already been taken for shifting the abattoir to the nearby GCDA market temporarily. Kochi corporation had entrusted a private firm to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the renovation of the plant. The firm has completed the work on the DPR. Effluent treatment plant, which is one of the major components of the renovation project, will comprise an anaerobic plant plus an aerobic plant. First, the effluent would pass through the anaerobic plant for initial treatment. Later, it would be treated at the aerobic plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-closure-order-abattoir-functions-sans-basic-facilities/articleshow/87704563.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation to raze illegal building extensions||KOLKATA: The KMC top brass has instructed buildings department executive engineers to demolish unauthorised constructions in buildings within five days of a notice being issued to the owners. The officials have also been warned against inaction. The circular to executive engineers specifies the power they are bestowed with to serve notice and subsequently demolish illegal structures made by owners and developers. A civic buildings department official conceded that unscrupulous promoters had taken advantage of the festive season, when vigilance was slack due to manpower issues, to add unsanctioned floors in under-construction buildings. Some localities that have witnessed a sudden spurt in such deviations from sanctioned plans or construction of illegal buildings are Burrabazar, Belgachhia, Bidhan Sarani, Entally, Bhowanipore, Tangra, Park Circus, Topsia, Kidderpore, Garden Reach, Metiabruz, Tollygunge, Behala, Garia, Jadavpur-Baghajatin belt and large areas located off EM Bypass, including Mukundapur, Nayabad, Madurdaha, Patuli and Kasba. A buildings department official said executive engineers were asked to coordinate with local cops and keep a watch on under-construction buildings. “We have asked executive engineers to also rope in assistant and sub-assistant engineers to keep a vigil. For anything suspicious, they should check buildings department records and alert us. We will take action through the engineers,” the official said. Sources said stop-work notices were being sent for illegal structures. “We have alerted assistant engineers about several illegal buildings. We are sending notices to the owners. If they don’t take action, we, with the help of cops, will demolish the illegal parts,” said a borough executive engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-raze-illegal-building-extensions/articleshow/87704560.cms||Saikat Ray

She was found with injuries on her private parts. Her family alleges she was abducted, gang-raped and then killed. Her father, a sanitation worker, identified the body. Her bicycle, school bag, four bottles of beer, and wrappers of snacks were found on the spot. The family had filed a complaint after the girl went missing, based on which cops registered an FIR under sections 363 (abduction), 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) of the IPC, along with relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2013 at the local police station against unidentified persons. Locals said that the girl, a class XII student, was bright and wanted to secure a government job after completing her education. She used to attend two-hour coaching classes after school and would return home around 5 pm. When the girl did not come back on Saturday evening, her father started searching for her. The coaching centre informed him that she had not come to class that day either. He then approached the police at around 7 pm and lodged a complaint, suspecting that she was abducted by a local boy who was seen following the girl in the past. Cops picked up the boy from his home and took him to the station for questioning. However, he claimed he was not aware of the whereabouts of the girl. Thereafter, police launched a search along with the family and recovered her blood-stained body from a cane field nearly 500 metres away from the village, at around 1 am. A piece of her suit was stuck to her mouth and she was apparently strangled to death using her dupatta. There were injuries on her face, possibly caused by sharp sugarcane leaves, which seemed to indicate the hours of struggle that she put up while she was confined. Pilibhit's superintendent of police, Dinesh Kumar, told TOI, “Soon after recovering the body, we had secured the crime scene and forensic experts were called to gather evidence. The girl had injuries on her face, neck, and below the abdomen. We have included the section of rape in the FIR based on the complaint of the family. However, the autopsy will verify the allegations of sexual assault. Four teams are working on the case, and a few suspects have been detained. A breakthrough is likely soon.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/schoolgirl-16-abducted-gang-raped-murdered-in-pilibhit-blood-stained-body-found-in-cane-field/articleshow/87703837.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Police commissioner A Satish Ganesh, on Sunday, said the report on Osama Shahidwith details about how he was involved with the solvers’ gang and was instrumental in ensuring that ineligible candidates become doctors, has been sent to the KGMU vice-chancellor with a recommendation to impose lifetime ban on Osama’s studies in the institution. Osama was arrested on September 14 after his connections with the Patna-based inter-state solvers’ gang came to light during investigation after the gang was busted with the arrest of Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under Sarnath police station. Police said that Osama, a native of Mau district, who had appeared in MBBS final year exam at KGMU this year, used to look for aspirants on behalf of his gang. The gang used to take contract of arranging impersonators to appear in the entrance exam. The officials said the gang used to charge Rs 30 lakh to Rs 40 lakh from each aspirant. Apart from Osama, police had also arrested Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad in Bihar. Although the kingpin of the gang Pravik Kumar alias PK alias Neelesh is still absconding. With the progress in investigation, police found that 25 aspirants were in touch with the gang. Of them 16 had appeared in NEET at different centres while nine had skipped. As many things were found fishy in the cases of these 25 aspirants, the National Testing Agency (NTA) director’s cooperation was sought in investigation. Later, NTA withheld the results of 15 aspirants while Biswas was banned for 2 years from appearing in the exam. Police have summoned these 16 aspirants to appear before the investigation officer of this case by Monday. The CP said that if the summoned aspirants fail to appear before the investigation officer (IO) by Monday, the police will initiate further legal process through court against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cops-urge-kgmu-vc-to-impose-lifetime-ban-on-arrested-student/articleshow/87704566.cms||---

The crime is said to have taken place around two months ago in a village in the Moradabad area, but the woman informed police on Saturday as the video of the act which the accused had filmed was posted online. She told police she had kept quiet all this while as the perpetrators threatened to make the clip viral on social media if she told anyone about the crime. An FIR has been registered against eight people under various IPC sections, including 376-D (gang-rape). Police are investigating the crime, said the SHO of the police station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls. In her complaint to police, the woman alleged that a man named Javed from her village had forced her to sit on his two-wheeler when she had gone to the market for some work. He then took her to a deserted place, where his friends joined him. The woman alleged that they took turns to rape her while the others filmed the act. She further claimed that the men began to contact her, asking her to “meet them” at various places. However, she refused. Angry at her refusal, they uploaded the video online and thereafter approached the police. The SHO told TOI that an FIR has been registered against Javed and seven others. Police are also probing if it is a case of a love affair gone awry, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-22-accuses-8-of-gang-rape-fir-lodged/articleshow/87703851.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kolkata||West Bengal’s 1st free IVF unit to come up at SSKM||KOLKATA: Forty-three years after Subhas Mukhopadhay created India’s first and world’s second test tube baby in a government hospital, Bengal and the eastern region are now set to get the first state-run Centre of Excellence in Reproductive Medicine. Treatment at the unit on the SSKM Hospital campus will be free. The centre will also be home for advanced research. An e-tender that was finalized last week and the Ghosh Dastidar Institute of Fertility Research (GDIFR), run by former Trinamool minister and infertility expert, Sudarshan Ghosh Dastidar, was chosen to be the knowledge partner for Bengal’s first government-run health care unit offering infertility treatment. The in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic and research centre will come up in the hospital’s OPD block. Fertility expert Gautam Khastgir said, “It’s the best gift for the father of assisted reproductive therapy (ART) on his 90th birth anniversary (celebrated on 1 October). Dr Mukhopadhay had to conduct his experiments quietly inside the NRS Hospital lab because his research had no state support.” The SSKM Hospital’s director Monimoy Bandopadhyay told TOI, “I don’t think there’s any other government-run facility in India like this one. Hospitals like AIIMS provide subsidized treatment, but our centre will take care of everything — from the IVF treatment to the baby’s birth. IVF treatment is inordinately expensive. Several couples from the weaker sections continue to suffer the pangs of childlessness because they cannot afford costly procedures.” IVF is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and a sperm in a laboratory dish and then transferring the embryo to the uterus. The SSKM director said the centre would take six months for full-fledged operations. “We hope to start the OPD in December. GDIFR will provide primary training to doctors, nurses and other medical personnel so the centre becomes independent within three years,” he said. The government will pay GDIFR Rs 2.35crore for three years to “operate, maintain and manage” the IVF centre. Ghosh Dastidar said, “This is chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s pet project. We have started training the first team of medicos and technicians. It will be developed as a centre of advanced research as well.” The OPD, starting in December, will help in screening the couples who require IVF. The cost of a single cycle of IVF varies between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh at various private fertility clinics in the city. Since the success rate of live births is only 30% to 40%, more cycles are needed. “Cost is the main reason why many people cannot afford IVF. If one can afford six cycles of IVF, the success rate will go up to 80% or 90%. But the cost also goes up to Rs 4 lakh. Now, more people will be able to get IVF treatment,” Khastgir said. According to estimates, a little less than 10% of all married couples suffer from infertility. While most of them get results through medicines or artificial insemination of sperm into the uterus, about 5% of such couples need IVF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-1st-free-ivf-unit-to-come-up-at-sskm/articleshow/87704578.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The duo, one from Odisha's Jharsuguda and the other a resident of Rohini in west Delhi, couldn't produce identity cards showing their affiliation to any bona fide media organisation, Tripura police said after taking custody of the women from their Assam counterparts. Sammriddhi K Sakunia (21) and Swarna Jha (24), who stayed in a hotel in violence-hit North Tripura's Dharmanagar, had been asked to get their statements recorded in Agartala in connection with a case lodged against them at Kakraban police station in Gomati district under sections 153A (promoting religious enmity) and 120(B) (party to criminal conspiracy) under the IPC. Citing hotel records, the police said the two women had mentioned their occupation as “students” while checking in and mentioned “work” as the purpose of their visit. “This triggered suspicion and we started an investigation after registering a fresh case under various sections of the IPC,” an official said. The women, travelling by taxi, had allegedly taken a detour from Kumarghat on Sunday to enter south Assam instead of proceeding to Agartala. They crossed the inter-state border at Churaibari to avoid detection, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/2-women-journalists-on-tripura-beat-detained-in-assam/articleshow/87705937.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Arunkumar, a daily wage labourer, residing at Olathanni under Neyyattinkara police station limits, is the deceased. The police have taken his 60-year-old father Sasidharan, into custody in connection with the incident. The police said that the alleged crime took place on Saturday night around 9.30 pm. The father and son reportedly consumed alcohol together at home and then broke into a quarrel which soon snowballed into a brawl. In the melee, Sasidharan grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Arunkumar on his chest. Neyyattinkara station house officer inspector V N Sagar said that the neighbours have told the police that drunken quarrels were regular between the father and son. “According to the neighbours, Arunkumar was more aggressive recently and started physically harassing his father. These repeated physical harassment may have acted as catalyst for the rage that led Sasidharan to commit the offence,” the inspector said. Sasidharan was working as a supplier at a restaurant near Neyyattinkara. His wife Santha was at home when the alleged crime took place. Arunkumar was a bachelor. His body was shifted to the mortuary on Sunday after inquest procedure. The post mortem examination will be conducted on Monday. Just over a week ago, a father was killed by his son during a similar drunken brawl at their home at Vellayani under Nemom police station limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/drunken-brawl-father-kills-son/articleshow/87704588.cms||---

A large group of children belonging to different age groups associated with NGO ‘Udaan’ that works for the welfare of youngsters with type-1 diabetes, were a part of the morning trek at Hanuman Tekadi. After the trekking expedition, a formal awareness programme was held at the foothill by ‘Udaan’ office-bearers and volunteers along with the health authorities. Speaking on the occasion, Tope said, the state government is committed to providing all possible healthcare to children with type-1 diabetes. “There is a need for creating more public awareness about diabetes, especially type-1 diabetes. The state government has set up blood-sugar monitoring facilities even at the government health sub-centres, among other services for the benefit of the patients,” he said. Tope also showered praises upon ‘Udaan’ founder Dr Archana Sarda, who has received the diabetologist award, 2021 from the Research and Study Society for Diabetes in India. “True to its name, ‘Udaan’ has infused new confidence in children with type-1 diabetes and helped them lead a normal life. Dr Sarda and her team have given wings to the dreams of scores of children,” Tope added. An awareness rally involving people from different walks of life was also organized at the end of the event, which saw the participation of volunteers with posters and banners. Type-1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, leading to a dependency on insulin from an early age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tope-treks-with-type-1-diabetic-children/articleshow/87703328.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Documentary presents work of students during lockdown||KOCHI: As part of the Children’s Day celebrations, Ernakulam Vidyarangam Kalasahityavedi launched a documentary that presents various crafty activities undertaken by school students. The one-hour documentary named ‘Mikavukal’ presents the videos of students making various items like LED bulbs, hand-sanitizers, origami models, bottle-arts, clay models, soaps, automobile models and even the miniature model of an aircraft carrier, etc., while they were confined to their houses during the pandemic-induced second lockdown. The students made the crafts using the materials available at their house and directions were given to promote reuse and recycle of non-degradable materials. The activities were given to them to keep them engaged during the lockdown and nurture their crafty skills. Though students of all schools in the 14 sub-districts in Ernakulam took part in the activity, the videos of only 26 selected students were added to the documentary after screening. Simla Kasim, the coordinator of Vidyarangam Kalasahityavedi in Ernakulam, is the director of the documentary. She said that the aim was not only to nurture the craft skills in children but also make them spread their knowledge to peers through the video. So in each video, the student has to explain how he/she made that particular craft. For example, Jilto George, a Class VIII student of St Little Theresa’s High School, Vazhakulam, who made the aircraft carrier model, which he named INS Vishal, explains how he designed and made it. The ship model is seen floating in the water perfectly. He also talks about the purpose of aircraft carriers in war and peace times and explains the functions of control tower, radar and runways. “Some students have made handicraft items using coconut shells, and used clothes for embroidery. Some used old papers to make the crafts and models. The lockdown time was challenging and boring for all students and we wanted them to be engaged. The documentary is being shared across various platforms,” Kasim said. LSGD minister M V Govindan, health minister Veena George, screenwriter John Paul, writer Benyamin and magician Gopinath Muthukad were among the ones who congratulated the students and the Kalasahityavedi for the initiative. The technical support for the documentary was given by Sathi K Thankappan, Eldhose P V, Prathapan M N, and C Reji Paul, who are members of the Kalasahityavedi. The editing was done by R Harikrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/documentary-presents-work-of-students-during-lockdown/articleshow/87704592.cms||---

According to the petitioners, a policeman hit the dog — a pug — and soon after it died. Police however denied the allegation and claimed that they went their looking for one Justin, 29, an accused in over 15 cases, including a murder case. Justin was arrested by Nedumassery police on Friday evening for alleged attempted extortion and threatening. Jijo Thankachan of Chengamanad, who owns the dog, admitted that his brother Justin was indeed in conflict with the law but alleged that this was no reason for the policemen to attack his dog. “Three policemen, including the Chengamanad circle inspector, came to our house on Saturday evening. My mother was alone at the house. She was looking at two of the policemen outside the house, through the window when another policeman entered through the backdoor. Our pet, Pixy, had walked towards the backdoor by then. My mother soon heard the noise of her getting hit and by the time she reached the backdoor the dog had fallen. My mother confronted the officer, but he rushed to his jeep without answering her,” said Thankachan, adding that the police threatened his mother when she questioned them outside the house. However, the police claimed that the policemen did not hit the dog. “We went there to serve a summons to Justin in a case. This seems to be an allegation to trap us. There have been incidents in the past as well where dogs were unleashed when policemen go looking for culprits. We have nothing to do with the death of the dog. If they have a complaint let an investigation take place,” said an officer with Chengamanad police. Thankachan said that he was planning to approach the district police chief with a complaint. He added that the policemen at the station informally admitted their fault to him but did not register a case. The family has even kept the carcass of the dog in their refrigerator seeking an inquiry. Meanwhile, animal rights activist Sachithra Soman said that she visited the house. “It is true that the dog died, and they have kept the body in the refrigerator to ensure that an autopsy takes place. They say that the policeman hit the dog causing the death. There were two dogs at the house, the seven-year-old Pixy which died and a two-year-old puppy, Paulo. Both are pugs and Paulo seemed to be a very loving pet,” said Soman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pet-dog-dies-after-being-hit-by-policeman-says-owner/articleshow/87704584.cms||---
---||Jaipur||270 species of winged guests arrive in Jaisalmer||JAISALMER: With the temperature dipping gradually, more than 270 species of migratory birds, including falcons, cranes, and vultures along with endangered ones such as common rock thrushes and sociable lapwings, from across the globe have started visiting the Desert National Park and the nearby areas. Wildlife experts and bird watchers have attributed the phenomenon to the good rains in the arid regions this year which contributed to the greenery. They said several rare species from colder countries like Kazakhstan and Russia are visiting for the first time this year and they were excited to study them. The sociable lapwing, which is on the verge of extinction covered around 12,000 km from Kazakhstan to reach Jaisalmer. A duck, that is usually found in Himalayan areas has been spotted in Lathi, Dholi, and Khetolai areas of Jaisalmer. Thousands of kurja birds have come to Ramdeora and Khetolai areas. Wildlife specialist Dr Divesh Saini said, "Common rock thrushes or rufous-tailed rock thrushes breed in open, dry and hilly areas, usually above 1,500 m above the sea level. They build cup nests in rock cavities and lay 4 to 5 eggs per clutch." "They are omnivorous and consume insects, berries, and small reptiles. Common rock thrushes are generally shy and quiet, but they may make short squeaky whistles. The males produce an enchanting soft and melodic song," he said. Environment enthusiast and bird watcher, Radheyshyam Pemani, said, "The sociable lapwing is rare and critically endangered as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This species breeds in Kazakhstan and Russia, and reaches India in winter." He said this attractive medium-sized lapwing has longish black legs and a short black bill. Summer adults have grey backs and breasts with dark bellies and white undertails, he said. "The head has a striking pattern with a black crown and eye-stripe, the latter being bordered above and below with white. The upper neck is ochre. Its longish black legs, white tail with a black terminal band, and distinctive brown, white and grey wings make it almost unmistakable in flight. The call is a harsh ‘kereck’. Winter adults have a less distinct head pattern, slightly browner back and breast, and a white belly," he said. He said the sociable lapwing ( Vanellus gregarius) is critically endangered due to rapid decline in the population and habitat loss. He said "This species breeds on open grasslands in Russia and Kazakhstan. These birds migrate south to wintering sites, including India. It feeds similarly, picking insects in grassland." Meanwhile, 124th birth anniversary of Dr Salim Ali, Birdman of India, was celebrated as The National Bird Day on 12th Friday at the park. Bird watchers and nature enthusiasts from Jaisalmer had planned a bird survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/voyaging-12000km-from-kazakhstan-winged-guests-reach-jaisalmer/articleshow/87705127.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Man on trial for murdering father-in-law||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The trial of a man who allegedly committed the murder of his father-in-law in 2017 at Vithura will commence before the Additional Sessions Court VI here on Monday. Ragesh alias Vinod, 35, of Kaduvachira near Chullimanoor is the one who will stand on trial before judge K N Ajith Kumar. The prosecution case against the accused is that he murdered his father-in-law, Sundaresan, 60, of Chennanpara near Vithura on November 18, 2017, by stabbing him using a pair of scissors. The murder was committed when the victim intervened to save his daughter from assaulted by the accused. Public prosecutor M Salahudeen will represent the prosecution during the trial. According to the prosecution, Ragesh was married to Sundaresan’s daughter Priya and he used to live with his in-laws. Ragesh used to physically abuse Priya often and this had caused frequent quarrels between him and Sundaresan. On the day of the crime, the accused assaulted Priya for the delay in serving lunch. At this point, Sundaresan intervened and confronted Ragesh. This soon made way for a brawl. In the melee, Ragesh grabbed a pair of scissors from the almirah and stabbed Sundaresan on his neck. Though neighbours rushed to the house and took Sundaresan to hospital, the doctors could not save his life. The accused soon fled from the house and was caught three days later by the police. The crime happened in front of Sundaresan’s wife Vasantha, son Pradeep and daughter Priya. Pradeep died a year ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-on-trial-for-murdering-father-in-law/articleshow/87704590.cms||---

RG founder Manoj Parab made the announcement at an event at Azad Maidan in the state capital and stated that the party will field candidates in every constituency. “Revolutionary Goans will contest election on Goa Su-Raj party name. This is not a seat-sharing adjustment or tie-up of any compromise or setting. Here we, Revolutionary Goans, will remain as RG but as we need a political party and single symbol to contest the elections, we have decided to do it with Goa Su-Raj party,” Parab said. RG had applied for registration as a party seven months back but have not received recognition as yet. Parab also announced that he had met with Aam Aadmi Party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal and political strategist Prashant Kishor, who is currently lobbying for Trinamool Congress. “Today the time has come to say that Goans are not helpless, we are revolutionary. We will save our Goa. It is time for Goans to get out of the slavery to people from other states. There are dalals today who are running from one party to the other. They don’t have principles, they don’t have an ideology,” Parab said. Parab acknowledged that he used to consider Kishor as his political guru and had approached him seeking assistance from Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC) for the upcoming polls. Parab said that Kishor brushed him aside and said that RG will not win more than 500 votes. “These parties from Delhi and other places have treated us as dirt,” said Parab. “We will win the elections and show them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rg-to-contest-2022-elections-under-goa-su-raj-banner/articleshow/87705143.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Weekend spurt in drink-driving cases||KOLKATA: Weekends have thrown up new challenges to traffic cops in the city with a spurt in the number of drink-driving cases. A week after Lalbazar re-introduced breathalyzers, cops prosecuted total 62 motorists, including bikers, for drink-driving. The drive, which had begun a week ago, saw 29 prosecutions in weekdays, expect for Wednesday (Chhath). Between Friday night and Sunday morning, 33 more motorists were prosecuted. “This indicates that we need to step up monitoring on the road with the onset of winter. Usually, we kick off such drives in December every year. This time, we have started the drive early,” said an officer. However, the officers at Lalbazar, who had drawn up an SOP for breathalyzer test earlier, are still not happy with the rising number of drink-driving cases reported from across all the traffic guards. Cops at all the 25 traffic guards have been asked to start nakas by 9pm. “We may deploy patrol trucks too,” said an officer. “Cops on trucks can carry the barricades and put them up at different points of the city,” he added. While Jorabagan guard continued to report the highest 14 drink-driving cases throughout the week, the headquarter traffic guard came second. However, the South and East guards recorded less number of prosecutions despite several pubs being located in their areas. Beliaghata, Sealdah, Kasba and Vidyasagar guards made significant number of prosecutions. In several places, ACPs have already recommended to RTOs for temporary suspension of licences for a few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/weekend-spurt-in-drink-driving-cases/articleshow/87704594.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Neki ki Deewar’ serves needy with dignity, respect in Chittor||JAIPUR: Every city has ‘Neki Ki Deewar’ (Wall of Righteous) as a collection point where the donors drop their old clothes and the poor pick them up as per their need. The wall in Chittorgarh has gone beyond the usual by dry cleaning, ironing and packing the donated clothes before the needy take them. Also, civil society members have appointed a cobbler who repairs, and polishes donated slippers and shoes for the needy. Every day over hundreds of people from poor families and the homeless queue up at the wall which has been converted into a proper shop by the local administration. Here the beneficiaries get clothes of their size and have the option of selecting the colours and fabric too. Mukesh Sharma, a member of a civil society group says that until two years it was just a raised platform where the donors would throw their old clothes. “We could see that the clothes thrown by the donors would get dirty in the open. It was very painful to see that beneficiaries had to pick and choose the cleanest from the pile of dirty clothes,” said Sharma, who mobilised civil society members to create a model to provide ease and ensure the dignity of those taking clothes. The local administration along with Acharya Shri Tulsi Foundation came forward by forming a management system to provide clean clothes to the needy. Sunil Dhiliwal of the foundation says that they first converted the place into a shop with proper racks to put the clothes. “A laundry service and tailor were hired for washing, stitching, ironing, coding and packing of the clothes,” said Dhiliwal. This has increased takers - from homeless beggars to poor families from nearby villages - who come and collect clothes according to their size. The success of the model has prompted the civil society members to start the same service by providing footwear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/neki-ki-deewar-serving-the-needy-with-dignity-and-respect-edt-310/articleshow/87705136.cms||---

However, the Akali team had to face protests by several farmers who had gathered outside a resort where Sukhbir was supposed to address a rally. They showed black flags at Sukhbir Badal, and also argued with policemen present at the spot. One of the protestors also alleged that his turban was removed during the tussle, but the police has refused to comment on the matter. The protesters maintained that the dharna was peaceful, but even then the police removed them from the spot. On the other hand, the police claimed that they were deputed to avoid any clash and they did their best to maintain the law and order situation.Congress leaders have also attacked the Akali Dal over the incident, and claimed that black flags are waived at Sukhbir each and every time he visits a rural area. District Congress president Ashwani Sharma said, “This is the reason Sukhbir is visiting Ludhiana urban areas time and again, because whenever he goes to rural areas, people protest against him. They have lost their ground among rural voters which used to be their strength some years back.” He said that the Akali Dal had supported the BJP over agriculture bills, and farmers will never forget this thing. However, Akali Dal MLA Manpreet Ayali countered the allegations, “There was great response to the rally and other programmes by voters in Gill constituency. People are not happy with the Congress because promises made by Captain Amarinder Singh were never fulfilled. As far as these protests are concerned, these are not farmers, but opposition party members who want to harm the Akali Dal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sukhbir-visits-gill-constituency-faces-farmer-protests/articleshow/87703895.cms||---

All these samples were of people who either lived close to or worked with the two Zika virus patients reported in the city on Thursday. Currently, the city has three Zika virus patients – a 24-year-old woman from LDA colony (Kanpur road), a 32-year-old man from Phoolbagh and a 48-year-old woman from Lal Kuan. “The samples sent by the CMO office for testing at KGMU have turned out to be negative. Currently, we have two sources for sample collection – through three government hospitals (Lokbandhu Raj Narayan Combined Hospital, Dr SPM Civil hospital and Balrampur hospital) where random sampling is being done and through contact tracing of positive patients,” said district surveillance officer Dr Milind Vardhan. “The three patients are doing fine. The young woman had mild fever on Sunday so we gave her medication,” said Dr Vardhan, who visited the patient on Sunday. The health department had created a 400m radius for contact tracing from each of the positive patient’s house which was expanded on Sunday by a few kilometres to widen the search area for more Zika positive patients, if any. Accordingly, 122 samples were collected by 142 teams from three areas and sent to KGMU for testing on Sunday. Test results are awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/106-samples-sent-for-zikatesting-found-negative/articleshow/87705139.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BSP appoints former U’khand head as party’s state poll in-charge; to contest in all 70 seats||Roorkee: The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has made 55-year-old Shish Pal Singh, a party's former Uttarakhand-head, as its new state president again ahead of next year's assembly election. The party has replaced Singh, a resident of a local village, with Naresh Gautam, who had taken command in 2020. Before Gautam, a UP resident, Singh was the state party president for over a year. The party also announced that it will contest all 70 assembly seats this time. The BSP has been going through a rough patch in the hill state as it could not win a seat in the 2017 assembly election. In 2012, the party secured three - all from Haridwar - and in 2007, BSP won eight seats. The party registered its best performance in terms of vote percentage in 2002 when it secured 10.93% votes, winning seven assembly seats. Its vote share has been dwindling since and in 2017, it shrunk to 7%. However, the party still has a considerable hold in Haridwar, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar districts. "In 2012, we had won three seats, but after that we witnessed shrinking of our base here. The reason behind this was the rise of the BJP. They made false promises. This time, we will be a kingmaker after the polls," said Singh, a native of Sikanderpur Bhainswal village who had fought the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Tehri seat. Meanwhile, Mohd Shahzad, a two-time party MLA from Haridwar district, is the party's new vice-president. Political observers said that BSP could perform well in the polls. "Haridwar district has 11 assembly seats and more than 2.5 Dalit voters are here. If the party revamps its election engineering with other major communities of the district, including Muslims, from booth level to sector levels, it surely can perform well in the election," said political analyst and lawyer Rao Naved Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bsp-appoints-former-ukhand-head-as-partys-state-poll-in-charge-to-contest-in-all-70-seats/articleshow/87703893.cms||Tapan Susheel

The PIL before Bombay high court highlights the unregulated business of cryptocurrency and seeks direction to the Centre, Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank of India, SEBI, and other authorities to take urgent steps to protect interest of citizens by formulating laws or guidelines to govern the use and trade of cryptocurrency within the country, including a taxation mechanism for all such transactions within or outside the country.  Advocate Aditya Kadam, who filed the PIL, says he has been investing in cryptocurrency since 2018 and given the lack of any regulatory mechanism seeks judicial intervention to develop “a mechanism for monitoring international transactions conducted within the country by establishing a separate organization or by bringing cryptocurrencies under the scope of previously established bodies under Government of India.’’ He also seeks orders to regulate registration of cryptocurrency exchange platforms and a mechanism of redressal of investor grievances against registered trading platforms in India. The petitioner said his PIL is filed to “highlight underlying problems and uncontrolled, unchecked trades and malpractices in crypto currency trading.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-advocates-pil-seeks-laws-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/articleshow/87705950.cms||---

The accident was so intense that it took around an hour for the police to cut the vehicle and take out the bodies of the victims. According to police, Manish Sharma (30) and his friend Rohit Kumar (28), working in a private company in Mathura, were travelling to Haridwar via Ghaziabad on Saturday night when the accident took place. The car was heading at a speed of over 100 kilometre per hour, claimed police. The assessment was made after they found the body of 45-year-old Mahendra Singh, from Kankarkhera. Singh was crossing the road while he was hit by the car. The driver tried to stop the vehicle but failed, said police. “Prima facie, it seems that the speeding car first hit Mahendra. After the accident, they tried to move in a wrong direction with an aim to flee the spot. This is when they rammed into a bus, leaving the two passengers in the car dead. The pedestrian too died at the spot,” said station house officer, Kankarkhera, Subodh Saxena. This is the second such accident in this area in the last 24 hours. On Friday night, two brothers died after being hit by a speeding truck near the same location. The two cousins, residents of Meerut’s Modinagar area, were returning home after distributing invitation cards for their sister’s wedding, scheduled on November 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/speeding-car-hits-a-pedestrian-then-rams-into-bus-three-dead/articleshow/87703896.cms||Ishita Mishra

Purported videos of the illegal mining were released by Congress at a press briefing on Sunday and the party said that it may move court against the government if no action is taken. However, the district administration claimed that no such mining is on in the region and permission has only been given by the government for "river draining in the area". Congress national spokesperson Alok Sharma said the illegal mining work is on along Ravasan river with heavy machines without any restrictions and the state government should make its stand clear on such mining activities. Dismissing the claims, SDM of Haridwar Puran Singh Rana told TOI, "Allegations of illegal mining are false and no such mining is taking place in the entire region. They have permission for mining with machines and our team went to the site on Saturday and no fault was found.

It is the second day in a row when residents of Kota woke up to ‘poor air’ quality. In Udaipur, the air quality turned ‘very poor’ from ‘poor’ in 24 hours. However, in Bhiwadi, the air quality improved from ‘severe’ to ‘very poor.’ For the past four days, the city has been witnessing increase in AQI. On November 10, the AQI was 195 and fell in the ‘moderate’ level. It increased to 198 on November 11, November 12 (236), November 13 (300) and 328 on November 14. There are six AQI categories — good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe. The AQI is calculated on eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb). It means that if the air quality turns very poor, the level of mixture of noxious gases goes up. AQI is emerged as one such tool for effective dissemination of air quality information to people. According to the state’s pollution control board, the air quality has deteriorated as velocity of air has decreased with the onset of winters, which is why pollutants do not disperse easily. Ajmer has the best air quality in the state as it has been categorised as satisfactory. In Jodhpur, the air quality continued to deteriorate for the past two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-5th-straight-day-citys-aqi-has-been-very-poor/articleshow/87705148.cms||---
---||Goa||Multiple checks system put in place to finalise private forests||Panaji: The review committee, carrying out verification of the additional private forest areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo panel, found many land owners raising objections during the process. This required the sub-committees to revisit the survey numbers several times. In view of this, the review committee has now put in place multiple checks and weekly monitoring mechanisms, involving forest officials, talathis and government surveyors. So far, until August this year, the review committee has verified and was able to find that an additional 1,396 hectares or 14sqkm of area in Goa qualifies as private forest. This area is in addition to the 46.11sqkm of the private forest identified by earlier committees and approved by the National Green Tribunal. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said in the assembly in July that the review of the additional private forest areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo panel will be completed by March 2022. The government panels while identifying private forests applied the criteria that the area should be either contiguous to the government forest lands or, if in isolation, the minimum area identified should be 5ha. And, canopy density should not be less than 0.4. The review committee has now formed several sub-committees, which are carrying out ground enumeration mainly based on the third criteria – that at least 75% of the tree species in the private forest being of forestry type. This will be the determining factor for an identified area to qualify as private forest. So that there are no objections to the forest found to be qualifying as private forest from the land owners, the review committee has now put multiple checks in place. “The range forest officer/member secretary of the sub-committee shall invariably visit all the sites and verify 100% sample points on the ground. Further, inspector of survey and land records & talathi shall also attend the field enumeration and verify the report prepared by the sub-committee before sending it to the review committee,” the committee has said in its new guidelines. In addition, it has said that the assistant conservator of forests (ACF) should be assigned an area for checking and he should verify at least 20% of the sample points in each sheet. “The deputy conservator of forests of both divisions shall conduct regular and random test checks for verification of the reports submitted by the sub-committees. DCFs shall conduct at least 5% random checking of the reports submitted by the sub-committees and verify the reports before sending it to the review committee,” the guidelines state. Besides this, geo-reference photographs of the trees at sampling points have to be taken mandatorily, along with the representatives, objectors or owners of the land, the review committee has said. The ACFs have also been asked to visit the DCF’s office every Tuesday and Friday to carry out the work of scrutinising all field reports for correctness and completeness. The review committee has asked for weekly report of the field verification exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/multiple-checks-system-put-in-place-to-finalise-private-forests/articleshow/87705158.cms||---

The 40-minute film, which is being screened at the 4th South Asian Short Film Festival at Nandan on Monday, was shot during his week-long journey in Iraq, where he travelled 70km on foot to visit the Shia pilgrimage of Arba’een Walk that witnessed around 25 million people from across the world walking from Najaf to Karbala. According to the director, who is a Presidency College-FTII alumni, shooting this film revealed a new perspective about religion and tolerance. Sarangi was invited to join this Shia pilgrimage, where millions go on a peaceful march to pay tribute to Hussain, grandson of the prophet, who was killed in a war about 1,400 years ago. “Growing up in Kanthi, I had been to the Muharram fair at the local Karbala ground. While I knew about Haj, Arba’een was new for me. Hardly much is written or filmed about this pilgrimage. Everything including food and lodging is offered free there. An Islamic philanthropic organization, despite knowing my religion, wanted me to observe their rituals of the pilgrimage and archive it,” he said. Sourav Sarangi at Najaf's Wadi-us-Salaam which is the world's largest cemeteryRisking deportation in the absence of an Iraqi visa, Sarangi still landed in Najaf in 2017 and finally entered a maze of tombstones at Wadi-us-Salaam - the world’s largest cemetery - with a four-member unit comprising assistant Minarul Mandal and Iraqi cameraman Usama Tmimi. Men, women, and even toddlers in prams and elderly in wheelchairs are part of the Arba’een Walk. Some thump their chests, others collectively wail in remembrance of the martyrdom of Hussain. “Rituals and personal experiences merge to result in catharsis in remembrance of their personal bereavement,” he said. Music, he said, played an important part. That’s evident in Santajit Chatterjee’s intelligent sound design and Sujoy Das’ mixing. Chest-beats overlap with the sound of the marching feet and somewhere connects with the idea of protest. In place of talking heads, Sarangi used his own voiceover and even lyrics of songs that played in the background. “Retaining the interview format risked the essence of our exchange of emotions getting lost in front of the camera,” he said. The voiceover touched upon issues like power, faith and world politics. His writing, which effectively merges disjointed experiences, added an extra edge. “There is a sense of claustrophobia in a world increasingly divided on religious lines. This journey to Karbala showed me another side of religion that can stand for universal peace and love,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/film-festival-to-screen-city-directors-docu-on-karbala/articleshow/87704604.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The passengers, calling the train a lifeline for them to reach colleges and offices, have demanded the continuation of the train. While the aforesaid DEMU train is being cancelled to start the new DEMU train between Kacheguda and Rotegaon, passengers have said that the timings of the former train are only suitable for them. Raj Somani, a railway activist said that the cancellation of the DEMU train between Rotegaon and Nanded would cause huge inconvenience to many passengers. “Without any consultation with the stakeholders, the SCR has taken unilateral decision to cancel the DEMU train in question. The SCR is earning huge revenue by running the train and therefore, it makes no sense in taking such irrational decision,” he said. Many students from the outskirts and nearby areas pursue higher education in Aurangabad by taking benefit of the rail connectivity. Besides, a considerable chunk of the working population from local industries and other establishments also rely on DEMU trains for commuting daily. Gangapur MLA Prashant Bamb, in a letter, addressed to the railway authorities, said many students would suffer due to the cancellation of the DEMU train between Rotegaon and Nanded. “While the Covid outbreak has already hit the students hard, the cancellation of DEMU train will create commuting issues for students plying between Aurangabad and the outskirt areas,” he said. When contacted, the public relations officer for the Nanded division of SCR, Rajesh Shinde, said the top-brass of the railways would take note of any feedback from the passengers over services of the concerned DEMU train. The DEMU train between Rotegaon and Nanded is being cancelled to start the new DEMU train between Kacheguda and Rotegaon, but passengers find previous train timings much convenient||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/passengers-angry-as-scr-plans-to-cancel-demu-train/articleshow/87703350.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP kept promise on law & order, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday reached out to the trading community maintaining that the BJP fulfilled the key poll promise of a robust law and order situation it made to the people in 2017 UP assembly elections. Addressing a “Vaishya and Trader” convention called by the BJP, Yogi said that it was because of the hard work of the trading community that UP has turned into a second biggest economy in the country. The convention, which was called by Naresh Agarwal, former Rajya Sabha member who has switched over from SP to BJP, was attended by a host of senior BJP leaders including Union minister Piyush Goyal and UP minister Nand Gopal Nandi. CM Yogi Adityanath being felicitated at Vaishya conventionThe CM categorically drew a contrast with the situation before 2017, when the state faced riots, especially during festivals and criminals gaining political patronage. Yogi also referred to alleged exodus of Hindu families in Kairana in the aftermath of 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and subsequent criminalisation in west UP. "It is no longer the case. Rioters have been rendered silent and the criminals are behind bars," he said. The CM said that it was because of well-coordinated efforts of the Centre and the state government that proper security for investors and traders was being ensured. He highlighted how the ever increasing GST collection was indicative of the growing business opportunity. Lauding the Modi government, Yogi said that India would have been turned into an economic super power soon after independence had the then Central leadership been like that of the present day time. “Be it coronavirus management, schemes meant for farmer welfare or making the country self-reliant (Atmanirbhar Bharat), the government did everything which was needed,” he said. Endorsing Yogi’s views, Goyal said that UP witnessed an immense change which was no less than a “kranti” (revolution). He said that the Vaishya community cared for the country and the society rather than its individual interest. “We often see social works being essentially done by the people from the Vaishya community,” Goyal said, exhorting the trader community to once again help the BJP to form the government . ‘Communist forces trying to create rift’UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the BJP was facing a “crisis situation” as “separatists” and “communist” forces have reached UP to create rift on the basis of caste and religion. “They want to destabilise UP,” he said, and asked workers to visit 1,000 households of backwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-kept-promise-on-law-order-yogi/articleshow/87705156.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ludhiana||Thieves make hay as banks, fin firms take time to act||Ludhiana: The Ludhiana police have given time to the banks and the gold finance companies to ensure safety measures, including deployment of security guards. Banks and finance firms’ officers have to ask their headquarters for security measures, which is taking time, thereby giving robbers a chance to take advantage of this delay. In the recent past, many ATM kiosks, mostly without guards, were targeted. Despite a number of such cases, the police administration has failed to ensure that all ATMs have security personnel deployed even at night, as many have guards only during the day. However, in several areas even during daytime guards are missing. On Saturday near Kailash Cinema Chowk, two assailants had tried to rob a man who was withdrawing cash from an ATM. One of the accused was carrying an illegal country-made pistol, with which he shot at the man who suffered an injury. A security guard present at a nearby shop and some locals managed to nab one the accused and his accomplice was arrested later. On Sunday, the TOI found several ATM kiosks at Pakhowal Road, Kochar Market, near Hero Bakery Chowk, Ferozepur Road near Bharat Nagar Chowk, Model Gram, Gill Road, Dugri and Chandigarh Road without security guards. On November 12, burglars had targeted an ATM of SBI in Swadi Kalan village, Sidhwan Bet, and fled with Rs 9.47 lakh by using a gas cutter. The ATM had a security guard in daytime, but not at night. Prior to that on September 25, car-borne miscreants first broke open the shutter of an ATM of SBI in Bhutta village using a gas cutter, sprayed something on the CCTV camera, then using the same gas cutter broke open the ATM and escaped with cash. The machine contained approximately Rs 18.38 lakh.Joint commissioner of police (city) J Elanchezhian said after the robbery bid at Muthoot Finance on October 30, all such finance firms and banks were asked to have security guards deployed and get other measures installed, but as they have to take up the matter with their headquarters, it was delaying the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/thieves-make-hay-as-banks-fin-firms-take-time-to-act/articleshow/87703909.cms||Payal Dhawan

She said Congress workers have been asking her to do anything but join hands with other parties, adding that she respects the views of partymen. Congress will give a chance to its dedicated workers who have worked for the party over the years, she said. Addressing over 7,000 Congress workers from Meerut, Agra and Aligarh zones during party’s ‘Pratigya Sammelan’ held in Bulandshahr on Sunday, she said the BJP government doesn’t understand the rights of the people and the meaning of independence because they have not fought for India’s freedom. While praising BR Ambedkar for his contribution in drafting the Indian Constitution, Priyanka also mentioned the contributions of Indira Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Sardar Patel in India's freedom struggle. Priyanka – who had recently bumped into Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav while they were on a flight, and also met the BSP supremo on Sunday to offer her condolences after the death of Mayawati’s mother – had sparked rumours of alliance with these two prominent parties. Also, a brief meeting of Priyanka and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary recently was seen as a hint towards an alliance, but Congress refrained from speaking on the issue. “In the past five years, Congress has been working for the people of Uttar Pradesh, and partymen are fighting the real battle in UP,” she said. Party workers have been raising burning issues such as inflation, atrocities on the farmers and the poor, CAANRC, atrocities on Dalits, etc, she added. During the dialogue with party office-bearers, Priyanka chalked out the strategy of elections and stressed on social media presence. She had asked all groundlevel workers to form WhatAapp groups and run Congress’s campaign on social media. The media was asked not to cover the event live as she was speaking to party workers about the party’s poll preparations in western UP. Priyanka had last month announced 40% reservation of seats for women in the upcoming UP polls. During Sunday's Bulandshahr meet, the Congress general secretary asked party office-bearers to give the front seats to women workers, and also had a separate meeting with the women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/congress-will-not-form-any-alliance-ahead-of-up-polls-priyanka-gandhi-vadra/articleshow/87703912.cms||Ishita Mishra

Amidst many symptoms such as myalgia (muscle pain), headache, cough and breathlessness, fatigue is most prevalent. Fortis C-DOC, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi, National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation and Diabetes Foundation, recently conducted a joint study that was published in the journal, ‘Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews’. The study found that type-2 diabetes patients who had Covid-19 showed significantly more fatigue as compared to those not infected by the coronavirus. While experts have said diabetes poses a challenge in the recovery of patients, the results of the study further show that diabetes complicates the course of Covid-19 and results in excess mortality. Sushant Rajput, diabetologist, said, “The right approach is for a treating clinician, psychological counsellor, nutritionist, and physical therapist to help with all-round recovery of diabetics infected with Covid-19.” Dietitian Supriya Kulkarni emphasized proper nutrition. “Keeping one’s glucose level in check is reliant on proper nutrition and exercise/activity,” she said. Adarsh Shetty, physiologist, said that patients with Type-2 diabetes must consider physiotherapy for the recovery of their pulmonary and cardiovascular health. General physician Junaid Siddique said diabetics should be regular with their medical check-ups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-prevalence-of-post-covid-fatigue-in-type-2-diabetes-patients-finds-study/articleshow/87704616.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Addressing mediapersons here, AAP Ludhiana Lok Sabha polls in-charge Amandeep Singh Mohi said, “The DC was being penalised for his honesty and upright behaviour as he had taken a stand against the sale of government properties by the ruling party.”AAP Punjab spokesman Ahbaab Singh Grewal alleged that the deputy commissioner was being punished as he had not allowed the sale of improvement trust land and building at rates much lower than the market value and had also marked an inquiry against Gill MLA Kuldeep Singh Vaid. Mohi and Grewal claimed that the AAP wouldn't allow an honest officer to be penalised for doing his duty and saving hundreds of crores of public money. AAP leaders alleged that the officer being brought to replace him was Dr Amarpal Singh, who is “highly indebted to the Badals for saving him in the iron ore scam and due to which he was promoted to the IAS.” AAP leaders Gurjit Singh Gill, Madan Laal Bagga and Ashok Prashar (Pappi) said, “Our party will approach the election commission against this arbitrary and wrong step of the Punjab government.” They said this pointed to collusion between the SAD and the Congress, as they were trying to team up like the last time against the AAP. Grewal and Mohi said the transfer was against the rules laid down by the ECI. Party’s district secretary Sharanpal Singh Makkar, district vice-president Dr Deepak Bansal and media in-charge Dupinder Singh were also present at the press meet. The Congress, however, has refuted the allegations. Congress’s district president (urban) Ashwani Sharma said he was not aware about the transfer and if it was done, it must be in routine. He added that the AAP has no issue left because chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi has delivered on the promises. The Congress leader said the deputy commissioner had no role in the auction of the LIT land and no inquiry was marked against the Gill MLA.The DC refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/aap-dc-being-transferred-for-not-allowing-wrong-sale-of-lit-land/articleshow/87703929.cms||---

Speaking at an event by Brahmin Parivar, Yogi said one could assume what would have happened had Patel not been there. “Comparing Jinnah with Patel is no less than an attempt to humiliate the entire generation. How long will we accept this,” he asked. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and cabinet minister Brajesh Pathak were also present on the occasion. Yogi also flayed the previous Congress-led UPA government at the Centre for not considering the pain and sufferings of Kashmiri pandits year after year. “For them, only power and chair were important,” he said, adding that it was the BJP government which not only resolved the crisis but also abrogated Article 370 that entailed special status to Kashmir. “Every true Hindu struggled for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. No political party can say that it did not get a chance to resolve the temple issue. Those who got the chance ordered firing at Ram bhakts,” he said, referring to firing on kar sevaks in 1990 during the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. “The very existence of Ram and Krishna was challenged. But the BJP government organised ‘deepotsav’ in Ayodhya,” he said. Yogi also referred to Tulsidas, a Ramanandi Vaishnava Hindu saint and poet who wrote ‘Ramcharitmanas’, as the one who refused to accept Akbar as king and said ‘Raja Ram Chandra Ki Jai’. “As per ‘sanatan parampara’, Brahmins are the ones who stand for religion at the time of crisis,” said the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/equating-jinnah-patel-petty-politics-says-cm/articleshow/87705165.cms||---

The first accused, Ashwani Kumar, 42, was nabbed by the public on the spot. An illegal country-made pistol and four live cartridges were recovered from him. Police said Ashwani had brought the weapon from a town in Bihar after learning about it on YouTube.The second accused is Gaurav, 28, nephew of Ashwani. Both are residents of Jassiyan village.Division 8 police station SHO sub-inspector Ravinderpal Singh said, “Both are unemployed and drug addicts. At times, they would get labour jobs. They started executing crimes to meet their drug needs. Two years ago, the Jalandhar rural police had arrested them with counterfeit currency notes. They later came out of jail on bail.”The police have also recovered the motorcycle used in the crime from the possession of Gaurav. “The bike has a Sangrur number plate and it is suspected that it is stolen. We are verifying it with the Sangrur police. Their search on YouTube about illegal weapons led them to a town in Bihar. About a month ago, the two bought a country-made pistol for Rs 20,000 from there. The pistol was used in the loot attempt at the ATM kiosk,” the SHO added.On Saturday around 6.30pm, Ashwani and Gaurav had tried to rob Sandeep Kumar, who was withdrawing cash, in the ATM kiosk. As Sandeep resisted, Ashwani shot at him. Sandeep received a bullet injury in his thigh. When the accused tried to flee, onlookers nabbed Ashwani, but could not get hold of Gaurav.

RHB commissioner Pawan Arora, who received the award virtually said, “Along with housing projects, the RHB has also launched many infrastructure projects and established itself nationally in the past two years. Departments from all the state participated in the competition and ‘Gold’ category award was declared on the basis online voting.” Instituted in 2003, SKOCH award salutes people, projects and institutions that go the extra mile to make India a better nation. At the time of participation, the RHB had presented that within a record time, it has launched Shiksak Peheri Housing Scheme, Luxurious MLA Scheme, All India Services (IAS, IPS and IFS) Officers Scheme and other housing schemes in smaller cities. Similarly, it has developed infrastructure projects including country’s first coaching hub, state capital’s biggest park and food joints (Chaupati) in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota. Many claim that the achievement was remarkable as the then BJP government in 2016 had announced to dissolve the board. An office bearer in RHB Union alleged that former chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s intention was to give the RHB land on public-private partnership (PPP) model at cheaper rates to develop various projects and no projects were given to RHB. “After the Congress government came to power, efforts were being made to revive the RHB. After the government expressed faith in our team, we performed and yielded results. This is first time any department has won this prestigious award.” Established in 1970, the RHB aims at providing houses on no profit-no loss basis. “The RHB was established nearly 46 years ago to cater to the housing needs of the residents, in particular the lower middle class. Now, it is also developing high-end projects after earning its own revenue,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-wins-skoch-award-for-revival-and-strengthening/articleshow/87705168.cms||---

They said other states have hosted this conference but not in their own office, instead it was held at other institutes, like in Pune it was held at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER) in Baner and in the verdant Centre for Police Research (CPR) in Pashan in 2019. Key security issues such as left wing extremism, terrorism, cybercrime, ISIS, crime against women, pandemic and the challenges will be discussed at the meet. Each state DGP will give a presentation and several committees of IGs have been formed to hold sessions on key topics. Sources said on the inaugural day, Amit Shah will be the guest and will give away medals. PM will attend the meet on November 20 and 21 and give reward medals besides addressing the conference. As per the tentative schedule, PM will either arrive in Lucknow on November 19 night or November 20 morning. Preparations are in full swing at Raj Bhawan for the visit.  CCTVs are being installed and a separate force of about 2,000 cops drawn from Lucknow police Commissionerate has been prepared for security. Night-vision drones will also be deployed. Since 2014, the DGP-IG conference has been held in different states. In 2020, it was held virtually due to Covid-19. The conference hasbeen held in Guwahati in 2014, Rann of Kutch in 2015, Hyderabad in 2016, Tekanpur in 2018, and Pune in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-host-nations-top-police-meet-for-1st-time/articleshow/87705175.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Jammu||How commandos, fate helped overcome a missed chance||Historically, Pakistani generals are obsessed with Chamb-Jaurian. They feel once the Akhnoor-Jammu road is cut off, Kashmir will stand isolated from the rest of India. In 1965, it remained a bridge too far, as General Yahya Khan was unable to organise the promised breakfast on the Akhnoor bridge. Pakistan army’s Operation Grand Slam was a failure. It is often said: once the war is over, there is no dearth of brave men. A brigadier from Pakistan had claimed while sipping his ale in a London pub that had he been given a free hand in 1965, he would have reached Akhnoor in 24 hours and then Jammu. This highlights the importance of Chamb to Pakistan. Operation Venus, planned by Pakistan in1971, was on similar lines. In1971, Lt Gen Sartaj Singh, general officer commanding (GOC) of 15 Corps, had planned a limited offensive into Pakistan from Chamb-Jaurian. The 10 Infantry Division with additional troops was to carry out the offensive. Alfa group of 9 Para Commando battalion, under Maj M M Ashok Cariappa, was allotted to10 Infantry Division. I was a lieutenant colonel and commanding officer of the battalion, which was with the infantry division to coordinate offensive tasks. Missed chanceAround the middle of November 1971, there was a war game about the offensive plans and loose ends were being tied up for the offensive. Lt Gen Sartaj Singh had given his outline plan for the offensive when I got up and said: “While we are planning offensive into Pakistan, my commandos who are deployed all along the frontline looking for gaps in Pakistani defences to infiltrate during the war, tell me that Pakistan seems to be building up opposite us with tanks, artillery, and a lot of infantry movement has been seen.” Brigadier R K Jasbir Singh, commander of the 191 Infantry Brigade, got up and said: “I endorse Lt Col Sabharwal’s views.” General Sartaj roared: “It’s all rubbish. As D-Day is approaching, you chaps are getting ‘yellow’.” There was pin-drop silence. I got up and volunteered to lead a confirmatory patrol behind the enemy lines to see for myself and report and sought permission to do so. This was agreed to and permission was given by the commander. At 9 pm on November 20,1971, Capt Keshav Padha, Havildar Waryam Singh, Lance Naik Karam Singh, Paratrooper Pushpinder Singh (radio operator), and I were to cross into Pakistan and spend around eight hours behind enemy lines, to look for any signs of Pakistani buildup. Before we could go ahead, Lt Gen Sartaj Singh rang up: “You will not go across. I repeat, you will not go across.” This, I feel, was a big mistake. Vital bridgeOn December 3, 1971, Maj Gen Jaswant Singh and I were visiting headquarters of the 191 Infantry Brigade, the forward brigade, to tie up and meet with Brig R K Jasbir Singh to get the latest information. After the discussion, when we were about to leave, Brig Jasbir Singh offered us a drink. Just then, heavy shelling from Pakistan began. The war had started. General Jaswant and I headed back for our command posts. As we were crossing the Chamb bridge, we stopped. It was unmanned. Gen Jaswant Singh, seeing this, told me: “Sabu, you will defend this for me no matter at what cost; this bridge is going to be vital for this battle.” Having rehearsed day in and day out for offensive tasks behind enemy lines, here I was given a task in a purely infantry role. Nevertheless, we were determined to do our best. On December 4, 1971, around 3 pm, Capt Cariappa with his boys arrived at the bridge and started digging to defend the structure. Around 400 yards behind them were three tanks of Deccan Horse .800. Behind them, there were 6 guns of 39 Medium Regiment, commanded by Major Ranbir Singh. Azad Kashmir Brigade of Pakistan, having overrun some of the forward Indian positions, was in the area of the western bank of Tawi since December 4 or 5. Their task was to advance along Chamb, Jaurian and Akhnoor. When the advancing elements of the Pakistani brigade reached the western banks of the Munnawar Tawi, they were clueless of the fact that at that given time, there was nothing between them and Akhnoor bridge except the commandos, yet they failed to make it to Akhnoor bridge. At the same time, commandos were blissfully unaware of the fact that apart from them, there were no other fighting forces behind them on the road between the two bridges. Saviours of AkhnoorThe commandos, a troop of tanks, and a battery of gunners stood firm and became saviours of Akhnoor and Jammu by giving Lt Gen Sartaj Singh enough time to redeploy his forces. During December 4-5 night, the Pakistani brigade launched three fierce attacks on the bridge. Each attack was preceded by an intense earth-shattering artillery barrage that seemed to last for eternity. The first attack with the battle cry of ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ came around 2 am. It was on the commando team led by Capt Macarius. Initially, we lost some ground in this attack, but it was soon regained by a local counterattack led by Capt Macarius. The second attack came around 3 am, which came on the team commanded by Capt Amar Bisht. This too was repulsed, with heavy losses to Pakistanis. In both these attacks, medium machine gun (MMG) teams of Naik Ram Singh and Lance Naik Hoshiar Singh, and of Havildar Bahal Chand and Commando Ram Singh played a vital role. Between them, they fired 12,000 rounds and inflicted heavy losses on attacking Pakistanis. The third Pakistani attack came around 5 am. By this time, the enemy had been vanquished and chased across the western bank of Tawi. The commanding officer of 13 Azad Kashmir along with nine of his men had been taken prisoner. During the battle, we lost a few commandos, including Lance Naik Hoshiar Singh, Commando Ram Singh and Lance Naik Om Prakash. Ten commandos, including Capt M A Cariappa, were wounded. In this battle, fate intervened and there were two lucky breaks for India. One, out of the blue, commandos arrived to defend the Chamb bridge at the most crucial time. Two, the GOC of Pakistan’s 23 Infantry Division, Maj Gen Iftikhar Janjua, died in a helicopter crash on December 9. If Chamb and surrounding areas are still with India and Pakistanis could not reach Akhnoor, the credit for this must go to Alfa group of 9-Para Commando under Maj Cariappa, three tanks of Deccan Horse, and six guns of 216 Medium Regiment under the leadership of Major Ranbir Singh.

The incident came to light on Sunday. The deceased have been identified as Akhilesh Kumar, 30, and Ritu, 28, both factory workers. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-East) Davinder Chaudhary said, “When all the calls of Ritu’s sister went unanswered, she went to the couple’s house and found them dead. Ritu, her sister and husband work in the same factory.” ACP added, “The couple had got married in June. It was the second marriage of both Akhilesh and Ritu. The probe suggests that Akhilesh was a hard drinker and Ritu would deter him from drinking. The neighbours told police that the couple used to fight almost every day. It is suspected that on Saturday, too, they fought and then took the extreme step. No suicide note was recovered from the spot.” The police are proceeding under Section 174 of the CrPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/husband-wife-commit-suicide-in-meharban/articleshow/87703961.cms||---

Twelve persons from different areas tested positive for the virus on Sunday. In just three days, 30 new cases have been found from different areas. Apart from 12 cases in Jaipur, two cases were reported from Ajmer and one case each from Kota and Nagaur. In the last 24 hours, 16 persons tested positive taking the overall tally to 9,54,519. The state’s casualty count toll stood at 8,954. Health department officials are taking the spike seriously. “We will get the genome sequencing of samples of those being tested positive for the virus,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). Five among those 30 cases found infected with the virus belong to the same family in Bani Park area. First, one member of the family tested positive for the virus two days ago. The health department took samples of other family members and they all were found infected. When health department officials talked to them, they claimed of being fully vaccinated. “Vaccination against Covid does not give any guarantee that a person will not get infected, but he will not get severe symptoms. So, it is necessary to take precautions even though the person is vaccinated with both the doses. A vaccinated person can also spread the virus. There is high possibility of the third wave to emerge, but it is expected that it will not be as dangerous as the second wave,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of advisory committee on Covid. The health department officials appealed to people to continue taking Covid appropriate behavior and avoid going in crowded places and maintain social distancing. Also, health department officials appealed to people to get vaccinated as a lot of beneficiaries have got vaccinated with the first dose but have not received the second dose yet. On Sunday, five persons tested positive for Covid in Adarsh Nagar, two each in Vaishali Nagar and Bani Park and one case each was reported from Jawahar Nagar, Malviya Nagar and Raja Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/12-persons-test-positive-for-covid-in-jaipur-30-cases-in-3-days/articleshow/87705181.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Redevelopment boost in Maharashtra gives Mhada record payoff||MUMBAI: The redevelopment of old buildings received a push in the state during Covid as Mhada gave record approvals to projects, in the process collecting its highest revenue levels from fees and premiums: in just five months, from April to August 2021, the agency collected Rs 1,171.86 crore through this approach. In comparison, in 12 months from April 2020 to March 2021, the agency had collected 261.38 crore.  From the time the pandemic began, Mhada’s total revenue collection has been over Rs 1,433 crore, a record for the housing agency. From April 2020 till August 2021 (the last month for which data is available), Mhada gave approvals or offer letters to 193 redevelopment projects. In comparison, the agency had approved only 162 projects in three years from 2017 to 2020 before the pandemic broke out.  Mhada officials said fast-tracking approvals and a 50% discount in premiums offered by the state government had helped builders and that was the reason behind the redevelopment push. Builders pay premiums to Mhada for getting additional construction space and concession in rules like having large amounts of open space and staircases.  Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said he was pushing to fast-track redevelopment of old and dilapidated Mhada-regulated buildings and the agency had been asked to issue offer letters in a time-bound manner. “We have cleared several projects that were stuck for decades. We have given offer letters and made way for the redevelopment of several projects like Patra Chawl, Chikhalwadi, Motilal Nagar and even BDD chawls. This has happened because of fast-tracking of processes. Those living in these old buildings will soon get new homes,” Awhad said.  There are 14,000-odd cessed buildings in the city. Many are in urgent need of redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-redevpt-boost-gives-mhada-record-payoff/articleshow/87705971.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The campaign involves door-do-door visits by health workers to trace beneficiaries who are yet to get vaccinated and convince them to take the jabs at the nearest vaccination centre. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, immunization officer for Aurangabad, said both male and female beneficiaries have been located during the door-do-door visits carried out by the health teams. “The efforts made by Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers during the campaign have started reflecting in terms of daily increased vaccination figures. The campaign also involves busting myths and false notions associated with the vaccination,” she said. The municipal limits of Aurangabad on Saturday recorded 11,081 vaccinations — a record daily figure since the vaccination programme against Covid-19 was launched by the government. Health authorities said vaccine hesitancy was observed in some of the minority dominated areas of Aurangabad. Notably, local unit of AIMIM led by city MP Imtiaz Jaleel had carried out mass awareness in many areas for getting vaccinated. The party had also put up hoardings in different areas displaying photos of some of its top leaders taking the jabs. Besides around 65 vaccination sites, the civic administration has also set up camps at tourist places and few other areas. Aurangabad has witnessed a total 10.16 lakh vaccinations so far, including 6.31 lakh beneficiaries who have received the first dose. Against the total target population of 10.5 lakh aged 18 and above, 3.86 lakh beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated, as per official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/health-workers-visit-33213-homes-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/87703385.cms||---

So, the news of the return of Lord Ram reached us late. Ever since, Diwali is celebrated on 'Ekadash', the 11th day. People prepare dal fritters and pooris. We make bunches from local wood like cheed, tie them together, light them and use them as a bonfire. The food is consumed around it and we dance around to folk songs which is the Bhailo dance tradition,” said Pradeep Kukreti, district president, Uttarakhand statehood agitators' forum. The group has been organising Igas celebrations at the Shaheed Smarak in Dehradun for several years now. Hundreds gathered at the ground on Sunday in festive wear. Celebrations were seen across multiple city localities like Nehru Colony, Lalpull, Patel Nagar, among others. Villages in the hill areas also marked the occasion by lighting diyas and preparing festive goodies. “It’s all about the community coming together for the celebrations. Food is prepared and consumed together, we have folk songs and dance. Bhailo is an integral part, sweets are exchanged. Every household will light lamps all through the night,” said Gita Bisra, a resident of Chamoli district’s Gairsain. Meanwhile, the festival of Igas Bagwal was celebrated with much fervour in the Queen of Hills Mussoorie on Sunday.  A cultural programme was organised where traditional folk songs and dances, cuisine and drums (dhol-damau) were played amid a large gathering.

In 2019, a 14-year-old girl was gang-raped by two men in the Navlakhi Compound that is isolated and dark and located right next to a busy Akota-Dandia Bazaar Road. After the accused were arrested, one of them revealed that his relative had looted a girl and her male friend in Navlakhi Compound in 2018 too. The boy had later filed a complaint of loot at Raopura police station. After the incident of gang-rape in 2019, demands were made to illuminate the isolated spots in the city and increase police patrolling in such areas. In March last year, a lok rakshak dal (LRD) cop posted at Laxmipura police station was arrested for raping a 21-year-old girl on the isolated Gotri-Ankodia Road. Accused Surajsinh Chauhan demanded bribe from a couple and then when the boy went to get cash from the ATM, he molested the girl and forced her to perform oral sex. Despite repetition of sexual crimes in such isolated and dark spots in the city, these are yet to to be properly illuminated provided with better police patrolling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/isolated-spots-threaten-barodian-womens-safety/articleshow/87704041.cms||Tushar Tere

The children, divided into ruling party and opposition, discussed and debated on 18 issues that the state is facing. Following all the assembly protocols, the speaker, chief minister, council of ministers and leader of opposition participated in the question hour in the presence of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, CM Ashok Gehlot and speaker of state assembly CP Joshi. Children who performed the role of the speaker, CM, ministers and MLAs seated on the respective designated seats/benches allotted to the members in the assembly. During the question hour, the members raised issues like shortage of fertilisers, school fees issue, the impact of Covid on learning outcomes, the power crises due to shortage of coal, environmental hazards in the state, rising crime against women, child labour, rise in dengue cases etc. The questions were to the point, terse, pithy, loaded with real facts in a parliamentary language using relevant sections and acts Living up to the expectations were responses from all the ministers. A member Divyanshi Choudhary raised year-wise data on the number of rape cases, pending cases and prosecution in these cases in the past three years. The response given to her was quoted from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report followed by efforts taken by the government. Jhanvi Sharma presided over as speaker mesmerised everyone in the assembly with her confidence, delivery and know-how of the assembly proceedings. She read out questions, warned the members not to disrupt and introduced an adjournment motion. The element of pandemonium in the assembly performed by the leader of opposition Vaibhavee Goyal left the real leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria spellbound. Goyal abruptly called for a walkout during a reply on frequent ban on the internet by government calling it harassment of students and the general public. Granddaughter of CM Gehlot, Kashvi Gehlot, raised the need for a campaign to create awareness of children on forest, nature, wildlife and environment. Over 5000 students submitted their video for the contest against the 200 shortlisted in the age group of 6-12 years by the organizers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/200-schoolchildren-conduct-mock-assembly-session/articleshow/87705185.cms||---

Of the state’s 2.23 crore unvaccinated population, Thane, Nashik, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Solapur, Nanded, and Ahmednagar districts have a population of 93.71 lakh above 18 individuals, who are eligible to avail the free shot, but have not yet come forward. “These seven districts have the state’s maximum unvaccinated population. We have been focusing on using interpersonal communication techniques and public education tools to motivate them to take the shot,” state immunization officer Sachin Desai said. The state has a population of around 9.14 crore above-18 individuals. Of them, around 6.90 crore have taken the first dose. However, the remaining around 2.23 crore have not yet taken a single shot. The growing perception among masses that the pandemic is over is among the main hurdles holding the state back from achieving 100% coverage of the first dose, experts have said. The seven districts collectively have a population of 2.9 crore individuals, who are eligible for the vaccine. Of them, 1,96,85,894 have taken the first dose, counting for 67% of first dose vaccination till November 13.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Those with divisive agenda support idea of Talibanisation, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Unleashing yet another a caustic attack on the opposition, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that people who have a “divisive agenda” indirectly support the idea of `Talibanisation”. “Jo log vibhajan ki baat karte hain wo apratyasksh roop se talibanikaran ka samarthan karte hain,” he said, while speaking at the Samajik Pratinidhi Sammelan organised by the BJP in Lucknow. The convention was called in support of OBC sub-castes like Maurya, Kushwaha, Shakya and Saini. The chief minister said that a host of voices from the opposition ranks came up in support of Taliban when it stormed back to power in Afghanistan. The CM’s apparent reference was towards SP’s Sambhal MP Shafiqur Rehman Barq who was slapped with sedition charges after he defended the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, while equating it with India's own freedom struggle. Taliban ka samarthan matlab manavta virodhi tatvon ko samarthan dena…,” he said, insisting that supporting the Taliban was like a conspiracy against Buddha’s message of peace and compassion. “Supporting Taliban was like dishonouring women and children also,” he stressed. Yogi’s statement correlating “division of society” with “Talibanisation” comes days after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav drew sharp criticism from the BJP ranks for comparing Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. Not surprisingly, Yogi once again slammed Akhilesh for “deriding” Patel by comparing him with Jinnah . “Patel rashtra ke nayak hain..aur Jinnah Bharat ke liye sadaiv khalnayak hi rahenge,” he said, reiterating that people supporting Jinnah were also supportive of Taliban. He asserted that the “peace-loving” people should never forget how the Taliban blew up 2,500-year-old statues of Buddha in Afghanistan almost 20 years ago. The statues were blown up and destroyed in March 2001 by the Taliban, on orders from its leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Yogi categorically cited that national emblem was an adaptation from the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka comprising four lions, standing back to back and mounted on an abacus with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull and a lion separated by intervening wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the Capital is crowned by the Wheel of the Law (Dharma Chakra).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/those-with-divisive-agenda-support-talibanisation-yogi/articleshow/87705190.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Soon, Lucknow's BSIP to be a part of national science research university||LUCKNOW: If all goes well, the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) will soon be the constituent of a national-level science research university. The department of science and technology is making efforts to set up first-of-itskind National Science and Technology Research University (NSTRU), and scientific institutes like BSIP will be its constituent. The department will set up the university by leveraging the research strength of autonomous research and development institutions working in the field of science and technology. Speaking during the founders’ day celebration on Sunday, BSIP director Prof Vandana Prasad said, “BSIP will also come under the umbrella of NSTRU. Like universities, the institute will also offer postgraduate course in science. The move will further strengthen the research output of the institute.” Prof Vandana said the idea behind bringing institutes under NSTRU is to make a mark in global scientific research rankings in which the research strength of all Indian scientific institutions is presented as one and not as individual units. BSIP also released a 20-minute documentary that covered the glorious 75-year journey of the institute, an annual report and a walk-through video of the new building of the institute. Chief guest on the occasion, secretary, SERBDST, Sandeep Verma, spoke about the government’s Science, Technology and Innovation Policy-2020 (STIP-2020). “STIP-2020 will make India technologically self-reliant and catapult India to the league of top three scientific superpowers. It will attract, nurture, strengthen and retain human capital through people-centric science and technology and will build individual and institutional excellence,” said Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsip-to-be-part-of-natl-scienceresearch-univ-offer-pg-course/articleshow/87705187.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||Impose lockdown to assess impact of local sources: BJP||NEW DELHI: Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday demanded a complete lockdown in Delhi for a week with no vehicles to be allowed on roads except for essential services. The party said this will prove to what extent stubble burning is responsible for air pollution in the national capital and what is Delhi’s ‘hand in pollution’. Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other BJP leaders participated in a dharna outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Sunday and blamed the Delhi government for failing to control air pollution. Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday said that the Kejriwal government has taken concrete steps in its fight against air pollution. He said that orders have been issued for shutting of institutions and polluting activities, and these tough decisions were taken in the emergency meeting on pollution chaired by the CM. Bidhuri said that if there is pollution in Delhi due to stubble, then states like Punjab and Haryana should have more pollution than Delhi because the stubble is burning there. He claimed that pollution on Sunday in various cities of Punjab is much less as compared with Delhi.

Railways’ passenger reservation system (PRS), however, will be shut for six hours during lean business hours of the night for the next 7 days, said Central Railway chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. “This is to enable upgradation of system data and updating of new train numbers. Since huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all Mail/Express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours,” added Sutar The timings of system shut down will be from 11.30pm to 5.30am in order to minimise impact on ticketing services. Both Western and Central Railway will revert back to the original train numbers of pre-Covid times.

NMC’s education officer Sunita Dhangar said on Monday, students of Class VIII and above will attend schools, but Classes IX to XII in schools under the education department of the zilla parishad will reopen from November 22 as per the state’s directives. “We have instructed all school principals to ensure students and staff continue to wear masks, maintain social distance and sanitise their hands,” Dhangar said. The civic health department will conduct surprise checks in both NMC and private schools to ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is being followed. “Almost all teaching and non-teaching staff have been vaccinated fully or partially. There are only a few teachers with comorbidities who are not vaccinated,” she said. Dhangar said there are still no clear guidelines from the government for starting physical classes for students of Classes I to VII. Himgauri Aher, the chairperson of the association of private English-medium schools in Nashik, said 35 private English-medium schools will reopen from Monday for students of Clases VIII to XII. “All these schools will ensure appropriate Covid behaviour,” she said. “Schools are keen to start classes from V to VII and the association is in the process of seeking guidelines from the state government on the issue,” she added.

---||Ahmedabad||Prime suspect in Anand Niketan case shifts to Dubai||AHMEDABAD: It has been over a year since students of Anand Niketan School in Satellite and their parents have suffered the nightmare of being targeted by threatening emails and morphed photographs of female classmates. While cops zeroed in on the prime suspect, a 17-year-old student, it is reliably learnt that his family has now moved to Dubai. Top sources in the state police said that after the grilling, where the teen even confessed to his crime, the juvenile shifted to Dubai where he is studying and spending time helping his billionaire father’s business. “After we zeroed in on the boy, a Satellite resident whose father owns event management, crypto-currency and digital wallet businesses, the family moved him from Ahmedabad to Dubai in May. He was first sent to Singapore from where he went to Dubai,” said a city police officer. He added, “The boy’s father confirmed this to police recently, saying his entire family has moved to Dubai. “His father, who keeps making trips to Ahmedabad, also met senior police officers on November 5 and informed them that he will soon sell off his property in the city and settle abroad.” The saga began on September 9, 2020, when the school received the first email, threatening it to cancel the mid-term exams if they did not want nude photographs of female students circulated. The school management cancelled exams for Classes 8 to 12 which had been scheduled for mid-September 2020. They then approached cybercrime police, seeking an inquiry into the issue, which was converted into an FIR on October 3, 2020. On December 6, 2020, the perpetrator sent another email, demanding the cancellation of preliminary exams for Classes 10, 11, and 12. The email was sent at a time when the cybercrime police was struggling to trace the person behind the emails. The perpetrator had used the dark web to commit the crime and the case was one of the most complicated cybercrime cases Ahmedabad police faced till date. Investigators even roped in central and American investigative agencies. On March 31 this year, the perpetrator used a virtual cellphone number to join a school meeting on Zoom and posted links to nude photographs of female students. This move revealed his hand. The cops realized that his real motive was to malign the two girls as one of them had rejected his advances and he blamed the other for influencing her. The cops also found a lead in the web searches on one of the devices they had collected from 120 students. “We used human intelligence to track him as he had been using the dark web, leaving no evidence of the crime,” said a police officer. The cops cannot stop them from shifting as they still do not have solid evidence of the boy’s involvement and no offence has been registered against him so far. Meanwhile, someone hacked into the school’s WhatsApp group in August and posted an indecent image of a student, demanding that the school cancel the Class 12 first term exams. “We found that the first suspect had not sent the message this time. We now have strong suspicions that another student learned the modus operandi of using the dark web and committed this offence,” said a police officer. Cops believe the second juvenile was guided by the prime suspect, who is now in Dubai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/prime-suspect-in-anand-niketan-case-shifts-to-dubai/articleshow/87704001.cms||---

It was inaugurated by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Sunday at the confluence of rivers Gori and Kali in the Jauljibi town of Pithoragarh district. The town is both religiously and historically significant and is located along the Nepal border, which is 64 kilometers away from the Pithoragarh town. It was earlier considered to be the centre of the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage route and has a rich trading history. It was also a point of exchange for Tibetan, Nepalese, and North Indian traders. Although the fair is known to be centuries old, it officially began in 1911 and was organised by the zamindar of Askot. After the Askot principality became a part of the Indian state in 1948, the fair was stopped for a while. However, it was resumed by the Uttar Pradesh government later on. The fair is especially famous for raw wool and warm clothes. The fair will commence on 14 November and culminate on 24 November, said A K Shukla, the sub-divisional magistrate of Pithoragarh. This year, more than 300 shops have been allotted space, he added. Citizens of Nepal are also coming to visit the event. During the inauguration, Dhami said that the fair is part of the state's cultural heritage and also a symbol of friendship between India and Nepal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jauljibi-trade-fair-inaugurated-by-cm-dhami/articleshow/87703997.cms||Prem Punetha

The duo of Dinesh Chandra and Amit Kumar were in remote sync with their solvers stationed outside and were clandestinely wrapping up the answers, when a sudden checking drive busted their crime at the Jankipuram centre. The examination was held by Uttar Pradesh Police Recruitment and Promotion Board (UPRPB) on Saturday. Dinesh, Amit and their aides Saurabh Tiwari and Rahul Rathi were formally arrested on Sunday. Police said, Amit was using a ‘Bluetooth’ device to connect with his solver, who is on the run after he was tipped off about the arrest in the examination hall. “We are trying to find his other associate,” said SHO, Jankipuram, Kuldeep Gaur, who said, Dinesh was caught the other examination hall. “The invigilator seized a miniature mobile phone, which escaped frisking before the examination began,” said the SHO. Later, a police team scanned his phone and found he was in touch via WhatsApp with two solvers, Saurabh and Rahul, who were surfing the Net and passing on the answers. A police team was alerted and the duo was also arrested. Police said, Dinesh was a jawan with the Central armed forces. “The four arrested do not have a criminal history, barring this case,” said Gaur.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Pollution a double whammy for firemen||NEW DELHI: For firefighters, the rising pollution has become an additional burden over and above their occupational hazard. Apart from dealing with hazardous gases while dealing with fires, they have to breathe in toxic air in the open. According to Delhi Fire Service (DFS), firefighters work in the most hostile environment filled with smoke, elevated temperatures, oxygen deficiency and poisonous gases. “This is a matter of deep concern and it causes firefighters health issues. However, the department is not capable of handling the pollution crisis,” said Atul Garg, DFS director. Somvir Singh (48), DFS assistant divisional officer, said their lungs were already compromised due to being regularly involved in firefighting operations. “From day one, we work in an environment filled with smoke and toxic gases, so our lungs are already weak. Pollution affects us like any other person. During fire incidents, a breathing apparatus saves us from smoke for 20-30 minutes. But we don’t have anything to protect ourselves from outdoor pollution,” he added. Amit Rana, a 35-year-old fire operator, said after completing a rescue operation when he spits, his mucus is black due to the toxic smoke. Smoke and pollution will have a severe effect on my body in the future. I have seen the effect on my older colleagues,” he added. The firefighters said they get training on how to release smoke from the body. “There are chances that we may inhale toxic fumes, so we have been trained to release it, but it affects our lungs,” said a firefighter. “We don’t get any special diet to save us from pollution. It all depends on what we can do to keep fit. We eat homemade food,” said another firefighter. Station officer Nitin bought an air purifier for his house after his father’s health started to deteriorate. “My father was a DFS staffer. He also smoked cigarettes. Now, he is being treated for a lung disease. An air purifier is just a temporary way to get fresh air. Smoking toxic gases will affect me when I grow old,” he said. A few years ago, while Nitin was dousing a fire in Malviya Nagar, he inhaled toxic gases and had to be admitted to a hospital due to high blood pressure. At the time of rescue operations, firefighters have to search for a place to get fresh air. “When we enter a structure engulfed in fire, we first search for a place from where we can get fresh air, like a window or an exhaust. We stay there and conduct further rescue operations. However, if the fresh air coming from the window or exhaust is hazardous, then it becomes a cause for concern,” said a fireman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pollution-a-double-whammy-for-firemen/articleshow/87704666.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Huge sim card racket busted in Sabarkantha||AHMEDABAD: If you are not using your simcard or your bank account has been dormant, be warned as cyber crooks may have started using your phone number of bank account for illegal activities such as cheating or digital fraud. City crime branch recently nabbed a 22-year-old man named Vijaysinh Jhala of Aniyol village of Talod taluka of Sabarkantha for allegedly selling simcards illegally. During his questioning, it was revealed that bank accounts, digital wallets, OTT app access credentials were also being sold illegally. These activities are flourishing in rural areas of north Gujarat— mainly Sabarkantha, Aravalli and Banaskantha districts — where gangs steal data from telecom companies or banks using the dark web and use it for illegal activities, said a police officer. Jhala was nabbed on October 9 after police learned that he was about to deliver a couple of simcards to certain person. When the cops caught him and investigated further, they found that the gang for which Jhala worked as a delivery man had around 20,000 simcards. “Such gangs work in layers so they can evade the cops. The kingpin will operate various Telegrams groups using which he offers to sell simcards, bank accounts or digital wallets. If a person shows interest, another set of people will check his credentials and if the person passes their background checks, they will send someone to deliver the simcards,” said a police officer. In the case of digital wallets and bank account, the end user or the customer who buys them illegally will be given the user ID or passwords by gang members in such a way that the end user will not even know their name or identity. Not just the end user or customer, the people working in the second or third layer will also not know who the kingpin is, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/simcards-digital-wallets-bank-accounts-on-sale-illegally/articleshow/87704044.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Just 3,982 such people have been completely vaccinated in the state till November 10. Only 20,042 bedridden and immobile citizens have received the first dose so far in Maharashtra.  The updated data of the public health department till November 10 revealed that nearly 10 districts had registered “no vaccination” under this category. The vaccination of bedridden and immobile people in another 10 districts was in double digits. An official from thestate’s public health department said, “We are aware that the numbers are low, and we plan to scale it up this month through the door-to-door campaign, as we have exact data of such people.”  According to data provided by the public health department, just 10,715 bedridden and immobile people had received the first dose and 464 had received the second dose in the rural areas in the state. In the municipal corporation areas, a total of 9,327 such people had received the first dose and 3,518 had got their second dose. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation topped the list with 4,215 people having received the first dose and 3,057 getting the second shot. The central government in September had announced “vaccination at home” for the disabled, in line with Covid-19 SOPs. This came a month after the Maharashtra government launched its pilot project for door-to-door vaccination for bedridden and immobile people in Mumbai. Activists have claimed that the demand for home vaccination was not catered to despite the central government’s announcement. The state government and the Mumbai civic body had told the Bombay high court that they would start door-to-door vaccination for bedridden and immobile people in the state capital as a pilot project from August 1. The court had then received nearly 3,505 responses in Mumbai from bedridden or immobile people. Completely bedridden, immobile or people suffering from some terminal illness were supposed to be eligible for home vaccination. A senior citizen whose wife is bedridden said he did not get the desired response from the immunization officials despite repeatedly sending mails and even calling them up. He said the officials claimed that they were busy at the vaccination sites. “We are hoping that the government’s new phase of door-to-door vaccination to check on unvaccinated people would help cover this population,” said the senior citizen, hoping for some positive impact of the “Har Ghar Dastak” campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/immunisation-of-bedridden-immobile-people-dismal-in-maharashtra/articleshow/87704683.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||BJP city unit protests against state govt, demands free ration to 10L poor people||Nagpur: The local BJP unit on Monday staged a protest rally against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over various issues, the main being alleged denial of foodgrains to specific ration card holders. Led by city BJP chief Pravin Datke and general secretary Chandrashekhar Bawankule, the rally started from Yashwant Stadium and moved to Samvidhan Square before culminating at the collector’s office where the BJP netas handed over a representation to collector Vimala R. On Friday, the BJP unit had staged demonstrations against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led government for failure to reduce Value Added Tax (VAT) on the fuel prices, at Variety Square. According to BJP netas, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government had provided free ration to crores of people throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the ration card by the state government was not of much use and has become a mere identity card as no help was received by people. Warning the MVA government of intensifying their agitation during the forthcoming assembly session, the BJP unit demanded distribution of free ration to about 10 lakh poor people who are struggling after losing their sources of their income during the pandemic. Flaying the three-party coalition for steep hike in Gunthewari charges from Rs 56/sq ft to Rs 168, the BJP unit termed it as “anti-people’s move” and demanded that October 18 government resolution (GR) in this regard be withdrawn. According to BJP netas, about five lakh residents living on the Gunthewari land would be affected by this “draconian decision which was taken without discussing with the public representatives”. Raising the issue of no rebate in power bills during the Covid-19 pandemic “as promised by state energy minister Nitin Raut”, the BJP office-bearers accused the government of being allegedly involved in large-scale corruption. Several prominent BJP netas participated in Monday’s protests, including MLAs Krishna Khopde, Vikas Kumbhare and Mohan Mate, MLC Girish Vyas, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, former MLC Anil Sole, former MLA Milind Mane, spokesperson Archana Dehankar, state vice-president Sanjay Bhende, Deven Dasture and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-city-unit-protests-against-state-govt-demands-free-ration-to-10l-poor-people/articleshow/87723182.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Activists said their request letter was not accepted by the offices of the CM and the environment minister. They said that their letters have not received any response from other officials including the BMC. “Six hundred and seventy Mumbaikars seeking scrapping of cycle tracks through Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Powai Lake and around Vihar Lake were not accepted by CM’s, environment minister’s and principal secretary’s office. Youth activists ran a signature campaign through the month of October and galvanised support of over 670 citizens. In addition to scrapping the cycle track, the letter states clear-cut points of contentions and suggestions to better the cycle track project,” said Nishant Bangera of Muse Foundation. “The periphery of the Powai Lake, Vihar Lake and SGNP are all contiguous to each other and hence form a very important wildlife habitat,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cmo-cold-to-letter-by-670-against-powai-cycle-track/articleshow/87705756.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The cops found the bodies on Saturday evening. The cops said that the couple, Rakesh Datania and Gungun Datania, were residents of Shahpur and had committed suicide. The couple were in despair because they feared that their families would not allow them to live together, the cops said. On the other hand, their families say that they were willing to get them married and had begun talking about their wedding after they went missing on November 10. A police officer said, “Rakesh and Gungun were in a relationship for about a year but their families were unaware of that.” The officer added: “When they did reveal their relationship to their families, they encountered some resistance. The families apparently sought time to think about it.” But the couple did not accept their families’ approach and decided to flee from their homes. “They might have feared that their family members would punish them and they would be defamed in society,” said the officer. “So they jumped into the river and committed suicide.” Preliminary investigation suggests that the couple may have died about three days before their bodies were discovered. “They left their house on November 10 and on the same day they may have committed suicide by jumping into the river,” said the officer. He said that their family members tried to contact them, but their cellphones had been switched off. “Their family members told us that they were planning to arrange their marriage soon and were trying to find them,” said the cop. Police have registered a case of accidental death and have begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wedding-in-air-couple-die-in-water-not-believing-kin/articleshow/87704049.cms||---

He also exhorted the party to create more active members in each constituency. The senior Congressman said that Goa’s unique identity and culture is under threat from BJP’s misguided notion of one nation, one religion, one language and one food habit. “Goa has a problem of jobs. Unemployment affects every family,” Chidambaram said. “Congress knows how to create jobs. Our manifesto will detail Congress’ job creation plan. We will stop the current tendency of 40,000 to 50,000 talent migrating out of the state.” He also said that Goa’s law and order situation has broken down over the last three or four years and women are afraid of stepping out of their homes in the evening. “We will ensure that women’s safety and security achieves top priority.” Acknowledging the concerns about coal transportation and cutting of trees in the Mollem Wildlife Sanctuary, Chidambaram said that if Congress forms the next government, it will review the linear projects and if necessary scrapthem. Addressing party workers in Ponda, Bicholim and Panaji, he also attempted to address the concerns about BJP MLAs being inducted into the party ahead of the elections. “We are putting the responsibility on to you, the block workers, to select the candidate. You may suggest one, two or three names and AICC will select one. Once the candidate is selected, all of you must work solidly for the candidate,” Chidambaram said. He said that each block must chose candidates based on loyalty, integrity, acceptability to the workers and winability. Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Rao accused BJP of rewriting history to demolish the legacy of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Rao said that Goans should not forget Nehru’s contributions to Goa right from Liberation. Meanwhile, social activist from Pernem, advocate Jitendra Gaonkar joined Congress on Sunday. Gaonkar was a Goa Forward Party member and was projected as its candidate for the Pernem seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-manifesto-will-focus-on-jobs-womens-safety/articleshow/87705229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The designated staff said that judicious use of the vaccine by them has resulted in rare wastage and boosted vaccinations. JS Ghodake, vaccination in-charge at the hospital, told TOI, “We have recorded wastage of around 145 doses at our site. Most of it occurred in the first two months, when Covaxin was available only in the 20-dose vial. Now, this the vial is available in 20-dose, 10-dose, and 5-dose options.” She added that this option of multiple sizes of the Covaxin vial also helped supply maximum doses to the eligible population. “Since the District Hospital Aundh also offers different specialities, patients for other ailments are often accompanied by their relatives or family members. We made sure that whenever excess doses were available, such patients’ kin got vaccinated with proper counselling and awareness. In some cases, we asked our staff members’ friends and families to get vaccinated to avoid any wastage,” said the official, adding that in the early part of the vaccination drive, the centre was always crowded with eligible beneficiaries, especially the 45-plus population. Ghodake explained that they usually use a 10-dose vial at the beginning of the day’s vaccination, when there is a slight rush of beneficiaries; conversely, for the last session of the day, a 5-dose vial is used to reduce chances of wastage. Meanwhile, on Sunday, a total of 10,261 beneficiaries got vaccinated across 231 government and private vaccination sites across Pune district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dists-dedicated-covaxin-site-administers-over-73000-shots/articleshow/87704688.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SoBo firm’s ex-staffer nabbed for ‘data theft’ to divert orders to rival||Mumbai: On March 3 last year, Lamington Road-based electronics businessman Rushab Shah was taken aback when a trusted employee of 11 years, in charge of sales and business development, decided to quit. A few weeks later, the mystery behind the hasty resignation began to “unravel”. Shah alleged that hundreds of crores worth of orders for electronic components for which his company, Madhu Subtronics Components, was in an advanced stage of negotiations had been surreptitiously diverted to another. “I was completely crushed to discover that the company which was getting the purchase orders belonged to a relative of my employee who had quit in haste,” Shah said. Late last month, Mumbai south region cyber police arrested the former employee, Pratik Lakhani (34), and his relative, Kumar Pal Shah, under the IPC for allegedly stealing data and cheating and under the Information Technology Act. Both are out on bail. According to the FIR, Lakhani stole data from his employer’s company and facilitated his relative’s firm to get a Rs 256 crore order for dust sensors. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda, who appeared for Lakhani for his bail before the Girgaum metropolitan magistrate argued, “The alleged amount of loss of Rs 256 crore is completely imaginary. The actual work order was only for Rs 2.05 lakh, not even Rs 2 crore.” He also contended that as far as the IPC offence of breach of trust is concerned, the money allegedly went to a company where no one was arrested. Ponda further argued it was a fit case for release. He submitted that according to a Bombay high court judgement, police cannot investigate offences under the IPC in a cyber crime case where the offences are bailable. In the FIR, the complainant, Madhu Subtronics Components, said it suspected someone was leaking internal information and confidential mails to rival companies . It called for an internal investigation and allegedly realised its own employee was leaking the information. The company approached the cyber police, who registered an offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust. Lakhani’s alleged role was exposed after the police arrested Shah in August.“During investigation, it transpired that since several years, Lakhani had allegedly accessed the emails, deals and other private business details and passed it on to his relative’s company,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobo-firms-ex-staffer-nabbed-for-data-theft-to-divert-orders-to-rival/articleshow/87705761.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Second vaccine shots 5-fold of first doses||AHMEDABAD: With the rise in Covid cases, the focus is sharply back on the vaccination for the pandemic – out of total eligible population of 4.93 crore in Gujarat, 91 per cent (4.5 crore) have received at least one dose, whereas 59 per cent (2.92 crore) have got both the doses. However, analysis of the vaccination figures reveal a gap between cities and districts – out of eight municipal corporation areas, six have achieved 100 per cent coverage of first dose, whereas among 33 districts, only four have achieved the feat. Moreover, only five districts or cities have recorded over 70 per cent coverage of second dose. Senior state health department officials said that the compliance of the second dose was higher than that for the first. In the past 30 days, the coverage of first dose increased from 89 per cent to 91 per cent, a rise of 2 per cent, whereas in the same period, the second dose coverage increased from 46 per cent to 59 per cent, a rise of 13 per cent. Analysis of the statistics available on CoWIN portal reveals that in the past one month, Gujarat administered 13 lakh first doses of vaccine against 69 lakh second doses – indicating five times more vaccination for the second dose. The latest notification by the state health department instructed all the municipal commissioners and collectors to carry out micro-planning to ensure the maximum coverage of Covid vaccination. The health department has also roped in private practitioners to dispel myths around the vaccination effects. Among the least covered districts, Botad has only 68 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated for first dose, and Amreli and Patan with 73 per cent against state average of 91 per cent. Among the districts with least coverage of second dose, Dang have 33 per cent coverage, followed by 40 per cent in Gir Somnath and 42 per cent in Morbi against state average of 59 per cent. “The carrot and stick approach may be adopted with restrictions on availing the government-run facilities as initiated by some cities and districts, or preference to the vaccinated for some initiatives. However, we request the citizens to ensure that they take vaccination at designated time even as door-to-door campaign would be initiated in the worst-affected districts,” said a senior health department official, adding that there is no shortage of vaccines in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2nd-vax-shots-5-fold-of-first-doses/articleshow/87704084.cms||Parth Shastri

It was recorded at 20.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday by the IMD’s Shivajinagar observatory and 21.6 degrees Celsius by the Lohegaon observatory. Met officials said they expect light rain with cloudy conditions in the city over the next four days. “The moisture incursion is taking place over the state due to presence of low-pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu as well as the presence of trough line from Tamil Nadu to the north coastal area of Odisha. There is another low-pressure area present over the South Andaman sea. Because of these conditions, several areas of the state, including Pune, are expected to receive light to very light rainfall for the next few days,” said a senior met official from the IMD. From Monday onwards, the city will experience cloudy conditions in the afternoon. It will also receive spells of light rainfall (2.5mm to 15.4mm) for the next few days, said the met official. “At isolated places, there is a chance of moderate rainfall in the district. At the same time, the chill factor that the city had experienced in the last few days due to northerly wind will go away completely. The city’s night temperature is likely to increase and it will go above normal by two to three degrees Celsius till November 20,” the official added. On Sunday, the weather conditions had changed completely. It was cloudy in the afternoon hours. The Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories recorded night temperatures 20.2 degrees C and 21.6 degrees C, which was above normal by 5.5 degrees C and 6.6 degrees C, respectively.

---||Delhi||20 years on, Kishanganj underpass now has yet another deadline - January 31||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has fixed a new deadline for the Kishanganj underpass — January 31. The project was conceived over 20 years ago by the unified MCD while work at the site started in 2008-09. So far, only one of the four underpass sections has been completed and opened for traffic. A senior north corporation official informed that Northern Railway has completed work on the three concrete box sections under the railway line and now the civic agency has to complete the pending work. “This included constructing six 150m long approach roads — three on each end of the underpass boxes, construction of retaining wall and two sump wells at the end to ensure no waterlogging happens below the underpass,” said the official. On October 26, local councillor and former mayor Jai Prakash inaugurated the road construction work at the site. “The corporation is presently removing the debris and simultaneously started work on levelling the connecting roads with machines,” said Jai Prakash. The underpass would link central Delhi with west Delhi and benefit the areas of Inderlok, Gulabi Bagh, Sarai Rohilla, Kishanganj, Padam Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Tri Nagar, Shanti Nagar and Rampura and nearby areas. The project is also expected to decongest Sadar Bazar, Rohtak Road, areas under Walled City extension and Azad Market, the official said. The project has cost Rs 48 crore to the civic agency and of that, 80% was funded from the Centre’s Urban Development Fund Scheme (UDF). “Of the total amount, we have already paid Rs 31 crore to the railway and now that the remaining fund was sanctioned from the UDF, we immediately issued the work order for the project of constructing approach roads. We are going to complete the site fully by January 31. Before that, by the end of December, we will open two more boxes for the general public. After that, a total of three boxes will be allowed for traffic movement,” said the official. North corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said that some horticulture work will also be done at the site to ensure the area looks green and beautiful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-years-on-kishanganj-underpass-now-has-yet-another-deadline-jan-31/articleshow/87704689.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Traffic cops swamped with 8,200 wrong challan plaints||PUNE: Last week, the Khadak police registered a cheating case against a scooter rider, who had tampered with his two-wheeler’s registration number plate to evade action for any traffic rule violation that is caught on the CCTV cameras on the streets. Altering the registration numbers (by adding or deleting a number) is one of the key reasons behind the wrongful issuance of challans and is causing inconvenience to other motorists and the police alike. From January 1 to October 31, the city traffic police issued 17.78 lakh challans to vehicle owners captured in the CCTVs while violating traffic norms. During the same period, the traffic police received 8,200 complaints from vehicle owners about having been wrongly challaned. The traffic police use 1,200 CCTV cameras installed on various roads and junctions to catch traffic-rule offenders. These cameras provide a live feed to the traffic police and a team of traffic police keeps an eye on the screens. As soon as anyone breaks any traffic rules, the traffic police take a screenshot. The image is studied and the registration number of the vehicle is taken down. The system is connected to online software. The image and other details of the area where the traffic offence has taken place and time is filled in the online form. The system then generates an online challan. If a mobile number is linked with the registration number of the vehicle, challan link is messaged to the vehicle owner and if the phone is not linked, the fine is collected if traffic police spot the vehicle on roads and examine the registration number using the software on a hand-held portable device. “To escape action, many motorists alter the registration number of their vehicles by using different tricks. Apart from such tampering, that number plates that are damaged/worn out over the years, use of fancy number plates, typographical errors and other reasons are also behind the issuance of wrong challans,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said. A person who received a traffic challan said the offence showed that he was being fined for not wearing a helmet whereas the photograph sent shows him wearing one but parked on the zebra crossing. Others too complained that the offence did not match the photographic evidence presented to them .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traffic-cops-swamped-with-8200-wrong-challan-plaints/articleshow/87705243.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The ZP officials said they have micro-planned the vaccination drive. “Some villages have already shared a list of those who have not yet been vaccinated. We will vaccinate them on priority,” Tidke said. So far, 275 villages of a total of 1,835 villages in the district have achieved 100% vaccination coverage. “Many villages have achieved over 80 -90 % vaccination in the district,” Tidke said. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the ZP, said the district has a floating or migratory population of about seven lakh and most of these people left during the lockdown. “We could not trace them when we tried to track them for the vaccination drive. As a result, the number of non-vaccinated people over 4.94 lakh,” Prasad added. He also said that some villagers, particularly in tribal parts of some talukas, are reluctant to get vaccinated due to lack of awareness. “We have roped in local leaders and people to create awareness among them and hope to complete vaccination in these villages in the coming days,” he added. The zilla parishad has over 275 vaccination centres across the district. It has also launched a special vaccination drive for the bedridden, pregnant, and disabled people to expedite the drive, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-5-lakh-yet-to-get-first-shot-of-vaccine-in-rural-pune/articleshow/87704695.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Ahmedabad||Diwali over, Ahmedabad cops get tough on mask violation cases||AHMEDABAD: The city police was lenient towards the mask rule during the Diwali and New Year festivals, but with Covid-19 cases on the rise, cops have swung into action and intensified their drive to catch the mask offenders. This is apparent with the figures of mask violation cases shooting from 65 offences on the New Year Day on November 5, to 345 on Sunday which is more than five times high. There was also a surge of Covid cases in the city from 20 cases on November 5 to 37 on Saturday. “On New Year Day, we spread awareness about wearing of mask and did not go strict so only 65 cases were registered. On the day of Bhai Beej, we also showed a bit lenient approach and fined only 81 persons, who were caught roaming without mask,” said a police officer. The officer said that the cops intensified their drive from November 7 after which the mask cases were registered in three digits. The figures of mask offences show that there is tendency amongst cops not to book people during the time of festivals and also ahead of polls. According to the figures of the city police, they had on February 21 booked only four people when the civic body polls were held. This is the lowest figure so far since the mask offences were introduced from June 24, 2020. After that, the city reported a surge in the Covid cases and deaths in March and April. Apart from the polls, the mask offences declined during the Rath Yatra festival also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diwali-over-cops-get-tough-on-mask-violation-cases/articleshow/87704112.cms||---
---||Delhi||Use public transport, walk or cycle at least one day each month: Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: With the capital battling severe air pollution, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said that every Delhiite should use public transport, walk or cycle at least one day every month. The Delhi government's Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) organised a one-day “Neighbourhood Raahgiri” programme on the theme “Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virrudh” to spread awareness about pollution, in association with Raahgiri Found.ation, at the Patparganj assembly constituency. The event took place on a stretch of road that was opened to the public with no vehicular traffic. “We can lay the foundation of a healthy Delhi by reducing our share of pollution by taking small steps like turning off the engine at traffic signals and switching to public transport,” Sisodia said during the event, while stressing on the need to work at three levels. “First, it is the responsibility of the government to make rules and regulations for the prevention of pollution, make strict systems to facilitate enforcement, conduct awareness campaigns and take action against those who violate them. The Delhi government is working on these key areas,” he said, adding that the government has prepared a bio-decomposer in collaboration with the PUSA Institute and sprayed it for free in the agricultural fields. He said this has ensured that stubble is not burnt in Delhi and is, instead, used as manure. He said that industry should move towards the latest sources of renewable energy to reduce its share of pollution and construction stakeholders should pitch in through measures like installing smog guns at major construction sites and sprinkling water continuously. “Third, I appeal to the people that the citizens of Delhi need to come together to fight this ‘Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virrudh’. It is our collective duty to come forward and reduce pollution at an individual and community level,” he said. “The purpose of organising programmes like Rahagiri is to make common people aware of such issues. The aim of these events is to give people a chance to experience a road without cars and bring about a change in behaviour,” DDV vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah said, adding that this gives people an opportunity to reimagine their streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-public-transport-walk-or-cycle-at-least-one-day-each-month-sisodia/articleshow/87704700.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cheating FIR filed against fitness firm, Shilpa Shetty, Raj Kundra||MUMBAI: A Pune businessman has filed a police complaint against the owner of SFL Fitness Pvt Ltd and four others, including Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty and her husband, Raj Kundra, for duping him of Rs 1.59 crore after luring him with the offer of opening a franchise of the fitness centre in Pune. Nitin Barai (59) filed the complaint on Saturday, almost seven years after the deal was signed, after realising that the party with whom he had signed the agreement had duped him and failed to return the money he had invested to get the franchise. Barai’s son, Yash (25), alleged they were threatened when they demanded their money back. The police said the contract agreement was signed in 2014. The police registered the FIR against director of SFL Fitness Kashiff Khan, Shilpa Shetty, Raj Kundra, Darshit Shah and a few others who were witnesses in the contract signed in 2014. A case under the IIPC sections 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) was registered. Shilpa Shetty tweeted: “Woke up to an FIR registered in Raj and my Name! To set the record straight. SFL Fitness. A venture run by Kashiff Khan. He had taken naming rights of brand SFL to open SFL Fitness Gyms around the country. All deals were struck by him and he was a signatory in banking and day to day affairs. We are not aware of any of his transactions nor have we received a single rupee from him for the same. All franchisee’s dealt directly with Kashiff. The company closed in 2014 and was entirely handled by Kashiff Khan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cheating-fir-filed-against-fitness-co-shilpa-shetty-raj/articleshow/87705781.cms||---
---||Pune||Hotels, wedding venues booked for next 3 months in Pune||PUNE: Hotels, banquets and marriage halls in the city are fully booked for the next three months as those who had postponed their weddings last year owing to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions are holding their nuptial celebrations this year. Amit Badula, director of events, Conrad Pune, said, “In 220, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many restrictions had been imposed by the government and a lot of guests did not want to go ahead with celebrations in such conditions. But now all these guests have booked the property for their events in the second half of 2021. Hence, there is surplus demand in the wedding segment for hospitality industry.” Gauri Kanitkar, CEO, Anuroop Wiwaha Sanstha, is looking forward to recovering the financial losses of 2020 from this year’s wedding season. “The mood for celebration is back among clients, who are ready to go all out for weddings like they used to before the pandemic. Though they are spending less on catering as guest lists have to be restricted to 50% of capacity of the wedding venue, they spend more on decoration, entertainment,” she said. Rounak Sethi, founder, wedding event management company, said, “Business recovery is at 70-80 per cent as of now. Until the pandemic is completely over, and there are no restrictions on the number of guests allowed, there will not be 100 per cent recovery of business.” Rashmi Shah, co-founder of a catering business, said, “With fewer number of guests allowed, the total income from a wedding event is less by 50 per cent. But clients are willing to have elaborate spreads, and don’t mind the increase in rates per plate/person. Last year, though weddings were organised with 20-50 guests, clients preferred per-plate buffets and did not opt for stalls and live stations for chaat, pasta, and so on. This year there has been a rise in clients requesting for such stalls and live stations, while ensuring that we take all safety precautions “ Mudassir Shaikh, who runs a sound system rental, said that business has not picked up much for him. “Even with the relaxations in restrictions, people don’t want to attract too much attention to their celebrations. We hardly have bookings now but hope for business to pick up in December.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hotels-wedding-venues-booked-for-next-3-months/articleshow/87705266.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

This will ensure proper spacing of flights. Also, the number of late night and red eye flights have always been more in Pune compared to daytime movements. With the airport operational round-the-clock, there will be more new flights starting, too,” Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke told TOI. He added, “We are hopeful that passenger traffic will reach pre-pandemic levels by next month and attempts are being made to ensure this.” At present, the airport has been witnessing daily average passenger traffic of 17,000-19,000 passengers per day as well. During pre-pandemic times, his same figure stood at 25,000-30,000. “The daily passenger traffic is still 35% short of 2019 levels. But the all-day operations will change this. Total flight movements today are 124-130 on most days, which stood at around 170 in 2019. By March next year, we expect to see the daily flight movements touching pre-pandemic levels. However, things could go back to square one if the third wave hits,” another airport official pointed out. With the new Jet Airways expected to begin operations from the first quarter of next year, airport officials said they expect to see its presence in Pune, too. “Jet Airways had the most slots in addition to an international flight to Singapore before it closed down here. We see no reason as to why it will not resume flights from Pune once operations begin,” the official said. At the moment, chaos and crowding have taken centre stage at the airport, leaving flyers feeling hassled. A meeting of the Pune airport advisory committee will take place on November 24 to address these issues, Pune Member of Parliament (MP) and advisory committee chairman Girish Bapat told TOI. “The meeting will see detailed discussions with all stakeholders on different issues, including crowding. The minutes of the meeting will be prepared,” Bapat said. Sudhir Mehta, president of Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), said they had written a letter to the PM and Maharashtra CM earlier. “The letters highlight the urgency of the civil aviation needs for Pune and neighboring districts to follow up on Pune airport’s expansion and expediting the process,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airports-per-day-footfalls-may-hit-2019-levels-by-dec/articleshow/87704126.cms||Joy Sengupta

The fee has been increased from Rs 60 to Rs 150 for general category and the parents said that while the scholarship amount has remained the same, the exam fee was increased by the education department. Yuvasena, a students’ organisation, has demanded that the hike be rolled back and has written to the education department on Friday. Joint Secretary of Yuvasena, Kalpesh Yadav, said, “The scholarship amount given to the students is petty. The students do not get much of a benefit with this small amount. The government should rather think about increasing the scholarship amount so that the students are motivated.” Yadav said, “For the past many years the scholarship amount has remained as it is. The education department has already sent a proposal to the state government about the increase in scholarship amount however no decision on the same has been made so fat.” According to the current scheme, the students appearing for middle school scholarship will et Rs 250 to Rs 1,000 annually in standards VI, VII and VIII where as the high school scholarship students would get Rs 300 to Rs 1,500 annually for standards IX and X. Yadav said that the scholarship scheme has to motivate the students, but the amount is so petty that the student do not benefit. Director of education, Dinkar Temkar, said, “The proposal to hike the scholarship amount is with the state government. But the decision on the entry and exam fee is of the exam council and with the changing time and pattern of exam it needs to e increased .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-hikes-entry-exam-fees-for-scholarship-test/articleshow/87704132.cms||---

The aspiring IAS, IPS and state government officers will be trained under this initiative for a year. The civic body will spend around Rs17,000 per student as part of the initiative. As many as 150 hopefuls of UPSC and MPSC exams would be admitted in this course, which is to be conducted in association with the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). A proposal regarding the same was recently approved by the PMC’s standing committee. “It was a long pending demand from the students and training staff to start such a course. The SPPU has supported the move and has agreed to provide the educational expertise for the training,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee. As per the proposal, 100 students from the reserved category and 50 students from open category will get admission in the course. An entrance exam for the same would be conducted and the sucessful students would get admission. The civic officials said that the initiative would be coordinated by the urban community development (social welfare) department of PMC. “The educational expense of the students will be borne by the PMC. The initiative aims at increasing the participation of students from financially weaker sections in competative exams. Family income and other factors such as score in the entrance exam would be considered for giving admissions,” said a senior PMC official. He said the training would include preparation for prelims and mains exams. Interview skills and group discussion skills would be taught. Mock tests and interviews would be conducted.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 15,000 flats to be on offer in DDA’s new scheme next month||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is all set to launch a new housing scheme next month and on offer would be around 15,000 flats, sources said. The proposal to launch the housing scheme would be brought before the authority at its meeting, expected to be chaired by LG Anil Baijal this week. DDA launched a housing scheme earlier this year and the flats that it plans to offer in December would be the ones that were surrendered during its previous housing schemes. Sources said that flats are available in locations like Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Jasola and Narela, but a bulk of them would be one-bedroom flats or those for economically weaker sections. The flats would include those that were surrendered in previous schemes in 2019 and 2014, apart from the 2021 scheme. There are a large number of DDA flats that are in different stages of construction, including premium three-bedroom flats and penthouses in Dwarka, but these would not be offered in the upcoming scheme. Sources said that DDA wants to offer the upcoming flats only when the real estate sector witnesses better growth in the near future. DDA’s previous housing scheme was launched on January 2, 2021, and saw 22,752 applications for the 1,354 flats on offer. The draw of lots for the scheme was held on March 10 for the 253 mostly three-bedroom flats, 757 two-bedroom flats, 52 one-bedroom flats and 291 EWS/Janta flats in areas like Dwarka, Jasola and Vasant Kunj. Even though DDA had carefully chosen clusters in ‘sought-after’ locations for the housing scheme in January, a large number of the 1,354 flats were returned and put up for draw again. However, the handing over of the most sought after of these all – 348 middle-income group (MIG) in Dwarka’s Sector 16-B costing Rs 1.2 crore each – had got delayed as finishing work on them was still on. While the draw of lots was conducted in March this year, DDA later conducted a smaller draw of lots of applicants who were earlier kept on a wait list. DDA had requested all the wait-listed applicants to deposit a registration amount as per their preferences in the application form of DDA Housing Scheme 2021 by June 30 through the DDA website. Wait-listed applicants who failed to deposit the requisite registration amount were not considered for the mini draw of lots for allotment of flats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/15000-flats-to-be-on-offer-in-ddas-new-scheme-next-month/articleshow/87704713.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||ZP to build central school clubbing 12 smaller ones||PUNE: A central school with classes up to Std VII is being constructed in Panshet which once completed can accommodate students from 12 nearby schools. The students will also be given transport allowance so that their commute is taken care of, Ayush Prasad, CEO of Pune ZP, said. Educators have stressed the need for peer learning in students and its lack in schools with less than 10 students where some classes have just one or two students on the rolls. But, one or two teachers are assigned to these schools and they end up having to teach all subjects to all classes. Many of these schools are only up to the lower primary level and for accessing upper primary education, students have to go to the taluka centre which is often far away, resulting in dropouts especially among girl children. The central school hopes to address all these problems. Kamalakant Mhetre, block education officer of Velhe taluka, said that while the new school is coming up in Panshet, the old schools will keep functioning till all parents decide to send their wards to the centralised school. Ayush Prasad said in schools with less than 5 or 10 students, children don’t experience peer learning due to the few children at the school. There are also complaints about teacher attendance and the timings not being followed at the school. Infrastructure is also limited and also underused. “In a central school, children would benefit through better education standards, peer learning and better infrastructure. They would learn with an exclusive teacher for each class. ZP would benefit from better resource utilisation and would be able to save costs, allowing us to do more with our budget. We have the support of the parents as many students from the villages already travel to private schools and young children also seem to associate travel with ‘good schools’,” he said. Prasad said that if successful, the project will be replicated in other areas, and they are planning another project in Velhe itself. “The school should be constructed within a year. This is supported by the Bajaj Group,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-to-build-central-school-clubbing-12-smaller-ones/articleshow/87704147.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Mumbai||Mere non-recovery of contraband does not entitle one to bail: Mumbai court||MUMBAI: When facts of the case demonstrate prima-facie involvement of accused, mere non-recovery of contraband from accused will not entitle him to bail, said a special NDPS court rejecting a plea for liberty in Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) case. The bail plea was filed by a man booked by the NCB, Mumbai Zonal Unit, for offences, including illicit trafficking and conspiracy under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The NCB case was of a seizure of 56 grams of Mephedrone and cash on July 18, from a chawl in Kurla west where two co-accused were arrested. On their statement, the bail applicant was nabbed from the spot and arrested on July 19. Later, NCB seized 53 grams of Mephedrone along with gold and cash from another accused’s house. The bail applicant’s lawyer Rohit Sawant argued that the NCB falsely implicated his client, especially since no contraband was recovered from him and his arrest was from his residence, not the spot, and merely on a statement of a co-accused. But NCB special public prosecutor Advait Sethna opposed the bail, arguing that it was a case of conspiracy, and given that there was a “close nexus” of accused and co-accused and commercial quantity of drug was seized, the rigours of section 37 kicks in. The section requires the court to grant bail only if satisfied that there is no prima facie case made out. Special NDPS court judge A A Joglekar said the contraband seized from a co accused “is undoubtedly” commercial quantity. The court said that while deciding bail plea, it is required to see if a prima facie case exists and the Supreme Court judgment this year in Sambhav Parakh vs State of Chhattisgarh cited by Sethna squarely applies to the bail plea before it.  The SC had observed that “when commercial quantity of illicit psychotropic substance is recovered from one accused in view of section 29 (conspiracy) of the NDPS Act, such other accused from whom no recovery has been made are also not entitled for bail as they have major link in the entire operation.” “It is not necessary to make a roving enquiry” when deciding a bail plea said the special judge, adding that the record demonstrates connivance of the accused and accused failed to make out a prima facie case for bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mere-non-recovery-of-contraband-does-not-entitle-one-to-bail/articleshow/87705785.cms||---

In these efforts, the municipal corporations have a crucial role to play,” Bharadwaj said. “We came to know that the confederation has told all the three municipal corporations that they will go on a mass strike if the arrears are not given,” he claimed. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, meanwhile, said that municipal employees are facing economic hardship due to excessive delays in their salary payments. However, they also know that withholding of municipal funds by Delhi government is responsible for their hardship, he said. Kapoor said if AAP members are serious towards ensuring timely salary payment of employees they should ask Delhi government to release the “withheld funds” to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore. However, Bharadwaj said, “Delhi government has paid every outstanding rupee to the civic bodies. Despite this, BJP is conspiring to throw Delhi into chaos and defame it. We want to tell all of Delhi that, even in times of such tragedy, BJP is scheming and making multiple plans to create more trouble for Delhiites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/threat-of-civic-staff-stir-looms-due-to-unpaid-salaries-aap/articleshow/87704714.cms||---

The seven-metre-wide road can be used by two- and four-wheelers, officials said. Another road has been proposed from Prayeja City to Nanded City and is aimed at decentralizing the traffic near the bypass on the Sinhagad Road. The link road was recently approved by the standing committee of Pune Municipal Corporation. Work is expected to begin soon. MLA Madhuri Misal recently inspected the Vadgaon Budruk-P L Deshpande link road and directed the officials to expedite the work. Misal said four kilometres of the 4.5km road – aligned along the canal – was ready. She said the remaining work would be finished soon. “I have also told PMC authorities to complete the other infrastructure work along the road – a safety wall, repairs of culverts and bridges, shifting of power utility cables and transformers,” Misal further said. Misal also reviewed other proposals for road infrastructure in the area. She said work on two flyovers on Sinhagad road – at Rajaram bridge and towards the bypass – was expected to begin soon. The facilities will provide through-and-through options for the vehicles and thus eliminate the need to halt at junctions. Umesh Mane, a Dhayari resident, said Sinhagad Road was handling vehicular traffic beyond its capacity. “This causes traffic snarls and chaos. Alternative routes are a must,” he said. Mayank Raje, a regular traveller on Sinhagad Road, said, “The entire stretch from Dandekar bridge to Nanded city has many gaps. There are traffic signals at every junction. Vehicles spend lot of time at every junction. A flyover will be.” Hemant Rasne, standing committee chairman, said Rs 1.76 crore has been sanctioned for the 1.8km Prayeja City-Nanded City road. “It will help decentralize the traffic in the area and prevent congestion,” Rasne said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-works-on-infra-to-ease-traffic-load-on-sinhagad-road/articleshow/87704167.cms||Sarang Dastane

Maliwal said Ranaut had made an outrageous comment recently in a TV show, hurting sentiments of millions by stating that India achieved its freedom in 1947 as a “bheekh”. The DCW chief urged the President to take immediate cognizance of these comments, “which are not only disrespectful but completely disregard and insult the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters.” In her letter, Maliwal said, “Our great freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and countless others laid down their lives for getting freedom to our great nation. Ranaut’s statements have hurt the sentiments of millions of Indians and are seditious in nature.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/take-back-kanganas-padma-for-sedition-maliwal-to-prez/articleshow/87704718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||IIM-Ahmedabad completes 5 years of school connect||AHMEDABAD: The Covid pandemic has far-reaching impacts when it comes to formal educational sector, and the teachers and administrators across the country are waking up to it. While the leadership development programme specially designed for the principals of government-run schools in Delhi completed five years in 2021, this year’s theme – along with infrastructure development, capacity building and student outcomes – remained the ways in which the students can be engaged. Prof Kathan Shukla, a faculty member and one of the coordinators for the programme, said that just declaring the schools open doesn’t bring the students back – it needs a long-term planning and engagement. “The challenge for the educators is to re-connect and re-wire with students post Covid. We are thus focusing on social, emotional and academic climate of the school as the schools are finding newer ways to connect with the community,” he said. He added that there is a sharp focus on the foundational learning with the realization that many students might need to re-visit them to go forward. “We are attempting to gamify the student learning experience through the training and engagement with different stakeholders. Some other topics we have integrated in the course include gender sensitivity, emotional regulation, and positive social interactions,” added Prof Shukla. The programme also intends to address issues such as bullying and teasing within school environs through social and emotional audit and working closely with both students and teachers. The experts at Ravi J Matthai Centre for Educational Innovation said that the interaction has resulted in better passing rates in government-run schools, but to take it to the next level would require grassroots-based educational innovations. School educational climate assessment would be launched soon at these schools, said experts. During Covid, the teachers across India including Gujarat had shared their innovations online with the larger community to emulate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iim-a-completes-5-yrs-of-school-connect/articleshow/87704175.cms||Parth Shastri

The godown, spread over 2,500sq ft area, was made of concrete walls and tin-sheet roof. Senior inspector Arvind Gokule of the Hadapsar police told TOI, “We have identified the deceased as Raju Bhimsen Kale (50) of Sadesatra Nali. He was a wood craftsman and using artificial legs as his lower limbs were amputated.” “A few days ago, the godown’s owner had purchased a lot of wood and mandap decoration articles. We are yet to record the statement of the godown owner,” Gokule said. Vijay Bhilare, fire station duty officer, said, “We controlled the flames and entered the godown premises at 7 am.

---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli: Cornered Milind Teltumbde’s guards held back C60 commandos for several hours, some seniors escaped||NAGPUR: A handful of armed Maoists of lower ranks fought to the death on Saturday, trying in vain to protect Central Committee (CC) member Milind Teltumbde, who carried a Rs50 lakh reward and had over 63 offences against him. Their last stand in the forest of Mardintola in Dhanora subdivision, near Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, also helped some other top cadres escape. Teltumbde, in-charge of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh zone, was among 26 Maoists killed. Among the dead, six were women including Vimla alias Imla, who was Teltumbde’s bodyguard. Another of his bodyguards, Bhagatsingh, too was found dead. Intermittent firing, including unprecedented heavy firing from either side at times, went on for almost 10 hours, it’s learnt. Four C60 jawans were injured in the encounter, now their condition is learnt to be stable. On Sunday, SP Ankit Goyal confirmed the death of Teltumbde after he was identified as per the police Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) by a surrendered Maoist at police headquarters. “We have informed Teltumbde’s wife (Angela Sontakey) about his death, but she is yet to reach to take the body,” said Goyal. Some 29 weapons, including five AK-47s, one AKM with under-barrel grenade launcher, three Insas rifles, and one pistol were seized from the encounter site by C60 commandos. Substantial explosives and materials of daily use were also seized. Also, on Sunday, Chhattisgarh police launched an operation on their side of the border in the region. Sources from the district police said top cadres like divisional committee member Sukhpal Parcheki and Dandakaranya special zonal committee member Prabhakar too were probably present at the encounter site, but managed to sneak away amid heavy firing. Teltumbde, who had survived several encounters narrowly, ran out of luck this time and was cornered. Sources said C60 parties, which started the operation a day ago, had encircled the hillock and forested region in multiple layers, and laid ambushes plugging exit routes. While the hilly and rocky terrain of the forested stretch helped top leaders and cadres flee despite raining bullets, Teltumbde got trapped on the hillock. Sources said the C60 commandos were initially stunned by the unfamiliar style of heavy firing from the Maoists, who are known to be extremely frugal with ammunition. “The experienced C-60 commandos sensed something different in the volume of firing, and realized the rebels seemed to be protecting someone very important. Forces had no information of Teltumbde’s presence, but the manner in which the Maoists were aggressively firing made it a possibility,” said a source. The C-60 commandos were led by Additional SP, Operations, Somay Munde, said SP Ankit Goyal, praising the efforts of the young IPS officer. Sources further said Teltumbde was protected by a group of young cadres from Chhattisgarh, who are yet to be identified. “Though they knew their end was near, the group fought till the last breath to protect Teltumbde. Almost 80-90% of the neutralized Maoists laid down their lives for Teltumbde instead of fleeing,” said the source. He added the small group kept the C60 commandos guessing for long about their next move. “Even after firing reduced from the Maoists side, and eventually their guns fell silent, the C60 commandos had to be very cautious,” said the source. Kasansoor commander Sunnu (reward Rs8 lakh), divisional committee member Mahesh Gota (Rs16 reward on his head), DVC and company four commander Lokesh (reward Rs20 lakh) and Korchi dalam commander Kisan (reward Rs8 lakh) were among the other key cadres neutralized. The bodies and materials seized from the slain Maoists were ferried to Kotgul by C60 jawans on foot, walking through the forest for almost 10km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cornered-teltumbdes-guards-held-back-c60-commandos-for-several-hours-some-seniors-escaped/articleshow/87704720.cms||Soumitra Bose

It has put a question mark on the state’s ambitious plan to vaccinate all eligible population with a single shot in the next two weeks. Despite the start of the Har Ghar Dastak campaign, there has only been a slight uptick in daily immunisation numbers. Only 13.88 lakh jabs were administered during October 30 to November 5, followed by 27.2 lakh during November 6-12 -- both figures being the lowest in at least the last 11 weeks. The end of festivities pushed up daily vaccination in the last week, but the numbers have been lower than the weekly jabs administered during the August-September period, the data showed. Compared to October when there were 1.5 crore vaccinations, this month has seen barely 44.32 lakh administered in the first fortnight. Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer, said the door-to-door campaign was picking steam in districts and vaccination numbers have started to rise. “Daily average vaccinations have been in the range of 4.5-5 lakh doses during the last two-three weeks. However, it touched 7 lakh on Saturday and will increase further from Monday,” he said, adding that the aim was to touch 10 lakh doses every day through the door-to-door campaign. Maharashtra has an adult population of 9.14 crore, of which 6.91 crore (76%) have taken at least one dose, while 3.34 crore (38%) have taken both shots. Desai said the 2.2 crore people who haven’t taken their first shots will be covered if 10-12 lakh doses can be administered every day in the next fortnight. Besides the first dose, nearly 75 lakh beneficiaries are due for the second dose too. In Mumbai, vaccination picked up significantly after the Diwali weekend as the city recorded 1-1.2 lakh vaccinations daily last week. A civic official said that nearly 70% of the doses administered now are second doses. While Mumbai has statistically achieved 100% first dose coverage, almost 30% vaccinations are still first doses. The official said that with train travel and access to most places tied to vaccination, few would want to remain unvaccinated. After Mumbai, Pune (95%), Bhandara (92.3%) and Sindhudurg (91%) are closer to hitting the 100% single dose coverage mark. However, the slowdown has officials worried. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the number of sessions conducted by private hospitals has dropped further. “The number of private hospitals conducting daily vaccination sessions is falling significantly. It was 210 at one point, which has now come down to an average of 150,” he said. A Pune Municipal Corporation official said that with less than 10 beneficiaries turning up at private sites, many do not create sessions on certain days. If the vial contains doses for 10 people and only four turn up, six doses can go waste. Data shows that several small districts in Maharashtra with a population of less than a million are far from achieving maximum single dose coverage. Sindhudurg, which has a population of merely 5.8 lakh, has given the first dose to 91%. Among other smaller districts with less than 100% single shot coverage are Washim (63%), Hingoli (60%), Wardha (80%) and Gadchiroli (66%). All these districts have a population of less than a million each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtras-weekly-vax-count-drops-to-three-month-low/articleshow/87706649.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||Driverless operations on Delhi Metro's Pink Line all set to begin by end of this year||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is likely to start “driverless” train operations on its longest corridor—Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar)—by the end of this year. With the addition of Pink Line, DMRC’s driverless network, which currently includes the 37-km-long Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West), would become part of the world’s longest automated Metro networks. According to sources, DMRC has completed signalling work and the commissioner of metro rail safety (CMRS) will inspect the corridor for unattended train operations (UTO) this week. Driverless operations in the UTO mode will be possible after a safety go-ahead from the CMRS and it is expected that it will begin by the end of this year. DMRC took a huge technological leap on December 28 last year when Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the country’s first ever fully automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line. It was expected that driverless operations would also begin on the 58.4-km-long Pink Line in a few months. However, unlike the Magenta Line, the Pink Line operated as two different sections till recently due to a ‘missing link’ at Trilokpuri where DMRC had been unable to construct a viaduct. The missing link was bridged in August this year and uninterrupted train movement on the entire corridor could finally begin. DMRC has been integrating this section with the rest of the corridor’s state-of-the-art signalling system, which allows automated driverless operations. When driverless train operations begin on the Pink Line, the total driverless network of DMRC would stand at nearly 96 km, which would be 9% of the world’s total driverless Metro network, according to DMRC. The driverless network would further cross the 100 km mark when the 12.5-km-long Maujpur-Majlis Park extension of the corridor, which is being constructed as part of Delhi Metro’s Phase IV project, gets completed by 2023. Thanks to the state-of-the-art Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling technology, driverless train operations are possible in both the Magenta and Pink Lines. Compared with the technology used in older Metro corridors, CBTC allows more efficient and safe train operations. Driverless operations have been made possible due to changes in the existing General Rules for running trains that take into account the presence of a driver and the guidelines of handling any emergency involving the presence of a driver. The Metro Railway General Rules 2020, however, takes into account driverless operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/driverless-operations-on-pink-line-all-set-to-begin-by-end-of-this-year/articleshow/87704745.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Trichy||Value addition centre lures more farmers to millet cultivation, away from GM crops||Trichy: Understanding the risks associated with the cultivation of expensive genetically modified cotton and maize crops, rainfed farmers in Perambalur district are increasingly turning towards less expensive millet cultivation. The change was possible after the state development policy council (SDPC) funded a millet development project in an administrative block of the district by establishing a value addition centre to market the produce. Now the number of farmers taking up millet cultivation has surged by about 80%. Though regarded as a traditional millet production belt, Veppur in Perambalur had extensively cultivated cotton and maize in the past few decades. Even as heavy usage of pesticides was making the cultivation expensive, adverse weather and crop loss added to the farmers’ woes. It was in this backdrop that a Chennai-based NGO called Barefoot Academy of Governance encouraged a section of farmers to take up millet cultivation. It broached the idea after conducting a study in Veppur block in 2015. Initially, only seven farmers took up the cultivation on 5.50 acres in 2015, but today it has surged to 105 acres. Around 60 farmers have cultivated millets including Kodo (Varagu), Foxtail millet (Thinai) and black sorghum (irungu solam) this year. Sensing the potential of the change, the state government also came forward to revive millet cultivation in 2020-2021. Named as Veppur Millet Mission, a value addition centre was established in Nannai village with the help of the state development policy council which allotted Rs 45 lakh for it. The millet farmers also formed a society named Nammalvar Organic Millet Farmer Producer Group to receive further support from Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission (TNSRLM). In the past two months, the group has been producing value-added millet products and selling them. “Millet rice and flour produced by our farmers are garnering overwhelming response. We are also improving our packaging and branding quality to target local and tier-I cities markets,” K Saravanan, coordinator, Barefoot Academy of Governance, said. In cotton and maize cultivation, if markets were deciding the price of the crop, farmers said they decide the cost in the case of millets even after value addition. “Low risk in cultivation and nutritious benefits encouraged our farmers to take up millets,” P Banumathy, a farmer from Perambalur, said. Mahalir Thittam department expects more farmers to take up millet cultivation as the success story is striking a chord with disgruntled cotton and maize farmers. “The value addition centre employs at least 15 women who will get assured income. Millet has a huge scope in the rainfed region,” M Rajmohan, project director, Mahalir Thittam, added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/value-addition-centre-lures-more-farmers-to-millet-cultivation-away-from-gm-crops/articleshow/87704733.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Virtual mega book fair for Delhi government schools||NEW DELHI: A virtual mega book fair was organised on Sunday for the students of Delhi government schools. The schools under the Directorate of Education (DoE) are expected to use the platform to choose from the best books for their libraries. Students and teachers alike will be able to place orders for the books online from the publishers and these would be delivered to the schools. Deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia inaugurated the fair via a video conference. “It is for the first time in the country that all schools of a state are participating in such a virtual book fair together. Books play an important role in the all-round development of children. Realising its importance, the Kejriwal government has made many important changes in its school libraries in the last five years. Our aim is to provide quality books to the children studying in government schools,” Sisodia said. Suggestions were invited from teachers and students regarding the selection of books and only those were included in the libraries that would contribute to the positive development of kids, he said. “Now, a scrutiny committee decides whether the books by a publisher are good and useful for children and whether they are required in a library, and if they would help the students in pursuing their dreams. The committee decides whether the books are worth purchasing,” Sisodia stressed. This year, the scrutiny committee has prepared a list of 8,000 books from 220 publishers. The Delhi government has allocated Rs 9 crore for 1,031 schools in Delhi. The books will be displayed on the DoE website from November 14 to December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/virtual-mega-book-fair-for-delhi-govt-schools/articleshow/87704734.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||14% women, 18% men have high blood sugar in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Around 14% of women and 18% of men in the state are being monitored for abnormal blood sugar levels or taking medicine to control the blood sugar levels in the state. Abnormal sugar levels recorded were greater than 140 mg/dl. Data from the Union Health and Family Welfare department shows that that blood sugar levels in both men and women are higher in urban areas than in rural areas. In Telangana, 21% men in urban areas had high blood sugar (greater than 140 mg/dl), compared to 16% in rural regions. About 18% of women in cities have this condition, compared to 13% of women in rural regions, while 14% of women in rural areas take medication to regulate their blood sugar levels. Interestingly, World Health Organization (WHO) data for November revealed that approximately only 25% of diabetics are correctly using their medication. The rest are either using it inappropriately or not using medication at all. “Any blood sugar level (post lunch) of 140 mg/dl is considered high though it is not diabetic. Blood sugar levels above 180 mg/dl are considered a diabetic condition. This requires lifestyle management with a healthy diet, proper medicine and regular exercising,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher. WHO also estimated that by 2017, nine million people worldwide had Type 1 diabetes (since childhood with specific medical conditions), but that 95% of patients had Type 2 diabetes, which is caused primarily by lifestyle issues and can be controlled with the help of maintaining healthy body weight. Adults with diabetes have a two-to three-fold greater risk of heart attack and stroke, according to experts. Worldwide, around 54% of potential diabetics are not identified, and in India, the figure is 49.7%. “Avoiding smoking and drinking after a certain age,” Dr Kiran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/14-women-18-men-have-high-blood-sugar-in-state/articleshow/87704748.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The ZP had demanded five acres of land in the Hinjewadi IT Park III for the project. However, the MIDC recently gave letter to the ZP citing that there was no policy to give the land parcel for such a project.. “Our headquarter has rejected the proposal/request,” stated the letter submitted by Sanjeev Deshmukh, regional officer of the MIDC. “The ZP has made a comprehensive village-wise solid waste management project for entire rural Pune. The Hinjewadi IT Park and the other nine villages are under the ZP limits. They have been facing solid waste disposal issues. Most of these agencies are dumping the garbage in open areas of these villages. This has created serious health issues at several locations. As a result, the solid waste plant is necessary to dispose off the garbage systematically,” said a senior official from the ZP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/midc-refuses-to-give-land-to-zp-for-stp/articleshow/87704223.cms||Sandip Dighe

While state highways and even city traffic police have voluntarily repaired the damaged roads, Trichy Corporation has come under severe criticism from the residents for being apathetic in resolving the road connectivity issues. Residents of various localities, particularly from the penultimate wards situated on the boundary of the city, opined that there was no respite for them from the bad roads. For the residents of Kattur near Thiruverumbur, KK Nagar, Wireless Road and E Pudur areas, commuting is still a struggle. Most of the roads were damaged due to the ongoing underground drainage work. Although the UGD work is partially completed in the residential areas that may not require further digging activities, the civic body was reluctant in taking up the maintenance work, residents said. Anticipating rainfall, the civic body could have filled the potholes and levelled the surface. Even after the heavy rain, there is no solution, the residents said. However, the civic body applied gravel mix on the damaged roads near RS Puram, but such temporary work was not carried out on all the bad roads. Even in RS Puram, the residents said that the shoddy temporary work is failing to address the purpose as two-wheelers are struggling to access the roads. “For weeks, waterlogging has been continuing near the Wireless Road vicinity. School children are also suffering, Trichy Corporation is yet to inspect our streets,” Hemant Verma, a resident of Vasantha Nagar near Trichy airport, said. A senior official with Trichy Corporation said that the roads are being temporarily overhauled in a phased manner. “Only after UGD work is finished, we can relay the roads,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-rain-but-water-logging-remains-a-pain/articleshow/87704749.cms||---

The demand for the second dose was higher at the camps. However, the response for the drive in Madurai and southern districts was poor as many of the southern districts witnessed rains on Sunday. In Madurai, around 42,000 people got vaccinated. Though the district did not see much rain on Sunday, the response was slow and marginally dull than the last mega vaccination drive, when the district recorded around 46,000 beneficiaries getting the vaccine jab. In Trichy city, the turnout started off on a dull note with poor footfall in most of the camps. However, the mobile vaccination vehicles covered the people gathering at spots with both Covaxin and Covishield. Till 6pm, Trichy district had vaccinated 67,258 people of which 39,494 took the second dose. The district was placed at fourth spot after Cuddalore, Chennai and Coimbatore. “As there was no rain in the city, demand for vaccination gradually improved by afternoon. Mobile vaccination centres on wheels did a commendable job by inquiring with people about their vaccination status and covering those eligible to get the second jab,” a medical officer with Trichy Corporation said. Of the 200 vaccination centres announced for Trichy city, over 100 were mobile vaccination centres. As the city had vaccinated many public with Covishield vaccine three months back, the demand for second dose is likely to increase in the coming days. “We are contacting those who have been skipping their second dose to appear at any of the centre to complete their vaccination,” the officer added. In Karur, 27,126 doses were administered while Ariyalur vaccinated 25,135 people on Sunday.  In Kanyakumari, despite heavy rains lashing the district in the last few days including on Sunday, 26,201 people took the jab. Of them, 22,545 were taking the second dose. In Virudhunagar, with no rainfall on Sunday, there was relatively good response from public and as 51,440 doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered.

Boundary stones and a board erected mentioning the property as owned by Malliampathu panchayat were damaged in the attempt. The land is situated in Vasan Valley on Vayalur road in the suburbs of Trichy city was identified under survey number 49/3. Sprawling for 2,200sq ft, the panchayat has records that the land, about 40 years ago, was used as a cremation ground. During an audit, as the land was found encroached by private individuals using the wrong survey number, Malliampathu panchayat approached the Srirangam taluk office to survey the site to identify the owner. On Saturday, a man had visited the site and boundaries were marked, confirming that the land belongs to the panchayat. “The worth of the property is presently estimated to be more than Rs 50 lakh and some influential people faked the survey number to claim ownership of the land for the past 12 years,” U Vigneshwaran, president, Malliampathu panchayat said. The rural local body had planned to fence the property to prevent further encroachment attempts but on Sunday morning, the boundary stones installed by the panchayat were uprooted. The panchayat council approached the Somarasampettai police station with a complaint seeking an inquiry. Revenue department officials also said that they will inquire about the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bid-to-encroach-land-in-trichy-a-day-after-panchayat-retrieved-it/articleshow/87704741.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 11-year-old falls to death from 10th-floor balcony in Borivli||MUMBAI: A schoolgoing girl fell to her death from her 10th floor apartment in a Borivli highrise on Saturday while doing art work. Hetvi Mehta (11) could have unintentionally cut up a portion of a balcony net while engaged in a craft activity, said the police. There is no conclusion on how she could have fallen as the balcony does not have cameras. The balcony did not have a grill. The police recorded an accidental death case and are making inquiries.Hetvi lived with her grandparents and mother in the highrise, AHCL Homes, on Borivli Link Road. Around 4.40 pm on Saturday, passers-by heard a loud thud on the pavement outside the building. “There was a cloud of dust and it was initially unclear what had happened. We then spotted the body of a child and alerted the society management. She had hit a signpost before landing on the ground,” said an eyewitness who works in an office on the premises. Someone called up the police control room. A police team rushed the girl to a public hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead. Another team stayed back to inquire about her identity. “As she was found on the pavement and the guards of the adjacent building did not recognise her, we went door-to-door to inquire whose child it was. When we reached Hetvi’s house on the 10th floor of the highrise, her grandmother was not aware of the accident. Her grandmother said Hetvi was indoors playing. We then showed her a photograph of the deceased. She was in shock and confirmed that the photo was of her granddaughter’s. Hetvi’s mother was away when the incident occurred. The family is grieving and we will record their statements subsequently,” said a police officer. Senior inspector S Kalekar of the Borivli police station said there did not appear to be any foul play. “It’s a case of an accidental fall,” said Kalekar. Hetvi studied in class VI of a suburban school and was an only child. The police will be going through CCTV footage from the society premises and commercial establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-yr-old-falls-to-death-from-10th-floor-balcony-in-borivli/articleshow/87705823.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Goa||Ahead of peak tourism season, Goa police to crack down on harassment of tourists||PANAJI: With Goa’s peak tourism season around the corner and international tourism set to resume, Goa police has decided to step up vigilance in the state, particularly to thwart harassment of domestic and international tourists. Police have begun booking miscreants and touts who are targeting tourists, North Goa superintendent of police Shobhit Saxena told reporters on Sunday. He said that tourist police have been deployed along Goa’s beaches to not only help tourists but to also address complaints of harassment. “I won’t say there is a rise in harassment of tourists, but Goa is a global tourist destination and like all global tourist destinations, there are instances of harassment,” Saxena said. “There are unscrupulous people who try to cheat tourists, who try to misguide them and we are booking a lot of these people under the Tourism Trade Act.” The SP said that police are keeping a close watch on touts, malpractices and illegal vendors who are harassing tourists. “The action is much more than it was in the previous years,” he said on the sidelines of a cycling expedition. Saxena, who also heads the crime branch, said that sleuths are also keeping a close watch on foreigners who are overstaying and who are linked to the drug trade. “We have also carried out a full foreigner survey to see who are staying here illegally. We are trying to identify them and we are trying to take action against them,” he said. In 2019, police seized drugs worth Rs 10 crore and several foreigners were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act for drug possession. Police are keeping a close watch on those who were booked earlier as well as their associates. Saxena said that the police force wants to “strike hard against drugs and nip it in the bud” to ensure a safe tourism season. “We expect to see a safe tourist season for everyone. Not only the local police station staff, but tourist police are also deployed and they have recently been trained in soft skills. They are deployed not only to assist the tourists but also to take complaints from them and they are going to be a force multiplier,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ahead-of-peak-tourism-season-police-to-crack-down-on-harassment-of-tourists/articleshow/87704806.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After monsoon break, all 8 zones of Corbett open now||DEHRADUN: After the monsoon break, all eight zones of Corbett will be opened to tourists on Monday. The tiger reserve was partially opened in October but three zones - Dhikala, Durga Devi and Sonanadi – were closed for night stay. Owing to a drop in Covid cases and a rise in inoculations, no curbs have been placed on visitors this year, officials said, adding that tourists are free to visit without a Covid-19 test or a vaccination certificate.“Due to easing of curbs, the response has been overwhelming. The park is fully booked for night stays and safaris for the rest of November,” an official said, adding that they are expecting a footfall of 1,000 people daily and plan to conduct 240 jungle safaris every day. The prime zones of the park will be open from November 15 to June 15. Last year too, the park saw a record footfall of 2 lakh tourists between October 2020 and March 2021, despite the fact that visitors had been asked to bring Covid-negative test reports. The critical core area of Corbett presents some of the most picturesque sights, offers scenic photography experiences and is ideal for wildlife sightings. The tiger reserve was adversely affected in the recent torrential rains in Kumaon, with several areas getting water- logged, cameras traps placed for census activities getting washed away and waste accumulating in the Ramganga river, which is the source of drinking water for many wild animals. Of the eight zones of Corbett – Jhirna, Dhikala, Bijrani, Durga Devi, Garjiya, Sonanadi and Pakhro – the first three remain the most sought after, as the likelihood of tiger sighting here is higher as compared to other zones. Among the new attractions for tourists this year is the newly-inaugurated Interpretation Centre at Dhangari, which provides information on the Corbett’s wildlife through various mediums. “At least 500 visitors have been coming to the interpretation centre every day, helping the department earn at least Rs 50,000 every day. This year, too, we are expecting a huge turnout as Covid norms have been relaxed,” said RK Tiwari, the warden of Corbett National Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-monsoon-break-all-8-zones-of-corbett-open-now/articleshow/87704229.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Who was Milind Teltumbde: He rose from mine union leader to Maoist thinktank||NAGPUR: Milind Teltumbde, who was a mine workers union leader, had risen to become the Maoists’ most trusted leader and strategy planner in central India. Former state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell in-charge Ravindra Kadam, considered an expert on Naxals, said the death of the Maoists’ apex body member would be a setback for the outfit but rebels would not leave the void unfilled for long. If Teltumbde is believed to be the sole motivator for ‘urban Maoism’ in Maharashtra, Kadam was the one who laid bare the outfits’ metro cell’s involvement in Koregaon Bhima episode with the aim of cornering the government and also spread its network in India. Teltumbde, from Karanja in Yavatmal district, was himself a cadre recruited from urban areas. His brother advocate Anand Teltumbde is in jail currently for his alleged role in Koregaon Bhima case. Teltumbde’s wife Angela Sontakey, also earlier arrested by Maharashtra ATS, was handling charge of Maoists ‘Golden triangle’ comprising states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Kadam, who had brought Teltumbde’s role to fore in Koregaon Bhima case, said the state security agencies now cannot sit basking in glory. “There is absolutely no place for complacency now,” said Kadam, who retired last year as Jt CP Nagpur. Kadam, who was the backbone of the Koregaon Bhima case, said a letters by Teltumbde, unearthed during the investigation, penned to his colleagues of Central Committee, the apex body in the outfit, narrating the success of the Koregaon Bhima case to put the government in a soup, laid bare the conspiracy to fuel the agitation. Kadam also said Teltumbde can also be credited with finding an alternative to Abujhmadh, along Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border, in the safe zones of Kanha National Park, where security forces could not enter due to legal constraints. “Teltumbde had stretched Maoist presence up to Mandla, Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh and Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, starting from Gondia,” said Kadam. Police sources said Teltumbde, who was baptized into the Communist movement by advocate Sujan Abhraham, was initially part of Akhil Maharashtra Kamgar Union. He was also divisional committee member of coal belt of Chandrapur and Nagpur. After the death of Shridhar Shrinivasan, Teltumbde was made secretary of Maharashtra Rajya State Committee, which oversaw the movement in the Gondia-Balaghat-Rajnandgaon zone. After the committee was dissolved in 2017, Teltumbde was made chief of Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh - Chhattisgarh (MCC) zone. Sources said Teltumbde was bringing along with him new recruits to work for MCC from places in remote Chhattisgarh when he was intercepted and killed in the encounter on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/teltumbde-rose-from-mine-union-leader-to-maoist-thinktank/articleshow/87704760.cms||Soumitra Bose

The train will be highly useful for traders and the business community, they said. Mayiladuthurai MP S Ramalingam has written to the general manager of Southern Railway on operating a new train on this section. He has stated that the train should be operated via Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Mayiladuthurai and Villupuram. The Southern Railway operates only a one-day service (Cholan Express Train Number 06795/06796) between Trichy and Chennai through the mainline, which is not able to cater to the needs of the travelling public living in the section. Moreover, the Cholan Express is a fully-reserved train, which has more air-conditioned sleeper coaches, and non AC sleeper class coaches than ordinary second class coaches, he said. Moreover, the timing of the Cholan Express is not suitable for the mainline section people to reach Chennai. It is a long pending demand of the people of the delta districts to operate an intercity day train without any reserved coaches, and only with second class sitting coaches suitably to reach the capital before noon, the MP said in the letter. Meanwhile, the functionaries of Thanjavur District Railway Users Association have welcomed the MPs demand. “Presently Rameswaram-Ayodya Cantonment and Rameswaram-Banaras weekly express trains provide early daytime connectivity to Chennai on Monday and Thursday for the mainline passengers,” A Giri, secretary of the association, said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mp-demands-new-express-train-between-chennai-trichy/articleshow/87704759.cms||---

Speaking at the conference, Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare of India, said, “It is the need of the hour to make breast feeding a successful national movement. We need to ensure the there are breast feeding rooms available in railway stations, bus stations and airports to ensure no mother has breastfeed in the washrooms... Creating milk banks will sensitise more communities.” While breastfeeding helps infant develop immunity, protects from certain diseases like pneumonia, obesity, it also helps them gain intelligence. “Breastfeeding protects women from cancers.

---||Delhi||Wrong to paint cops with communal brush: Delhi Court||NEW DELHI: A city court came down heavily on an accused’s lawyer for painting the entire Delhi Police with a communal brush by saying that the criminal cases related to the northeast Delhi riots have been fastened upon the members of the Muslim community alone. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said the statement was not only “highly irresponsible”, but also “patently false”. The court further said that the police appeared to have done its job with utmost integrity and certainly not on communal lines. During the hearing of a bail application of an accused in a riots case, his counsel argued that only people belonging to the Muslim community were targeted by the police in the aftermath of the riots and were arraigned in false criminal cases. To this, the court said, “These submissions... are certainly not in good taste. These are noted with immense disgust, repugnance and strong disapproval.” It said that the counsel had not pointed out any material on record to substantiate his claim that the riots were not communal in nature or were the handiwork of any political party. “It is the counsel himself, who is now painting the entire Delhi Police with a communal brush by saying that the criminal cases related to the riots have been fastened upon the members of Muslim community alone. The statement of counsel are not only highly irresponsible but also patently false,” it added in its order on November 11. The court noted that while dealing with the cases related to the riots, it had noticed that members of both the communities had been arraigned as accused and were chargesheeted by the police. In some cases, it was observed that there were witnesses belonging to Hindu community cited against the accused belonging to the same community and witnesses belonging to Muslim community cited against the accused belonging to the same community, it added. “The police appears to have done its job with utmost integrity and certainly not on communal lines. Maybe, some lapses have occurred during the investigation of these cases related, but even those lapses also do not give any slightest indication that the investigation was not fair and impartial or was on communal lines,” the court observed. “The cases before this court are very serious and sensitive in nature and require to be dealt with in a professional manner and without any communal taint,” it said. The court went on to say that the submission of the counsel that the chargesheet was only a bunch of papers was distasteful, to say the least. It added that the chargesheet had been considered in detail by the previous sessions judge, whereby charges had been framed against all the accused in the case, including the accused. "It is true that the investigating agency has kept open its right to investigate the case further, which is permissible u/s 173 (8) CrPC. It has to be borne in mind that the instant case relates to the killing of a person by riotous mob and only few persons among that mob have been identified so far against whom the chargesheet has been filed. It is the duty of the police to continue further investigation so as to identify all the remaining rioters and bring them to book (sic),” it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wrong-to-paint-cops-with-communal-brush-court/articleshow/87704763.cms||---

At this point, the air was too thin and trekking was deemed risky for the toddler by the doctor available at the last village enroute. While undertaking the seven-day long trek, the toddler looked forward to meeting Hulk and Captain America among other superheroes because his mother had told him that all the superheroes stayed near the Everest Base camp. “I am an Everest superhero, I like sleeping in the sleeping bag,” said the little trekker, speaking about his experience. Born to a trekker mother, it was she who set a goal for him to be the youngest one to trek to the Everest base camp. “I had taken him to professionals while he was an infant. They had advised me to ensure that he is not used to too much luxury. Since he began walking, I used to ensure he walked a lot and took the stairs several times a day to make him rough and tough,” said Shweta Golechha, his mother. “My husband planned a 15-day trip to Manali to acclimatize him to below zero temperatures, camping and trekking. By the time we went for the trek, he had already experienced these things,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4-yr-old-treks-to-everest-base-camp/articleshow/87704766.cms||Amrita Didyala

He also announced plans to export cotton and cotton yarn from Vidarbha soon. Addressing a programme of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) on Saturday evening, Gadkari, also city MP, said, “Harris called me yesterday night. She was inquiring about our economy. She stated they want to increase trade with Hindustan as compared to some other countries. Therefore, there are big opportunities for Vidarbha that require technology and resources. Chamber and traders here should now dare and start thinking globally,” he said. Stating he has special interest in agriculture, the minister said export of oranges from Vidarbha started last year. “We exported 8,000 tonne oranges last year. This year, we target to increase it to 1 lakh tonne. Now, we don’t need to send them to JNPT, Mumbai, before exporting. From dry port started at Wardha, goods can be transported to Haldia port to Pangaon port and Dakha,” he said. The Uinion minister said that the home minister of Bangladesh had a meeting with him in New Delhi. “He assured to take oranges in huge quantum from Vidarbha. Similarly, I have plans to export cotton and yarn in huge quantum from Vidarbha this year. There is huge demand of cotton and yarn,” he said. Gadkari suggested NVCC to felicitate entrepreneurs who invest over Rs500 crore in Vidarbha and increase the limit to Rs1,000 crore. “I personally know the dignitaries who were felicitated today. Here no one invests over Rs5-100 crore. Now, scenario is changing. Nagpur is having good infrastructure now. Soon the city will become capital of logistic,” he said. He expressed satisfaction over NVCC’s plan to construct its new office. “I have planned a tunnel which will start from Cotton Market and end near the NVCC office so that people can cover the distance within 3-4 minutes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kamala-harris-dials-gadkari-wants-increase-in-trade-with-hindustan/articleshow/87704767.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

A KMC official said littering has become a major issue at major transit and tourists places owing to the food stalls. The food vendors are counselled and sensitised regularly, but the situation remains the same. The vendors have claimed that the irregular arrival of the waste collection autorickshaw tippers forces them to dump the waste along road side. Vijay Patil, acting chief sanitation inspector of KMC, said, “As per law it is mandatory for every one to segregate waste at source. Many do not practice it in reality. We have counselled the vendors from Central Bus Stand, Shahupuri, Rankala, Rajarampuri and Khau Galli to start practising segregation and storage. If they are found handing over mixed waste then we will impose fine on them and if the offence is repeated, we will cancel the license and seize the cart.” Unsegregated waste is the major concern before sanitation authorities and not the collection. With additional vehicles arrived, the door-to-door collection of waste is now a regular affair. The segregation if not done at the source, causing inconvenience to the waste handlers at the processing plant. “Since the processing plant has become operational, the waste piled up for 10 years was processed up to 60%,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mandatory-for-food-vendors-to-segregate-waste-kmc/articleshow/87705326.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Wazir’ Mandi strays into ‘king’ of Hyderabad cuisine Biryani’s court||HYDERABAD: Authentic Deccani or Hyderabadi cuisine is a melange of recipes from Iran, Turkey and the Arab world with unique added flavours of South India, making the cuisine a delight for the gourmet. Hyderabad in the last four centuries imbibed food traditions from around the world, of course, with a pinch of local tastes to suit the local palate. There are about 700 authentic Deccani food flavours, each with its signature taste and unique aroma. There are also some new entrants that are fast adapting to the local food culture with Deccani masalas and other ingredients. It’s a matter of time that these new dishes become part of the Deccani cuisine, argue Hyderabadi food experts. After Shawarma, Mandi is ruling hotel kitchens. Mandi, the Yemeni dish, was once limited to a few wedding dinners. What started in a couple of speciality restaurants in Barkas, is now being served in an estimated 2,000 restaurants. Though Mandi and its Arabic cousin, Kabsa, started off in hotels in Hyderabad around the same time in 2013, Mandi took over the Hyderabadi palate, said Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) city convener P Anuradha Reddy. The city has about 5,000 biryani joints. With more Mandi joints opening in the city, food experts feel Hyderabadis want to experiment with new foods. They, however, argue that no dish would ever beat Hyderabadi biryani, which was likely introduced by the Qutub Shahis and perfected in royal kitchens of Nizam, particularly Mir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII. Himayat Ali Mirza, great grandson of Osman Ali Khan, said Hyderabadi biryani evolved absorbing Deccani or Telangana flavours into it. “This evolution took place in the mega royal kitchens of Asaf Jahs,” he said adding that biryani continues to be the favourite dish of most Hyderabadis, the growing popularity of Mandi notwithstanding. Heritage and food expert Dr Haseeb Jafferi said the light masala and large quantities of meat and rice with a dash of dry fruits in Mandi is appealing. While biryani has its loyal fan base many prefer Mandi as it is light on spices. He, however, argues that biryani will remain the king of Hyderabadi cuisine but it can accommodate Mandi as a wazir (minister). Dr Mohammad Safiullah, who is currently doing research on Hyderabadi cuisine, said Hyderabadi biryani has been perfected over the decades and no dish would ever beat it. Mandi is a new flavour in the town and Hyderabadis are known for their penchant for new foods. Interestingly, Mandi has been given a local flavour and it’s not surprising that it may sooner or later evolve as Hyderabadi Mandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wazir-mandi-strays-into-biryanis-court/articleshow/87704768.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Mumbai||Installing world’s tallest saffron flag in Maharashtra, NCP dabbles in ‘soft Hindutva’||MUMBAI: NCP seems to have taken a saffron turn ahead of the local body polls as NCP MLA Rohit Pawar, grand nephew of NCP supremo Sharad Pawar, installed the world’s tallest saffron flag in his constituency of Karjat-Jamkhed last month. The massive flag, weighing 90 kilogram, is hoisted atop a 74-metre-tall pole which weighs 18 tonnes and has traversed across six states before being installed in Jamkhed. Political observers said the saffron flag was an attempt by the young Pawar family scion to not just make an attempt to experiment with soft Hindutva but also lay claim to Shivaji’s legacy. Rohit told TOI that the flag pole was 74 metres tall since ‘Shivaji Maharaj’s coronation took place in 1674. “Hindutva can’t be claimed by any party and neither does it belong to any political party. This flag has travelled to 96 holy sites across 36 districts in India. The saffron flag also represents nationalism and has travelled to several religious sites all over India. There is nothing political about it. CM Uddhav Thackeray has already spoken about neo-Hindutva. The saffron flag doesn’t belong to any particular political party,” Rohit said. The flag is called ‘Swarajya Dhwaj’ or self rule flag. The flag not just relates to Shivaji’s fight for self-rule but is also seen as an attempt at soft hindutva by the NCP ahead of the local body polls. Local historians said one of the Maratha Confederacy’s last battles was fought in Kharda against the Nizam, which the Marathas own. “Kharda in Jamkhed taluka has historical importance. So the flag was installed near the Shivpattan fort here ,” Rohit said. During the 2019 polls, Rohit won Karjat Jamkhed assembly constituency by over 43,000 votes defeating BJP’s sitting minister Ram Shinde. “Rohit is now seen as NCP’s youth face. The party is expected to gain from his campaign and Swarajya Dhwaj as every family in the hinterland connects to Swarajya and the saffron flag,” an NCP functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-installing-worlds-tallest-saffron-flag-in-state-ncp-dabbles-in-soft-hindutva/articleshow/87705827.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Local MLA Dilip Bankar raised the issue and sought Pawar’s intervention in the matter after the latter flagged off sugar cane crushing at the Ranwad cooperative sugar factory, which resumed operations after six years, on Sunday. Addressing a gathering at the function, Pawar said there was a need to make by-products to make the sugar factory viable and profitable, Otherwise, farmers incur losses. Pawar said factories should also focus on producing power, ethanol, and hydrogen to make the factory profitable. “If this happens, farmers will get a better price for their produce,” said Pawar. Pawar said that there has been a drop in sugar production in Brazil and Thailand – the largest sugar producing countries in the world – and demand for sugar has increased in the international market. “Hence, there is a scope to export sugar,” he said. Citing the example of Brazil, where Pawar said factories crush 35,000 tonnes of sugarcane a day with just 100 workers, he urged sugar factories to increase production with limited manpower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pawar-for-power-to-farmers-during-daytime/articleshow/87705337.cms||Tushar Pawar

State IMA president Dr Ramkishna Londhe, who was in Chandrapur to take part in a medical conference, on Sunday claimed their delegation is visiting Ahmednagar on Monday and would discuss situation with their local counterparts and decide on going ahead with the indefinite strike. “The woman doctor and three nurses working for the government hospital have been made scapegoats in the case. The fire broke out following short circuit in power supply wire and still women doctor and nurses were booked for causing death by negligence even as it was evident that they have no role in outbreak of fire,” Londhe said. He claimed that a six monthly audit for fire, electrical system and building strength is mandatory for all hospitals. “All the private hospitals compulsorily carry out fire and electrical audit every six months. It is the responsibility of administration to ensure proper fire and electrical audits are carried out in government hospitals. If responsible administrative officers failed to comply with the norm, how come the woman doctor and nurses are responsible for that?” asked Dr Londhe. He claimed that women doctor and nurses are being treated as hardcore criminals and the police have even taken second round of their custody for further interrogation. He maintained that IMA Maharashtra unit stands strongly behind the innocent doctor and nurses, and all 47,000 members of IMA in state would go on indefinite strike with MAGMO and nurses federation crippling the entire health services in state, if charges are not withdrawn against innocent woman doctor and three nurses, he said. He also demanded Rs50 lakh compensation for the family of the final-year medical student killed in the medical college campus in Yavatmal and take security measures to ensure that such incident does not take place in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ima-threatens-indefinite-strike-over-charges-in-ahmednagar-hospital-fire/articleshow/87704772.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Mumbai||Month after he’s out of jail for murder, man held for killing another woman in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Released from prison only last month, a 41-year-old man was arrested late on Saturday in connection with the brutal murder of a homeless woman in Ghatkopar. The accused, Sagar Yadav, had been previously jailed for a similar offence in which he had murdered a woman in Navi Mumbai. On November 2, 52-year-old Shobha Soni had been found bludgeoned to death with a stone in an open space at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar. Her arms, legs and mouth were tightly bound and her clothes were in disroder.A forensic examination did not disclose any sexual assault. Soni’s sister told investigators that the family had severed ties with her as she had married against their wishes. The police said that Soni and her husband were estranged; he is an alcoholic and lives at Kalwa. For some time, Soni worked with an idli vendor but lost her job during the pandemic. She then started to beg to survive and put up near an open-air library at night. The police said they examined dozens of electronic surveillance videos around the crime scene. They found images of the accused arriving at the crime scene, but could not find any of him leaving from there “On the basis of what could be seen in surveillance footage, we made notes on the culprit’s appearance, his gait and hairdo. Based on these leads, we made enquiries in shops around and examined every route that led to the crime scene. The accused had been spotted by people moving around on pavements across the eastern suburbs and also at Mahim and Bandra-Kurla Complex,” said inspector Ghanshyam Nair, crime branch. Police established Yadav’s identity and discovered that he had been jailed from November 2016 to October 2021 for the murder of a woman in Navi Mumbai. On October 7, he had walked out of Taloja prison and started living on the streets of Navi Mumbai. A police team quizzed ragpickers and homeless individuals before zeroing in on Yadav’s location in the Mankhurd-Belapur belt. Late on Saturday, he was picked up from Mankhurd and handed over to officials of Pant Nagar police station where a murder case has been registered against him. Yadav was acquainted with Soni from a decade ago. He has told the police that Soni and her partner had looted him in 2011 and he killed her for revenge. But the police are yet to verify his claim. In an unrelated case in September this year, a 32-year-old woman had been brutally raped and murdered inside a tempo at Sakinaka. The police arrested the accused who was known to her. The chargesheet — filed within 18 days — stated that the accused was “angry” with the victim because she had gone out of the city for a fortnight and this had sparked a fight between the two of them on the fateful day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-month-after-hes-out-of-jail-for-murder-man-held-for-killing-another-woman/articleshow/87705597.cms||Nitasha Natu

The government is using a similar strategy for detecting patients with tuberculosis now. A tuberculosis search campaign will be implemented from November 15 to 25 in Nagpur district. Under this campaign, teams of the health department will visit houses in marked regions of Nagpur district and collect the samples of residents having symptoms of TB from long time. Accordingly, their X-Ray and CB-NAT testing will also be conducted. “Team members will conduct survey of all family-members. Those having cough for more than 2 weeks, fever, experiencing sudden drop in weight etc will be tested for TB,” said district TB officer Dr Mamta Sonsare. In case of diagnosis, free medical treatment will be provided by the local health institutions. All households in rural areas and selected areas in urban areas will be surveyed. Survey team will have two members. It will include Asha Swayamsevak in rural and Arogya Sevak in city areas. The National strategic plan for tuberculosis elimination 2017-2025 aims at eliminating TB in the next 4 years. “Detect – Treat – Prevent – Build” (DTPB) is the formula on which the state health department is working. Hospitals, diagnostic labs and medical stores have been directed to keep the record of TB patients and upload it on the digital platform to ensure the documentation of TB. “Till now, only medical practitioners, hospitals and laboratories were notifying TB patients to government health system. Now, all chemists will also inform about TB patients for whom they have dispensed the TB drugs,” said Dr Sonsare. TB patients are also encouraged to notify themselves. “We are planning to reach out every TB patient so that the incentives and support to patients, families and communities can be properly extended,” Dr Sonsare added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/door-to-door-survey-of-tb-patients-from-today/articleshow/87704775.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

G Baby Shalini of Kanyakumari district had filed the habeas corpus petition seeking a direction to find the whereabouts of her missing husband Duraisingh who is working as a havildar in BSF at Chohtan taluk, Barmer district in Rajasthan. Since he failed to meet her on September 15, the petitioner filed the petition alleging that he is missing. However, Kanyakumari district police, which conducted an inquiry in this regard, submitted that Duraisingh is alive and on duty. Police further submitted that he is also frequently in contact with the petitioner over phone. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran observed that the petitioner had filed the petition with frivolous and false details so as to force her husband to come down to Tamil Nadu, which in the opinion of the court is an abuse of process of law. The judges observed that the petitioner had made imaginary allegations so as to bring her husband from Rajasthan. Such an attempt made by the petitioner by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of this court has to be curbed and curtailed. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition and imposed a cost of Rs 15,000 on the petitioner payable to high court legal services authority of Madurai bench within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/false-details-hc-asks-woman-to-pay-rs-15k-cost/articleshow/87704774.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Complainant Nitin Barai (59) filed the complaint with the Bandra police on Saturday almost seven years after the deal was signed after the complainant realised that the party with whom he signed the agreement duped him and failed to return the money he invested to get the franchise. Barai’s son Yash (25) who has invested money in the fitness business alleged that they were threatened when they sought their money back. The contract agreement, according to the police probing the case, was signed in 2014 and the payment was done within a month then. However, the complainant did not get any money that he had invested in the business. Based on the complaint, the Bandra police registered the first information report against the director of SFL Fitness, Kashiff Khan, actress Shilpa Shetty, her husband Raj Kundra, Darshit Shah and a few others who were a witness in the contract signed in 2014. A case under the Indian Penal Code Sections, including 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) has been registered against them and the Bandra police are probing the case. TOI has the FIR filed against all the above names.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/businessman-files-cheating-case-against-shilpa-shetty-hubby/articleshow/87706025.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Houses flooded at Vizhinjam||Thiruvananthapuram: Local residents at Kottapuram went through nightmarish experience on Saturday following incessant rain as it caused the Gangayaar canal to overflow and flood houses, shops and landing centres damaging fishing equipment and means of livelihood of the fishermen. Mild tension prevailed in the area as the residents, tired of their constant demand for cleaning of the canal, gathered demanding immediate action. Mayor Arya Rajendran, deputy mayor P K Raju and welfare standing committee chairman H Salim reached the spot and tried to pacify the residents. Following it, officials of the minor Irrigation department and corporation officials deployed earth movers to clean the canal and chunks of plastic waste were scooped up from the canal. Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima said that in June and July, heavy showers led to overflow of the canal and it would flood the auto stand and the locker facility of the department of harbour engineering. “Many fishing boat engines were lost and damaged. Following the flood, many street vendors had lost their means of livelihood. In addition to this, a few houses located on the ‘puramboku’ land were also submerged. The flooding that happened in the last two days was so severe that lakhs worth of fishing equipment have been lost,” said Kottapuram ward councillor Paniyadima. The work to revamp the canal was tendered and work was awarded recently, however, delay in implementation of the work caused flooding in the area again, Paniyadima said. He also cited the plight of residents of Mariyanagar and Vayalinkara. The septic tanks of houses in these colonies were filled and no action has been taken so far to clear the blocked tanks. The state government had in August approved the tender excess for cleaning and revamp of the canal as a special case. The work was tendered thrice, but no response was received .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/houses-flooded-at-vizhinjam/articleshow/87690412.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Passenger trains free from Covid tag, fares to be pre-pandemic||Nagpur: After the Railway Board issued orders to remove the ‘special’ tag from all mail and express trains, the Central Railway on Saturday identified 206 trains and removed the special tag. Now these trains will operate with regular numbers with pre-Covid fares. However, even as the mail and express special (MSPC) and holiday special (HSP) ‘special’ tag on almost all the trains have been removed, there is no clarity on various fare concessions to senior citizens, handicapped, disabled, students, etc which were allowed before Covid. Central Railway chief public relations officer (CPRO) Shivaji Sutar said, “As of now, there are no instructions from the Railway Board regarding providing concessions and other benefits, but almost all the trains will charge the fares that used to be applicable pre-Covid period. All the regular time-tabled trains which are presently operating as special trains shall be operated with the regular number and with fare and categorization as applicable.” During the last over one year after Covid, Indian Railways raked in the moolah by charging 20-30% more fare than the normal. It also saved crores by withdrawing various concessions. Of the 206 trains from which the special tag has been removed, more than 24 trains will be to and from Nagpur and several others will be passing through. These include trains like Vidarbha and Sewagram Express to Mumbai and all trains to Pune including Garib Rath and Hamsafar. Sutar said as part of railways’ efforts to normalize passenger services and revert back in a phased manner to the pre-Covid levels of service, the railways’ passenger reservation system (PRS) will be shut down for 6 hours during the lean business hours of the night for next seven days. “This is to enable up-gradation of system data and updating of new train numbers etc. Since a huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all mail and express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours to minimize the impact on ticketing services,” said Sutar. The activity will be performed starting from the intervening night of November 14 and 15 to the night of November 20 and 21 starting at 11.30 pm and ending at 5.30 am. During these 6-hour periods, no PRS services like ticket reservation, current booking, cancellation, inquiry services etc will be available. During the period, railway personnel will ensure advance charting for the trains departing during the affected timings. Except for PRS services, all other inquiry services including 139 services will continue uninterrupted, said railway officials. Basant Shukla, general secretary of registered passengers rail user body Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK), welcomed the decision but said, “It was due to pressure from various organizations the railway ministry had to bow down. But unless all the concessions are not granted there is no meaning in restoring train numbers.” “The railways should also start issuing bedrolls and blankets with caution. If the railways feel offering sops is still pinching, then it should withdraw privilege ticket order (PTOs) and reduce the number of free passes being given to its employees,” said Brij Bhushan Shukla, founder of Rail Yatri Sangh. On Friday, the Indian Railways issued an order to discontinue the ‘special’ tag for mail and express trains and revert to pre-pandemic ticket prices with immediate effect. The board said the second class of such trains shall continue to run as reserved except for any relaxation permitted in a special case. On already booked tickets in advance, no difference of fare either to be collected by the railways or any refund due to already booked passengers shall be permitted. Ever since the Covid lockdown was eased, the Indian Railways has been running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now even short-distance passenger services were being run as special trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/passenger-trains-free-from-covid-tag-fares-to-be-pre-pandemic/articleshow/87704795.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Madurai||Rain subsides in Kanyakumari, but many areas still under water||Kanyakumari: There was a letup in the intensity of rain in Kanyakumari from Sunday morning after three days of heavy rain which left many parts of the district under water. More than 3,200 people had to be moved to safety in the 24 hours till Sunday morning and as many as 72 huts were damaged, 10 of them fully. The district recorded an average rainfall of 109.53 mm in 24 hours till 8 am. Of the 14 places that recorded more than 100 mm rainfall, three recorded more than 210 mm each. Trains were cancelled either fully, partially or short-terminated at Thiruvananthapuram and Nagercoil. The district administration declared a holiday for schools and colleges on Monday. As many as 3,278 people were evacuated from 65 inundated areas across the district till 9 am on Sunday and shifted to temporary shelters where they were provided food and basic amenities. The rescued people were from 1,004 families which included 1,620 women, 1,063 men and 595 children. The highest number of inundated places was in Agastheeswaram taluk (19). Many places in Thovalai taluk (17) and a few low-lying places in Kalkulam, Vilavancode, Killiyoor and Thiruvattar taluks were inundated. “The biggest challenge was resistance by people from inundated areas as they refused to leave their localities despite water level going up and posing a threat to their lives,” district collector M Arvind told TOI. Heavy duty motors were used to pump out water from Suchindram temple and many other places where the water could not naturally drain. Medical teams were in place to check people in the relief camps for ailments. With rain giving a break from Sunday morning, the water level in Thamiraparani river through Kuzhithurai came down. Perunchani recorded the highest rainfall of 219.4 mm in 24 hours, followed by Puthen dam with 217 mm and Kodayar Lower with 211 mm. By recording an average rainfall of 77.2 mm in 24 hours till Friday morning and 100.48 mm till Saturday morning, the district has recorded an average rainfall of 287.21 mm over a period of 72 hours, making it the heaviest downpour in the southernmost district in more than a decade. In view of the rain, the district collector also announced that the weekly grievances meeting at the collectorate on Monday will be held on Wednesday. Power supply to as many as 83,111 connections was disconnected due to the rains and inundation to avoid accidents such as electrocution. By 6 pm on Sunday connection was restored to 65,709 – that is 79% of the lines that were disconnected over the last three days. The disruption was primarily because of transformers being turned off or damaged by the rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rain-subsides-in-kanyakumari-but-many-areas-still-under-water/articleshow/87704789.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Confidential||Is CM’s trick, a treat? Has chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s outburst against the BJP helped or harmed the saffron party? While the saffron party top brass say the attack successfully projected them as the main opposition in Telangana, the talk in TRS circles is that KCR succeeded in shifting focus away from Eatala’s win in Huzurabad. The spotlight shifted to Bandi Sanjay instead, which TRS doesn’t mind. Let’s see how that affects BJP’s internal dynamics. Trolls say ‘challenge accepted’ Achampet MLA, Guvvala Balaraju of the TRS is a harassed man these days. He is inundated with calls, mainly BJP sympathisers, who are demanding that he keep his word and resign from the assembly. In a war of words, preceding the Huzurabad assembly byelection Balaraju had said he would resign as MLA if the BJP’s Eatala Rajendar won the poll. “I said I would resign if any BJP MLA also would come forward to resign if the TRS candidate won. No one came forward to accept my challenge,” Balaraju told TOI. Meanwhile, the TRS MLA has compiled a list of all the phone calls he had got ‘round-the-clock’ asking him to resign. He will take up the issue both legally and politically. Some callers got abusive and they got it back in kind. “I am an aggressive politician. If someone foul-mouths me, am I expected to suffer what they say?” he asks, obviously rhetorically. Pocket without pennies in Jubilee Hills? The rich and power of Hyderabad are known not to flinch when it comes to showing off their wealth. Or are they? With a new panel taking over the Jubilee Hills International Centre, the pricey club linked to the Jubilee Hills Housing Society, many interesting details about the cash-rich members are spilling out. A little birdie tells us that the club's food sales had increased by 30% recently, not because the membership had increased, but because members were bringing along guests and not paying for them. Members with guests would enter through one gate and exit through another without being noticed. There is only one entry and exit gate now, forcing all to clear their bills. The club has nearly 2,800 permanent members and 1,500 other members all of them influential faces of society. Do they really need to play such cheap tricks? Musical chairs for MLC seat Will someone please make Padi Kaushik Reddy a member of the legislative council (MLC)? Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has made it quite clear she will not consider his name under the quota she controls for reasons best known to her and now there is talk that the TRS government will give him the seat under the MLA quota. Just give him the seat and get it over with once and for all. That way this sad saga will end. So what if he was of no use to TRS on his home turf in Huzurabad! Citizens first for KTR ‘Sunday Funday’ on Tankbund and Charminar has become a huge hit. Though the idea was municipal minister KT Rama Rao’s, he gave credit to common citizens for it, stating that their suggestions through twitter prompted the decision. In a press meet on Saturday, he said the TRS government listens to everybody and respects their proposals. “Similarly, we changed Metro Rail timings recently, based on feedback and suggestions on twitter from commuters. The government resolved many issues after getting feedback on social media,” KTR said. On the criticism of his department, the TRS working president said civic body works are a ‘thankless job’. Though the staff work 365 days a year, if something goes wrong, they face the ire of the people, he said. Tailpiece Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) MD V C Sajjanar sending legal notices to actor Allu Arjun and a bike hailing firm over an advertisement apparently showing the corporation in a bad light has led to Twitterati chuckling. Some of them have pointed out that the bus stop in the ad is Veeravasaram in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district. If anyone should feel upset, it should be the Andhra Pradesh corporation. When an APSRTC bus has been shown in the ad, why would TSRTC get all touchy, they wonder. If the Twitter users are right, it is a question worth asking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-confidential/articleshow/87704785.cms||---

Milind Band, the general manager of NMPML, said the transport utility already had two existing centres and there will be greater demand for passes as more students will be attending classes physically after the improved Covid scenario in the city. “Hence, we are opening two more centres at Panchavati and Nashik Road divisional office buildings of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC),” he said. Currently, the NMPML has two centres at its headquarter along Timbak Road and Tapovan office. NMPML has introduced passes for students and daily commuters. Students would get a 50% concession for 30 days and a 66% concession for 90 days on fixed routes. NMPML rolled out the city bus service on July 8 by deploying 28 buses on nine routes. Now, the transporting wing has rolled out 130 buses on 34 different routes in the city. Bus driver, conductor manhandled Four unidentified people allegedly manhandled a bus driver and conductor of Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (NMPML) bus on Saturday night in the Mhasrul area of the city. NMPML has lodged a complaint with the Panchavati police station and submitted a video in this connection. The incident took place at 8.30 pm on Saturday at Mhasrul when the city bus was coming from Borgad. The four occupants of a car took over the bus and stopped the bus, manhandling the driver and conductor because the driver allegedly swerved the bus near the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmpml-plans-to-reopen-two-more-centres-to-issue-student-bus-passes/articleshow/87705363.cms||Tushar Pawar

The complainant also identified him as a relative of his wife. She was questioned as well, during which she allegedly confessed to the crime. The woman told cops that she was not happy with her husband and in order to teach him a lesson, she hatched this plan along with her cousin, Giriraj Sharma. She called him on the day of incident and told him the timing when there would be no one present at home and also the location of all valuables. Sharma then executed the burglary a day before Diwali. Sharma is a resident of Dausa, Rajasthan. Police have recovered Rs 78,300 in cash apart from gold jewellery from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-organises-burglary-at-home-to-teach-husband-a-lesson-arrested/articleshow/87704811.cms||---

In a letter sent to the union minister Tharoor said this highway is of critical importance as it offers vital connectivity towards its southern parts of the district and to Tamil Nadu. Though the state government has previously carried out two stages of widening from Karamana to Balaramapuram and have proposed one till Vazhimukku, the aforementioned road is still under the administration of the NHAI and this has led to a situation where the maintenance of the remaining part of the road from Vazhimukku has been severely affected. Following discussions between the state public works department and the NHAI, it has been proposed that the remaining stretch will be handed over to the state government with a one-time maintenance scheme support from the NHAI. While an estimate of Rs 23.48 crores for the expenditure that would be required for the maintenance and upkeep of the road has already been submitted, the funding is yet to be sanctioned. As a result of this delay, the maintenance, including aspects such as road resurfacing, has been adversely affected, which has, in turn, caused considerable distress for the people, said Tharoor in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tharoor-seeks-centres-help-on-nh-upkeep/articleshow/87690444.cms||---

Disaster management minister K K S S R Ramachandran, who visited the affected areas, told reporters that the government machinery will take stock of the damages caused once the water drains. Damage to crops and public property such as roads, tanks and to individual houses, cattle or other belongings will be ascertained. “We will complete the assessment in two days after rain stops and submit a detailed report to the CM,” the minister said. Ramachandran attributed conversion of paddy fields to residential plots as the main reason for the inundation of residential areas. “You have built houses in the tanks and on agricultural lands,” he said when asked if the water stagnation was due to delay in desilting waterbodies. The minister said steps will be taken to desilt, repair and remove encroachments from rivers, tanks and channels. He said that water level has gone down at many places, exposing badly damaged roads that need to be re-laid. The immediate focus of the government is to rescue people from inundated areas and provide them with essential supplies. Nearly Rs 200 crore sanctioned for the district after the previous floods two months ago is being utilized through various departments, he added. Rural development minister K R Periakaruppan said the government cannot take responsibility for encroachments on waterbodies that happened in the last 10 years, but will fight against them legally. IT minister T Mano Thangaraj and monitoring officer for the district N Jothi Nirmalasamy were also present. DGP C Sylendra Babu visited affected places and appreciated police personnel who were engaged in rescue operations. PMK founder S Ramadoss, while pressing for removal of encroachments from waterbodies, appealed to the government to expedite repair and rehabilitation works. TMC(M) president G K Vasan sought special attention from the government to Kanyakumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/conversion-of-fields-to-blame-for-flooding-min/articleshow/87704812.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Western Railway could soon have 20 AC local services a day||MUMBAI: In a bid to make AC local trains seem ‘cooler’ and more accessible to citizens, the Western Railway plans to increase the number of services, as well as improve the fare structure for single-journey tickets. Nearly four years after it first introduced air-conditioned local trains on December 25, 2017, WR now plans to add eight more AC services, bringing the total up to 20 services per day. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 20,000 passengers availed of the 12 AC services that ran each day. Eight new services are now proposed on the corridor between Churchgate-Virar, with some services originating and terminating at Goregaon, Borivli and Nalasopara. The Mumbai division has already sent the proposal to WR head quarters for approval. A senior WR official said, “Of the eight services planned to be introduced, one each will be during the morning and evening peak hours.” Of the 8 services planned, one pair will be between Churchgate-Goregaon-Churchgate, two pairs between Churchgate-Borivli-Churchgate, and one service each will run from Virar to Churchgate (in the morning peak hour) and from Churchgate to Nalasopara (in the evening peak hour). The decision to introduce more AC trains was made with the hope that additional trains, especially during the peak hour, will encourage more passengers to opt for AC locals. Even though WR has a fleet of six AC rakes, it runs only 12 services with two rakes. Railway ministry has also become proactive in promoting AC trains. It has already decided that all future trains to be procured will be fully air-conditioned. Besides, it has also decided to introduce a Metro-like fare structure for single-journey tickets. WR is also planning to allow second-class and first-class ticket -holders to travel by AC train by paying excess fare to on-board ticket examiners. In a public survey undertaken recently on fares, nearly 52% of the 35,685 respondents wanted fares to be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-could-soon-have-20-ac-local-services-a-day/articleshow/87705609.cms||Manthank Mehta

The two injured— Sanjay Sonurlekar and his son Sahil, residents of New wada, Ona village in Bicholim, were rushed to the community health centre in Bicholim where they were undergoing treatment. Their house was also damaged. In Aldona, the pandal erected for the confirmation service collapsed just before the service could commence. No casualties were reported. Power supply was also affected for sometime. The 110kV line to Kadamba sub-station was affected disrupting power to Panaji and nearby areas. The supply was restored later. Fire and emergency services department said that there were reports of tree falls in Canacona and Majorda. The India meteorological department (IMD) said that the rain spell was due to two weather circulations that are bringing moisture incursion to the Goa coast. IMD said the reason for the mid-November rainfall was the circulation near south interior Karnataka and north Tamil Nadu which is a remnant of the depression that crossed over to the Tamil Nadu coast on November 11. Also, the circulation over the south east Arabian Sea is also bringing easterly winds over Goa resulting in the rainfall. Sakhali, Old Goa, Bambolim, Panaji and Aldona are among the areas that reported rainfall on Sunday. The day time temperature was rising for the past two days with the maximum temperature of 34.6 degrees C being recorded on Sunday. The rainfall activity is likely to increase in the week and could even result in heavy rainfall of 6.4cm of rain in 24 hours, the IMD said. In addition to this, a new low pressure area is likely to form by November 17 which is being observed by the IMD. Fishermen warnings have been issued for the Goa-Maharashtra coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-injured-by-lightning-as-goa-receives-thundershowers/articleshow/87704914.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Arora has taken possession of the 4,000-sq-ft flat. On November 2, the actor filed a withdrawal application with MahaRERA, stating she and the promoters had amicably settled the dispute. Arora had booked the Rs 14.5 crore flat in the ‘81 Aureate’ high-rise project in Bandra (West) in February 2017. The project is the free-sale component in a slum rehabilitation project promoted by Pyramid Developers and Ultra Lifespaces (formerly known as Satra Buildcon). Pyramid Developers had earlier run into trouble with the authorities. Arora said she had already paid around Rs 13 crore. In her complaint in October 2020, Arora alleged the promoters had committed to handing over possession of the flat on or before December 31, 2017, with a maximum grace period of six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malaika-amicably-settles-row-over-rs-14-5cr-flat-delay/articleshow/87705850.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad schools grapple with learning loss issues due to pandemic||AHMEDABAD: The ministry of education, government of India, has recently started a countrywide survey to assess learning loss among schoolchildren amid Covid-19 pandemic. In Gujarat while the state education department is planning to start a survey to evaluate the learning loss and find out measures to overcome these challenges, several schools are grappling with the issue where the writing skills of students have deteriorated and academic performance dipped immensely in the last 18 months. From issues in reading and writing skills to lack of confidence and poor show in pen-and-paper exams, the impact of disruptions in education caused by the pandemic is seen in some of the leading schools of the city. “Learning loss is a reality and there is a need to assess it. Having said this, we must also realize that learning loss is not permanent and can be worked upon. We plan to start bridge courses to reduce the learning loss. We need to identify the areas where they have fallen weak and find solutions. Once the in-person classrooms start normally we will begin work in this direction,” said Vinod Rao, Gujarat education secretary. Schools after shuttering down for a long time due to Covid-19 started reopening for the new academic year from July in a staggered manner. Most of these schools had switched to online education which still continues as government has allowed re-opening with limited student capacity. Also, parents are not willing to send their wards to school citing the risk of infection to children. Most self-financed schools in Ahmedabad are witnessing 25% attendance or even less. One of the indicators for the learning loss lie in the results of recent class tests held in pen-and-paper (offline) mode for Std 9-12 students. “In the recent exams held for Class 9 to Class 12 students, 50% students have shown significant decline in the offline test as compared to online exams held earlier. We have asked parents of such students to send their wards to schools so we can take special care to improve their learning,” said Fr Xavier Amalraj, principal of St Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall. He said that there has been lack of self-confidence and issues in written skills due to online education that has been going on for a long time now. Also, students are under mental stress due to online education. Many students who managed to get a perfect ten in the online exams held in last one and half years are seen struggling to even clear the unit test held in offline mode. C N Vidyalaya principal Hitesh Trivedi said that students of Class 9 are struggling to recite one-page from the textbooks. Students find it tough to sit for longer hours in school, he said. “Only those students whose parents have taken active interest in their studies have fared well in the written exams. The presentation skills of students have been negatively impacted. There is a 40% difference in the performance of students when the recent offline exam results are compared with online test results. All these issues can only be addressed once the schools start functioning normally,” according to Trivedi. According to Manan Chowksi, president of Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association and trustee of Udgam school, many meritorious students in Class 11 science have failed or scored below average. “We are yet to find out ways to overcome learning loss. Any remedial action is difficult at this stage for we are yet to determine areas where they have fallen behind,” said Chowksi. Indrani Banerjee, principal, H B Kapadia New High School, said that the confidence level of students has gone down. “This is reflected in their handwritings and presentation work,” according to Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-schools-grapple-with-learning-loss-issues-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/87704307.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Madurai||Madurai: Stagnant rainwater troubles vendors, customers in Mattuthavani market||MADURAI: The stagnating rainwater in some areas at Mattuthavani Central Vegetable Market is troubling customers and vendors alike besides helping mosquitos breed, said the vendors at the market. The Mattuthavani Central Vegetable Market sees hundreds of customers and vendors gather every day. Due to the recent rain in the district, rainwater has remained stagnant in the areas between some platforms. “Water keeps getting stagnant as and when it rains. Even after days, the water doesn’t get dried up and corporation workers are not doing anything. Vendors like us are forced to set up shop next to it. Customers don’t even want to buy from us as the water remains in such an unhygienic manner. It is repulsive to us too,” said N Shanthi, a vegetable vendor. Vendors said that it is also leading to breeding of mosquitoes. “With dengue cases being reported in Madurai, we are worried as stagnant water can easily become a ground for breeding dengue-causing mosquitoes. Not just mosquitoes, other insects are also attracted to the water making it difficult for us to be so close to it with our vegetables. But still we have no choice,” said M Mayee, another vendor. It was also alleged that the corporation workers did not come regularly to collect the wet vegetable waste from the market but only once in a few days and are also not collecting it from all interior areas of the market. Further, due to rain, the path to the public restroom used by vendors has also turned muddy and slippery with stagnant water. Madurai City Corporation commissioner KP Karthikeyan, meanwhile, said that separate teams are in place for cleaning the Central Vegetable Market and they will appropriately take measures to resolve any issue if complaints are raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stagnant-rainwater-troubles-vendors-customers-in-mattuthavani-market/articleshow/87704816.cms||---

Dhami has been selected as a standby player among the 20 players selected for this month’s Junior Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar. Eighteen players are part of the final squad while two players, including Dhami, are selected as standby, but will be with the team for the entire duration of the junior WC in Bhubaneswar. Though many hockey players from the state have represented the country, all of them were from the timewhen Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh. Notably, no male international hockey player has ever come from the Pithoragarh district until Dhami. Coming from the Katiyani village which lies on the outskirts of Pithoragarh district, Dhami had been on the radar of the national selectors for a while now after he won gold in the U-17 Nehru Cup tournament and a bronze medal at the junior nationals representing Haryana. Coming from a humble family, Dhami was brought to Tanakpur by his hockey enthusiast uncle Prakash Singh in order to avail better hockey facilities. Later, Dhami was enrolled at Doon’s Maharana Pratap Sports College in order to avail good coaching and better facilities. “Financially, we were not strong and therefore, we had to send Bobby to the Doon sports college where facilities are for free and an athlete gets a complete diet. My lifetime dream is finally achieved after my nephew has been selected for the WC,” said a jubilant Singh. The 20-year-old forward was sent to SAI Sonepat in 2018 for advanced training. There, he went on to represent Haryana in age group teams. Recently, Dhami has been selected for a job in the Indian Air Force under sports quota and will officially join after the World Cup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-its-1st-ever-mens-player-selected-in-wc-bound-national-hockey-team-in-21-years/articleshow/87704314.cms||Mohammad Anab

At least the panchayat should give us some relief,” one stakeholder said. Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes said he would look into the feasibility of the proposal. Gram sabha attendees also called for police to act against nuisance makers on the beach. Many tourists take liquor bottles to the beach and dump the empty bottles there, especially at night. The broken bottles then pose a danger to others, they pointed out. Villagers also said touts and pimps continue to be active on the beachfront, despite the presence of the tourist security force. Stakeholders also pointed out that 99% of the tourists visiting Candolim are moving around without masks, but none are being fined. The sarpanch said he would write to the police to take action. A number of other issues, including haphazard parking of vehicles on the roads and large resorts bringing in outside vehicles, thereby depriving local taxi owners of business, were also raised at the meeting.

The police identified the accused as Rahul of Memala near Vithura. The police said that the alleged fraud was reported at Vithura Fuels located at Chennanpara between March, 2020 and July, 2021. Rahul's wife Neenu Raj, who worked as an accountant at the fuel station is the prime accused in the case. She allegedly tampered with the accounts register and billing software of the fuel station to divert funds at regular intervals. She also allegedly created relevant forged documents to cover up the fraud from their employers. Rahul was a temporary staff of the same fuel station. He is accused of disposing of the ill earned money by purchasing land properties and vehicles in the names of their relatives. The fuel station was owned by an NRI couple. They found out about the fraud when they returned three months ago and conducted an audit of the accounts. Following this they filed a complaint before the police. Neena and Rahul sought a month's time to pay back the entire amount to settle the case. But two weeks ago they went absconding. Neena filed for an anticipatory bail plea before the district sessions court here. He was caught when he secretly visited his house on Friday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-arrested-for-fraud/articleshow/87690469.cms||---

However, it has now risen to 8 per cent in rural areas and 12-14 per cent in urban areas. The numbers are expected to increase further, especially as obesity is now on the rise among adolescent children,” said Dr Subbiah Eagappan, head, department of diabetology, Government Rajaji Hospital. He added that due to the lockdown, adolescent children are more prone to obesity and girls and women are at more risk. At Government Rajaji Hospital, an awareness programme was organized on Saturday with doctors addressing on diabetes, in which Tamil orator G Gnanasambandam delivered a special address. Dr AJ Asirvatham, chairman of Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India, said that the pandemic has made it difficult for patients to go for check up and hence it is difficult to spot and monitor diabetic patients. “Further, Covid-19 can predispose patients to diabetes. It can push pre-diabetic patients to diabetic status. The causes are mainly stress and use of steroids in treatment of Covid-19. The recovery period is six weeks. If a person shows no high blood sugar in that period after getting Covid-19, it is unlikely they’ll develop diabetes,” he said. At the same time, SARS nCoV-2 virus can damage pancreatic cells as well which can lead to diabetes but it is reported in only around 1 per cent of cases. “At GRH alone, we had a couple of cases wherein pancreatic cells were damaged. Covid-19 unmasks diabetes and it has been seen that around 36 per cent of Covid-19 patients are newly diagnosed with diabetes. Even if these patients didn’t get Covid-19, they’ll still be diabetic later in a few years,” said Dr Subbiah Eagappan. Dr CR Magesh Babu, senior consultant at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre said that people who have a family history of type 2 diabetes should go for screening test once they cross the age of 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/diabetes-cases-likely-to-go-up-further-in-tn-say-docs/articleshow/87704831.cms||---

The germplasm conservation centre – built by the research wing of the forest department over three years using compensatory afforestation (CAMPA) funds - displays scientific, ecological, medicinal and cultural information related to all 90 grass species. Officials involved said some of the grass species housed at the centre, which is divided into seven segments, play a key role in controlling forest fires while others are good at averting human-wildlife incidents through their pungent grass-blade smell. The conservatory, which has segmented grass species into aromatic, medicinal, fodder, ornamental, religiously- important, agricultural and miscellaneous, aims to recognize the role of various types of grasslands in the ecosystem and promote threatened species. Authorities said carbon sequestration, the process of vegetation capturing and storing atmospheric carbon, has gone down due to urbanization, deforestation and intensive mining. Chief conservator of forests (research wing) Sanjiv Chaturvedi, whose idea it was to build the conservatory, told TOI, “Grasslands hold more than a third of the world’s land-based carbon. Most of that carbon is not touched by wildfires, which typically just burn through above-ground vegetation. In fact, fires can even promote the growth of grasslands and even help them store carbon more efficiently. In forests, severe wildfires release large quantities of carbon into the air and it can take trees decades to recover from that. Certain species of grass stop wildfires.” The conservatory houses the fire-resistant “Thysanolaena maxima” species, also known as tiger grass or broom grass. “Found along steep hills, ravines and sandy river banks up to an altitude of 2,000 metres in Uttarakhand, its dry flowering stocks are used as brooms by locals and the green portion, which grows round the year, as fodder. The perennial species also prevents erosion on steep slopes and is planted to revive barren lands. This grass is widely being planted across Nepal for slope stabilization and soil moisture retention,” Chaturvedi added. The scientist in-charge of the Doon office of the Botanical Survey of India, SK Singh, lauded the initiative. “Some species of grass, which serve as fodder for livestock, as well as some bamboo species that have multifarious utility, do require germplasm conservation,” he told TOI. Notably, the fragmentation of grasslands in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the population of the Great Indian Bustard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-develops-indias-1st-grass-conservatory-at-ranikhet-with-90-species/articleshow/87704347.cms||Shivani Azad

The highest rainfall in the state was recorded in Ernakulam with Cochin airport area and North Paravur receiving 19cm rainfall. Aluva followed close behind with 15cm while Konni in Pathanamthitta and West Kallada in Kollam recorded 14cm of rainfall each. The IMD had issued a red alert on Sunday for Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur districts. A very heavy rainfall warning has been sounded for six districts on Monday---Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod. “The two main systems bringing rainfall to Kerala region are a cyclonic circulation over Southeast Arabian sea extending up to 3.1km above mean sea level and a trough that runs from the cyclonic circulation to southwest Bay of Bengal across north Kerala up to the same level,” said P S Biju, scientist, India Meteorological Department, Thiruvananthapuram. Thunderstorms with lightning accompanied by gusty wind speed reaching 30-40kmph are very likely at one or two places over Kerala on Monday. Fishermen have been advised not to go to sea as strong wind with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60kmph is likely to prevail over southeast and east-central Arabian Sea. Two other systems are also approaching the peninsular region, one on the east coast, as a low-pressure area lies over central parts of Andaman Sea. It is likely to concentrate into a depression over west-central Bay of Bengal by November 17. On the west coast, a fresh low-pressure area is likely to form over east central Arabian Sea off south Maharashtra-Goa coasts around the same time. The Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) has asked district administrations to shift people living in landslide and flood-prone areas to relocate to safer places or relief camps as there is a possibility of widespread rains in the coming days. The southern railway informed that due to the landslip between Kuliturai and Eraniel railway stations in Nagercoil-Thiruvananthapuram sections, train services along the route have been totally cancelled or partially cancelled. It said that the restoration work at the landslip spot is in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rains-to-continue-for-next-few-days/articleshow/87704345.cms||---

The meeting directed the district collectors to decide whether the schools should be allowed to function in those districts where a red alert has been sounded. At present, a red alert has been declared in Ernakulam, Thrissur and Idukki. Idukki and Kakki dams have been opened. The irrigation and power departments have been asked to closely monitor water levels in all the dams. Currently, four teams of national disaster response teams are camping in various places. Four more teams will be reaching the state on Monday. Two teams of defence security corps are ready in Kannur and Wayanad. They will be deployed to districts in an emergency. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) representatives who participated in the meeting said heavy rains were likely to continue for the next three days and rains were caused due to westerly winds. All the districts have been asked to follow the instructions and take necessary actions as laid out in the orange book. So far, seven landslides have been reported in the state after November 10. However, no casualties have been reported. The meeting also asked the district collectors to evacuate people from landslide-prone areas to relief camps and safer locations. Financial relief to the eligible should be disbursed at the earliest, the chief minister instructed. In addition to the chief minister, the meeting was attended by local self-government minister M V Govindan, devaswom and SC/ST welfare minister K Radhakrishnan, water resources minister Roshy Augustine, power minister K Krishnankutty, chief secretary V P Joy, additional chief secretaries of revenue and LSG departments, state police chief Anil Kant, disaster management commissioner A Kowsigan, representatives of IMD, Navy, fire force and other stakeholder departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-holds-high-level-review-meet/articleshow/87704363.cms||---

Speaking at the launch of ‘Momentum Country and Global Leadership: India-Yash’, an initiative to engage adolescents and youth in taking decisions with respect to their reproductive health and well-being, experts pointed out the need to increase awareness about family planning (FP) and reproductive health (RH). The initiative was launched by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “Through this four-year project, India-Yash will focus on family planning and reproductive health for those in the age group of 10 to 29 years and leave behind scalable and sustainable models for young people to take charge of their sexual and reproductive well-being,” said Dr Koki Agarwal, director, Momentum Country and Global leadership. One of the key highlights of the initiative which sets it apart from many others is that it includes the much neglected 10 to 15-year- olds in the dialogue on sexual and reproductive health, who are often left behind. It will be done by involving youngsters in identifying problems specific to these age groups and designing solutions for the same. “The project will support the FP/RH needs of India’s marginalized youth in urban and rural areas of Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in the first phase and later on it will be replicated in other parts of the country,” said Sangita Patel, director, health office, USAID/India, adding that although Telangana is better placed than many other states, more awareness is needed. To include the youngsters in the dialogue, an innovation challenge will be held to invite ideas, hand-hold them and provide incubation support to help them turn into scalable models. “With this we will bring about a shift in power dynamics from health market players to clients (young people) and support an enabling environment for adolescent and youth-friendly health services,” said Dr Somesh Kumar, country director, Jhpiego India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/youth-need-awareness-on-reproductive-health/articleshow/87704874.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Opening of flyover likely to get delayed||Vijayawada: Commuters may have to cope with the traffic problems on Ramavarappadu ring road for a few more days as the opening of Benz circle flyover is likely to delay. The project which was slated for inauguration on Sunday got delayed in view of the busy schedule of Union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari. Travelling on NH-16 from Benz circle to Ramavarappadu is the toughest task for the denizens. The five-km ride usually takes around 35 minutes and minor road mishaps are prevalent on this stretch. People had been demanding a flyover for the last two decades and the Union government approved the proposal in 2016. Construction of the first flyover took around 2 years and traffic problems reduced significantly after it became functional in 2020. Traffic towards Chennai is easily passing through the Benz circle junction in five minutes while traffic towards Kolkata is taking around 30 minutes in peak hours. The agency finished the works of the second flyover in a record time of one year and completed load testing. Officials launched the trial run on November 6, 2021 and are waiting for the road transport minister’s appointment for inauguration. “City police are permitting vehicles for a limited time in the name of trial run. We are still facing traffic problems though works have been completed ahead of the deadline. NHAI should inaugurate the flyover soon,” Md Naggor, a techie, said. Meanwhile, NHAI authorities said they are waiting for a convenient date for both chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Union minister Gadkari to inaugurate the flyover virtually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/opening-of-flyover-likely-to-get-delayed/articleshow/87704361.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Child dies after falling into canal||THRISSUR: A three-year-old boy lost his life after he fell into a canal in Kottanellur in Mukundapural taluk on Sunday. The boy, identified as Arrow Heaven, ran away from his mother while she was taking him for a bath and accidentally fell into a canal. Police said though the mother jumped into the canal she was not able to rescue the child as he was swept away in the strong currents of the canal flowing in full spate in the wake of the heavy rains in the region. Police and fire-brigade personnel launched a joint search operation for the boy but they were able to retrieve the body only by the evening and it was later shifted to the General Hospital in Irinjalakuda. Meanwhile, the sluice gate of Poringalkuthu Dam was reopened following rise in the water level in the reservoir. A KSEB official in charge of the dam said the dam was opened after the water level in the reservoir rose above 420 meters. The release of about 3000 cusecs of water from Parambikkulam was a major reason for the rise in the water level in Poringalkuthu Dam. However, the water level showed signs of receding after the rain abated over the day. Water level in the Chalakudy River rise to 3m following the opening of the sluice gate of the PoringalkuthuDdam. However, the authorities said there was no need for panic as the water level in the river is well below the danger mark. Shutters of the Peechi dam have also been raised further, following the rise in the water level in the reservoir. Several low-lying areas near Kodungallur were flooded in the incessant rains that lashed the district, where a red alert has been issued on Sunday afternoon. Relief camps have been opened at Athirappilli, Pariyaram and Edavilangu, and altogether 64 people have been shifted from the area. Visitors have been banned in the beaches and night travel has been banned in the hill ranges, official sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/child-dies-after-falling-into-canal/articleshow/87704370.cms||---

---||Delhi||Doctor who? Recognition for man who helped Delhi breathe easier||NEW DELHI: An ace clinician, mentor to hundreds of top doctors, trendsetter and researcher whose pathbreaking study gave Delhi a chance at fighting pollution, Dr Jitendra Nath Pande was all these and more. The pulmonologist succumbed to Covid-19 in May 2020 but he was remembered with gratitude when being conferred the Padma Shri last week. “I will never forget a call I received as a teenager one evening from the then prime minister's secretary, letting me know that the PM was on his way to see his wife, hospitalised with a mild illness in my father's ward at AIIMS,” recalled his son, Aman Pande, a pulmonologist at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, US. “My dad, who had poured himself his evening's whiskey, calmly took the phone and informed the caller that his senior resident would be happy to update the PM.” What most doctors who have known Pande remember is how he provided the same treatment and care to the poorest of the poor and the highest of the high. “He treated princes and presidents with the same empathy that he showed the poor,” Aman told TOI. “He was known for seeing the crowds of patients at the clinic strictly in the order they arrived. He almost took pleasure in telling those who tried to jump citing their status to get to the end of the line.” Born in UP’s Shikohabad in 1941, Pande did his MBBS and MD from AIIMS, specialising in pulmonary medicine. At 48, he was one of the youngest to be appointed a professor of medicine. He served as head of the department of medicine at AIIMS from 1993 until his retirement in 2003. He also served as an expert on several government bodies, including the Indian Council of Medical Research, and was actively involved in the investigation of the Bhopal gas tragedy. After his retirement, he continued to practice pulmonary medicine as a consultant at Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research. The capital city will have Pande to thank for finding the correlation between air pollution and emergency room visits by people. “The study that established this was his brainchild. It found a 20-25% rise in emergency visits with acute asthma, chronic inflammatory lung disease and heart attacks with increased levels of air pollution in the previous 48 hours,” said Dr G C Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, and member of the study team. The Supreme Court took cognisance of this study in its 1998 order banning diesel buses from the streets of Delhi and replacing them with CNG vehicles and packing off small-scale industries from residential areas. Before things again took a turn for the worse, Pande’s research gave Delhi a chance to curb pollution. Khilnani says Pande took respiratory medicine to the next level in India. “He performed the first fibre-optic bronchoscopy in India,” the doctor revealed. Pande also established the country’s first medical intensive care unit at AIIMS in 1993. Dedicated as he was to medicine, Pande enjoyed teaching even more. “He would happily take the ‘introduction to medicine’ class for third-semester students,” said Khilnani. Among Pande’s many students is Dr Anoop Misra, executive chairman, Fortis C-DOC Hospital for Diabetes and Allied Sciences. Misra recollected Pande excelling in everything he did, even repairing medical gadgets. Remembering the pulmonologist’s brilliance in clinical diagnosis, Misra said, “He had an extra-clinical sense and made quick diagnoses and was always bang on.” Pande’s students now practise across the globe. “He was instrumental in helping us establish pulmonary medicine in Nepal,” wrote Dr Narendra Bhatta, head of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. Some of Pande’s students and acquaintances feel the Padma Shri is “too little, too late” for such a legend but most have welcomed the government’s move. “He is the most suited for this award and I am really overwhelmed that the government has recognised his contribution to the field of medical education and healthcare,” says Khilnani. He will be remembered for being extraordinarily honest to the profession and for never giving in to any pressure, political or whatsoever, says Misra. “This is what Pande taught us, and this is the legacy we carry forward,” he adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctor-who-recognition-for-man-who-helped-delhi-breathe-easier/articleshow/87704875.cms||Yudhajit Shankar Das

The fact came to light when the police verified the content on the mobile phones of the accused. The phones used by the accused cost atleast Rs 60,000. “In the phones of these accused, we found photos of them using high-end cars and bikes,” sources in Mancherial police told TOI. The accused Robin Khan, Sahib and Harish are from Nuh district and Ejaj Ahmed Khan is a resident of Palwal in Haryana. The accused used to earlier steal tyres from vehicles parked on highways. Later, with the help of some of their villagers, they learnt the various methods of stealing cash from ATM machines including cutting the ATM cash chest with a gas cutter. “So far, we have seized 60 ATM cards from the possession of the accused. The accused claimed that in their village, ATM cards are given on rent by many people on a commission of Rs 1,000 per card. When we verified the bank transactions, we learnt that there were lakhs of rupees in each account,” police said. In Mancherial, the accused were arrested for breaking open the ATM of a public sector bank with a key they had bought from abroad. The key helps access a button through which one can turn the ATM machine on and off. The accused would turn the machine off when the mouth of the cash dispenser is open and just before the ATM machine dispenses the cash and the cash-dispensing sound. Using fingers, they would pull the cash out and lodge a complaint with the call center claiming that a sum of money from their bank account has been deducted but they did not get the money and successfully received the reimbursement. A suspect sheet was opened against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/atm-heist-accused-own-high-end-cars-and-bikes/articleshow/87704881.cms||Srinath Vudali

Out of 15 puppies, four puppies were adopted by the visitors. All Animals Foundation, an NGO, organised the programme to promote adoption of stray puppies for the first time at the park. “We often found that most of the puppies would roam on the roads and die after coming under the wheels of vehicles. To protect them and to promote the adoption of stray dogs, we have decided to give puppies to people who are interested in adopting them,” Santosh Reddy, one of the organisers, told TOI. The organisers said that most people prefer different dog breeds and spend lakhs of rupees to get them, but animal lovers who cannot afford to spend too much money to buy dogs can adopt these puppies for free. “We have nearly 1,500 fosters in the city who pick these puppies from the roads and hand them over to us. We vaccinate these puppies soon after they are taken from the fosters to protect them from diseases. We accept only puppies that are 30 days old,” said Reddy. Though the puppies are given free of cost, Rs 350 is collected towards the cost of the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stray-puppies-find-home-in-adoption-drive-at-kbr-park/articleshow/87704892.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Shatabdi fare to drop by Rs 90||Chandigarh: With reduction of Covid-19 cases across the country and pressure from passengers over the hike in fares, the railways has decided to discontinue the ‘special’ tag and restore operations of all Shatabdis, mail and express trains to their earlier schedule and revert to pre-pandemic ticket prices with immediate effect. The railway board announced trains will now be operated with their regular numbers and fares will revert to normal pre-Covid prices. As per this railway ministry decision, fares of Shatabdi, mail and express trains will be restored within this week as per the software upgradation, said Ambala divisional railway manager Gurinder Mohan Singh. The train fare for Chandigarh Shatabdi Express under special category is Rs 670 (under flexi fare) per passenger, which after removal of the special tag, will come down to Rs 580 per ticket. For train from Chandigarh to Amritsar, the fare existing during the special category is Rs 480 in AC chair car. It will come down to Rs 430 per ticket. An official statement read that Covid-19 restrictions, which were imposed during the pandemic, will continue. Curbs such as temporary restrictions on concessions, bedrolls and meal services will remain in effect but the fare will be restored. However, sources in railways said the fare once restored will not be refunded to those who have already booked tickets for special category trains. The status of special trains will be removed from all the MSPC and the HSP trains giving a major relief to passengers. "The first digit will now not be zero as was in the case of special trains,” another official said. Since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, the railways has only been running special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now even short-distance passenger services are being run as special trains with “slightly higher fares” to “discourage people from avoidable travels”. The railways had stopped passenger services in March last year due to the pandemic, gradually resuming services from May 2020 in a phased manner. However, most of the resumed trains were operating as ‘special trains’ for which ticket prices were higher than regular trains, without concessions for senior citizens. The number for these train numbers began with ‘0’. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has been asked to make necessary changes in the software to reflect the changes. Additionally, each zonal railway has been directed to ensure that necessary arrangements are made to make the details available to all the concerned staff well in advance and necessary changes are made in the database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shatabdi-fare-to-drop-by-rs-90/articleshow/87704377.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Kochi||Idukki dam opened, TN issues first warning at Mullaperiyar||Idukki: Just about two weeks after closing down the shutters of the Idukki dam, authorities opened one of them again on Sunday following heavy rains. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine said the dam’s shutter number three was opened before the water level reached the red alert mark to avoid a flood risk. The shutter was raised by 40cm releasing 40-50cusec of water when the water level rose to 2,398.90ft. As per the rule curve, red alert is declared when the water level goes up to 2,399.03ft while the upper rule level has been fixed at 2,400.03ft. The minister said more water will be released from the dam if the rains continue. KSEB had earlier opened three shutters of the dam on October 19 following continuous rainfall in the catchment areas and closed them on October 27. A KSEB dam safety official said the dam was opened in anticipation of the heavy rainfall predicted in the region. This is the first time that the dam has been opened in November. “The dam was opened before the waters reached the red alert mark to avoid flood risk. It is a lesson we have learnt from the 2018 floods,” said James Wilson, a member of KSEB advisory board. “The dam was opened in 1981 and 1992 not to control the flood situation. But in 2018, the dam was opened to prevent flooding following extreme rains,” he said. Even as a shutter has been opened the water level has been continuing to rise and crossed the red alert mark, reaching 2399.06ft at 7pm. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has issued the first flood warning at Mullaperiyar Dam with the water level reaching 140ft on Sunday morning. Idukki collector Sheeba George said as there is a possibility of opening the spillway shutters of the dam those living close to the river banks should take precautionary measures. The upper rule level fixed by the Central Water Commission till November 20 is at 141ft and the maximum storage level is 142ft. The ban on mining, quarry and tourism activities will continue. The collector also stopped MNREGA works and plantation sector works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-dam-opened-tn-issues-first-warning-at-mullaperiyar/articleshow/87704397.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Retail prices scalding pockets||AHMEDABAD: This year’s Navratri-Diwali festive season spelt good news for many industrial and consumer products segments as pent-up demand pushed up sales volumes. Even though consumers splurged on festive shopping sprees, they paid higher prices for a range of commodities. An increase in raw material prices for cotton, oilseeds, coal and natural gas or even steel, semiconductors, metal and other basic chemicals, caused end product prices to rise in many sectors. While apparels are expected to get costlier in the coming fortnight, the price of consumer electronics, ceramic tiles, real estate properties and even edible oil prices are on the boil. Prices of apparel, made-ups to rise by 15%With prices of cotton touching record-high levels of Rs 68,000 per bale, and that of dyes and chemicals used for textile processing almost doubling in the span of a month or two, the prices of cotton apparel and made-ups will increase by 15-25% in a fortnight or so, suggest industry players. “Higher prices of cotton are hurting manufacturers, many of whom have temporarily stopped buying cotton to reduce cost-pressures. With cotton prices increasing, even yarn prices have increased due to increased demand from China, where there are production shortages. These being major raw materials for manufacturing textiles, apparels and made-ups, it will certainly lead to an increase in prices,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council. Basic chemicals used in textile process houses have also become costlier. “Besides the cost of dyes and chemicals, the prices of coal – which is used to operate boilers – have also increased. This has added to our cost of production and it is not viable to do business without passing them on. To keep basic liquidity, we have no choice but to increase the job charges which will add to the cost of polyester sarees, fabrics and dress materials,” said Pramod Chaudhary, ex-president, South Gujarat Textile Processors’ Association (SGTPA). Industry players have also raised concerns over the GST Council’s proposed plan to implement an increase in GST rates on fabrics and garments from 5% to 12% effective January 1, 2022. “If the GST rates increase, apparel and made-up will get even more expensive and this in the longer run may affect cost-competitiveness of apparel makers and hit order volumes and demand,” said Rahul Mehta, chief mentor, Clothing Manufacturers’ Association of India (CMAI). Consumer electronics, home appliances get dearerCome Diwali and a lot of people wait for the annual Diwali discounts on a range of consumer products and home appliances to make their purchases. However, this Diwali, consumers have paid at least 15% more on televisions, air conditioners, washing machines and given the semiconductor shortage and rise in prices of other raw materials. Bhavesh Waria, president, Ahmedabad Electronics Dealers’ Association (AEDA), said, “From April to October 2021, a slew of raw materials including copper, aluminium and plastic parts became expensive. These are widely used in manufacturing of consumer electronics and home appliances and over the past six to seven months, the consumer electronics have become costlier by at least 10-15% due to costlier raw materials.” Makers of electronics and home appliances are battling production woes amid a steep semiconductor shortage, which is affecting production in a big way. “At present, dealers are not facing any issues because the demand has not remained so great even during the festive season. However, the shortage of semiconductor is getting worse for manufacturers with demand only increasing. Therefore, consumers who plan to buy electronics may buckle up for another likely increase in prices by 3-5%,” Waria added. Edible oil prices on the boilEdible oil prices rallied substantially in the domestic market over the past one year. High prices of imported oils such as sunflower and palm oil, as well as a surge in oilseed prices amid Covid-19 induced disruptions, kept edible oil prices on the boil. The retail prices of sunflower oil (packed) in Ahmedabad shot up by 55% to Rs 160 per kg on November 10 this year from Rs 103 per kg on the same date last year, according to the data compiled by the union ministry of consumers affairs. During the same period, the per kilogram price of soya oil firmed up by 46% to Rs 150 from Rs 103. While mustard oil price jumped 75% to Rs 175 from Rs 100, palm oil increased 28% to Rs 110 from Rs 86. “Edible oil prices remain high only when oilseed prices are high. Most importantly, high prices of imported oils such as sunflower and palm also kept domestic oils such as mustard at firm levels,” said Sameer Shah, president, Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (GSEOOSA). Sunflower, palm, and soya oil price fluctuations are dependent on international market trends. Worldwide, the supply of these oils was lesser than the demand. Also, a significant chunk of these vegetable oils went into biodiesel production, which further affected its availability. High prices of oilseeds kept edible oil prices firm amid less supply of vegetable oils around the world. India’s 65% edible oil demand is met through imports. However, groundnut oil prices were less volatile as groundnut production was plentiful. Groundnut oil prices rose only 9% annually as of November 10, 2021. Ceramic tiles prices rise 30-40%Faced with back-to-back surge in prices of natural gas and higher transportation and raw material costs, tile makers in Morbi, India’s largest cluster of ceramic tile industry, have raised the prices of their finished products by an average of 30-40%. Since the beginning of August this year, the price of industrial piped natural gas supplied to the tile manufacturing units in Morbi has firmed up to Rs 58 per standard cubic meter (SCM) for 3-month minimum guaranteed offtake (MGO) from Rs 33.14 per SCM (excluding tax). The tile makers revised prices of tiles — vitrified, wall and floor tiles — thrice to pass on higher production to consumers. As a result, retail prices of various ceramic tiles have also surged by 30-40% in tandem with the wholesale prices, said tile makers in Morbi. Property gets 10-15% dearerWith key raw materials such as cement, steel, hardware and sanitary ware as well as transportation becoming costlier, real estate developers have seen their production cost moving up by an average of 20%. “The raw material price surge has pushed up construction costs by at least Rs 300 to Rs 500 per square feet in Ahmedabad. On an average the cost has gone up by 20%. It will increase further,” said Chitrak Shah, vice-president of CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers. “However, the developers have not passed on the entire burden onto consumers. Hence, the retail prices of properties, mainly residential ones, have risen by 10-15%,” added Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/retail-prices-scalding-pockets/articleshow/87704393.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Power panel okays purchase from SECI||AMARAVATI: Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has stamped its nod for the purchase of power from Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). The distribution companies wanted to purchase about 7,000 mw of power from the SECI. The APERC has asked the state government to ensure that the annual procurement does not increase the maximum ceiling of 17,000 million units.  Discoms have filed an application with the APERC seeking approval for an interim power procurement with a plan purchase of 7,000 MW of solar power from SECI in a phased manner commencing from September 2024. Discoms have also requested ERC to allow them into a tripartite agreement along with state government and SECI for procurement of power for a period of 25 years.  In their request, discoms said that Centre has pledged in Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 to 35% between 2005 and 2030 at COP21 deliberations and to that effect it has been focusing on accelerated use of clean and renewable energy by 40% by 2030. Centre had also set a target to achieve 450 GW renewable energy installed capacity by 2030. It felt that there is a need to reduce the cost of service while ensuring quality power and 9-hours daytime free power supply to farmers in view of the state government’s mission of achieving sustainable agriculture while lowering cost of cultivation and increasing farmers’ income.  It has been estimated that the subsidy support for free power supply to agriculture is likely to increase from Rs 8,900 crore in 2020-21 to around Rs 17,819 crore by 2030-31 considering release of new connections of 50,000 per year. With a view to de-risk the discoms as soon as possible from the burden of agricultural consumption, the government wanted to ensure direct payment through an exclusive payment security mechanism for purchase of power for agriculture needs.  The commission said it has examined the request of the discoms and the approved load forecasts and resource plans. Commission said the demand forecast is comparable to the indicative forecasts of the resource plan. “Therefore, the commission finds that the proposed quantum of procurement is in accordance with the projected requirements. Further, as justified by the discoms, the country’s march towards integrating more renewable sources is the need of the hour in view of the COP21 commitments,” said the commission. It further observed that procurement of the proposed energy is necessary and in the best interests of the power sector in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/power-panel-okays-purchase-from-seci/articleshow/87704389.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||DU colleges yet to take final call on reopening hostels||NEW DELHI: Though several students’ organisations have been demanding reopening of college campuses, senior officials of Delhi University (DU) say no decision has been taken yet on the issue. The modalities regarding hostel accommodation are also pending with the varsity. Speaking to TOI, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said before reopening, the varsity also had to keep in mind the large number of outstation students from states where the Covid-19 caseload was still high. “Our situation is very different as we have a large number of students from various states. There are a good number of Covid-19 cases in some states. Before reopening, we need to consider these aspects too. It will mean that students from such states will have to travel to Delhi. For schools, it’s a different matter as they are more localised and students are from the city itself. We will wait for a couple of weeks before taking a call,” added Singh. For outstation students, accommodation in hostels, where they usually share rooms, is another concern. While several college principals said they were waiting for detailed guidelines, senior DU officials said it was unlikely that colleges would reopen for all courses at one go. Rajeev Gupta, dean of students’ welfare at DU, said, “Currently, several MPhil, PhD and postgraduate students are already living in the university hostels. Most hostels have taken the call to not take fresh admissions for now, so undergraduate students have not been admitted. We will wait for a few more weeks to get clarity.” “Once classes star, we will see if it’s possible to call students from science courses or those requiring practical work to the campus. It’s too early to say as we need to first identify who all will be called. However, if only students requiring laboratories are called, it will cut down the numbers requiring the hostels. They might not have to share rooms, but the final call will be taken later,” Gupta explained. Suman Sharma, principal of Lady Shri Ram College for Women, said, “While it’s difficult to comment right now, based on the current pandemic situation it looks like sharing rooms will not be possible. The rooms may have to be converted into single occupancies. However, we will decide on this later.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-colleges-yet-to-take-final-call-on-reopening-hostels/articleshow/87704901.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has taken up various civic works including building retaining walls, road levelling, levelling of service roads and other works at the Road under Bridge (RuB) at Tukaram Gate. Locals of Tukaram Gate, Addagutta, and other colonies are irked by the inordinate delay in completion of works. “How long do we have to suffer with dust pollution. Moreover, the earthmovers make loud noises and create nuisance even late in the night,” said B Giridhar, a resident of Tukaram Gate. The residents said that the works were halted during the last two months due to heavy rains and the site became soaked with rainwater. Though the RuB works had begun in end of 2020, the project an into delays due to several hurdles such as land acquisition, finalisation of designs, court cases, heavy downpour, shortage of workers and pandemic. The residents also alleged that the by-lanes adjacent to the RuB have become congested as the construction waste is being dumped in these lanes. “We cannot park our vehicles in our premises or move them out due to the dumping of concrete waste,” said V Prabhakar Rao, another resident of Tukaram Gate. However, GHMC executive engineer, B Gopal said that if all goes well, the RuB will open to the public by next summer. “The RuB project should be completed by March and if that does not happen, then latest by June,” the officials said. Over 1.5 lakh commuters are expected to benefit with the construction of the RuB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/slow-pace-of-work-at-tukaram-gate-rub-irks-locals/articleshow/87704897.cms||Sunil Mungara

The condition is more severe in non-science students than science students. While 84% non-science PhD students showed some signs of depression the corresponding figure was 62% for science students. Students belonging to economically weaker sections, having limited knowledge of local language and earning less than Rs 20,000 were more likely to report moderate to severe depressive disorders. In addition, analyses of interviews of PhD students showed that financial hardship, disagreement with supervisors, compromised students’ support services and an uncertain job market were the key factors affecting the mental health of students and inhibiting academic performance. “Given the growing prevalence of depressive disorders among PhD students and limited systematic studies in the Indian context, we decided to conduct the study. In post-Covid times, it is most likely to have increased, especially due to the fear of lack of employment opportunities,” said Dr KR Thankappan from department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Central University of Kerala, who was part of the team that conducted the study about the prevalence of depressive disorders in PhD students. For the purpose of the study, a total of 240 PhD students from science and non-science streams of two public universities of Kerala one in Kasaragod and another in Thiruvananthapuram were interviewed. “The study found that there is a growing concern of depressive disorders among doctoral students in Kerala. While some of the factors causing depressive disorder may require attention at the university level, there were other factors such as financial issues and fear of unemployment that required systemic and policy interventions in a coordinated manner,” added Dr Thankappan. Educationists and psychiatrists said there is an immediate need to look into the mental health of students, both at school and university levels. “Our PhD students are a neglected lot. Permanent job opportunities are few, leading to frustration and crisis in career and life,” said educationist RVG Menon. “Our research set-up is more job oriented. Hence, though we have many research papers published from Kerala there are very few that make it to renowned international publications. Due to this, often a committed student faces not just performance bias, but biases of other kinds that lead to anxiety and depression,” said psychiatrist Dr CJ John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/68-phd-students-suffer-from-depression-study/articleshow/87704400.cms||Preetu Nair

Police identified the accused as Anish Ahmad and Suhaliya for plotting an extortion bid in order to clear their debts. Police said Ahmad knew garment trader Vibhu Gupta and worked as a staffer in his shop located at Panchvati Circle in Raja Park. Investigators claimed that Ahmad’s prior experience as an electrician came in handy while designing a ‘dummy bomb,’ which was a scare tactic to extort money from the trader. “The had accumulated a lot of debts and thought that Gupta would be an easy target if he could be scared into paying him some hefty amount,” an official said. The incident had taken place on Friday afternoon when an e-rickshaw driver delivered the cake in a box at Gupta’s shop. When Gupta opened the suspicious box, he saw some wires jutting out of it and a note asking him to travel in the same rickshaw with Rs 8 to Rs 10 lakh. The letter also threatened that if he failed to pay, the bomb would explode. Shaken after reading it, Gupta refused to take delivery of the box and returned it to the driver. The driver then took the cake home and found a digital watch, batteries and wires inside it. He panicked and threw it near a culvert. Police on Saturday early morning recovered the box and detained the driver, he told cops that a woman had paid him Rs 50 to deliver the box to Gupta’s store Police said the device did not have any explosives or detonators but contained small batteries and a few nails. Police then constituted a special team led by SHO Panna Lal to track down the woman and unearthed the entire conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-held-for-sending-fake-bomb-to-raja-park-trader-for-extortion/articleshow/87704922.cms||---

This is the seventh time KTR has written to the Centre urging it to sanction the project. In the latest letter, KTR pointed out that Sircilla has been a major hub of handloom and textiles activity for several decades and has the requisite ecosystem, including trained manpower required for such a mega powerloom cluster. He also pointed out that the state government has initiated several measures such as 40% input subsidy linked wage compensation scheme, thrift fund to handloom and powerloom weavers to boost this sector. He said that with the Centre’s support the state will not only be able to compete with other states but also other countries. “Over the past few years we have been observing that the Union government is announcing schemes and assistance to states which lack the necessary ecosystem or resources. All this at the expense of fast developing states like Telangana… I make an earnest appeal on behalf of people of Telangana to sanction the Mega Powerloom Cluster at Sircilla without further delay,” he added. --||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-urges-centre-to-sanction-mega-powerloom-cluster-at-sircilla/articleshow/87704425.cms||---

However, in most of the states, Congress is adopting a softened Hindutva policy to fight BJP. In Kerala, Congress member Rahul Gandhi took on a CPI candidate in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” a politburo member remarked. “Electoral understanding with Congress isn’t the only issue the politburo discussed. Congress’ policy on farmers’ issue is the same with BJP,” the member said. On reports that the party state secretariat has been allowed to take a call on Kodiyeri Balakrishnan returning as the state secretary, the leader said the politburo didn’t take up the matter for discussion. The draft of the party’s political resolution will be discussed at politburo before placing it before central committee to be held inJanuary.

The jawan, identified as Ganesh Kumar, belongs to Ashthawan in Nalanda district. The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of state police and intelligence agencies found some sensitive documents saved in his cellphone which should not have been there. He is on leave, sources said. City SP (west) Ashok Kumar Mishra said he was working as a nursing staff at AFMC, Pune. “Formal procedures of his arrest are being made after lodging an FIR against him,” Mishra said. Intelligence sources said Kumar came in touch with a Pakistani operative over WhatsApp around two years ago and was honeytrapped to pass on information about order of battle (ORBAT), which means location of Army units on ground. “Till now, investigation shows that Kumar didn’t either receive any monetary benefits for passing on the information or was blackmailed for it. He was purely honeytrapped after which he got involved in espionage. The PIO had posed as Indian Navy medical team staff to extract information from him,” a source said. Sources said the ATS, Patna police, Intelligence Bureau and Military Intelligence personnel were quizzing the soldier to know about the information and documents he shared related to Army units’ movement and location in the last couple of years. They said the cellphone found in his possession would be sent for forensic test so that any deleted chats and documents sent to the Pakistan operative over WhatsApp could be retrieved. “Further legal process is underway. Nothing much can be disclosed at present,” a source privy to the investigation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/army-jawan-held-for-sharing-documents-with-pak-intelligence-operative/articleshow/87704447.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Devotees will be allowed to have darshan only from Tuesday, on the first day of the Malayalam month of Vrishchikam. Due to the prevailing climatic conditions, the state government has decided to restrict the entry of devotees to Sabarimala in the initial days. Even though it was decided to allow 30,000 devotees for darshan per day, it has now been decided to restrict the number due to the adverse situation prevailing in Pathanamthitta district. The police and Travancore Devaswom Board will be taking a decision on how many devotees can be allowed each day, on Monday. Since a decision has been taken to restrict the number of devotees, the people who booked through virtual queue system will be given alternate dates for darshan. The police department has been asked to make necessary arrangements for this. It has been decided that devotees will not be allowed to take a ritualistic dip at Pamba until the water level decreases. Even though there was decision to begin spot booking at Nilackal, it has been temporarily postponed to reduce the rush of devotees. The authorities have decided to ensure that Swami Ayyappan trekking path is safe for trekking for devotees during the heavy rains. Travancore Devaswom Board and state health department have made it mandatory that the devotees coming for darshan should carry the Covid vaccination completion certificates or RT-PCR negative certificate of tests conducted 72 hours before the travel. For devotees choosing spot booking (when it starts), they should carry all the relevant documents to prove their address and identity. On Monday, the incumbent Melshanti V K Jayaraj Potti will open the sanctum sanctorum of the temple at 5pm and will light the lamp.

Requests for exemption should be made by candidates through schools, backed by medical reports. The first lot of such requests have to be made by November 25 by the schools. The CBSE circular that has reached schools, announcing these exemptions, also says that children who are participating in sports events recognised by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and those who have been selected to participate in the International Olympiads recognised by the Homi Bhaba Centre for Science Education, scheduled during the term one exams, are also eligible for this exemption. Candidates will have to furnish these details with letters from SAI and the Homi Bhaba Centre. No separate term one examination will be held for such candidates and their performance in term two exams will decide their results, the circular said. The reason for including sports in this category is to promote the spirit of sports among children in the country, the circular said. Schools will have to forward these requests to the regional offices of CBSE (Bhubaneshwar in case of West Bengal), which will scan these requests for their genuineness and then send confirmations to the respective schools. “Though there is no child with Covid as of bow among the board examinees, we have kept an isolation room ready with a doctor and a nurse in attendance. If any child develops symptoms we will move him to this isolation room and do the needful. Often not all cough and cold is Covid and an isolation room helps. The circular will put tense parents at ease too and they will not push a sick child to write the test,” said Loveleen Sehgal, principal of Birla High School. “We are all praying that none of our board examinees fall sick and are able to write term one but at least this assurance from the Board would help children relax in case they contract the virus despite all efforts,” said Asian International School principal, Vijaylakshmi Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jhimli-cbse-first-term-exception/articleshow/87704459.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

William Blair, the vice-president and chief executive of Lockheed Martin’s India operations, said the company is “well placed” to partner with Indian entities in areas of unmanned platforms, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and machine learning among others. He also pitched Lockheed’s F-21 aircraft, specifically configured to meet the IAF’s needs, as the best option in the force’s hunt for 114 combat jets. Lockheed has tied up with the Tata group to manufacture the aircraft in India and promised not to sell the F-21 to any other country provided it secures the multi-billion dollar deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-aerospace-major-looking-at-addressing-indias-needs/articleshow/87706082.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Businesses pick up near educational institutions||Mangaluru: The eateries, stationery shops, cafes, gaming centres and other shops situated close to educational institutions, catering to students, are slowly bouncing back, as business is picking up gradually. Nikith Mascarenhas, who runs a stationery shop and makes bulk sale of attendance registers in Vittal, had no business since the start of the pandemic. “Sales have improved from the past one month. Depending on the Covid situation, it may take at least a year for business to get back to normal, like in the days before the pandemic,” says Nikith, who is continuing his family business. The smiles on faces of proprietors of eateries and shopowners near educational institutions, who had little or no business, are back, as the educational institutions have reopened. Raj of Vihar Restaurant situated at St Aloysius College shares that business has improved since the reopening of colleges. However, the rise in the prices of raw materials including gas, is a burden on them. “We are in a Catch-22 situation as we cannot increase prices. Even if we hike prices, other shops situated nearby should also increase prices uniformly, or else students go to those places where prices are less. We cannot burden students too, whose families have suffered financially due to Covid-19,” he said, while recounting the difficulty of small eateries that cater to students. Normally eateries near educational institutions do business only when schools or colleges are open. “There is no business when students have holidays,” said the owner of another eatery near Car Street. “When schools and colleges are open, we have good demand for evening snacks. Parents who come to pick up their children from schools pay a visit to our shop,” said an eatery owner near Sri Venkataramana Temple in Car Street. Some students who frequented eateries for lunch and on breaks, have been avoiding it due to Covid-19. “They are bringing tiffin from home to avoid getting into crowded places,” said Naufal, who runs an eatery near Vamanjoor checkpost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/businesses-pick-up-near-educational-institutions/articleshow/87703708.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

They also blew the mud house by dynamite. The incident came to light on Sunday. According to locals, the Maoists raided the house of Saryu Singh Bhokta at around 7pm on Saturday. They shot his two sons — Satyendra Singh Bhokta and Mahendra Singh Bhokta — and their wives Manorama Devi and Sunita Devi. The Maoists stayed there for around two hours till 9pm. The Maoists left a pamphlet there, stating that their action was to avenge the March incident this year when four of their cadres — Shivpujan Kumar, Amresh Kumar, Sita Kumar and Uday Kumar — had been neutralised by the CoBRA battalion 205 at the same place. They alleged that the cadres were given poison in the meal, which caused their death. But in the police record, they were killed in an encounter. The Maoists blamed the Bhokta family for the fake encounter and alleged that they acted as police informers. Four AK-47 rifles had been recovered from their possession. The village is on the border of Gaya and Aurangabad districts. Spokesperson of Bihar, Jharkhand, North Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh (BJNCUP) Simant Regional Committee of the banned CPI(Maoists), Manas, in a press statement said that had they lost four brave comrades in a fake encounter. “We do not remorse the loss of lives if the supreme sacrifice is made in war field, but they were killed by betrayal in cold blood which warranted revenge,” Manas said. The Maoists also released two sets of photographs along with their statement. While the first set of four photos shows their slain cadres lying here and there in the house of Bhokta, the second set of four photographs shows four members of the same house hung by their neck in the courtyard. “We have avenged the betrayal and this would be the fate of anyone who backstabs our men,” the Maoists said in the press release. Police have launched a massive combing operation in the area. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar told a private news channel that the incident took place at the same house where an encounter took place in March this year in which four Maoist commanders were killed in an encounter. Earlier also, the Maoists had tried to find Saryu. On Saturday, when they did not find Saryu, they tortured his sons and daughters-in-law and later hanged them outside the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-kill-4-of-a-family-in-gaya/articleshow/87704464.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Minister announces Rs 10 crore for Naxal rehab in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli||MUMBAI: The state will extend full support to rehabilitate surrendered Maoists and bring them into the mainstream by allocating special funds for Gadchiroli district, guardian minister Eknath Shinde said on Sunday. Shinde was interacting with the media a day after 26 hardcore Maoists, including key Naxal leader and Yavatmal resident Milind Teltumbde, were gunned down on Saturday in one of the biggest police encounters of the year in Gadchiroli. “The action is a huge jolt for the Naxal movement not just in Maharashtra but across the country,” Shinde told the media in Thane. “We have already laid out a plan to bring the Naxal-infested areas into the mainstream and also chalked out rehabilitation plans for those who have surrendered. I have issued directions to allocate special Rs 10 crore in the district planning funds for ensuring these Naxals can start their own businesses and be self-reliant. We want them to be part of our initiative in bringing Gadchiroli on the development map,” he said. Speaking about the nine-hour encounter, the minister said the operation started after the Naxals opened fire on our teams. The slain Naxals, including Teltumbde, were involved in several killings of civilians and the police and were wanted in many states where their operations were active. “Our teams managed to break in through the three-tier cover around Teltumbde and managed to kill him. Following the death of Teltumbde, we are positive about weakening the Naxal movement in the area. Teltumbde was a major driving force for the Maoists operating in the region and nearby states of Chattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh as well and was a key person in their operations,” he said. Shinde lauded the efforts of the police teams, saying that despite injuries they still faced the Maoists. “Four of our police staff suffered injuries and were admitted to the local hospitals for treatment. I have spoken to the CM and home minister about rewarding the force working there,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minister-announces-rs-10-crore-for-naxal-rehab-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/87705889.cms||Manoj Badgeri

A most wanted criminal in Colombo, Chanuka was a close aide of Lokka.A CB-CID source said, “During inquiry, we learnt that the Chennai city police had arrested Chanuka in 2017. District CB-CID deputy superintendent of police P Sivakumar and team recently got a tip about Chanuka and were camping in Bengaluru city since November 6. They traced the whereabouts of Chanuka to Banaswadi with the help of CB-CID cyber cell and Karnataka cyber police.”The source said the team had conducted a door-to-door search to nab Chanuka. “When they showed Chanuka’s photo to a housemaid – Nagaraj – he confirmed the whereabouts of Chanuka. The team arrested Chanuka from an apartment at Banaswadi on Friday (Nov 12) along with 46-year-old T Gopalakrishnan alias Jayapal, a native of Srivilliputhur in Tamil Nadu, for providing him shelter at his younger sister’s apartment.”Jayapal, the source said, had introduced Chanuka to his sister as Nannan from Tamil Nadu and told her that he would stay for a few months for business purposes. “Her maid Nagaraj was instructed to provide food and all the essentials to Chanuka.”The source said the Kancheepuram Q-branch police had arrested Jayapal six months ago for providing shelter to Sri Lankan drug smuggler Suresh. He had come out on bail within two months of the arrest. The team had brought both Chanuka and Jayapal to the city on Saturday after obtaining the prisoner transit warrant from a Bengaluru court. “They were produced before chief judicial magistrate (CJM) M Sanjeevi Baskar the same night and remanded in judicial custody. We will file a petition before the CJM court on Monday, seeking their custody for seven days.” Lokka, who was wanted in more than eight murder cases and drug smuggling cases in Sri Lanka, had come to Tamil Nadu in 2017 by an illegal ferry.

However, the PG medicos decided not to join duty as they allege that they are being exploited instead of appointing senior specialist doctors for the pilgrimage season duty. “The Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association has decided not to comply with the decision taken by the health department to send PG residents for Sabarimala duty disguised as specialists,” said Dr Naveen R, state secretary of the association. “We have been exploited to the limits and this has to stop. We have sacrificed our specialty training period for the past two years as the state was in crisis due to the pandemic situation,” said Dr Athul Ashok, state president of the association. The PG residents have been taking extra duties in all medical college hospitals and in several Covid centres as the situation demanded it. There are only two batches of PG medicos presently in the state and NEET PG counselling for the fresh batch is yet to commence. Instead of posting qualified specialists with postgraduate degrees in the respective specialty from the directorate of medical education or directorate of health services, the authorities are trying a gimmick using the existing, heavily overworked PG students, said Dr Naveen. The virtual emergency medicine department planned at Sabarimala is being set up with the service of PG residents by pooling them from different departments of various medical colleges. There is a lack of permanent staff in the emergency medicine department and hence the PG medicos are being exploited to cover up these shortages. This is against our curriculum laid down by the Kerala University of Health Sciences and most of us have already completed the required casualty duties. Hence the health department will have to make alternate arrangements instead of putting us on Sabarimala duty, said Dr Akash, secretary of Thiruvananthapuram medical college unit of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pg-medicos-not-to-take-up-pilgrimage-duty/articleshow/87704472.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The family members of the deceased had earlier taken a stand to accept her body only if police arrest the school principal, Meera Jackson. Police had on Saturday booked her under Section 21 (punishment for failure to report or record a case) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Meera was the principal of the private matriculation school at RS Puram when the teacher, Mithun Chakravarthy, sexually harassed the girl. The school management had later transferred her to another school. After the arrest of Mithun, Meera had gone into hiding and police had on Saturday formed two special teams to nab her. “We traced her whereabouts to Bengaluru in Karnataka and arrested her in the early hours of the day. We have brought her to (RS Puram) police station and are questioning her,” an investigation officer told TOI. City deputy commissioner of police T Jayachandran, meanwhile, told the media that they had collected a piece of paper from the girl’s house mentioning about a person’s grandfather and another person’s father, who, she said, shouldn’t be spared. “We are trying to identify them. We are working on various angles to ascertain all the factors that pushed her to take the extreme step.” The 17-year-old girl had committed suicide by hanging at her residence on Thursday evening. The RS Puram all-woman police had arrested the teacher on Friday based on a complaint lodged by the victim’s father. Mithun was later lodged in Udumalpet sub-jail in Tirupur district under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/principal-arrested-in-student-suicide-case/articleshow/87704938.cms||---

This drill is for exams that are scheduled from November 16-20 and a separate drill will be conducted for the exams that are scheduled the day after. A circular that reached schools late last evening elaborated the process of the drill, making it mandatory for all schools to attend. An encrypted question paper will first be sent to schools at noon sharp and schools will be shown how to download these. They will also have to keep their printers ready so that the question papers are printed immediately and kept aside for distribution during the exam. Schools will also have to keep high speed printers ready so that the mock OMR sheets can be printed immediately and be kept ready for distribution. This regimen has to be followed by schools on each day of the exam. “This drill is important so that schools don’t falter in any step because that will hold up the exam. This year’s exam is totally new for us. We were not used to this system and need this handholding,” said director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Meena Kak. Many school principals said that this change is exciting because there’s much to learn. They said that it felt that the teachers are giving an exam, since every move in the backroom will be monitored and recorded by the board. “Printers, photocopiers, staplers, papers etc are to be kept ready for the drill.

For the same, after close scrutiny of the biodatas of the aspirants trying to get party tickets from the 12 assembly seats of the district for the 2022 UP assembly polls, the district, assembly constituency and main sector in-charge committees of the party have sent 60 applications to BSP chief Mayawati. Besides, these committees have also recommended the names of 18 prospective candidates for nine assembly seats of the district in their report. These nine seats are Phaphamau, Soraon, Handia, Meja, Karchhana, Allahabad West, Allahabad South, Bara and Koraon. Candidates for the remaining three assembly seats of Allahabad North, Phulpur and Pratappur are believed to have already been finalised by the party, with two Brahmin and one Muslim faces, said a senior BSP leader privy to the information. Abhishek Gautam, the newly appointed BSP Prayagraj district unit president, confirmed that names of probable candidates have already been sent to the party headquarters. “Now, our national president Mayawati ji and senior leaders will take a final call in this regard,” he added. Party insiders say the BSP chief is likely to meet the ticket seekers before putting the final seal on the names of candidates for which the party has started calling potential candidates to Lucknow for interview. A senior BSP leader, requesting anonymity, said this time the party might delay naming candidates for many seats till close to election so as to field worthy candidates, while taking into account the candidates named by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Samajwadi Party. If party leaders are to be believed, BSP may field a leader of Pal community from Allahabad West seat to make up for its former MLA Puja Pal, who lost the elections from the seat in 2017 to BJP’s Sidharth Nath Singh, having left the party. On Allahabad West and Allahabad South seats, the BSP committees have forwarded the names of three leaders each as potential candidates, including two Muslim leaders each on both seats. Party leaders claim that name of a Brahmin traders’ leader has already been finalised by the party to contest from Allahabad North seat. The most intense fight is for the seats of Pratappur and Soraon from where party’s sitting MLAs Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hakim Lal Bind (the only two seats that BSP could win in 2017 out of 12 in Prayagraj) have defected to Samajwadi Party. Party leaders say BSP can field a Muslim face from Pratappur, and will be fielding a Brahmin leader from Handia seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bsp-district-machinery-sends-60-names-for-12-assembly-seats-of-district-ahead-of-22-polls/articleshow/87704944.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav flips BJP’s JAM, says it denotes ‘jhooth, ahankar, mehngai’||GORAKHPUR: Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday responded to Union home minister Amit Shah’s JAM jibe by flipping the acronym to denote jhooth (lies), ahankar (arrogance) and mehngai (inflation). Addressing a press conference in Kushinagar, Akhilesh said BJP is full of lies and arrogance and he will reply to BJP’s JAM with butter. Akhilesh started his Vijay Rath Yatra from Gorakhpur on Saturday and addressed people at Hata after reaching Kushinagar in the evening. Akhilesh said, “As far as we understand, in BJP’s JAM, J is for jhooth (lies), A is for ahankar (arrogance) and M is for mehngai (inflation). BJP is answerable for JAM, but it is trying to divert people’s attention. We will reply to JAM with butter, and you will soon know what butter is.” “People have decided to change this government, which only changes names and colour and has forgotten issues like price hike, unemployment and plummeting value of rupee,” he added. Referring to the foundation laying of a university in his parliamentary constituency Azamgarh, he said, “They have laid the foundation of the university, but they should also tell about its budget. They are running a medical university in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the ninth floor of the medical college built by Samajwadis otherwise they would have been running it in a tin shade. The agriculture university we gave to Azamgarh was dragged to Gorakhpur by Baba ji. They are only inaugurating the work of SP.” Unemployed youth, farmers and people are facing the heat of price rise and have decided to vote this government out in 2022, he added. “BJP doesn’t care about farmers and is forcing three black laws. Farmers were waiting to see their income double, but were crushed under the wheels. A BJP minister’s son is accused. The payment of sugarcane farmers is pending and wheat is not being purchased anywhere. We will work on Lohia’s principle of ‘Daam Bandho’,” he added. Earlier, BJP always raised the issue of falling value of rupee against dollar, but is now silent when the rupee is on tailspin. They should at least tell us how much investment has come to the country, he added. “They are selling institutions like railways, airports, ships and ports and filling the pockets of the rich. We have progressive thoughts but their beliefs are regressive. They will give ration to the poor only till elections, but we Samajwadi will give free ration for the full five years,” the SP chief said. Defending his party MP, Akhilesh said, “BJP is falsely accusing Azam Khan saheb, all the cases are fake and they are torturing him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhilesh-flips-bjps-jam-says-it-denotes-jhoothahankar-mehngai-wait-for-our-butter/articleshow/87704955.cms||Arjumand Bano

Kabeer Ullal, a resident of Millat Nagar in Ullal, stated in his complaint before the commission, that the Mescom authorities disconnected power supply to his house, in spite of paying the bill on time. As a result, the food items stored in the refrigerator perished during the absence of family members in the house. After the hearing, the commission directed Mescom officials to pay Rs 4,000 to the complainant as compensation, and also pay Rs 5,000 as litigation charges. Kabeer told TOI that he was very regular in paying electricity charges to Mescom. “A bill of Rs 1,787 was issued to my house on June 12, 2018, and the same was payable on or before June 27, 2018. However, I have paid the bill on June 14, 2018. Thereafter, I along with my wife and children went to our in-law’s house on June 15. While going, I had stored fish, mutton, chicken, vegetables ice cream and other items in the fridge, since I was expecting the visit of my relatives after our return. The total value of the items stored in the fridge was worth Rs 6,000. On my return on June 19, 2018, I found a foul smell emanating from the fridge, and that the items kept inside had perished,” Kabeer said. On verifying the meter board outside the house, Kabeer noticed that the fuse was removed, and the supply of electricity was withdrawn, he said. “I contacted a lineman and got to know that the fuse was removed as per the instructions of his higher officer. Hence, I moved the DCDRC through my advocates G K Parameshwara Jois and Mohammed Ansar. The commission has ordered the assistant executive engineer, Ullal sub-division and executive engineer, division No1, Mescom Attavar, to pay the compensation and litigation expenses,” Kabeer said. In the order signed by Prakash K, president, Dakshina Kannada DCDRC, members Lavanya M Rai and Lingaraju P V, the opposite parties have been directed to pay the compensation jointly within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/food-in-fridge-rots-mescom-officials-asked-to-pay-compensation/articleshow/87703718.cms||---

The 14,000 sqm field area that was cultivated had been lying fallow for many years and the farmers who revived it were a group of youth who took to farming to inspire others. The Chicalim Youth Farmer's Club (CYFC ) on Sunday happily and proudly harvested their paddy crop, gathering a yield of 64 sacks of 25 kg each. Of these, 50 bags were of the Jyoti rice variety and 14 bags of the Karjat variety. The harvesting process was conducted by a farmer from Nagoa, Greg Fernandes, while eight teachers from St Joseph Vaz College, Cortalim, helped the youth. Interestingly, earlier too, the young farmers received help from Goenche Shetkar during the process of sowing and transplanting. Part of the harvested paddy will be distributed among the members of the club and the rest of it will be sold in the market once it is processed into rice. Parish Priest of Chicalim Church, Fr Bolmax Pereira, who founded the club and guided members said, “We have 35 youth registered with us. Few are studying and others are working. While many have contributed as and when they afforded time, 15 youth have been continuously engaged in the activity." Stating that overall, nearly Rs 1 lakh has been spent on the programme, Pereira said that the local community sponsored the activity. To honour the achievement of the young farmers, a team from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, Old Goa (ICAR) and basmati rice growers from Haryana visited the harvesting site. The Haryana team told the youth that Haryana exports 60% of its basmati crop to Arab countries and that growing Basmati is possible in Goa. The team also assured the young farmers of help during the next sowing season. ICAR has also offered assistance to the club to grow Beyer and newly-researched varieties while also assuring that other inputs will be provided next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-youth-farmers-harvest-64-sacks-of-paddy/articleshow/87704987.cms||Ruvina Khan

His body was found in his car near a community health centre on NH-98 on Sunday morning, police said. Palamu Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar Sinha said the body had a small but deep piercing wound beneath his right earlobe. “As per autopsy report, it is a bullet wound,” he said.

A civilian phoned the Harihurganj police station about a body in the car in the morning after which police swung into action. “Police rushed to the site and retrieved the body and seized the car,” said officer in charge of Harihurganj police station, Sudama Kumar Das.

---||Ranchi||Kishan da, wife sent to Seraikela jail||Ranchi/Jamshedpur: Founding member of the CPI (Maoist) and the outlawed party’s politburo member, Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, his wife Sheela Marandi alias Sheela di — the only woman member of the party’s central committee — along with their four aides were forwarded to the Seraikela divisional jail on Sunday after they were produced before the court of Seraikela sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM), Kavitanjali Toppo. Earlier, all six were brought to the Seraikela Sadar Hospital, (SSH) for a medical examination before their production in the court amid tight police security. The four aides were identified as Virendra Hansda, Raju Tudu, Krishna Bahanda and Gurucharan Bodra. Carrying a reward of Rs 1 crore on his head, Bose was wanted in more than 50 cases lodged in different police stations of Jharkhand and an almost equal number of cases filed in different police stations of Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. Sheela di has nearly two dozen cases filed against her and is out on bail in most of them. She was earlier arrested in 2006 and came out of jail in 2016. She has been currently arrested in a fresh case bearing number 67/21 registered under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act with the Kandra police on November 13, 2021. Addressing the media at the Khukhri guest house of Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP), DGP Niraj Sinha said police have recovered an ocean of information from the couple which may warrant months to be analysed. “The volume of information and documents we have recovered is enormous. We are likely to include several other sections of the IPC and the UAPA in the case against the couple after proper analysis of the information,” he said. Police said the entire operation of nabbing the top-rung Maoist leaders was a mind game involving no firepower. “We had specific inputs about the Scorpio with its registration number in which the suspected Maoist leaders were travelling from Giridih to Chaibasa,” Seraikela SP Anand Prakash said, adding that personnel of the CRPF were also part of the operation. Police also said the six persons, including the woman (Sheela di), did not reveal their identity initially. “After sustained interrogation and verification, we were able to establish their identity,” state police spokesperson A V Homkar said. Sources in the police department said the arrest was possible only after the force has been successful in breaking into the Maoist rank and file and placing moles to provide inside information. It is believed that the recent surrender of area commanders, Bailoon Sardar, Suraj alias Gaju Sardar and Raimuni, who were active along the tri-junction of Ranchi-West Singhbhum and Seraikela, helped the police team to cross-verify the insider information about the movement of the Maoists leaders. The DGP, however, refused to go further into the details of the operation but said they are hopeful of arresting the only politburo member (PBM), Misir Besra, who is left after Bose’s arrest. “We have laid our hands on the encyclopedia of the Maoist organisation, their plans, successful and failed operations and several other crucial information that would help us pull down their entire structure soon,” he said. Sinha also said he remembered the dreadful incident of the Maoist attack on the JAP camp in Topchanchi in Dhanbad during Diwali in 2001 when many personnel were killed. “We lost 15 JAP policemen in the Maoist attack lodged by the team of Bose which was led by their women wing under Sheela Di. At that time, I was here on this premises attending the Diwali mela. Exactly 20 years after that incident when we are addressing the media about the arrest of the mastermind and attacker of that ghastly incident, it gives a sense of closure,” he said. On the physical and mental condition of Bose, DGP said though he was in his late 70s, Bose was not frail as was believed. “He is physically sound and mentally alert than anyone of us in ‘this room’. He still has the spark to convert any mind to become a Maoist. He is an ideological think tank which should not be confused with his rank of PBM. He is the brain behind the merger of the erstwhile Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) and the CPIML-People’s War. It was because of his influence in this part of the country that despite having bigger firepower and cadre strength, the People War faction agreed to give him command over the eastern region by constituting the Eastern Regional Bureau,” Sinha added.

Apart from this, an RPF post, a GRP outpost, a parcel room and a godown will also come up. A wifi facility and a battery-operated vehicle for ferrying passengers within the platform are also in the offing. Besides, a foot over-bridge at the station and extension of the platform will also be done as part of the renovation project. “Amenities at the station are based on the volume of traffic and with the growth of passenger traffic the amenities will be upgraded,” an RVNL official preferring anonymity said when asked about the amenities that are likely to come up at the station. Situated 10km away from Tatanagar on the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai rail line, as many as 35 pairs of long distance and short distance trains, mostly west and north-bound ones, pass through Adityapur every day. Although no passenger train originates from Adityapur, nearly two dozen trains have a stoppage there. With two platforms and six tracks, the station largely caters to the residents of Adityapur and Kandra in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district. “Two important Bihar-bound trains, namely the Tata-Chhapra express and the Tata-Patna express, have many takers at Adityapur but ever since the pandemic struck, these trains are not stopping at the station any more,” local Congress leader Sureshdhari said. Earlier, a representation was given to the divisional railway manager, requesting him for constructing a makeshift washroom at the station. “In the run up to the renovation project, two toilets were dismantled at the station a few months ago, thereby, causing problems for the passengers,” Adityapur resident S K Tiwary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/foundation-stone-laid-for-adityapur-rly-stn-revamp/articleshow/87704637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The culmination of the “government at your doorstep” programme will also mark the second anniversary of the Soren government on December 29. According to sources, the ruling alliance government is eyeing to strengthen its base at the grassroots before the panchayat poll bugle. A call on the panchayat polls will only be taken after the mega public outreach drive even though the ruling parties have pinned the onus of announcing the dates on the state election commission, the sources added. Talking to TOI on Sunday, state rural development minister Alamgir Alam said, “We have already said we are serious about holding the panchayat polls and held meetings with the state election commission in the past to begin the groundwork. Now, they will have to announce the dates. Sooner or later, it will happen but from Tuesday onwards, the government’s entire focus will be on holding the ‘sarkar aapke dwar’ programme.” Notably, over 4000 panchayat bodies in the state had received the second extension of their tenure in August this year through an ordinance as the Jharkhand Panchayat Raj Act, 2001, doesn’t permit two extensions. Earlier in January, the state government had extended the term of elected panchayat bodies for six months as the election was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Alam had said they were eyeing to hold polls by this year-end but had upset the opposition BJP. State BJP president Deepak Prakash had accused the state government of deliberately delaying the panchayat and municipal body polls, claiming “fear of its shrinking ground”. “The government is aware that it has done no good to the public since it came to power two years ago except blaming the Modi government and crying fund crunch. Hence, it is not ready to hold the polls despite the Covid-19 situation stabilizing. We have decided to begin stirs for holding of the polls soon,” he said. Meanwhile, sources in the state election commission said they are ready with the groundwork and will notify the dates after getting the go-ahead nods from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/panchayat-polls-unlikely-this-year-too/articleshow/87704558.cms||ASRP Mukesh

During the launch of the campaign, state leaders of the party, which is part of the ruling alliance, braved the rain and cold and organised ‘prahatferi’ at Piska More at 7am and later held a ceremony at the Nehru Park in HEC area to formally kick-start the event, which will continue till November 29. Sunday’s event was attended by Congress leaders and cabinet ministers Rameshwar Oraon (finance), Badal Patralekh (agriculture), Alamgir Alam (rural development) apart from a host of party MLAs and workers. Addressing the event, state party president Rajesh Thakur said the ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ was part of a nationwide campaign by the AICC to “expose” the Modi government. He said, “Today is the birth anniversary of Pandit Nehru, one of the architects of Independent India. He was also one of the towering figures who led the freedom struggle. However, the Narendra Modi government and BJP since 2014 have launched a campaign to rewrite history and demean the contributions of scores of freedom fighters. Hence, the Jan Jagran Abhiyan is aimed at reaching out to the people across the state to make them aware about our history and expose the Modi government.” Thakur added, “The current burning issues of the country, be it inflation, sale of PSUs, contentious agriculture laws, unemployment and others, are part of the campaign. In last seven years, the country has never experienced such a policy paralysis like it is undergoing now under the current regime.” After the formal launch, all district units rolled out different programme in their respective areas. In Morhabadi, the party held a street play titled ‘Jago Janta Jago’ to take a dig at the Union government and to commemorate Nehru’s birth anniversary. A senior party worker, Alok Dubey, said they also launched different thematic posters on inflation that will be distributed among the masses in the coming days as part of the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-rolls-out-fortnight-long-campaign-on-nehrus-birth-anniv-to-take-on-modi-govt/articleshow/87704589.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Nagpur||Labour dept paves way for reinstatement of 570 workers||Nagpur: Some 570 workers of Gopani Iron and Power Limited, Chandrapur, heaved a sigh of relief as they were reinstated to their jobs this week following the intervention of state labour ministry and the labour department. The dispute between Tadoli MIDC Sponge Iron Workers Association, and Gopani management was amicably settled after a fresh agreement was signed with a hike of around 25% in wages along with inclusion of payment of Diwali bonus component, it’s learnt. Sources in the labour department said the Gopani management had terminated 570 workers through a notice on September 3. Services of five contractors were also withdrawn. It’s also learnt that the unit was shut down subsequently on September 7 due to shortage of raw materials. Earlier in August, the company production had reduced by almost 50% after work was hit by shortage of raw materials. Apart from the paucity of basic raw materials, the company had cited poor run of the steel market in the backdrop of the economy sickened by the Covid onslaught in the country as another ground for their drastic decision. The retrenchment of workers had fuelled an agitation over the workers’ demand for renewal of wage agreements which had been discontinued due to Covid pandemic. Sources said the workers, through their association, were demanding a 60% hike in wages leading to the deadlock. Labour office sources also said that the workers were demanding salaries for July and August, which had not been paid. Assistant labour commissioner Rajdeep Dhurve said the management decided to settle the arrears of one month salary in instalments along with a new service agreement and bonus. “The labour ministry was supposed to hear the matter once again as there was a deadlock over the issue of ‘no work, no wages’,” he said. “The workers and their association were demanding wages since work was discontinued due to the unilateral decision of the Gopani management. The issue was amicably resolved after intervention of the minister and the labour department,” said Dhurve, whose efforts under the supervision of addditional labour commissioner Nitin Patankar helped resolve the dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/labour-dept-paves-way-for-reinstatement-of-570-workers/articleshow/87704960.cms||Soumitra Bose

Addressing a function on the eve of state’s foundation day at Jharkhand Armed Police-I ground, the CM said: “Some of the youngsters have taken the wrong path for various reasons. I appeal to them to get back to the mainstream. The government would provide with jobs and a dignified life.” Soren praised the Jharkhand police for facing law and order challenges successfully while operating in the state’s difficult topography. He claimed that left wing extremism has been brought under control to a large extent while organized criminal gangs have been handled sternly. He said Jharkhand police were never short of morale while handling different challenges, adding that many of them have also been martyred while performing their duty. The CM stated that his government was implementing several welfare schemes to bring a smile on every one’s face. He announced that the existing facilities at JAP-1 ground would be enhanced.

Once they complete the course, they will be eligible to offer their services in any cricket tournament. Apart from eight girls from Gujarat, the other participants are from Maharashtra, Orissa, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. All 22 girls will undergo a six-day training from Monday in the city wherein they will be taught both theory and practical. They will have to appear for an exam to score at least 80 per cent to get the certificate. “We have been given level 1 coaches and umpires by the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) for training these girls,” Nitendra Singh, chief coach and director (cricket operations), Divyang Cricket Control Board of India (DCCBI) told TOI. “Once they pass the course, these women will be able to stand in as professional umpires and scorers in the cricket tournaments. We will ensure that they get to serve in the differently-abled cricket tournaments at state, national and international level,” he said. “But my aim is to get the differently-abled umpires in mainstream cricket tournaments. This will not just give full-time employment to these women but also make cricket a more inclusive sport. I am in talks with some state cricket associations to give such umpires a chance. To start with, they can umpire or keep score in local tournaments,” Singh, who is fondly called Munna in cricketing circle, said. “When these women start umpiring and scoring, they will get at least Rs 1,500 per day when the matches are played apart from train tickets for air-conditioned coaches. We will try to treat them at par with other umpires and scorers,” Singh added. About two dozen differently-abled men too will be trained in umpiring and scoring at this camp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-umpires-with-difference-soon/articleshow/87704102.cms||Tushar Tere

During these hours facilities like ticket reservation, current booking and inquiry services won’t be available. The railway ministry said this is being done as part of its efforts to normalise passenger services and revert in a phased manner to the pre-Covid levels of service. On Friday, it announced to do away with the “special” tag attached to all trains and had also said the train numbers won’t have “0” as the first digit. On the shut down of PRS services, it said, “This is to enable upgradation of system data and updating of new train numbers. Since huge amount of past (old train numbers) and current passenger booking data are to be updated in all mail/ express trains, this is being planned in a series of carefully calibrated steps and implemented during night hours in order to minimise the impact on services,” it said. Except for PRS services, all other services will continue uninterrupted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railways-passenger-reservation-to-be-shut-down-for-6-hours-for-1-week/articleshow/87706088.cms||---
---||Nagpur||50 held on day 2 of Amt curfew, situation ‘tense but under control’||Amravati: Around 50 people from two opposing factions have been arrested in connection with the last two days’ violent activities in the city, even as the situation was “tense but under control” on Sunday, the second day of curfew, according to official sources. Guardian minister Yashomati Thakur told TOI that “nothing untoward” had happened in the city as well as in the district. “Everything is balanced and under control. People should observe peace and restraint,” she said. The minister urged all citizens to cooperate with the administration to help establish normalcy in the city. The city has been in grip of terror since Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Amravati bandh turned violent on Saturday, which resulted in stone-pelting, loot and arson, wherein business establishments of the minority community were targeted. Though the police have made elaborate arrangements to cope with the situation, eight platoons of state reserve police force and additional police force from Jalna, Wardha, Nagpur and Buldhana had to be summoned and deployed at various places in the city. Police ensured heavy bandobust in sensitive areas on Sunday and took out a route march in the evening. In the afternoon, a meeting of the peace committee was held at Nagpuri Gate police station which was addressed by guardian minister Thakur and police commissioner Arti Singh. Both of them urged members from either community to observe peace. A district bandh call given by BJP received fair response in Morshi and Warud pockets on Sunday. Police rounded up eight BJP activists from Warud while they were shouting slogans in front of their office there. Police also detained former agriculture minister Anil Bonde, BJP district president Nivedita Chaudhary and MLC Pravin Pote. Meanwhile, curfew has been imposed in Achalpur, Anjangaon Surji, Teosa, Warud and Morshi towns, it was learnt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-held-on-day-2-of-amt-curfew-situation-tense-but-under-control/articleshow/87704979.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No permission but many coaching insts start classes||Nagpur: Quite a few coaching institutes in semi-urban areas have started operations even though the state government has not issued any permission for reopening. Repeated pleas by owners of the coaching classes seeking reopening permission have fallen on “deaf ears”. Owner of an coaching institute based in the city said, “I know a few in other districts who have started classes. It has been months now and our association has repeatedly written to various government officials as well as public representatives, but to no avail.” TOI tried speaking with a few such institutes which had reopened, but only two agreed to share their reasons, on condition of anonymity. These are standalone coaching institutes without the frills and infrastructure that either the national-level franchisees or big brand local classes boast of. An institute owner from Wardha said, “I only called my students twice before Diwali, and now in small batches for doubt clearing sessions for those who are in Std XII.” The owner said online classes are not feasible “because this is preparation for a competitive exam”. “Understanding the concept is one part of the preparation, the other is how to approach the exam in the limited time. The required pressure simulation cannot be done online,” he said. Another class owner from Nagpur said, “I have stopped now till board exams of CBSE X and XII get over, but yes some students will have to be called back. Right now the focus is on completion of course and online mode has slowed down the process. If the course completion gets delayed then we may never be able to do full justice to our students, in terms of preparing them for the exam next year.” Coaching institute associations across the state have been lobbying to get the reopening permission, but authorities have been non-committal. A coaching association member said, “Civic authorities say permission has to come from Mumbai. When we write to chief minister’s office, they forward that correspondence to higher and technical education department even though we are not under them. So, in this bureaucratic maze, coaching classes are now the only establishment in entire Maharashtra to remain shut.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-permission-but-many-coaching-insts-start-classes/articleshow/87704974.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Gaurav Sharma and his associates are alleged to have entered the premises “with their shoes on” by climbing over wall at midnight and filming the area. As per popular belief, no one is allowed to enter the temple at night since it is held that Lord Krishna and Radha perform ‘raslila’ at night at the place and they shouldn’t be disturbed. As per SP (city) MP Singh, Sharma said he has been running his YouTube channel for past five years and earns Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 per month from it. He has around 45 lakh subscribers. “My cousin told me there’s a place in Vrindavan, where no one enters at night, as it is believed that misfortune strikes those who do so. I decided to make a video of the area around midnight,” he said. He confessed to uploading the video too.

Environment minister Nilesh Cabral, in a letter to the Union government, stated that Goa is in the process of preparing a 100% renewable energy plan with assistance from the Union ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE). Goa requires approximately 540MW power during the day and 640MW during peak hours, 6pm to 11pm. The government has notified a solar policy with 50% subsidy on benchmark cost. However, till date, only about 15MW installations have been completed. “The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) is the nodal agency which interacts with MNRE for implementation of centrally sponsored schemes as well as schemes of the government of Goa in the field of new and renewable resources,” Cabral said. The state government has decided to set up floating solar power plants at Selaulim, Amthanem, Anjunem and Chapoli dams on a design, build, finance and operate model for a period of 25 years and has invited expression of interest (EoI) for selection of solar power developers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-preparing-100-renewable-energy-plan/articleshow/87705014.cms||---

According to ministry sources, the details will be announced by December-end so that aspirants and institutions can start the preparations. The exams, as envisaged in the NEP 2020 are likely to be conducted twice a year. The computer-based common entrance test for the central universities, which includes the likes of JNU, BHU and DU, would comprise of three hours of testing divided into two sections -- Common Aptitude Test (50 questions) and Domain Specific Test (30 questions each)— and will eliminate the individual exams that many of the universities conduct presently. According to sources, the ministry is finalising the proposal based on the report of the committee set up by the UGC and the admissions to the central universities for the 2022-23 will be based on the CUCET score. “The ministry is ready to implement the CUCET from 2022 as planned under the NEP 2020. The details and the dates will be worked out soon. The ministry is planning to announce the details as early as possible so that the candidates and universities get time to prepare,” said the official. The official said that Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has asked the officials to work on the recommendations of the UGC to roll out its implementation without any further delay. “The exams were scheduled for implementation from 2021 and the ground work was completed in March 2021. However, due to the lockdown it couldn’t happen. While to start with the plan was to conduct it once, from 2022 the plan is to conduct it twice for the benefit of candidates,” said the official. According to the NEP 2020 document, “the National Testing Agency (NTA) will facilitate a single entrance exam for admissions to universities across the country. It will offer a ‘high quality common aptitude test’ like SAT examination, as well as specialised common subject examinations at least twice every year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/education-ministry-finalising-details-of-2022-entrance-test-for-central-varsities/articleshow/87706126.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Goa||‘Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time’||Arnold Rodrigues was at the peak of his prowess when he went ‘missing’ in 1984. The star midfielder was in terrific form as Goa won the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy outright for the first time that year. Arnold was named the best midfielder and player of the tournament. When India were scheduled to tour West Indies, he was the first name on the selectors’ list. But while the Salgaocar Sports Club medio happily left for the tour, he did not return to India. “Since the journey was long, we had a one-day stopover in London,” remembers Arnold. “My mum was there (in UK) and she came to the airport to take me home where I could spend the holidays. It was off-season for football in India, so I thought this was a good idea.” What started as a month or two of holidays took a dramatic turn when his mother hid the passport, leaving Arnold with no choice but to continue in UK. He stayed back reluctantly, calling his employers, Salgaocar, after 10 months to tell them that he won’t be able to represent the club again. Everyone was shocked. After all, Arnold, then aged 30, was among the best midfielders in the country. He was clearly at the top of his game, yet, even 36 years later, there are no regrets. “Many former players told me that I took the right decision. I can see many struggling (financially, after their playing days),” says Arnold. Why his mother – who moved to UK in 1975 -- decided to hold Arnold back is also understandable. Born in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, Arnold grew up watching his father, a prominent football referee, officiate matches in the National league. He took to the sport like fish to water, playing on the streets with a tennis ball. While Arnold was grabbing attention on the streets with his skills and goals, the late nights of football under streetlights didn’t help his cause at home. They were all concerned. When Arnold just wouldn’t stop going out even at night to play football, he was packed off to a boarding school in Goa. “At first glance, this place looked just like Africa,” says Arnold. Things were not the same, though. At the St Anthony’s High School boarding in Monte de Guirim, football plays an important part of any boarder’s life and it didn’t take too much time for the magician from East Africa to show that he was cut from a different cloth. “Since I had come from Dar es Salam, playing with the sturdy African boys, it was easy for me here,” says Arnold. Word soon spread about the special talent and he found himself doing duty for Panvel Sports Club after club secretary Antonio Botelho showed up at the boarding and asked him if he wanted to play in the top division. “That was my dream,” says Arnold. He lived his dream with Panvel SC for two years (1972-74), famously winning the Bandodkar Gold Trophy with the club. Salgaocar then came calling and he spent 10 hugely successful years, captaining the club to a triumph at the Puttaiah Memorial Soccer, their first major outstation trophy in 1978. “I must have attended about 16-17 national camps but was dropped on many occasions. I don’t blame anyone. India had great midfielders at the time and there was place for just two (in the starting 11),” says Arnold, who was a regular with the state team from 1975 to 1984. Arnold, though, was not to be denied his chance of representing the country. In 1977, he was part of the India team for the Goodwill tour to Zambia and Kings Cup in Bangkok. After a six-year hiatus, he made it to the top again, this time representing the country for the President’s Cup in Dhaka and Super Soccer in Delhi. “Sometimes I think I was born at the wrong time,” says Arnold. “For us, there were no facilities, no coaching, no infrastructure. The grounds were so hard. They players now get to train and play on fantastic grounds. When they play, people across the world can see them live in action on television.” Fans here watched Arnold only on the ground with no footage available of how brilliantly he pulled the strings from midfield. All that remains are memories which old-timers happily recall. Arnold, they say, was terrific in Madras, now Chennai, when Goa won the Santosh Trophy in 1984. He made India take note of his talent but, sadly, that was the last time fans here saw him play for either the club, state or country. After that, he simply went ‘missing’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sometimes-i-think-i-was-born-at-the-wrong-time/articleshow/87705151.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Bombay HC says 4-year-old not competent witness in Pocso case, frees man||MUMBAI: Quashing a 2019 conviction under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), the Bombay high court said the sessions court had given “undue importance to a stray statement’’ of a four-year-old without ascertaining first whether the child could be a competent witness. Mumbai sessions court had convicted the accused to five years’ rigorous imprisonment in 2019. He was one of two accused in the case. The co-accused had been acquitted by the trial court. The HC said, “A child is a competent witness provided he is capable of understanding the questions put to him and is able to give rational answers.’’ But in this case, the child was barely four years old and of a tender age, and “it was obligatory” on the judge to ascertain first whether the child can depose as a competent witness, which the trial judge had not done, the high court added. The prosecution’s case was that the accused, who was hired to paint a room, had made the child sit on his lap. It was alleged that at 9.30pm, he then touched her private part and that the other man had slapped her. The child, who did not have the cognitive skills to remember, recollect and narrate an alleged sexual abuse by a painter-workman, had later in her cross-examination by the defence lawyer also said she was deposing as told by her mother, observed Justice Anuja Prabhudessai while acquitting the man convicted in the 2017 case. The prosecution’s case was based mainly on the child’s testimony. “Conviction can be based on the sole testimony of a child witness provided the witness is competent to depose to the facts and is a reliable witness,’’ said the HC. The man had been convicted under section 10 of Pocso for aggravated sexual assault, where minimum punishment is five years’ RI. Both the accused had pleaded they were not guilty. Observing that the trial court had “failed to evaluate competency’’ of the child as a witness, the HC scrutinised her evidence to ascertain whether her deposition can be relied on. The HC judgment noted that the child “was not trying to conceal the truth’’ and the tenor of her answers during trial indicate she lacked the intellectual capacity and maturity to understand the nature of questions and to give rational answers, hence she “cannot be considered to be a competent witness.” Besides, there is no confirmation of the identification of the accused in the case, the HC noted as the date of painting work was a day after the alleged crime, said the room owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-hc-says-4-year-old-not-competent-witness-in-pocso-case-frees-man/articleshow/87706135.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Sister to contest assembly polls, my time hasn’t come yet, says Sonu Sood||BATHINDA: Actor-philanthropist Sonu Sood, who emerged as a real-life hero for thousands of migrants during the lockdown, on Sunday announced his sister Malvika Sood Sachar’s intention to join Punjab politics, but added he has no such plans for himself. Sood, who is from Moga district, said his sister has done a lot of amazing work in the past and wanted to amplify her activities. Speaking to media persons in Moga, his hometown, Sood said Malvika would contest the next assembly elections. “The election manifesto, where political parties make a lot of promises but most of the time complaints keep coming up of (parties) not fulfilling these promises, should be a sacred document and parties must give a guarantee of fulfilling what they promise in a timely manner. Malvika will give an affidavit of standing by what she promises to the people. And if she fails to deliver, she will give up (politics),” he said. Sood, however, did not say from which party she would be joining, saying it will be announced at an appropriate time. Asked whether he would join politics, Sood said for now, he would support his sister to serve society in a better way. About their agenda for entering politics, he said education, health and unemployment would be the core areas for him and his family, and they would keep working for basic needs of quality education, affordable medical treatment and providing employment to the needy. For some time now, after he met Delhi chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi in August, there has been speculation about Sood testing the political waters. He had recently met Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi in Chandigarh and his predecessor Capt Amarinder Singh before that. He also plans to meet SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal soon. He called all the political leaders he has met as “wonderful people”, but had a special word of praise for Channi, saying he was a very humble and polite person. It is being said that PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu is also in touch with Sood and may meet him soon. Malvika has been working for people of Moga. Malvika said she had not considered joining politics and was more into charity. But there are expectations of the people and now the effort would be to serve them with full might, she said. Sood said after Covid-19, he has been concentrating on providing relief to people suffering from dengue, especially those needing dialysis. “A dialysis facility has been started from today,” he said, adding that anyone needing it should contact his family or the family-run Sood charity foundation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sonu-sood-says-sister-to-contest-punjab-assembly-elections/articleshow/87705135.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chandigarh||Channi’s RSS attack: Nat’l minorities panel chief says Golwalkar made ‘Punjabi as mother tongue’ appeal||Jalandhar: National Commission for Minorities chairman Iqbal Singh Lalpura in a recent post on Facebook claimed that during the census of 1961, which also took into account regional languages, government enumerators would write Hindi in the mother tongue column for a Hindu person even when they would mention Punjabi. Just a day after Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi criticised the RSS in the state’s legislative assembly, Lalpura, in the post on November 12, asked “who was in the government” when the 1961 Census was carried out. The Congress was in power at the time. Lalpura’s assertions com at a time when the Congress-led Punjab government has been able to ensure the passage of ‘Punjabi and Other Languages Education (Amendment) Bill, 2021’ and ‘Punjab State Language (Amendment) Bill 2021’ in the state legislative assembly — a move which is being seen as a way to reach out to sections demaning implementation and propagation of Punjabi language. “A news report says that at that time, RSS chief Madhavrao Sadashivrao Golwalkar asked Punjabis to mention Punjabi as their mother tongue,” Lalpura wrote. Lalpura said in the 1960s, even as Punjab suffered the most during Partition, the then entire leadership of Congress, including the Prime Minister, backtracked from its promise to form a Punjabi language state. He also mentioned that police entered Darbar Sahib during Punjabi Suba agitation. “RSS is enemy organisation of Punjab,” CM Channi had said in state assembly on November 11. Describing the RSS as “a non-political, social organisation”, Lalpura said in the post: “Under what rules allegation is being levelled against an organisation which is not present in the assembly to defend itself. Which other social organisations have been discussed by the legislatures? Is it not aimed to create divisions in society? If members of the assembly and their leaders would come to this low level of debate and knowledge of issues of the state, who can save Punjab? Punjab is facing multi-organ failure,” he wrote. He has also written about the Naxalite movement in Punjab of 1960s. He said that Naxalites, at the time, would say that paddy should be grown in the sarovar (holy pond) of Darbar Sahib. In an apparent dig at Shiromani Akali Dal, he said all its noise on crucial issues of Punjab would fall silent after it came to power. Mentioning the days of militancy, Lalpura, who remained a police officer in Punjab and also served in intelligence department and as an SSP in the state police, said fake encounters took place during militancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channis-rss-attack-natl-minorities-panel-chief-says-golwalkar-made-punjabi-as-mother-tongue-appeal/articleshow/87705157.cms||IP Singh
---||Chandigarh||Amarinder rubbishes claims of proposed meeting with Gandhis||Chandigarh: Former chief minister of Punjab Capt Amarinder Singh has dismissed the claims made by one of the cabinet ministers that he will return to the Congress and would soon be meeting the party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. “These are malicious and mischievous assumptions apparently made with an ulterior motive,” said Amarinder. He added that there was no question of his looking back ever since he was busy shaping up his party and giving the finishing touches to its organisational set up. “We are waiting for the registration of our party — Punjab Lok Congress — by the Election Commission of India and the allotment of the party symbol,” he added. Earlier in the day, social justice minister Raj Kumar Verka had made a statement in Amritsar that Amarinder could return to the Congress soon. The former chief minister had on November 2 tendered his resignation from the party stating that he was hurt by the conduct of Sonia and her children – Rahul and Priyanka. He had also revealed the name of his new political party the same day. Amid political turmoil in the Congress, Capt Amarinder had submitted his resignation as chief minister to Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on September 18, ahead of the Congress legislative party’s meeting stating that he was continuously humiliated for the past two months by the party high command. Meanwhile, Congress MP from Patiala and Amarinder’s wife Preneet Kaur met chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday, along with some municipal councillors from Patiala. The councillors claimed that they had met the chief minister to apprise about the local issues of Patiala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-rubbishes-claims-of-proposed-meeting-with-gandhis/articleshow/87705184.cms||---

The visa-free corridor was closed due to the pandemic last year, as travel restrictions were imposed.

---||Goa||Under house arrest, pandemic hits kids’ mental health: Experts||PANAJI: Mental health repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic have been immense for children and adolescents. Several issues stem from them being away from school for a prolonged period. Chairperson of the state commission for protection of child rights, Peter Borges said the pandemic brought a complex array of challenges which have had mental health consequences, including grief, social isolation, fear, uncertainty, increased screen time etc, negatively impacting the mental health of children. Strong stabilising forces for children, friendships and family support were also dismantled during the pandemic, he says. Children have been coping with anxiety, stress and emotional tension due to physical inactivity, says pediatrician and member of the Goa chapter of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Dr Sushma Kirtani. Under house arrest, they have been suffering from psychological problems, anxiety disorders, psychosomatic diseases, aggressive behaviour as well as panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder when they’ve lost a loved one in their family. “Many children and adolescents developed Covid obesity and have put on 10-12kg since the pandemic began from watching TV, surfing the internet, playing games online and snacking too often. Their parents are happy to see them chubby but there are many side effects of diabetes and high blood pressure, among others, that they must be cautious about,” she says. A child who came in with an upset stomach, vomiting and belching was found to be waking up at 12pm, having breakfast at 1pm and lunch at 5pm. Besides eating disorders, the excess screen time has meant that children have been presenting with neck and back pain, watering and redness of eyes and internet addiction disorders. With classes moving online and parents and in-charges of childcare institutions unable to monitor children’s internet usage, the state’s child welfare committees have received several cases of online abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents, especially girls. Several also accepted friend requests from strangers, got influenced and even ran away, chairperson of the child welfare committee North Goa, Esther Torrres said. They’ve also borne the brunt of domestic violence and have had suicidal ideation. “For the highly vulnerable group like children with special needs or marginalised or with chronic disorders, such as disabilities, already existing mental health problems, trauma experiences, children with HIV, cancer, and those from migrant background and low socio-economic status, this has been a more challenging time,” Borges says. The state needs to invest on scaling up mental health and psychosocial support as Covid-19 pandemic response, especially for vulnerable children, he says. “Otherwise, this will result in outcomes such as suicide, inability to live independently, school dropout, substance use, physical health problems, etc,” he said. Children of some migrant families were badly affected and have missed out on school altogether. “Some haven’t returned. Some have returned with a single parent after the father abandoned them, who want to put their children in a child care institution. There are cases of children finding it difficult to integrate into the culture and with the people of their home state as they grew up and studied here,” Torres says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/under-house-arrest-pandemic-hits-kids-mental-health-experts/articleshow/87705223.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Bengaluru||Drugs, alcohol caused one suicide every hour in 2020||BENGALURU: Deaths by suicide attributed to drug abuse and alcohol addiction continue to increase with 2020 seeing over 9,000 such cases at the rate of at least one every hour. Just two states, Maharashtra and Karnataka, account for more than 43% of cases. Psychiatrists and psychologists say people could be pushed to the brink either by underlying mental conditions amplified by alcohol and drugs, or the action could be influenced by other issues including financial distress and family problems. The number of such deaths increased by nearly 17% in 2020, compared to 7,860 reported the previous year as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. In 2019, suicides because of drug abuse and alcoholism accounted for 5.6% of over 1.3 lakh suicides across the country. Comparatively, such cases account for 6% of over 1.5 lakh suicides reported in 2020. Of 9,169 such deaths, 3,956 were from Maharashtra and Karnataka. Analysis of data from previous years shows that while Maharashtra has been topping the table since at least 2015, cases in Karnataka have been growing and brought the state to second place since 2018. It was in the third place in 2017. Between 2015 and 2020, nearly 40,000 deaths by suicide have been attributed to drugs and alcohol. Other than Maharashtra and Karnataka, three other states — Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala — also reported a high percentage in these years. In 2020, these states together accounted for 7,356 (over 80%) of total such deaths. There has been a consistent increase of such cases in the past five years with 2015 only reporting 3,670 cases. It is not just total number of such cases, but such suicides as a percentage of total suicides too has gone up. In 2015, such cases accounted only for 2.7% of total suicides. Multiple psychiatrists TOI spoke to said patients who are depressed and addicted to alcohol are prone to suicide and long-term use or consumption of large quantities can also cause substance-induced psychosis which can lead to suicide. While Maharashtra has seen a consistent growth in cases, Karnataka, which only had 94 such cases in 2015, has seen more significant spikes. The annual increase in Maharashtra has been in the range of 7% and 29%, while it’s been between 30% and 300% (2015 to 2018) in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drugs-alcohol-caused-one-suicide-every-hour-in-2020/articleshow/87706192.cms||Chethan Kumar

He said he was yet to take a decision about contesting the 2022 assembly election from Navelim constituency. “My interest will always be Goa and Navelim constituency. I will take an appropriate decision in the interest of the party, of my people and of Goa,” Faleiro said when asked if he would contest from Navelim for the assembly polls. TMC has nominated Faleiro for the Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal left vacant following the resignation of Arpita Ghosh nearly two months ago. He will file his Rajya Sabha nomination papers on Tuesday for the elections to be held on November 29. With TMC’s tally in the Bengal assembly rising to 218, Faleiro’s passage to the Rajya Sabha is but a formality. Speaking to TOI from Kolkata, Faleiro said that upon his entry into Rajya Sabha, “Goa will find a voice in the Parliament as TMC is the second largest opposition party.” Special status for Goa, recovering Rs 35,000 crore mining loot, and the three linear projects are the issues he will raise in the Parliament, he said. His nomination to the Parliament triggered speculation that it was a “broad hint” the party might not field him in the 2022 Goa assembly polls. Though Faleiro said he was currently undecided about contesting from Navelim, sources said that TMC was considering fielding a candidate propped up by Faleiro from Navelim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-decided-on-contesting-from-navelim-yet-luizinho/articleshow/87705240.cms||---

We do not want to do caste politics. We do not want to discriminate between people and make politics out of it. Priests present here must have seen the development in Aldona constituency,” he said during the Sarkar Tumchya Dari programme. “We have not referred to people with religion, but now some are trying to differentiate them as Hindu, Muslim, Christian among others,” Sawant said. Last week, after promising a list of populist schemes ahead of the 2022 assembly elections, in a bid to get the arithmetic right ahead of the electoral fray, AAP promised to appoint a chief minister from the Bhandari community if it wins the elections. Sawant said that till date BJP has never discriminated based on religion and Goa has never seen fights among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. “We are moving ahead with development,” he said. He said that all beneficiaries of different social security schemes will get regular payments from December 31. The CM said that a lot of people promise freebies in view of elections, but the people of Goa are smart. “It is very easy to come to Goa and announce something, but during the pandemic when the revenue to the state government was reduced, the state government did not stop any social welfare scheme,” he said. He said that the power tariff in Goa is the cheapest in the country. “Goans are not aware of power shutdowns. We have never had a power shutdown. When some people come from outside and speak about power, we believe them. People should check with their relatives about power issues in neighbouring states, especially in Delhi and we need not go to West Bengal,” the chief minister said. Sawant said that after BJP formed the government at the Centre, the state received Rs 20,000 crore for infrastructure development. He also said that Goa is the number one state in infrastructure development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-want-to-do-religion-caste-politics-says-sawant/articleshow/87705268.cms||---

---||Guwahati||Wives of former poachers ladle out a ‘potboiler’ in Assam sanctuary||MANAS: When their husbands decided to forgo their dangerous life as poachers, women living in villages around Manas National Park of Assam had to soup up their traditional culinary skills to earn for their families. The journey of these women from the indigenous Bodo community has become an example today for others. Their decision to take up the job of keeping the family pot boiling after their husbands were brought back into the mainstream is now being showcased as a model by other community members. These women in and around Basbari range used their traditional culinary skills by offering Bodo dishes to tourists coming to the famed Manas National Park, known for one-horned rhino and royal bengal tiger, but the endeavour initially floundered due to absence of entrepreneurial skills. Mitali G Dutta, a culinary entrepreneur, came to know about their attempts and came forward to help the women in association with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) by skilling them and helping them market. “I started working with them in 2017 and began with giving tips on how to present a dish to a customer,” Dutta said. The women know their dishes best and no training is given to cook the items, but lessons are imparted on how much should be served, how the plates should be arranged and most importantly on the pricing to make it a sustainable business model, she said. “The Forest Department helped us by providing us space at the Bansbari Anti-Poaching Camp. There different villagers come and set up small food stalls,” Dutta said. The women formed ‘Gungzema Kitchen’ — an enterprise to showcase traditional and authentic Bodo food and cultural performances — during the Manas Spring Festival. Bhadri, one of the staff at Gungzema Kitchen, said that earlier survival in itself was a concern for them, but now all of them are earning and are self-dependent. A traditional Bodo platter served by Gungzema Kitchen contains about 7-8 items and is priced at Rs 500. Another member, Sharmila said, “When tourists sample our food, they usually tell us of how they relished our platter. It encourages us and makes us happy!” The off-seasons are utilised by the women to farm grains, vegetables and tend to poultry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/wives-of-former-poachers-ladle-out-a-potboiler-in-assam-sanctuary/articleshow/87706215.cms||---

The Goa Forward Party (GFP) legislator told reporters that there is drug trafficking in the coastal area and “a Pablo Escobar” is controlling it. For the trade to end, the CM has to act against the person who, he said, has brought a bad name to BJP. Paliencar, a former minister in the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government, said that the minister in question is pointing fingers at others for lack of development but “the fact is that there is a lot done by me in this Siolim constituency”. Further hitting out at the minister, Paliencar said that the type of development work that he has done since he became Siolim MLA has not been done in the adjoining constituency either. “Siolim has a history, the people here do not accept outsiders,” he said. Paliencar said that sub-stations have been be set up in the constituency and underground power lines have also been laid, besides hot mixing and asphalting of roads thta were neglected for many years. The process of setting up a 30MLD water project is about to start, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/act-against-min-to-stop-drug-trade/articleshow/87705307.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus, Fr Patricio Fernandes said the ‘maddi’ will commence the celebration of the novena and feast of St Francis Xavier after the mass in the pandal at 6pm on November 23. The novenas begin on November 24 and continue through to December 2, culminating in the feast on December 3. The theme this year will be ‘Stay with us lord, to love communion, participation, mission like St Francis Xavier’. The high mass on the feast day will be celebrated by archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and emeritus bishop Alex Dias along with other priests at 10am. Pilgrims who occupied the corridors have been permitted to come and stay by registering themselves. Those who overflow from the corridor will be accommodated in the pilgrim tent to the south of the Basilica. “This year on account of the ban on fires and cooking, the pilgrims can avail themselves of food packages from our canteen,” Fernandes said. “For nearly two years devotees of Goemcho Saib have not freely visited the shrine or participated in the novena and feast, especially in the last year. But this year, special arrangements are made to encourage the faithful to safely come and pay their respects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/st-xavier-novenas-from-nov-24-amid-covid-protocols/articleshow/87705317.cms||---

Josh was high. And if you stood outside any of the exam centres, one thing was conspicuous by its near absence — parents chaperoning the girls. In fact, many of those TOI spoke to laughed and said their parents had no clue they were trying out for NDA. Others said they didn’t need to convince their parents — they were quite thrilled to hear their daughter wanted to be in uniform. The turnout was impressive — around 75% of the girls who had registered showed up for the test. Those who qualify will head for a five-day SSB — one of the most gruelling and unforgettable ‘interviews’ in the country. Many of them had set off from far-off districts in the wee hours to be on time for 8.30am muster. In Indore, Class 12 student Divya Patel, who had come from Pithampur, looked around and said: “It feels good to be here, like being part of history. I’m hoping I’ll get through, but even otherwise I can say I was among the first.” Some of the candidates were from military backgrounds, but most — over 60% — aim to be first-time faujis in their families. The candidates felt that they didn’t get enough time to prepare for the test. “We didn’t know if girls would be allowed from this year or the next,” said Bhaskar. It was on September 22 that Supreme Court rejected the government’s request to defer the exam till next year. “We gave hope to the girls. We cannot deny them that hope now,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/josh-high-as-first-batch-of-girls-sits-for-nda-exam/articleshow/87706236.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Goa||Cycling 6,800km to highlight marine pollution||PANAJI: At a time when fuel prices continue to burn a hole in everyone’s pocket, four men have decided to cycle over 6,800km along India’s coastline with a simple message ‘Burn Fat Not Fuel’ while also documenting the extent of plastic and marine pollution. Led by 56-year-old naval veteran Milind Tambe, the four cyclists will pedal across nine states in their bid to promote sustainable travel. The expedition began on Sunday with two riders pushing off from Goa’s capital with the other riders joining in at various stages of the Indian Coastal Cycling Expedition. Over the next 101 days, the cyclists will traverse through Karnataka and Kerala until they hit Kanyakumari for their first major pit stop. The next major pit stop will be at Visakhapatnam till they push on to Kolkata. From there, they will courier their cycles to Gujarat and pick up the trail from Bhuj. “The first objective is to promote sustainable travel. That’s why our hashtag is burn fat, not fuel. We want to promote sustainable travel,” said Tambe. The second objective of the entire team is to monitor the plastic pollution along the beaches. “So basically we would be mapping beaches wherever we find them to be excessively polluted. We will see what kind of plastic pollutants are there,” said Tambe. He is joined by 49-year old Pune resident Shriram Kondhawekar. The other two cyclists are 43-year-old IT professional Mandar and 30-year-old software designer Aakash Sinha. The Union ministry of sports and youth affairs has recognised the expedition under the Fit India movement. The ministry has asked the quartet to promote the concept of fitness. The four cyclists are part of a photography club and met in December 2020 during a visit to Brahma Tal in Uttarakhand, where they decided to cycle along the country’s coastline. Earlier this year, Tambe and Sinha tested their resolve by cycling from Mumbai to Goa. “The experience is going to be a lot richer than what it was in the first leg, and we’re looking forward to it,” said Tambe. Along the way, they will pitch their tents wherever possible or stay at homes of their local hosts while also doing some sightseeing. “We want to photograph each and every light house as best as possible. During the entire expedition, we hope to map the lighthouses, we may not be able to map some for security reasons, but wherever we can we would be taking pictures of each and every one that we come across,” said Kondhawekar. The expedition was flagged off by commandant 2 Signal Training Centre Brigadier A S Sawhney and superintendent of police (North) Shobhit Saxena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cycling-6800km-to-highlight-marine-pollution/articleshow/87705330.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||Goa: BJP’s Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane to join AAP||VALPOI: BJP’s Vishwajit Krishnarao Rane from Poriem constituency has announced that he will join Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday. Rane said both, Congress and BJP, have failed at development, leaving AAP as the only option. “Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane has been MLA for 50 years and was chief minister for more than 17 years. Despite this, he has failed to give the people of Poriem basic necessities,” he said. Sattari locals say that his decision will affect BJP in the 2022 polls since he has many supporters in Poriem. “My motivation for joining BJP then was Manohar Parrikar’s vision. Since the current government has lost that vision, I feel Arvind Kejriwal’s vision alone can transform Goa. Therefore, I have decided to join AAP.” “Many Sattari residents gave their land for the dam with the hope of 24X7 water supply. Unfortunately, they still struggle with water shortages. They rely on tanker supply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjps-vishwajit-krishnarao-rane-to-join-aap/articleshow/87705340.cms||---

They have now realised this. The ball is now in the Congress court.” Addressing reporters during the induction of two former BJP workers from Fatorda into GFP — Dattaprasad Mandrekar and Vanita Madkaikar — Sardesai disclosed his party’s plans of holding booth workers meetings soon, an exercise which he said would culminate on December 19 with a “yatra” across the state. Sardesai welcomed both new entrants in GFP’s fold. Fatorda Block president Peter Fernandes was also present. Sardesai added that he never did discrimination on party lines when it came to development of Fatorda. “During my tenure as MLA of Fatorda for the past 10 years, I have never harassed any BJP worker. We have put our efforts to take Fatorda forward.” He said that the ‘Future Ready Fatorda’ concept is to give a better future for children. “Proactive, positive and forward-thinking people are joining us, because they know that we are going forward by protecting our Goem, Goemkar and Goemkarponn,” Sardesai said. He said that the ‘development by consent’ which is taking place in Fatorda will take Goa forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/clarity-on-alliance-by-dec-19-says-vijai/articleshow/87705344.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: At wind's mercy, nation capital breathes a sigh of relief, AQI 'very poor'||NEW DELHI: The capital got some relief on Sunday with air quality improving from "severe" to "very poor" category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 330 against 437 on Saturday. It is likely to remain in the "very poor" category for the next few days. Though the farm fire count remained high at 3,445, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 reduced from 31% on Saturday to 12% on Sunday due to reduction in transport-level wind speed. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) said, "AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as winds at transport level are slowing down, resulting in lesser intrusion of farm fire-related pollutants into Delhi." Track the pollution level in your cityThere was also an improvement in the air quality owing to an increase in mixing layer height and decrease in moisture content. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, "There was no change in local winds as they were mostly light or calm in the last 24 hours at Safdarjung, while it was around 5-7kmph between 11.30am and 3pm at Palam. Reduction of moisture continued over Delhi with a relative humidity of 30-55%. However, anti-cyclonic wind pattern, which impacted the moderate to severe smog conditions, has shifted to southwest Delhi." Met officials said the visibility in smog was 1,000-1,500 metres over Safdarjung, while at Palam it remained at 1,500-2,200 metres since Saturday evening. No fog was reported on November 13 night or the next morning. The minimum temperature dropped to 10.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather said, "As the smog layer thinned, the sun increased insulation and warming of the atmosphere, thereby lifting the mixing layer height." Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas said, "The adverse air quality was also greatly impacted by a dust storm moving in from the southwesterly directions of Thar desert, which amplified the PM2.5 and PM10 levels significantly." SAFAR said air quality was likely to remain in the "very poor" category for the next few days. "If lockdown is implemented for the next two days, air quality may improve a little. However, it is likely to remain very poor for the next two days if the stubble burning share doesn't increase. AQI is likely to deteriorate from Tuesday night due to calm winds. On Wednesday, it is likely to be in the upper end of the very poor category."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-winds-mercy-delhi-breathes-a-sigh-of-relief-aqi-very-poor/articleshow/87706225.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Goa||New private forest areas come to light||Panaji: The review committee carrying out ground verification of additional private forest areas in the state, as identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees, has found in the process new private forest areas. The body’s sub-committees carrying out the groundwork have found land adjacent to areas identified as private forests by the committees. The ground officers have told the review committee that these new areas also appear to qualify as private forests. The review committee has decided to inform the state government about these new private forest areas. “The member secretary invited the attention of the committee members that as per the patches provided by the Forest Survey of India, there are large green areas of more than 5ha and more than 40% canopy density found outside the survey numbers provisionally identified by Thomas & Araujo committees. However, the review committee is reviewing only the areas provisionally identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees as per the mandate given to the committee,” the review committee was informed at its meeting in August this year. The sub-committees felt that the ground verification can only be complete if these adjoining new patches of forests are taken into account. “It is also noticed that in some cases, the patch extends to the areas adjacent to the survey numbers which are not identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees and that the review can only be completed if the entire patch is verified in the field,” the review committee was told. The example of two survey numbers at Velim in Salcete taluka were shown to the committee. However, the review committee decided that it will only work within the mandate provided to it for now. “The committee observed that its mandate is to review only the areas identified by the Thomas & Araujo committees, but this issue may be brought to the notice of the government,” the review committee has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-private-forest-areas-come-to-light/articleshow/87704829.cms||---
---||India||SC ruling may deter builders from challenging Rera orders||NEW DELHI: In what could be a relief for homebuyers and deter builders from the usual practice of resorting to long legal recourse by challenging orders of Rera authorities, the Supreme Court in a recent judgment has upheld a provision in the real estate law, which makes it mandatory for builders to deposit full compensation and interest ordered by the regulator or at least 30% of the penalty as a pre-condition for challenging any such order before the appellate authority. The court has also upheld the provision that the appellate authority has the freedom to increase the mandatory deposit beyond 30%. While the penalty imposed by the Rera authorities goes to the Consolidated Fund of India or the state account, the refund is the entitlement of the customer. Homebuyers’ organisations said this judgment by a three-member bench, led by Justice U U Lalit on Thursday, will put an end to harassment of customers as builders found it a better option to challenge the Rera orders than paying the refund amount to the buyers. The SC held that the condition of pre-deposit imposed on promoters for filing appeals under Section 43(5) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act is neither discriminatory nor a violation of constitutional provision. The court observed: “The intention of the legislature appears to be to ensure that the rights of the decree holder (the successful party) is to be protected and only genuine bona fide appeals are to be entertained…the intention of the instant legislation appears to be that the promoters ought to show their bona fides by depositing the amount so contemplated.” Abhay Upadhyay, president of PFCE, an umbrella body of homebuyers, said, “This is a landmark judgment. We can now hope that this plugs all the loopholes and the builders must deposit the full refund ordered by the Rera authorities before going for any appeal. This will also filter the appeals which were intended only to harass homebuyers.” The pre-deposit provision was made to ensure that the money which has been computed by the authority must be safeguarded so that consumers don’t have to run from pillar to post to get their due, if the appellate authority passes order in favour of the buyer. The SC also upheld the retroactive application of Rera to the real estate projects which were ongoing at the commencement of the Act. Earlier, the Bombay HC had passed a similar order when different builders had challenged the applicability of the law to projects which had already started by the time the law was notified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-ruling-may-deter-builders-from-challenging-rera-orders/articleshow/87706263.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||‘Bizarre’ eligibility norms for posts put docs with disabilities in a bind||NEW DELHI: You are ineligible for the post of ENT, urology or dental surgeon if you cannot use both legs, but eligible if your disability affects both arms. “Why are those with both legs affected barred from these surgical specialties while allowing those with both arms affected? Do they conduct surgery with their legs?” asked a doctor with disability about the bizarre identification of posts. The strange identification of posts for doctors with disabilities came to light when the organisation Doctors With Disability: Agents of Change (DwDAoC) raised the issue of institutes of national importance including all the AIIMS advertising posts for recruitment without including the latest identified posts for persons with disabilities. Though a January notification of the social justice and empowerment ministry has identified hundreds (593) of more posts for those with disability than the last notification in 2013, DwDAoC has challenged the very concept of identifying posts, especially in the medical field. “The identification of posts for doctors with disabilities continues to categorise people according to body parts such as OA OL BL (one arm, one leg, both legs) rather than seeing their functional ability. Unlike post-graduation in other disciplines, in medicine, it combines active duty with studies. No matter what their disabilities, if they have a post graduate degree in a specialty, it means they are capable of carrying out the job for which they have specialised. However, many such specialists cannot get a job as posts in their specialty have not been identified as being open for persons with their specific disability,” explained Dr Sharad Philip, a DwDAoC member. The January notification identifies posts in urology and ENT (ear, nose, throat), two surgical specialties, as open to OA, BA, OL (one arm, both arms and one leg) but not for someone with both legs affected (BL). There is a surgeon super specialising in urological surgery both of whose legs are affected who conducts surgeries using a standing wheelchair. However, he will be ineligible for any post as he is ‘BL’. Similarly, in the case of psychiatry, persons with visual disability are excluded. However, Dr Philip, who has low vision due to retinitis pigmentosa, has completed post-graduation in psychiatry in the premier institute for mental health in India, NIMHANS, Bangalore. Going by the government’s notification, he will not be eligible for any faculty post in psychiatry. However, the notification identifies the post of faculty of medicine for persons who are blind or have low vision. There are also essential activities listed against each post. These include S (sitting), ST (standing), KC (kneeling and crouching), MF (manipulation with fingers), SE (seeing) and C (communication). Of these, kneeling and crouching is listed as a functional requirement for posts in surgical specialties like ENT and urology and for psychiatry. Senior residents in psychiatry do not have to kneel or crouch, but have to be capable of bending and lifting. DwDAoC’s letter pointing out these “absurd” stipulations has been forwarded to the social justice and empowerment ministry for “appropriate action”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bizarre-eligibility-norms-for-posts-put-docs-with-disabilities-in-a-bind/articleshow/87706266.cms||Rema Nagarajan

---||Nagpur||After grad constituency debacle, BJP taking MLC polls seriously||Nagpur: Wary after its crushing defeat in the graduates’ constituency elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is not taking the December 10 MLC polls lightly. The party’s strategy makers have already started preparing for not only the Nagpur seat, but also others at Mumbai, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Buldhana, and Washim. The saffron leadership’s apprehensions are not ill-founded. In 2009 elections, former minister Rajendra Mulak won with a wafer-thin margin of just four votes against sitting BJP MLC Ashok Mankar. That time too the BJP had more numbers in the local civic bodies and was ruling Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). BJP city president Pravin Datke told TOI that the party wouldn’t be taking any chances even though their victory was a foregone conclusion due to advantage of about 65 seats. “In view of our defeat in graduates constituency polls in December last year, we would be careful while devising poll strategies. We will ensure that there is no overconfidence among activists and leaders while going to the polls,” he said. For BJP, winning the seat is also a prestige issue considering that two of its biggest leaders – Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who is also former chief minister – hail from the city. Any defeat in their home town directly affects their credibility. In graduates’ constituency polls, Congress Abhijit Wanjari defeated former mayor and favourite Sandip Joshi by a big margin of 18,910 votes, even though the seat was a BJP bastion ever since it was formed and represented by party heavyweight Gadkari. The unexpected loss for the first time on this MLC seat in 58 years had jolted the saffron party from within and raised several questions on credibility of its biggest leaders. Earlier, the party suffered a defeat in 2019 assembly elections in the district as it managed to win just six seats out of 12 in comparison to 2014, when it won 11, when state minister Sunil Kedar was the lone winner from Congress. Speaking on the party’s loss in 2009, sitting MLC Girish Vyas said cross voting by four Kamptee councillors had turned the tide in opposition’s favour that time. “We will ensure that such situation is not repeated. I am launching a book on Friday highlighting my work in the constituency in last six years. It would be unveiled by Gadkari and other top party functionaries at Suresh Bhat Hall. We have really done a commendable job during the Covid-19 crisis by not only spending funds, but also providing all kinds of help during the emergency,” he told TOI. BOX # WHAT BJP IS WARY OF * Suffered humiliating defeat in its own den in graduates constituency polls * Seat was BJP’s bastion since beginning, since 58 years * Heavyweights like Union minister Nitin Gadkari had usually won seat * Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) would be contesting polls with full might * In 2015, Congress withdrew its candidate after an unofficial pact with BJP * In 2009 polls, Congress’ Rajendra Mulak won by just four votes * He managed to defeat Ashok Mankar due to cross voting by Kamptee councillors * Party failed to retain seats in 2019 assembly polls * It managed to win just 6 of 12 seats, as compared to 11 in 2014||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-grad-constituency-debacle-bjp-taking-mlc-polls-seriously/articleshow/87704894.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Airport director Gagan Malik said there is quite a lot about Goa that people do not know and that the airport authorities are attempting to highlight those facets. As part of the initiative, the arrival lounge and the aiprort’s compound wall have art work showcasing various heritage sites of Goa. The entrance gate, meanwhile, has been given a carnival look with face masks decorating the area and colourful illumination at night. “People feel that Goa is about beaches and merry-making. But Goa is also a serious destination that is rich in heritage. It’s nice to see people taking selfies at the entrance gate of airport. Visitors are also often seen exploring Goa at the airport itself,,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/visitors-to-get-feel-of-goa-right-from-airport/articleshow/87704903.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||As air turns fouler, Haryana asks schools in 4 NCR districts to shut for a week||GURUGRAM: The Haryana government on Sunday directed four NCR districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonipat — to shut down schools and halt construction activity for the next seven days in the wake of deteriorating air quality. The order, in line with a similar directive by the Delhi government on Saturday, was issued by additional chief secretary SN Roy. The order said the air quality across NCR and neighbouring areas were far below the “accepted norms” and could prove to be detrimental to the health of children all the more. On Saturday, the Supreme Court had taken cognisance of the foul air quality in the region and directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent steps to reduce AQI levels, asking “how will people breathe?” Following the apex court’s observation, a meeting was convened by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas. Apart from asking schools to stay shut, the Haryana government also directed offices to instruct their employees to work from home. “After considering the present situation, the government of Haryana has decided to take quick action with a view to lower the air pollutants immediately. For the next seven days in the four NCR districts, it has been directed that all schools remain closed. All government, private establishments operate their non-essential activities from home. The idea is to reduce 40% vehicular load from the roads,” Roy said in the order. Construction and demolition activity, according to the order, must be stalled immediately. The government also asked the authorities to ensure there was no instance of waste burning in the open and manual sweeping. The civic bodies, it said, will have to ensure regular sprinkling of water on the roads to help the dust settle down. After staying in the “severe” category for the last two days, Gurugram’s air quality slid to “poor” on Sunday because of better wind speed. On Sunday, the AQI in the city was at 287, down from 441 on Saturday. But since November 2, Gurugram’s air quality has hovered around the “very poor” to “severe” mark. Officials in the pollution department said the AQI might again dip to “very poor” in the coming week. On Sunday, only one of four air monitoring stations in Gurugram recorded AQI in the “very poor” category. While Gwal Pahari recorded the highest AQI of 302 (very poor), Sector 51 clocked 292, Vikas Sadan 297 and Teri Gram 257. According to the central Pollution Control Board, a “very poor” AQI can lead to “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”. Several private hospitals in the city have already been reporting a surge in cases of respiratory illnesses. The state pollution control board officials said the civic authorities and other agencies were following all measures as laid down under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). “All civic agencies are managing the situation on the ground to ensure the air quality becomes breathable again. Although there was an improvement in AQI on Sunday, their air quality is likely to drop in the coming days because of a dip in the temperature,” an official said. He also pointed out that the air was better on Sunday because there were fewer vehicles on the road. Gurugram, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), recorded a minimum temperature of 11°C on Sunday. When the mercury is low, it prevents the dispersal of pollutants closer to the ground. The AQI across NCR wasn’t any better. Delhi, meanwhile, registered “very poor” air on Sunday, with an AQI of 330. On Saturday, the AQI was 437 (severe) in the capital. The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 also reduced to 12% on Sunday from 31% the previous day, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR).

---||Goa||Chimbel locals continue to protest against tree axing||Panaji: Chimbel villagers and activists from other areas held a protest at the Provedoria complex on Sunday demanding a review of the decision to cut 30-odd trees for a new old age home. The protesters outside the complex stuck to their guns demanding the use of the existing building site for the new home. Various speakers at the protest said they would not allow the felling of decades-old trees for the centrally-funded project. Former MLA Victor Gonsalves said a new project at the cost of trees would impact the heritage site. Sanjay Ghatwal, an activist from Merces, said that while pursuing such projects proper assessment of environmental damage is not done and this is triggering disasters. “We are not against development but it should be done with minimal damage while protecting trees,” he said. After a series of protests in September, the issue heated up again after Provedoria sought police protection to axe the trees. Local activists Ana Gracias, Tukaram Kunkolkdar, Michael Dias and others spoke during the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chimbel-locals-continue-to-protest-against-tree-axing/articleshow/87704929.cms||---

In a variation from regular celebrations, the youngsters, along with their parents, headed off to Colva beach early Sunday morning, but instead of an expected swim in the sea or building of sand castles, the group undertook a clean-up of the beach. Within just about an hour, the children had collected 10 kg of waste from the beach. The parents of these children, mostly professionals, organised the clean-up in a bid to provide a meaningful celebration of Children’s Day for their kids. The idea was conceptualised by IT professionals Salomi and Samir Utagi. who are parents to Saanvee, 9, and Shloke, 5. “On the occasion of Children’s Day, we usually think of giving something to the children and it’s mostly food, it could be cakes or goodies. So, instead, we thought of giving them the idea of a safe and healthy planet for their future, making them responsible for it and setting an example by being a part of the cleaning activity with them,” Samir said. The children love the beach and seeing it littered isn’t a great sight. But why stop and complain when you can make a difference, he added. The group started out at 7.30am and managed to collect a total of 10 kg of waste. “The children left the beach feeling proud of their small yet impactful contribution to a cleaner country and a sustainable environment,” said Salomi. Small steps like these from each one of us every day can make a huge difference in the long run, said Saawni Kunde, the mother of the youngest participant, three-year-old Keya. “Being a part of the activity was fulfilling not just for me but for my three-year-old as well. It’s been my goal to make my daughter Keya aware of the environmental issues and protection,” she said. Aarav, Aaryaansh, Kanishka, Akshat and Kamaxi and their parents were the other participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/on-childrens-day-little-hands-achieve-big-feat-at-colva/articleshow/87704952.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Nagpur||PWD spent Rs1.1k cr to widen Nagpur, Gondia, Bhandara roads||Nagpur: Even as roads in some parts of the city are in bad condition, the state’s public works department (PWD) has concretized/asphalted and widened a few inter-district roads in Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia districts at the cost of Rs1,103 crore in the last two years. Two major roads in the city are part of PWD’s project. As per data available from the office of PWD superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh, over 95% works of six packages approved under hybrid annuity model (HAM) have been completed in these three districts. Minor works including footpath, road-divider, markings etc are likely to be completed soon. Under six packages, 378.48km long roads have been widened, concretized/asphalted — 136.22km in Nagpur, 130.36km in Bhandara and 111.9km in Gondia. The PWD came up with the HAM model for the first time in 2019 to execute large number of works simultaneously. Earlier, it used to execute works only on limited roads every year due to low budget. Under HAM, the private contractors gets 40% payment after project completion and remaining 60% in equal instalments in 10 years. The work is supposed to be completed in one and a half year. The contractors will have to maintain the roads for 10 years. The PWD will pay Rs20.71 crore for operation and maintenance of these six packages. North Ambazari road from Rani Jhansi Square to Vivekananda Memorial and the road from Ambazari T-point to Nagpur University Campus Square have been widened wherever required and concretized. Both these roads were in a sorry state. North Ambazari road was also damaged to a great especially after works of Metro Rail corridor. Now, minor works like road-divider etc are going on between Ambazari T-point and Campus Square. There are sprawling lakes, tiger reserves, religious places, water fountains etc in Bhandara and Gondia districts. Roads connecting these places have been widened and asphalted. --------------------------------------------- Six packages executed Nagpur district * Rani Jhansi Square to Vivekananda Memorial, Ambazari T-point to NU Campus Square, * Patansaongi to Fetri to Hingna; Narkhed to Zilpa to Saoner to Parseoni * Hingna to Kanholibara Chowk and Panchgaon to Kuhi to Ambhora Bhandara district *Jamb to Mohadi to Lakhani to Palandur; Adyal to Lakhani to Tirora to state border *Tumsar to Devada to Sakoli Gondia district * Roads connecting tourist places; state border to Amgaon to Etapalli-Allapalli road * State border to Gondia to Sadak Arjuni to Gadchiroli-Chamorshi-Ashti road||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pwd-spent-rs1-1k-cr-to-widen-nagpur-gondia-bhandara-roads/articleshow/87704942.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolkata||2 jumbos enter Jalpaiguri town, prohibitory orders imposed||Jalpaiguri: Prohibitory orders were issued after two elephants — a tusker and a makna (male without tusk) — entered Jalpaiguri town on Sunday night. The pachyderms, believed to be from Baikunthapur forest, travelled along the Teesta river bank, went into Paharpur, crossed the busy NH31D and walked into the town. Although the administration imposed Section 144 of CrPC, its implementation was poor as thousands tried to get a peek at the jumbos. The elephants were discovered around 3am on Sunday by the night guard at a Covid hospital in Biswa Bangla Krirangan, in the heart of Jalpaiguri town. Hearing noises, Bibhuti Roy grabbed his lathi and came out of his shelter, thinking there were thieves on the prowl. “Two elephants were roaming around on the Biswa Bangla Krirangan campus. It was difficult for me to believe what I was seeing. I came back my senses on hearing one trumpeting,” Roy said. The jumbos entered Topamari area in ward no.2, breaking the gate of the Jalpaiguri BL & LRO office on the way. They then entered Biswa Bangla Krirangan campus, broke open its fencing and crossed the Karala river to enter ward no.24. From there, they went behind Arabindu Byamagar O Pathagar Club through Pabitra Nagar colony to take refuge in a graveyard. To distract the elephants from raiding Pabitra Nagar colony, power was cut. “These are maljuria elephants. Such jumbos have the habit of trying to explore new routes. But they often turn ferocious when they do not get enough food after being holed up for long,” said state wildlife advisory board member Animesh Bose. Foresters from Lataguri and Moraghat range, Ramsai, Binnaguri, Belakoba, Malbazar, Airawat and Sukna WL squads and Jalpaiguri Mobile Patrolling Party could not drive away the animals till late evening. “We are trying to make the elephants return to the forest. But it’s not an easy task, especially in places where there is a thick habitat,” said Mridul Kumar, divisional forest officer, Jalpaiguri division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-jumbos-enter-jalpaiguri-town-prohibitory-orders-imposed/articleshow/87705333.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

Subramaniam, a 34th-batch alumnus of the post-graduate programme, expressed his gratitude to the institute, saying it taught him the “ability to think from first principle” and apply it to the country’s economic recovery after Covid. Narasimhan, a 21st-batch alumnus, urged students to challenge their limitations and “do something to make the planet a better place to live in”. Sambamurthy, an 18th batch alumnus, said: “The two most important words are ‘integrity’ and ‘fun’. It is up to us to live a life of integrity and give back to the institute but at the same time, we need to seize the moment and enjoy the company we have.” Alagh, a 3rd-batch alumnus, said people should not focus on how to live but plan how to die. “Real happiness comes from how you plan to die, how people are going to remember you after your death,” he said. Speaking on the occasion, Shrikrishna Kulkarni, chairperson of the IIM-C board of governors, emphasised the need to prepare managers not just for industrial, financial and commercial enterprises but also as enablers of social change and national development.

---||Kolkata||TMC seeks arrest of Tripura BJP MLA over threats||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress on Sunday demanded action against BJP’s Ramnagar MLA Surjait Dutta, who reportedly in the presence of Tripura CM Biplab Deb at a public meeting, asked BJP workers not to allow any ground to TMC candidates and said there should not be “any courtesy or mercy”. BJP did not immediately respond to the allegations or the video of the meeting shared by Trinamool. TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev demanded immediate arrest of the Ramnagar MLA. Trinamool spokesman Kunal Ghosh said Dutta needed to be arrested as he had violated a Supreme Court directive and was threatening TMC candidates. He said all these showed that BJP was afraid of Trinamool. The video clip tweeted by Tripura Trinamool Congress showed MLA Dutta asking BJP partymen to chase away Trinamool candidates. He said as BJP had faced torture in past three decades, the same should be paid back. He even mentioned that he was shot at seven times in the past. Trinamool also tweeted the letter of BJP MLA Sudip Roy Burman written to the DGP on Saturday on the law and order situation in Tripura in which he asked for ensuring free and fair polls so that voters can vote fearlessly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-seeks-arrest-of-tripura-bjp-mla-over-threats/articleshow/87705377.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cash-for-candidate audio raises political pitch in civic poll run-up||Kolkata: A cash-for-candidate allegation surfaced on Sunday with Trinamool Congress releasing an audio clip on its Twitter handle in which a person is heard negotiating for Rs 1 lakh each for nomination of 12 candidates in the upcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls. One among the persons in this conversation was allegedly South Kolkata BJP worker Pritam Sarkar, who had defected from Trinamool to BJP several months ago. Sarkar claimed the audio clip was fake and denied having any such conversation in the first place. He also threatened legal action. Police said no complaint was lodged till Sunday evening. Bengal BJP, however, kept Sarkar off any organizational work until he could clear himself of the allegations. On Sunday morning, Trinamool posted an audio of a purported telephonic conversation between a person alleged to be Sarkar and another unidentified person that went viral. In the clip, a conversation is heard to broker a deal. One speaker – alleged to be Sarkar – is also heard saying he is close to Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar and will have a word with him over selection of candidate for the forthcoming civic poll. He also demanded from the other person Rs 1 lakh each for 12 candidates. Majumdar termed the incident a ploy to tarnish BJP’s image. “The person (Sarkar) who is heard on the clip was a Trinamool Congress worker earlier. He used to organize several fairs and other events for Trinamool,” he said. Trinamool tweeted: “@BJP4Bengal is demanding Rs 1 lakh for each candidate. @DrSukantaBJP, is this how you collect funds for your propaganda?” Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said BJP had reached a state of desperation and alleged that its workers were collecting funds this way. As the clip went viral, Sarkar said he would take steps to bust the fake news. “This is fake audio and I got it last night. My photo was used in the video and that was fake. I am nowhere associated with such a conversation. Definitely someone has circulated it with political motives. Someone is trying to tarnish my image,” he said. “This is not the first time such fake videos about BJP leaders went into circulation,” Sarkar continued. “A few days back, someone had put up banners in the name of the South Kolkata district president of BJP. Such attacks are normal for BJP workers.” Sarkar joined BJP barely a year ago. He was not given any official responsibility, but was seen participating in debates and youth parliament workshops. “We have asked him not to participate in any organizational work till he proves himself innocent. It is a duty to clear himself of charges,” said Shankar Sikdar, BJP’s South Kolkata president. “There are many who have joined BJP and it is not possible to keep a tab on each. He is a mere karyakarta. But we will allow him to join any organizational work after he proves himself innocent,” Sikdar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cash-for-candidate-audio-raises-political-pitch-in-civic-poll-run-up/articleshow/87705323.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Burdwan elephant herd now split in two||Burdwan: The herd of elephants in East Burdwan was split up on Saturday night as the calves were unable to keep up with the adult male elephants. While some of the animals were driven 11-12km from Bhalki’s Pratappur jungle, mothers and calves remained far behind. Forest staff on Sunday said their plan to herd out the pachyderms had to be stalled because of rain around 4pm. At present, the herd is roaming in separate groups between Pratappur jungle and Jamtara jungle under Ausgram (II). Forest officials and hulla parties have been deployed to different positions. Arup Middya, anchal sabhadhipati of Bhalki panchayat, told TOI: “We are also ready with a 100-member team. We have this big a group because elephants have entered Bhalki jungle several times. Our teams also cooperate with the forest department and administration. They guarded the villages with burnt tyres at night.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/burdwan-elephant-herd-now-split-in-two/articleshow/87705387.cms||Mohammad Asif
