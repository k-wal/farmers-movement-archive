On the opening day of winter session of Parliament on Monday, the government secured approval of both Houses for the repeal amid protests by the opposition parties which insisted on a debate. The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, which sought to rescind the three laws passed last year, was passed by Lok Sabha within minutes. The exercise was replicated in the afternoon in Rajya Sabha. The passage of the legislation for revocation, promised by PM on Guru Nanak’s birthday on November 19, brings the curtains down on an intensely contested episode which saw sustained protests by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western UP, their tenacity eventually forcing a rethink. The bill will now be sent to the President for his assent to meet the procedural requirement for the extinction of the three laws. While the demise of the bills addresses their principal pitch, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) - the joint body of the protesting farmer unions leading the current protests - has refused to end the agitation and has been pressing the government to concede six other demands they have raised, including a legal guarantee for procurement of crops at MSP, sacking and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and withdrawal of cases against farmers. As the government moved swiftly to meet the PM’s public pledge for the recall of the farm laws and cast off what had become a millstone around its neck, opposition parties led by Congess demanded a discussion, but in vain. In Lok Sabha, just as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced the bill, some opposition MPs trooped into the well of the House, raising slogans and holding banners, demanding a debate. Speaker Om Birla said he was ready to allow discussion on the bill provided there was order in the House. “You want a debate, I am ready to allow debate when there is order in the House. But if you come to the Well, how can there be a debate,” he said asking the members to take their seats. Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asked why there is no discussion since the bill was listed for consideration and passage. He accused the government of taking the House for a ride. As opposition MPs continued to shout slogans, the Speaker put the bill to voice vote and declared it as passed. Tomar introduced the bill in Rajya Sabha after the House assembled in the afternoon. He said there was no need for any discussion as both government and opposition wanted the laws repealed. Importantly, Rajya Sabha had also cleared the three reform laws by voice vote. On Monday, before the motion was adopted for passage of the bill, Deputy Chairman Harivansh allowed Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to speak for two minutes. Kharge said the government had taken back the three farm laws because of the upcoming elections in states. He also mentioned the alleged deaths of over 700 farmers in more than a year during the agitation against these laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-approves-repeal-of-farm-laws-with-voice-vote/articleshow/87991135.cms||---

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday night issued an order asking airports to have “separate holding area (while passengers from at-risk countries are awaiting their RT-PCR test results)… with proper amenities for passengers (and) protocols to avoid congestion”. “Signages may be put up at prominent places and volunteers may be placed to guide the passengers to prevent any chaos.”  The regulator has the asked the airlines to put in place a mechanism for testing 5% of arriving passengers from the countries not at risk. “Announcements as to the seat numbers selected through the randomisation process may be made in the flight itself so that the passengers are prepared,” the order says.  “All incoming passengers accordingly may be advised, while filling up Air Suvidha portal, that they should plan their onwards journey keeping in mind the stay at the airport to obtain the test results. They should also be prepared for movement to state government-identified quarantine facilities if they test positive at the airport,” it says. All international arrivals have to give travel history of the last 14 days.  As of November 26, the Union health ministry’s list of at-risk countries include those in Europe, apart from South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. This risk-based list will keep getting updated as the situation evolves. Given the fact that international air travel was picking up in past few months, the task at hand for testing all arrivals from there will be a logistical challenge. Airline and airport operators have begun gearing up for the same. A spokesperson for GMR Group, that runs the Delhi and Hyderabad airports, said they would be ready with all necessary arrangements on time keeping in mind the fresh guidelines and passenger convenience. “We will ensure adherence to the Covid-19 protocol during the stay of passengers inside the terminal.”  A Bengaluru airport spokesperson said they are working with all the airlines and other stakeholders to implement the new procedures and minimise inconvenience to the passengers.  The two most asked questions that affected passengers and their relatives about the new travel rules starting December 1 are: Can someone flying in from at-risk countries leave airport after getting tested on arrival? And, do such passengers need to wait for test report before taking a connecting domestic flight?  “People taking connecting domestic flight will need a negative report from the test on arrival,” said a senior airline official. Citing state-specific rules, Delhi and Hyderabad airport officials said arrivals will be allowed to leave if they test negative. “Passengers from other at-risk countries (not in the list) can leave after giving samples. All arrivals from these countries will also need to undergo a test on day eight.”  The Omicron scare comes at a time when travel was beginning to resume. “This is eerily similar to last December when it seemed we were in the endemic stage and then the Delta variant was detected in the United Kingdom. Now again things were going back to normal and Omicron has been detected. We just hope the similarity ends right here, right now,” said an airline official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/come-december-1-arrivals-from-omicron-hit-nations-will-need-negative-covid-report-for-onward-journey/articleshow/87991307.cms||Saurabh Sinha

A final decision on the issue, however, will be taken by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) next week, which will be then considered by the health ministry for approval. It would be too early as yet to speculate on just when the doses will be given. “We shall decide this after the NTAGI meeting next week,” a senior official told TOI. Experts say vaccination is certainly a strong public health measure and, even in case of mutations, may prove protective to a large extent. “Data from various countries suggest that majority of the deaths due to Covid-19 and even hospitalisation, particularly those who are critical, are among unvaccinated. Secondly, the data suggests that those who are immuno-compromised, like transplant patients or cancer patients, sometimes may need a third dose because their immune systems do not work so well,” the official said. Meanwhile, the government is also working on a comprehensive policy for vaccination of children. “We are ready with a comprehensive plan for vaccinating children below 18 years of age. A prioritisation process — similar to adults — has been prepared so that children with co-morbidities or those who are immuno-compromised are given priority. We will submit this plan to the ministry very soon but time to start vaccination among children is yet to be specified,” Covid-19 taskforce chairman Dr N K Arora said. Officials say even some elderly may require an additional dose as they may not generate enough antibodies or develop immunity. “There are also cases, where vaccine induced immunity may wane faster because of age, underlying disease or inability of body. There are some memory cells that are created which will immediately respond when one gets the infection but may be in some cases – where people are elderly or immune-compromised, it is not happening. So there is no harm in giving an additional dose to such people,” an official said. In the wake of Omicron, the new variant of SARS-COV2, the government is also closely tracking the data to analyse trends such as severity of infection among new Covid-19 cases, especially those that are getting hospitalised even after vaccination, and those dying from the infection. However, the expert panel feels that at this point there is no data in India to suggest a need for a booster dose for all adults. “Most people here are young and have a good level of immunity. The sero surveys conducted by states recently suggest 90-95% of adult population have immunity. Even among children, the sero-prevalence is around 80%. The national sero-survey will further validate that,” the official said. The World Health Organisation’s Scientific Advisory Group will also deliberate on the issue of need for booster dose in the wake of Omicron in its upcoming meeting on December 7. Meanwhile, the government here is focused on completing first dose coverage among all of its adult population, and expand coverage among those due for their second dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expert-panel-mulls-nod-to-additional-dose-of-covid-vaccine-to-elderly/articleshow/87991487.cms||Sushmi Dey

However, no formal decision had been made as of November 29. A little over five months ago, a sudden meeting to analyse creation of new infrastructure in Gujarat came as a surprise for many. Reason: Discussions were about creating a control centre. While a feasibility took off for what scientists term a “mirror” control/mission centre, many remain apprehensive about the need for such a centre, given that Isro’s control nerve centre, ISTRAC in Bengaluru, has already begun renovation specifically for Gaganyaan. Weeks later, there was another discussion about a possible astronauts’ rehabilitation centre in Gujarat. Multiple Isro scientists, engineers and staffers TOI has been speaking with over the past several weeks have consistently said there has been no formal order for creation of anything, but that “there are ad hoc instructions about checking for feasibility”. Isro chairman K Sivan explained: “Gaganyaan, unlike any other mission, is much bigger involving many national agencies and labs. For optimal utilisation of resources and considering various technical aspects and human safety, it’s necessary to spread facilities across many places. One shouldn’t look at this as shifting something from one place to another, it’s in fact, creation of new infrastructure.” Control/Mission CentreScientists explained that Gujarat — if Isro decides to create it there — will get a “mirror control centre” on the lines of what ISTRAC will have but maybe slightly smaller. “We’ll have 100-150 consoles, AV facilities, space for VIPs etc,” one of them said. At ISTRAC, work for a dedicated Gaganyaan control centre is ongoing. “Unlike other missions which require only two halls — for space systems and ground systems — Gaganyaan will need three. The third for environment control and life support, crew and other aspects,” a senior scientist explained. “...Given this will be ready and supplemented by a network of ground stations across the globe, what’s the technical justification for a mirror facility? There appears to be other, including political considerations, for such thinking,” another scientist said. However, a senior official from Isro HQ clarified that a project as critical as Gaganyaan requires redundancies. “That’s why we are thinking of this,” he said. Landing On Arabian Sea Or BoB Will Decide RehabAnd, the astronauts’ rehabilitation centre, another scientist explained, “will be a new facility that needs to come up close to the landing site. It could come up in Gujarat if we decide to land on Arabian Sea and not Bay of Bengal (BoB).” TOI had reported earlier that Isro was weighing both options with initial assessment showing BoB to be more rough than Arabian sea. Now, a scientist from the headquarters said: “Crew landing could mostly happen off Gujarat coast because the Indian Navy has said that BoB is a rough sea with high waves, which may cause the module to go under water. After landing, rescue will take about two odd hours, and given the height of the waves on BoB, there’s apprehension that it could go above the crew module hatch making it difficult to rescue astronauts. This makes the Arabian sea more feasible. However, no final decision has been made yet.” After landing, the crew will need rehabilitation and such a centre, another official reiterated, needs to be close to the sea. This centre will have medical and other facilities. “If BoB is considered for the landing finally, a rehab centre could come up on the West Coast. Mostly like at the spaceport in Sriharikota. Even otherwise we could have backup centres,” the official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gaganyaan-control-centre-astronauts-rehab-unit-may-go-to-gujarat-no-final-decision-yet/articleshow/87991719.cms||Chethan Kumar

The project is one of the major infrastructural development works which the BJP government hopes to showcase as one of its biggest achievements ahead of the 2022 assembly polls in the state. During a package wise review of the project on Monday, the CM interacted with the DMs of the districts through which the project will be passing. These districts include Etawah, Auraiya, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot. The CM asked the officials to immediately identify land along both sides of the expressway where an industrial corridor and clusters can be set up. “Along with the construction of the main expressway, work should also be carried out to install signages and borders,” he said. UPEIDA CEO Awanish Awasthi informed the CM that the upcoming expressway would be the “safest” expressway and completed in the shortest period of time. The CM also launched a Road Anthem during the meeting. The Bundelkhand Expressway will connect the lesser developed districts of the state with Delhi through the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and Yamuna Expressway. The 296-km project will start near Bharatkoop at Jhansi-Prayagraj National Highway Number-35 in Chitrakoot and traverse through seven districts before ending near Kudrail village in Etawah on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/start-operation-of-bundelkhand-eway-by-dec-31-says-uttar-pradesh-cm/articleshow/87991741.cms||---
---||World||Ghislaine Maxwell targeted young girls for abuse, prosecutor in her opening remarks||NEW YORK: Ghislaine Maxwell preyed on young girls for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, a US prosecutor said on Monday in her opening statement in the New York trial of the British socialite.  Between 1994 and 2004, Maxwell - a former employee and romantic partner of Epstein's - allegedly sent gifts such as lingerie and discussed sexual topics with the girls to win their trust before encouraging them to give Epstein erotic massages, according to the 2021 indictment against her.  "She preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused," assistant district attorney Lara Pomerantz said in the prosecution's opening statement.  Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-abuse charges.  Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes, including two counts of perjury that will be tried at a later date. Maxwell, who appeared in court wearing a white face mask amid the Covid-19 pandemic, faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted on all counts.  Maxwell's trial comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged victims of sexual abuse to speak out against powerful men such as movie producer Harvey Weinstein and R&B singer R Kelly accused of misconduct. The case against Maxwell stands out in part because she is a woman.  Four accusers are expected to testify as government witnesses in the trial.  Maxwell frequently wrote during the morning proceedings, sometimes handing notes to her lawyers.  Prosecutors have said Maxwell encouraged the girls to massage Epstein while they were fully or partially nude. In some cases, Epstein or Maxwell would pay them cash or offer to pay for their travel or education, and Epstein sometimes masturbated or touched the girls' genitals during the massages, prosecutors said.  Pomerantz described Maxwell as "essential" to Epstein's abuse of the girls, seeking to undermine the defence's expected argument that she was not aware of Epstein's alleged crimes.  "Sometimes, she was even in the room for the massages herself, and sometimes she touched the girls' bodies," Pomerantz said. "And even when she was not in the room, make no mistake: she knew exactly what Epstein was going to do with those children when she sent them to him inside the massage rooms."  Maxwell's lawyers have said that prosecutors, unable to convict Epstein, are using the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell as a scapegoat.  "Left with no fish to attempt to fry, the government belatedly turned to Ms Maxwell," her lawyers wrote in a February 4 filing.  Maxwell's lawyers have indicated that they will question the credibility of the four alleged victims by asking why they waited to come forward and arguing that they have financial incentives to lie or exaggerate.  "Any accuser who testifies that Ms Maxwell participated in sex abuse or sex trafficking is not telling the truth," her lawyers wrote in court papers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ghislaine-maxwell-targeted-young-girls-for-abuse-prosecutor-in-her-opening-remarks/articleshow/87991889.cms||---

The center, in partnership with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub, will help the central bank improve the current payments system, Fed chair Jerome Powell said in remarks prepared for a virtual event on Monday.  "In particular, the partnership will support our analysis of digital currencies, including central bank digital currencies," said Powell, adding that the center would focus on making cross-border payments faster and less expensive and provide new tools to help supervise financial firms.  Powell did not comment on his outlook for the economy or monetary policy in his remarks.  The Fed is in the process of exploring whether it should launch a digital version of the US dollar, and the board is working on a discussion paper that would explore the policy issues surrounding a central bank digital currency.  Researchers at the New York Fed have also developed an approach to measuring banks' exposures to climate-related risks, potentially an early step toward assessing whether financial institutions have enough capital on hand to withstand them.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/new-york-fed-reserve-launches-innovation-center-powell-says-it-will-help-central-bank-improve-payments/articleshow/87991904.cms||---

It said failure to do so will force the court to set up an implementation force. The direction came from a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant after SG Tushar Mehta said that the commission, comprising officials from the five states and the Centre, had in September directed the states to take measures in anticipation of rise in pollution. Many of the directions are either partly complied with or not complied with,” Mehta said. The bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said, “Meetings are happening. Directions are passed. Our directions are also being passed on to the states. But, nothing is happening at the ground level. The pollution keeps increasing and it is hovering at a ‘severe’ level in Delhi.” The SC sought answers from Delhi and the four NCR states to specify within 48 hours what steps they have taken to implement all the directions issued by the court, the commission and the Union government. It posted the matter for further hearing on Thursday and asked the state to file affidavits by Wednesday evening. Mehta said a significant cause for air pollution in the NCR are the polluting industries. The Commission had on August 12 directed Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan to ensure that industries operating in NCR districts shift to PNG/cleaner fuels, he said, adding that the direction has been either partly complied with or still remains to be implemented. The SC sought the status of implementation of this direction from all states. The SG said the Commission’s direction to the states to closely and regularly monitor the industries, which already have gas supply available to them, and ensure their switching to cleaner fuel is still to be fully complied with. Apart from these two directions, the SC also sought answers from the state governments on the implementation of its direction on the ban on use of diesel generator (DG) sets, except as backup for emergency purposes (the SG said many DG sets were found running on surprise inspection at malls and commercial establishments in NCR); status of implementation of the direction of impounding petrol/diesel vehicles, which are more than 15/10 years old and still found plying in the NCR; and the steps taken on ground by the states for prevention of dust pollution, control and suppression of dust particulates permeating the air from roads and from open areas along the right of way. Further, the Court sought replies on the status on the checks and action taken on visibly polluting vehicles and vehicles without valid PUC; steps taken by states for dust mitigation measures in construction and demolition sites, C&D waste management as per the rules and directions related to transportation of C&D materials; and steps taken by states for registration of construction projects on the Web Portals for remote monitoring by enforcement agencies and self-certification of compliance of rules related to C&D activities by the project proponents.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-on-pollution-ncr-states-on-48-hour-notice/articleshow/87991878.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The government hopes to complete the transaction in the current financial year. The government has set a target of raising Rs 1.75 lakh crore from disinvestment in state-run entities and listing of LIC. So far, the government has has raised Rs 9,330 crore as disinvestment receipts. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) empowered Alternative Mechanism, which includes finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, road transport minister Nitin Gadkari, MoS (independent charge) science and technology Jitendra Singh, approved the highest price bid of Nandal Finance and Leasing Pvt Ltd for sale of 100% equity shareholding of the government in Central Electronics Ltd (CEL). The public sector entity falls under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). It was established in 1974, with an objective to commercially exploit indigenous technologies developed by national laboratories and R&D institutions in the country. The CEL is a pioneer in the country in the field of Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) and it has developed the technology with its own R&D efforts, according to the company’s website. The process of CEL disinvestment started in 2016 with the ‘in-principle’ approval of the CCEA. Final bids were invited in 2019 but it did not receive any response from investors, according to a government statement. The process was re-launched in February 2020 and three bids were received by July and all the bidders were shortlisted by the transaction advisor. The shortlisted bidders were given access to the virtual data Room (VDR) through which CEL provided information to the qualified bidders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/after-air-india-govt-okays-sale-of-cel-for-rs-210-crore/articleshow/87991989.cms||---

---||World||Omicron risk very high, may change pandemic course: WHO||GENEVA: The Omicron coronavirus variant is likely to spread internationally, posing a “very high” global risk of infection surges that could have “severe consequences” in some areas, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday. It urged its 194 member states to accelerate vaccination of high-priority groups and, in anticipation of increased case numbers, to “ensure mitigation plans are in place” to maintain essential health services. “Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” the WHO said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant... is assessed as very high.” To date, no deaths linked to Omicron had been reported, though further research was needed to assess Omicron’s potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections, it said. “Increasing cases, regardless of a change in severity, may pose overwhelming demands on healthcare systems and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The impact on vulnerable populations would be substantial, particularly in countries with low vaccination coverage,” it said. The variant was first reported to WHO on November 24 from South Africa, where infections have risen steeply. It has since spread around the world, with new cases found in the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia even as more countries imposed travel restrictions to try to seal themselves off. Japan said on Monday it would close its borders to foreigners, joining Israel in taking the toughest measures. The WHO, in its latest guidance, reiterated that countries should use a “risk-based approach to adjust international travel measures in a timely manner”. Further advice would be forthcoming, it said. “The presence of multiple mutations of the spike protein in the receptor-binding domain suggests that Omicron may have a high likelihood of immune escape from antibody-mediated protection. However, immune escape potential from cell-mediated immunity is more difficult to predict,” it said. “Overall, there are considerable uncertainties in the magnitude of immune escape potential of Omicron.” More data was expected in coming weeks. “Covid-19 cases and infections are expected in vaccinated persons, albeit in a small and predictable proportion,” it added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/omicron-risk-very-high-may-change-pandemic-course-who/articleshow/87992108.cms||---

The government expressed solidarity in a statement with countries, particularly in Africa, that have so far been affected by Omicron. India’s announcement followed China’s pledge the same day to supply a billion vaccine doses to Africa. The MEA said in a statement that India had also cleared supplies of Covaxin to Botswana. “Any new requirement projected either bilaterally or through Covax will be considered expeditiously,” it said. “The government of India stands ready to support the countries affected in Africa in dealing with the Omicron variant, including by supplies of Made-in-India vaccines,” said the government. It said it is also ready to supply essential drugs, test kits, gloves, PPE kits and medical equipment. As the government recalled, India has so far supplied more than 25 million doses of Made-in-India vaccines to 41 countries in Africa. With many countries hastily banning all travel to and from South Africa and its neighbours, official sources said India felt it was important to stand by countries in the southern African region.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/india-vows-to-stand-by-africa-says-all-covax-orders-cleared/articleshow/87992205.cms||---

Maharashtra state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on Monday told TOI that a complete RT-PCR report for Covid included that of the ‘N’ , ‘S’ , ‘E’ and ‘ORF’ genes. “If the ‘S’ gene is absent in a person and the other genes are positive, it is an indirect way to know that the Omicron variant may be present in him or her even without conducting genome sequencing. Unfortunately, not all laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests are checking for the ‘S’ gene,” he said. “A directive may soon come for all laboratories to additionally check for the ‘S’ gene in a sample. Deletion of the ‘S’ gene will red-flag Omicron ahead of genome sequencing,” said the task force member The World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated that countries using PCR tests containing the ‘S’ gene could also utilize the ‘S’ gene target failure as a proxy marker for infection with the Omicron variant of Covid. “Similarly, PCR tests are under development to test for this variant without the need for full sequencing” a WHO statement read. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force and also the national Covid task force, said with Omicron being stated as a cause for concern across the world, maintaining caution was instrumental. “The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is continuously monitoring the evolution of the virus. Based on this, TAG-VE has advised WHO to designate Omicron as a virus of concern and will communicate new findings with the member states and public,” said Dr Pandit, who is the director (critical care) in Fortis Hospitals Mumbai. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, state coordinator for genome sequencing and head of B J Medical College’s microbiology department, said the current testing kits included detection of two different genes, that could be either ‘ORF’, ‘RdRp’, ‘N’ or ‘S’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/missing-s-gene-in-rt-pcr-test-can-point-to-omicron/articleshow/87992225.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The MP forwarded a representation by a delegation of former army officers to the defence minister, claiming that the Army headquarters had already sent him a proposal in October 2020, urging him to honour the veterans of the 1965 and 1971 wars by recognising their services under the YSY.  “The matter was discussed in October last year by a delegation of all India short-service commissioned officers, while the comments of CDS General Bipin Rawat have already been sent, as the government had accepted this scheme in principle. However, the papers, presently with the ministry, needs clearance,” reads the letter by the Patiala MP. It said the AQH in May last year had asked all released emergency and short-service commissioned (SSC) officers to send details of their service record. ""A total of 414 EC/SSC officers had sent their details but with the outbreak of the Covid, some lost their lives and only 385 are left. This is a diminishing pension account and presently all EC/SSC officers are in the 78 to 85-plus age group. A proposal by AHQ had recommended a grant of Rs 30,000 and DA per month to such war veterans,” the letter added.  “A large number of SSC officers are relieved from the army after putting in 5 to 19 years of service but sent home without any benefits, such as pension and medical facilities. Such officers, when relieved from the army, can be accommodated in paramilitary forces so that they do not have to look for alternative jobs. These officers are well trained and will be an asset to the forces,” the letter further read.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/clear-yudh-samman-scheme-to-honour-ec/scc-pak-war-veterans-patiala-mp-writes-to-rajnath/articleshow/87992193.cms||Bharat Khanna

A bench of justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna said creation of a portal will facilitate the applicants to apply for compensation from their homes and a person from a remote village would not have to go to the district headquarters to submit the documents. The bench said the online system will make the procedure easier and it should be adopted as it would avoid long queues at the collectors’ offices. The court examined the data placed before it by the Centre and noted that only 3,071 claim applications were filed in UP, where 22,909 deaths were recorded. In Kerala, 6,116 claim applications have been received out of total deaths of 38,737. “Thus, it can be said that either there is no wide publicity given by the states concerned with respect to the compensation offered for the death of a person due to Covid 19 or the claimants are not made aware where to apply,” it said. The court also directed the chief secretaries of all states to submit compliance reports on the number of deaths recorded, claim forms received so far and the number of persons to whom the amount of compensation has been disbursed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-many-yet-to-apply-for-ex-gratia-sc-says-create-portal-to-make-process-easier/articleshow/87992246.cms||---
---||India||Government healthcare spend up at 41% in FY18 from 29% in FY14||NEW DELHI: The share of government spending in total health expenditure increased significantly to 40.8% in 2017-18, up from 32.4% in previous year, and went up from 28.6% in 2013-14 during the UPA regime, the National Health Accounts estimates show. The findings show government spending on health as a share of total government expenditure increased to 5.1% from 3.7% between 2013-14 and 2017-18, indicating higher investments in the sector as compared to previous years. The higher spend by government along with increased share of expenditure in private health insurance has led to a decline in out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE). Data shows OOPE on health dropped as a percentage of the total health expenditure to below 50%. In 2017-18, 48.8% of expenditure on health was out-of-pocket, as against 58.7% in 2016-17 and 64.2% in 2013-14. Though OOPE on health has reduced significantly between 2013-14 and 2017-18 as against the reduction during previous years, it’s much higher than the global average of approximately 18% as sudden health emergencies can push poorer households into poverty. NHA estimates also show an increase in the share of government health expenditure in GDP of the country to 1.3% in 2017-18 from 1.20% in the preceding fiscal year, and from 1.15% in 2013-14. Yet, it remains far below the target of 2.5% of GDP envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017. The share of social security expenditure on health, which includes health insurance programme, government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements made to government employees increased during 2017-18. Its share in total health expenditure climbed to 9% in 2017-18 from 7.3% in 2016-17 and 6% in 2013-14. The share of foreign aid for health declined to 0.5% from 0.6% the previous year, which government attributes to India’s economic self-reliance. The 2017-18 estimates suggest enhanced public expenditure on healthcare which has led to decline in per capita out-of-pocket expenditure to Rs 2,097 in 2017-18, against Rs 2,336 in 2013-14. The government attributes the fall in out-of-pocket expenditure to the increased utilisation of government health facilities and reduction in the cost of services at these facilities. The share of primary healthcare in the current government expenditure increased to 54.7% in 2017-18 from 51.1% in 2013-14, as per report.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-healthcare-spend-up-at-41-in-fy18-from-29-in-fy14/articleshow/87992428.cms||---

AI will go to the fold of its winning bidder, Tata Group, and they want their issues resolved before the takeover. On November 17, 2021, they had written to the management saying “...while other airlines have started rolling back their Covid pay cut, we are still burdened by this pay cut of 55%. Despite our repeated pleas for restoring our (pay), there has been no response from the management.... There is no move to resolve the plethora of longstanding disinvestment issues, be it accounting of illegally withheld 25% arrears with appropriate interest…” The Tatas are set to take over by January 23, 2022, - the long stop date. ICPA’s November 17 letter had said: “We have given the management ample benefit of the doubt and more than enough time to remedy these issues.... Yet the management's silence on our service conditions and arrears is deafening…. this state of affairs is no longer tenable.

---||India||Regime change can’t lead to public contracts’ nixing: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In a hard hitting judgment, the Supreme Court on Monday said that mere change of regime cannot lead to mindless cancellation of public contracts entered into by the previous regime by parroting the specious grounds of public interest, loss to public exchequer and irregularities. Nuancing the sanctity attached to government contracts, a bench of CJI NV Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant said, “By merely using grounds of public interest or loss to the treasury, the successor public authority can’t undo the work undertaken by previous authority.” Writing the judgment, CJI Ramana said, “Such a claim must be proven using material facts, evidence and figures. If it were otherwise, then there will remain no sanctity in the words and undertaking of the government. Businessmen will be hesitant to enter government contract or make any investment in furtherance of the same. Such a practice is counterproductive to the economy and the business environment in general.” The ruling came in a judgment dismissing appeals of City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which had challenged a Bombay high court verdict quashing its decision to allot 47,000 square metre land to highest bidder Metropolis Hotel at Navi Mumbai in 2008, when an airport was proposed there. Later, CIDCO had allowed bifurcation of the land - 24,000 sq mt for a five-star hotel and 23,000 sq mt for commercial-cum-residential purpose. However, in 2011, the lease was cancelled on the ground of loss to exchequer and irregularities, which CIDCO could not substantiate either before the HC or the apex court. Castigating CIDCO, the CJI said, “It is clear that there is an element of abuse of bureaucratic power behind subsequent change in the tender allotment. After conducting a tender process and receiving money, the government back-tracked which led to prolonged litigation. The impugned order of CIDCO, annulling the allotment on hyper-technical grounds cannot be sustained for being contrary to the doctrine of fairness. The reasons in CIDCO's order cancelling the lease are perverse and per se based on extraneous considerations.” Upholding the land allotment to Metropolis Hotel, the three-judge bench said, “We are not able to identify any substantive violation of law or tender conditions, which mandate annulling the allotment and subsequent arrangements, thereby proving the conduct of the appellant authority to be disproportionate.” The bench said, “It appears that the PIL has opened a large window to entertain any tender, regardless of scale, which are now sought to be challenged as a matter of routine.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/regime-change-cant-lead-to-public-contracts-nixing-supreme-court/articleshow/87992529.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Consider weight of blotter paper while weighing LSD: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Merely because a blotter paper can be licked or put in a glass of water does not necessarily mean that it must be excluded while determining the LSD weight, ruled the Bombay high court on Monday. Justice Revati Mohite-Dere held that blotter paper be considered while weighing Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) based on an “underlying principle” enunciated by the Supreme Court, which in a case pertaining to heroin, had contemplated the whole ‘mixture’ while deciding its weight. LSD, a hallucinogenic narcotic drug, is placed as small dots on blotter paper for consumption. “The whole of the quantity — LSD with blotter paper — is to be taken into consideration whilst considering small or commercial quantity,” said the HC. The court held that the Mumbai forensic science laboratory (FSL) report was “not clear”, and in the interest of justice directed that the seizure of 31 blotter papers from Anuj Keshwani (30) be sent to the Gandhinagar FSL in Gujarat for a fresh test to ascertain whether each of the blotter paper contains LSD. Keshwani (30) was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau last September in the case against Rhea Chakraborty, former girlfriend of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The NCB had claimed that Keshwani was found in possession of 0.62gm LSD, a commercial quantity. The Gandhinagar FSL must give “weight of each of the blot papers purportedly containing LSD on it”, said the HC. It directed the laboratory to submit its report within six weeks to the special NDPS court. “LSD put on a blotter paper is capable of being swallowed after placing it on the tongue. It is thus evident that the blotter paper is capable of being swallowed and is used as one of the methods for consuming LSD,” said Justice Mohite-Dere. “It is important to bear in mind the legislative intent, the object and reasons, and, the preamble of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act while considering whether LSD is to be weighed sans the blotter paper.” The judgment was in a petition filed by NCB which said paper weight must be factored in to decide quantity of LSD seized. The agency’s special counsel ASG Anil Singh and counsel Advait Sethna with Shreeram Shirsat cited the recent Supreme Court ruling in Hira Singh’s case arguing that it required weight of drugs sold on street to include any ‘neutral substance’ mixed in it, not just its pure form. The HC said, as noted by the SC, it was never the intention of the legislature to exclude the quantity of the neutral substance and to consider only the actual content by weight of the offending drug. It is also pertinent to note that illicit drugs are seldom sold in a pure form. “They are always adulterated or cut with other substances or put in a gelatin or blotter paper, as in the present case,” said the HC. The Mumbai FSL report was silent on whether blotter paper was weighed too and thus “defective”, argued Keshwani’s counsel Rizwan Merchant and Taraq Sayed. The NCB said 32 complete blotter papers and 10 more together weighed 0.62gm. The FSL report said 31 blotter papers weighed the same, which “seems improbable”, said the HC. It accepted that “the FSL report is not clear whether it checked every blotting paper for LSD or not, or whether only one sample test was done”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-weight-of-blotter-paper-while-weighing-lsd-bombay-hc/articleshow/87992588.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||India||‘IT Parliamentary panel seeks Speaker’s nod to call FB whistleblowers’||NEW DELHI: The parliamentary standing committee on information and technology will continue its “grilling” of Facebook in at least one more of its meetings since the global social media platform was unable to provide satisfactory responses to questions raised by the members of the Shashi Tharoor-led House panel on Monday. The House summoned representatives of Facebook India after receiving a dossier from former Facebook data analyst and whistleblower Sophie Zhang, who had in her depositions alleged a “bias” in the way the platform handled content. She also pointed to lack of proper regulation, especially to identify and take down hate content in the Indian context. Sources said representatives of Facebook and the IT ministry were scheduled to appear before the House panel on Monday. However, with the conversation with the two representatives of Facebook India stretching to over two hours, the panel asked the ministry to appear before it on another day. Posers to Facebook included the contents of the Wall Street Journal Files, a series of reports based on internal Facebook documents, including some research reports. While the committee sought to question the Facebook team on what is not right with its internal systems — instead of the things Facebook said are in order — the House panel also sought to know how the company is attempting to reduce the role of human content moderators in the interest of privacy concerns, how far it has moved on its pledge to increase investments, the gaps so far as its Indian language capabilities are concerned, and how the company has progressed on suspending accounts following internal reporting of objectionable content, especially hate content. Facebook has been given two weeks to respond in writing to the committee’s questions. Sources said, some members made pointed references to internal Facebook communications pertaining to certain networks in India that are deemed to be purveyors of hateful content, alerts which Facebook India did not heed. One member, a source said, made specific references to a Facebook page by the name of ‘Sonkar Network’, which routinely posts communally sensitive and incendiary content, but which was not taken down by Facebook India despite being flagged by the platform’s mechanisms to identify and flag malicious content.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/it-parliamentary-panel-seeks-speakers-nod-to-call-fb-whistleblowers/articleshow/87992638.cms||Swati Mathur

In separate letters to UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and J&K, POSOCO has warned that in case a power station trips amid their overdrawal, the grid could collapse since “adequate spinning reserves”, or spare generation capacity, was not always available in the region. Noting that states also didn’t have any spare generation capacity, the operator advised them to buy additional power from the exchanges or tie up generation capacity available elsewhere to meet peak demand. Punjab is the biggest violator of grid discipline, overdrawing or load-shedding — resorting to blackout — between 150 and 800 MW (megawatt). Haryana’s violations range between 475-675 MW, Rajasthan between 300 and 500 MW and U MW. J&K is lowest at 150-200 MW. It was overdrawal by UP and Punjab that had sparked off the world’s largest power outage in history in July 2012. It affected over 620 million people ( 9% of world population).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/overdrawing-by-5-states-raises-grid-outage-fears/articleshow/87992650.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The Centre filed its affidavit in the apex court responding to a PIL filed by former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation Jacob Puliyel seeking direction for making public segregated data from the clinical trials of the vaccines. He also pleaded that the governments should be restrained from making vaccination mandatory for people. The government said the vaccination continues to be voluntary. It, however, said that the governemnt was encouraging people to get vaccinated as it was the only way to protect them from the pandemic. “Any misgivings and misconceived doubts and motivated propaganda against vaccination can only result in a potential threat of setting vaccine hesitancy again, which will not be in public interest. Once it is placed before this that there is a statutory regime in place and the regime is followed then this court may not undertake the exercise any further as it would enable the petitioner and handful of others like him to create serious misgivings and misconceived doubts against the vaccination in the process of this petition itself,” the affidavit. The Centre said the vaccines, which have undergone the statutory regime, are safe . “At this juncture, the entire concentration of the Central government and the state governments should be and is on vaccination drive and encouraging people to get them vaccinated. It is, therefore, not desirable at this juncture to invest time finding out motives behind few elements attempting to act against the interest of the nation at the cost of violating the right of crores of citizens to be protected from pandemic,” the affidavit said. “The percentage of such effects having serious/severe (including deaths) in case of both Covaxin and Covishield is less than 0.01%,” it said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dont-let-doubts-be-created-about-vaccine-efficacy-govt-to-supreme-court/articleshow/87992678.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Majority of Punjab groups in favour, larger meet on December 1||BATHINDA: A majority of the 32 farmer groups of Punjab are in favour of ending the agitation at the Delhi border sites after the bill to cancel the three farm laws was passed in both Houses of Parliament on Monday. A meeting of the 32 farm groups was held at the Singhu border on Monday. After the meeting, BKU Ekta Dakaunda president Buta Singh Burjgill and BKU Kadian president Harmeet Singh Kadian said an emergency meeting of 42 representatives from Punjab and other states — who used to participate in talks with the Centre — will be held on December 1 to formally discuss the issue of protests at Delhi borders. They refused to comment on the longevity of their struggle but hinted at lifting it after December 1. According to reliable sources in the Punjab farm groups, most of them want to change the form of protest by lifting it from Delhi borders while continuing to protest for an assured minimum support price (MSP) on all crops. However, there is no unanimity among the groups as a few of them want to continue the sit-in at the borders till the Centre gives a legal guarantee for MSP. Sources said those who want to lift the protests are trying to prevail on the smaller section of farm groups to ensure a collective decision on the issue. At the Singhu border meeting, the 32 farm groups decided to ask the Centre to make announcements about the pending demands in Parliament on Tuesday. They want the central government to clarify about the MSP committee, its constitution, terms of reference and the time frame. They also want the Union home ministry to issue letters to the states asking them to quash cases registered against farmers during the ongoing struggle and want the Centre to clarify its position about compensation to the families of the farmers who died during the protests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/farm-stir-at-delhi-borders-to-end/articleshow/87992704.cms||Neel Kamal

The bereaved relatives who have observed their first death anniversaries are aghast that the bodies had not been disposed of with dignity. The bodies have been identified as those of Durga Sumithra, a homemaker and resident of Chamarajpet, and Muniraju, a labourer and resident of KP Agrahara in Magadi Road. ESIC Hospital staff said that after the construction of a new mortuary in the hospital, the two bodies were not shifted to the new facility and the civic agency did not follow up. GB Sujatha, Durga's sister, said her widowed sibling had been admitted to ESIC Hospital after testing positive for Covid-19 in June 29, 2020, and died on July 2. "The BBMP told us they had cremated my sister and gave us a death certificate. We performed her last rites. This is shocking," Sujatha said, adding she is having a tough time consoling Durga's two daughters, who now live with her. Muniraju succumbed to Covid-19 on July 2, 2020 at ESIC Hospital three days after he was admitted. All his three daughters are married and they had rushed to the hospital on hearing of their father's death. "We were informed that the BBMP would cremate the body as per Covid-19 protocol. This is disgusting," his youngest daughter Rajeshwari said. Sujatha and Rajeshwari said BBMP should be penalized for negligence. The bodies were found in the old mortuary of ESIC hospital on Friday when a worker went to clean it. Concerned over the foul smell in the place, the worker began opening all mortuary boxes and was shocked to find two bodies. Immediately, he informed the hospital authorities. The hospital checked its records and identified the bodies as those of Durga and Muniraju. "When the two patients died, we informed their families. Since the bodies could not be handed over to the families, they were kept in cold storage and were to be cremated by BBMP," an ESIC hospital official said. "The number of deaths was high. We opened a new mortuary in mid-2020 and all bodies, barring these two, were shifted there," the officer said, adding: "Looks like the staff forgot to shift these two bodies." A senior health officer from BBMP west zone blamed the hospital, saying they were supposed to hand over the body "to us for cremation and they failed to do their most important duty". Sources said power supply to the old mortuary's cold storage appears to have been discontinued recently, leading to the decomposing of the bodies. The bodies were shifted to Victoria Hospital for postmortem. Dr Venkat Raghava, head of forensic department, said the bodies were partially decomposed, skeletonization had begun and maggots were feeding on them. After the postmortem, the bodies were cremated by BBMP officials at Guddadahalli crematorium.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/16-months-on-covid-bodies-cremated-by-civic-body-found-at-bengaluru-hospital-morgue/articleshow/87992701.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Gaganyaan: Gujarat may get control centre, astronauts’ rehab||BENGALURU: Isro has been actively considering creation of new infrastructure for India's human spaceflight programme including its first mission — Gaganyaan — in Gujarat. However, there was no formal decision as of Monday. Over five months ago, a sudden meeting to analyse creation of new infrastructure in Gujarat came as a surprise to many as the discussion was about creating a control centre. While a feasibility study took off for what scientists term a "mirror" control/mission centre, many remain apprehensive about the need for it, given that Isro's control nerve centre, ISTRAC in Bengaluru, has already begun renovation specifically for Gaganyaan project. Weeks later, there was another discussion about a possible astronauts' rehabilitation centre in Gujarat. Multiple Isro scientists, engineers and staffers TOI has spoken with in past several weeks have consistently said there's no formal order for creation of anything, but that "there are ad hoc instructions about checking feasibility". Isro chairman K Sivan explained: "Gaganyaan, unlike any other mission, is much bigger involving many national agencies and labs. For optimal utilisation of resources and considering various technical aspects and human safety, it's necessary to spread facilities across many places. One shouldn't look at this as shifting something from one place to another; it's in fact, creation of new infrastructure." Control/Mission CentreScientists explained that Gujarat, if Isro decides to create it there — will get a "mirror control centre" on the lines of what ISTRAC will have but maybe slightly smaller. "We'll have 100-150 consoles, AV facilities, space for VIPs etc," one of them said. At ISTRAC, work for a dedicated Gaganyaan control centre is ongoing. "Unlike other missions which require only two halls — for space systems and ground systems — Gaganyaan will need a third for environment control and life support, crew and other aspects," a senior scientist explained. "Given this will be ready and supplemented by a network of ground stations across the globe, what's the technical justification for a mirror facility? There appears to be other, including political considerations, for such thinking," another scientist said. However, a senior official from Isro HQ clarified that a project as critical as Gaganyaan requires redundancies. "That's why we are thinking of this," he said. Landing Will Decide RehabAs for the astronauts' rehabilitation centre, another scientist explained, "A new facility needs to come up close to the landing site. It could come up in Gujarat if we decide to land in the Arabian Sea and not Bay of Bengal." TOI had reported earlier that Isro was weighing both options with initial assessment showing Bay of Bengal more rough than the Arabian Sea. Now, a scientist from the headquarters said: "Crew landing could mostly happen off the Gujarat coast because the Indian Navy said the Bay of Bengal is a rough sea with high waves, which may cause the module go under water. After landing, rescue will take about two hours, and given the height of the waves in the Bay, there's apprehension it could go above the crew module hatch making it difficult to rescue astronauts. This makes the Arabian Sea more feasible. However, no final decision has been made yet." After landing, the crew will need rehabilitation and such a centre, another official reiterated, needs to be close to the sea. This centre will have medical and other facilities.

US firm Novavax and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute said on Monday that they had initiated work on developing new versions of their respective vaccines adapted to the mutant strain. Pfizer and Moderna too said they were racing to tweak their vaccines. Other companies that are expected to modify their vaccines include the Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals and the Hyderabad-based Bio E. Both were expected to launch their shots over the next few months. Novavax said on Monday it had already initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B.1.1.529, and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks. “We will continue to work with urgency to address this latest strain and the continued evolution of Covid-19,’’ a company official told TOI. Experts believe there is a “high probability’’ that companies may need to go back to the drawing board, but will take a “final view'” based on the data on transmissibility, and efficacy of existing vaccines on the new variant. “Today we do not know the effectiveness of existing vaccines against this virus. Companies must develop strategies to fight this virus by reinventing the vaccine against this novel sequence,” a domestic vaccine player said on condition of anonymity. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is backi-ng Sputnik V, said, “The Gamaleya Institute believes Sputnik V and Sputnik Light will neutralise Omicron as they have the highest effica-cy against other mutatio-ns. In case a modification is needed, we will provide several hundred million of Sputnik Omicron boosters by February 20.” Companies attributed the confidence to adapt quickly to emerging strains on the technology platforms in use. “Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology allows us to adapt quickly to strain changes and lends itself to inducing broadly cross-neutralising antibodies based on the use of a full-length spike protein,” the company said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-variant-may-force-drug-companies-to-tweak-covid-vaccination-plans/articleshow/87992742.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

A division bench comprising Justices Sunil Dutt Yadav and Siddaiah Rachaiah has said the Balakiyara Bala Mandir should keep the girl till she attains the age of majority or changes her mind to accompany her parents/natural guardian, whichever is earlier. Further, the Mandir has been directed to ensure she continues studies. The court passed an order in this regard on Thursday. The girl was produced before the court in response to a habeas corpus petition filed by her mother . Upon enquiry by the bench, the girl informed the court that she wanted to pursue studies but her parents were forcing her to get married at the cost of her education. To avoid parental pressure, she had gone to Goa and was residing with her brother there . The girl further told the court she is not willing to accompany her parents and she is ready to go to any Juvenile Centre/Remand Home. The girl's parents claimed that somebody had kidnapped their daughter and police suppressed the same by not registering a case, even though the mother had lodged a complaint. The parents assured the court that that they will not pressure the girl for her marriage or discontinue her further studies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-saves-girl-from-marriage-sends-her-to-govt-home/articleshow/87992743.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Counting of votes will be taken up on December 30. These urban local bodies have remained without elected representatives since 2018. The election dates were announced after the Karnataka high court, which was hearing a series of petitions over delay in conducting elections to 51 ULBs, asked the State Election Commission (SEC) to complete the poll process by December 30. "When the high court asked us, we informed the court that the SEC was ready to hold the polls as early as December if the state government issued reservation of wards in these 51 ULBs. Accordingly, the government issued the list on November 27 and we issued the poll calendar today," said SEC commissioner B Basavaraju. He said the SEC was confident of holding glitch-free polls as it had successfully conducted gram panchayat polls between the first and second Covid waves in December 2020. "The experience has prepared us for any eventuality," he added. Elections to several ULBs were pending since 2017-18 due to litigation or reservation issues. Apart from the fresh polls to 51 ULBs, the SEC has announced dates for bypolls to be held in 109 wards of nine ULBs. Most ULBs are town municipal corporations and a few are city municipal corporations.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/3-yr-wait-over-state-ulb-polls-on-dec-27/articleshow/87992804.cms||---

Doddabelavangala police registered a case on November 26, based on a complaint filed by Basavaraja R Kadabe, superintendent engineer, BBMP, central office. Kadabe alleged civic officials came to know that on November 24, locals intercepted BBMP compactors on the road and demanded that the waste processing plant at Chiguranahalli be closed. On November 26, senior BBMP solid waste management officials visited the spot along with the DC and SP, Bengaluru Rural. “We found leachate overflowing from the plant, entering small ponds and getting mixed with water. It caused bad smell and water in the nearby check dam too got polluted. The problem is being caused due to heavy rain and poor maintenance at the unit. This is having a bad impact on public health,” Kadabe alleged.. Police registered a case under IPC sections 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 336 (whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or personal safety of others).

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Hearing on Krishna water dispute posted to December 13||BENGALURU: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine appeals by Karnataka and Maharashtra to publish the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal awards, delivered about 10 years ago, in the official gazette and listed the case for a detailed hearing on December 13. When the case came up for hearing before a bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud, Karnataka sought the vacation of a November 16, 2011 Supreme Court order which stopped the Centre from publishing in the official gazette the final order of the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal II (KWDT). The first order was pronounced in December 2010, allocating the river water to Karnataka, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The publication of the tribunal order is obligatory for its implementation. The KWDT had further modified its final order and report on November 29, 2013 to allot surplus water to Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.However, following the bifurcation of AP, Telangana and AP moved the Supreme Court challenging the KWDT’s allocation of shares. ‘Irrigation projects stalled’Senior advocates Shyam Divan and Mohan Katarki, for Karnataka, argued that its dam and irrigation projects worth crores of rupees in Krishna basin across north Karnataka have been stalled since 2011 as the Centre hasn’t published the KWDT orders though the dispute was between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. “Karnataka had mooted irrigation projects across Krishna basin worth Rs 60,000 crore since 2014-15 but failed to implement them due to non-publication of the order. The costs of these projects have escalated annually by 10% to 15%. The life of the award is 40 years, out of which 10 years have already lapsed and, therefore, the state may lose about 20 years,” the advocates argued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hearing-on-krishna-water-dispute-posted-to-dec-13/articleshow/87992809.cms||---

Justice HP Sandesh made this observation while quashing proceedings against three Congress workers of Mudddbihal town in Vijayapura district, holding that there is no notification bringing the town area within KOPD Act. The judge noted that a reading of section 1(2)(i) of the Act says it is applicable to cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi-Dharwad, Mangaluru and Belagavi that come under KMC Act, 1976 and section (1)(2)(ii) says the Act will be applicable to areas notified by the government under Karnataka Municipalities Act or any other law. On April 20, 2018, an official in charge of the assembly elections had registered a case against Hanmagouda, Hamjisab and Gangadhar for offences under section 3 of KOPD Act and section 171 H of IPC. It was alleged that when the Congress candidate came to the tahsildar’s office at Muddebihal for filing nomination papers, some vehicles accompanying him were displaying stickers that had the party’s symbol and flag.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/public-places-act-applicable-only-in-notified-areas-hc/articleshow/87992810.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Thefts up post lockdown, financial woes to blame||7.4k two-wheelers stolen till October: Police dataBENGALURU: A 38-year-old suspect arrested recently for theft was found to have been released on bail twice this year. A 32-year-old mechanic nabbed for stealing cars after taking them for test drives had been arrested in February this year for car lifting. Police say repeat offenders of this kind and first-timers are contributing to a spike in theft cases post the Covid lockdown in May. While habitual offenders claimed before police that they needed money for legal expenses, first-timers said they were pushed into committing crime due to financial distress caused by job loss or inadequate wages. Vehicle theft, house theft (stealing without breaking any lock, door or window) and thefts by domestic helps are the major types. House break-ins, known as house break thefts or HBTs in police parlance, are categorised separately. In May when the lockdown was in force, 807 cases of theft were reported from across the state, says police data. The number, however, began rising. There were 1,250 theft cases in June, 1,627 in July, 1,672 in August, 1,580 in September and 1,546 in October. January 2021 saw 1,366 theft cases, February 1,337, March 1,573 and April 1,177. A senior IPS officer pointed out the reasons behind the increase, especially after the lockdown. “Financial crisis, scarcity of jobs or those with less remuneration and old-timers returning to their illegal activities are the three prime reasons behind the spike. In ordinary cases of theft of valuables, we have come across many youngsters who took to stealing because of their poor income. The same is the case with household employees committing thefts. Some suspects even claimed that they stole to adjust the school fee of their wards,” he said. The officer, however, said the trend of habitual offenders returning to crime is what’s worrisome. “A chain-snatcher first steals a bike so that he can use the vehicle while committing the offence and later abandons it. Many old-time offenders claim they have no other alternative to meet expenses like advocate fees and others,” he said. 7.4k two-wheelers stolen till October: Police dataIn the first 10 months of 2021, 7,402 two-wheelers and 250 cars were stolen, says state police data. The least number of vehicles were lifted in May: 425 two-wheelers and five cars. Also, May registered the least cases of house theft (37) and domestic help theft (13). With 94, January witnessed most house theft cases, while August saw most domestic help theft cases till now (36). In July, the highest number of two-wheelers were stolen (977), while 35 cars were lifted in January, the highest in a month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/thefts-up-post-lockdown-financial-woes-to-blame/articleshow/87992811.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||World||Pentagon: Few changes to US overseas military 'footprint'||WASHINGTON: After months of study, the Pentagon has decided no immediate major changes are needed in the global positioning of the United States forces, although it will further analyse force needs in the Middle East and make refinements in Asia and the Pacific, officials said Monday. The outcome of the study, which began in March at Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's direction, reflects a complex security picture facing the Biden administration, which fully withdrew from Afghanistan in August but is increasingly concerned about countering China in the Asia-Pacific region and Russia in Europe. Iran presents a further challenge, including in Iraq and Syria, which makes it difficult to allocate more US forces to other parts of the world. With China in mind, the Pentagon plans to make infrastructure improvements in some parts of the Pacific, including in Guam. In September the US announced a new partnership with Australia and Britain to deepen security, diplomatic and defence cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. As part of that AUKUS partnership, Australia is to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, and the US is to increase rotational force deployments to Australia. The Austin review is the first of several broad assessments by the administration of its defence priorities and policies. They include a reassessment of nuclear forces - their size and makeup, as well as the policies associated with their potential use - that is due to be finished early next year. The Pentagon also is working on a revised National Defense Strategy that would frame the full scope of defense policies, including the role of nuclear deterrence, cyberthreats, international alliances, and force modernization. The Austin study, known as the Global Posture Review, has set the stage for adjustments to U.S. force positioning in the coming two to three years, according to a senior defense official who briefed reporters on the outcome. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the Pentagon's public announcement, said a number of force adjustments in the Asia-Pacific are in the works but require further consultation with foreign governments. In April, Austin announced plans to expand the US military presence in Germany by 500 troops and a halt to planning for large-scale troops cuts that had been ordered by the Trump administration. At the time of Austin's announcement, the US and European officials were expressing concern about a build-up of Russian forces near Ukraine's border. That crisis abated, but in recent weeks it has returned amid worry that Moscow might be planning a military incursion into Ukraine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-few-changes-to-us-overseas-military-footprint/articleshow/87992812.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Schools can be named after donors, says govt||BENGALURU: The education department has reiterated that schools or their facilities can be named after donors. Its 2011 circular was reposted on the website of department of public instruction on Monday. According to it, donors who contribute one-third of the total cost will get an opportunity to name the facility after them. In case it is not the entire school, but a room or any other facility, it will be named after the sponsor. The department had started an app called ‘Namma Shaale Namma Koduge’ to streamline donations to schools. The app provides donors a list of schools and their needs. It also gives updates to donors on how much work is completed using their money. However, the app has not been rolled out fully. “It is difficult to have 48,000 accounts for each school. So I have proposed that the money be transferred to the existing accounts of school development monitoring committees,” said Vishal R, commissioner of public instruction. More recently, the government has invited corporates, NGOs and philanthropists to upgrade schools into the successful Karnataka Public School model. However, Niranjanaradhya VP, educationist, said the government cannot pass on its obligation to private players. “Providing education is the state’s obligation. They cannot substitute it using donation or philanthropic activity. Donations can be considered only as a supplementary source. Earlier, it was agreed that these schools should be called Nammooru Shale. They are community schools and should not be renamed after individuals,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/govt-schools-can-be-named-after-donors/articleshow/87992813.cms||---

Public prosecutor GV Gayatri Raju told TOI L Hanumantaraya, a resident of Kallambella in Tumakuru district, was convicted by judge N Krishnaiah of the special fast-track court. “In all, 15 eyewitnesses, including the girl’s grandmother who first noticed the offence, deposed before the court. No witness turned hostile. The girl’s neighbours, who had witnessed the post-offence events, also gave vital statements. All their statements and medical reports proving the offence helped in securing the conviction,” she said. According to the chargesheet, on April 16, 2018, Hanumantaraya took the girl to his house on the pretext of giving her chocolates. The girl’s parents had gone out for work and her grandmother was inside the house. The girl was playing with other children when Hanumantaraya took her. On being sexually assaulted, the girl started screaming. “Hearing her cries, the grandmother rushed to Hanumantaraya’s house. On seeing the grandmother when he peeped out of a window, he locked the child inside the bathroom and escaped through the backdoor. By then, neighbours entered the house and found the girl,” the chargesheet stated. The girl’s grandmother filed a police complaint on the same day, and on the next day, Hanumantaraya was arrested from a relative’s house where he was hiding.

Yadlapalli will play Bengaluru’s Sharmada Balu, a wildcard entrant, in what should be a tight clash.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/rutuja-faces-shreya-first-in-itf-event/articleshow/87992823.cms||---

Responding to a question on whether the government has any proposal to recognise bitcoin as a currency, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman replied in the negative in Lok Sabha. The statement came ahead of the introduction of a bill to “prohibit” all private cryptocurrencies, while providing certain exceptions to “promote the underlying technology” and its uses. The proposed legislation, planned for the current session of Parliament, will also create a “facilitative framework for the creation of official digital currency to be issued by the RBI”, the government had said last week, amid intense lobbying to “regulate” cryptocurrency, instead of banning them in India. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency globally. Those supporting the demand for regulation have argued that it is tough to ban cryptocurrency, and the entire market will move to the Dark Net if the government moves ahead with the ban. The RBI has been leading the demand for a ban. While replying to another question, junior minister for finance Pankaj Chaudhary told the lower house that in October, the RBI sent a proposal to the government to amend the law to widen the scope and definition of “bank note” to include currency in digital form. “The RBI has been examining use of cases and working out a phased implementation strategy for introduction of CBDC with little or no disruption,” Chaudhary said. The RBI has opposed the introduction of private cryptocurrency, arguing that it is prone to misuse and has no underlying asset from which it derives its value. Besides, it fears that private digital currency will result in dollarisation of the economy and significantly impact its ability to manage money supply, inflation, exchange rate. In contrast, it is looking to start work on CBDC over the next few months. “Introduction of CBDC has the potential to provide significant benefits, such as reduced dependency on cash, higher seigniorage due to lower transaction costs, reduced settlement risk. Introduction of CBDC would also possibly lead to a more robust, efficient, trusted, regulated and legal tender-based payments option. There are also associated risks which need to be carefully evaluated against the potential benefits,” Chaudhary said in Parliament.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/theres-no-plan-to-recognise-bitcoin-as-currency-govt/articleshow/87992805.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Server glitch halts ICSE marks upload, process to resume today||KOLKATA: The marks after evaluation of ICSE semester-I papers could not be uploaded on Monday because of a server glitch. Around 7.30pm, the CISCE sent a circular to school principals and asked them to close the evaluation centres for the day and restart at 8am on Tuesday as the Online Marks Capture System was not functioning. The ICSE exams started on Monday for more than 30,000 examinees across the state. Of them, about 7,000-odd students are in Kolkata. A similar situation arose on November 22 when ISC exams started. The exam started at 10.50am when the questions were given out to candidates. They started writing from 11am and finished at noon. The answer keys were sent at 1.30pm and examiners started their evaluation. Most had completed their evaluation by 6.30pm and had started to upload when they found they could not log in. Finally, the convenors took a joint decision and wrote to the Council seeking help. The Council decided to close the centres for the day. “It is likely that the Council will bring in a new system of evaluation. The circular indicated that and we hope this problem gets solved once and for all. Several examiners and supervisors have fallen sick,” said a convenor who also wrote to the Council seeking intervention. Another convenor suggested the CISCE should shift to OMR sheets since this will automatically solve the problem. At present, students are writing in answer booklets. ICSE started with English 1 paper on Monday. The ISC mathematics exam for the day has been pushed back to December 12. From Tuesday, ICSE and ISC exams will be held simultaneously. Students were happy with Monday’s paper. For many, it was their first day in school after 20 months. Rishon Sarkar of La Martiniere for Boys had been anxious before reaching school. But when he met his classmates there, he became free of tension. Nileeni Mondal was stuck in Mombasa because of Covid but flew down last week to be able to write the exam from school. “I am so happy to be back in school where I belong. Writing the exam from Kenya would not have been the same,” she said. The CBSE Class X term-I major papers are starting from Tuesday. The exams for minor papers have been going on.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/server-glitch-halts-icse-marks-upload-process-to-resume-today/articleshow/87990972.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Patna||Winter session of Bihar legislative assembly begins with national anthem||PATNA: In an unprecedented departure from the parliamentary convention, the winter session of the state legislative assembly began on Monday with the play of the national anthem, ‘jana gana mana...’ Assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha said it has been done with the permission of the House (sadan ki anumati se)” after which he, along with the MLAs stood in deference to it. Curiously, after the national anthem, someone from the treasury benches shouted ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’, which was countered by an equally loud voice from the opposition side invoking the national infamy of the last fortnight or so thrown up by the award-winning cine-actor Kangana Ranaut, who has gone on record saying that the country got Independence in 2014. Incidentally, the play of the national anthem on the floor of the House is otherwise reserved for the special occasions when either the President or the governor addresses the joint session of the state legislature. Also, in the state, the national anthem is played when the governor addresses the joint session of the state legislature marking the start of the budget session. All that notwithstanding, finance minister Tarkishore Prasad tabled the second supplementary budget worth Rs20,531.82 crore to be taken up by the House for its passage. As for the legislative business, three Bills – Bihar Technical Services Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Bihar Private Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and Bihar Land Mutation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 – were also tabled, which would be deliberated upon and passed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Earlier, the MLAs of RJD, Congress and Left parties expressed their concerns separately about various issues and told the media that they would seek the government’s replies to them. Later, Tejashwi had an informal sitting with the Left MLAs in his chamber, indicating that the floor coordination between the RJD and the Left parties was real, while the Congress has already announced to follow its own line. How all this pan out in the House will be keenly watched, observers feel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/winter-session-of-bihar-legislative-assembly-begins-with-national-anthem/articleshow/87989611.cms||Abhay Singh

While interacting with the media outside the assembly after the opening day of the winter session, Tejashwi said he will send a copy of NITI Aayog’s report to the CM to read and reply in the House. He even raised questions on prohibition and the way police were searching the wedding venues. “If liquor is being recovered in Bihar, who is responsible? If Bihar is at the bottom on all the parameters of NITI Aayog, who will answer?” Tejashwi asked. Later, he also attacked former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and retweeted the latter’s tweet in which Modi had stated that if NITI Aayog changes the way of its rankings then Bihar will be at the top. “Just by putting a mask, a wolf will not be a lion,” tweeted Tejashwi. Hitting back at Tejashwi, JD(U) MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said the former should first bring the reports of the then Planning Commission and CAG of his parents’ tenure and then JD(U) will debate on the NITI Aayog’s report. “Let me remind Tejashwi that Nitish Ji has been accorded with 22 awards nationally and internationally for good governance. As far as a debate is concerned, we are sufficient for people like Tejashwi,” Neeraj said while hitting out at the opposition leader for the cases against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tejashwi-seeks-nitishs-reply-on-niti-cag-reports/articleshow/87989642.cms||Sheezan Nezami

After holding a meeting with his party legislators, Sharma said Congress had always worked for the development of the country. “Alliance is formed during elections and at present we have to become the voice of people,” Sharma told TOI, repeating the incidents of the recently concluded bypolls in which RJD ignored the claim of Congress over Kusheshwar Asthan assembly seats and contested both the seats. When asked whether the Congress will participate in the all-party opposition meeting, if called by leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, he replied, “We will follow the instructions of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul ji. At present we are focussing on making Congress strong and working for people. There is no need of alliance in the House.” RJD also called a meeting of all its legislators on Monday to discuss the strategies to be followed during the ongoing session. Chairing the meeting at 9M Strand Road bungalow of Bodh Gaya MLA Kumar Sarvjeet, Tejashwi discussed various issues, including NITI Aayog and CAG reports, unemployment, corruption and health sectors. He advised his legislators to actively raise the issues of public interest and participate in the debate. When asked whether a meeting of all the Mahagathbandhan legislators was planned, RJD’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said, “If need be, it will be called.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/no-need-of-alliance-in-winter-session-congress/articleshow/87989693.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||NDA lawmakers reiterate support to liquor ban law||PATNA: The NDA legislators in Bihar on Monday reiterated their support to the liquor ban law enforced by the state government led by Nitish Kumar and raised their hands as a mark of solidarity on the issue. The BJP, JD(U), HAM (S) and VIP legislators attended a meeting of the NDA legislators at the assembly’s central hall to decide strategies for floor management in both the Houses of the state legislature during the winter session, which began on Monday. Nitish addressed the NDA legislators and explained why the liquor ban was necessary for social development of people. While the CM was recounting the benefits of total prohibition, the legislators raised their hands in support of the liquor ban and the state government’s decision to strictly enforce it. Nitish attacked some of the opposition leaders who were trying to make the prohibition law a political agenda in the garb of recent hooch deaths, which mainly occurred due to consumption of poisonous liquor. Though the meeting was called mainly to decide floor management strategies for the winter session, but the CM mainly spoke on the issues related to total prohibition, sources said. The ruling NDA has 126 MLAs in the 242-member assembly, including 74 of BJP, 45 of JD(U), 4 of HAM(S), 3 from VIP and independent Sumit Kumar Singh. One seat in the 243-member assembly is currently vacant following the death of Bochahan MLA Musafir Paswan. Sources said some of the legislators raised issues of their respective constituencies and urged the CM to take necessary steps to resolve them. The CM reportedly told them to him with over issues related to their constituencies. The NDA legislators’ party meeting was also addressed by deputy CMs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi (BJP), parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP president Mukesh Sahani.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/nda-lawmakers-reiterate-support-to-liquor-ban-law/articleshow/87989748.cms||Madan Kumar

All the key government hospitals in the city have been witnessing a rise in number of patients with winter ailments in their OPDs. Severe patients, on the other hand, are being admitted to these hospitals. “Heart attack and high blood pressure cases have increased by 20% in the cardiology department of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in the last couple of days due to drop in temperature,” said Dr B P Singh, head of cardiology department of the hospital. He added the viscosity of blood rises due to cold and such conditions aggravate chances of clotting in arteries leading to heart attack. “Since people with high blood pressure and blood sugar are more prone to getting affected by cold weather, they should regularly get their blood pressure and sugar levels checked by medical experts,” he added. There has been about 80% rise in brain stroke cases at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P). Dr Devendu Bhushan of AIIMS-P’s medicine department said while one to two patients of brain stroke used to visit the hospital in a day earlier, the number has gone up to 9 or 10 now. Patna Medical College and Hospital superintendent Dr I S Thakur too said cases of cold, cough and respiratory problems have risen due to change in weather. “Sporadic cases of dengue and pneumonia are also registered in the OPDs of PMCH,” he added. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said pneumonia, cold and fever among children showed about 20% increase this week. “Patients with skin ailments like itching and eczema are also reaching the hospital,” he added. Dr Pankaj Tiwary of skin department of PMCH said cold weather aggravates skin ailments. “Elderly people and those with high blood pressure and blood sugar are more prone to develop nagging skin diseases in winters,” he added. “Most patients are complaining of severe bullous disorder, bacterial and fungal infection due to prolonged itching on body parts, dandruff on the scalp and chopping of lips,” Dr Pankaj added. He advised people, especially children and elderly ones, to regularly use moisturisers on whole body after bath to keep the skin moist. “Unscientific home remedies, unhygienic living and neglect of problems could worsen the problem,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/drop-in-mercury-level-gives-rise-to-winter-ailments/articleshow/87989757.cms||VK Tripathi

He lauded the implementation of National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA) and said the use of tablets would ease the functioning of the House. “On behalf of the House, I am thankful to CM Nitish Kumar and Union parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Venkatesh Joshi for their guidance in implementation of NeVA,” Singh added. He appreciated the anti-liquor pledge taken by the officers and staff of the legislative council on November 26 and said the Upper House would provide all support to the officers involved in implementation of prohibition. Singh extended his gratitude to President Ram Nath Kovind for gracing the centenary celebrations of state legislature. State building construction minister Ashok Choudhary tabled the Bihar Technical Service Commission Amendment Bill and health minister Mangal Pandey tabled the second supplementary budget of 2021-22 in the House on Monday.

---||Patna||Patna’s air quality remains ‘very poor’ for 5th day||PATNA: The air quality in Patna remained ‘very poor’ for the fifth consecutive day with further deterioration from 342 to 353 in the past 24 hours on Monday. As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report, Patna was among the top 12 most polluted cities in the country. Most of these polluted cities were from Bihar, including Motihari with air quality index (AQI) of 398, Sasaram (390), Siwan (385), Rajgir (360) and Darbhanga (356). The average concentrations of PM (particulate matters) 2.5 and PM 10 stood at 411 in the ‘severe’ and 385 in the 'very poor' category, respectively. The overall AQI of Patna was based on the readings of six air monitoring stations at Planetarium (411), BIT-Mesra, Patna (390), Eco Park (380), SK Memorial Hall (359), DRM office-Khagaul (344) and Patna City (233). A ‘very poor’ AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illness on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect on people with lung and heart diseases. Naveen Kumar, environment scientist and councillor analyst at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), told this newspaper on Monday that several contributory factors are behind the air pollution rise in the region. “During winter season, the AQI level in Patna and neighbouring areas remain high because of low wind speed due to which the pollutant level is trapped in the earth surface. Pollution are more likely to occur under temperature inversion conditions in winter time,” he said. Senior programme officer of Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), Ankita Jyoti, said it is high time the state government should implement the climate action plan, which was formulated under the National Clear Air Plan. “Under this plan for Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur, they have already talked about the emergency response action, which we call a graded response action plan,” she said. “The whole climate action plan has mentioned a set of measures that should be taken if the AQI level reaches a certain level like banning the entry of trucks in the city, stopping the use of diesel sets in commercial establishments and making proper traffic management. The government needs to enforce it strictly as soon as possible,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/patnas-air-quality-remains-very-poor-for-5th-day/articleshow/87989873.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Now, relish Gaya’s ‘mahua tilkut’||GAYA: ‘Tilkut’, the famous sweet product of Gaya, has now got a new variant – ‘mahua tilkut’. The new variant is made of ‘gur’, ‘til’ and other ingredients. It will be a mix of dried ‘mahua’ and ‘til’. A plant will soon be established in Gaya under the special central assistance (SCA) scheme for Maoist-hit districts to produce the new variant of ‘tilkut’. The SCA scheme is monitored at district level by district magistrate, senior superintendent of police and the divisional forest officer. DFO Abhishek Kumar said a pilot project was launched last year to buy ‘mahua’ flowers from forest villagers. “Green shade nets were distributed among 100 households for hygienic collection of mahua flowers. This helped the forest department control forest fires as most forest fires in Gaya are caused due to lighting of fire below the canopy of mahua tree for easy collection and most of the time, it spreads to the forests causing irreparable losses to the wildlife as well,” he said. The DFO added the pilot project had started from Masaundha village under Barachatti block in Gaya and it would now be extended to other forest villages. Under the project, local villagers will be trained to collect, process and market mahua flowers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/now-relish-gayas-mahua-tilkut/articleshow/87989858.cms||---

Munger sadar sub-divisional officer (SDO) Khushboo Gupta said she received complaints from at least seven voters about withdrawal of money from their bank accounts. “These people were in for a shock after receiving messages on their cellphones about withdrawal of money from their bank accounts,” she added. Police officers present at the booth swung into action and arrested a polling staff, Ravi Kumar Singh. During interrogation, he confessed to his involvement in the crime and said he had withdrawn the money from the voters’ bank accounts with the help of a mobile application. Ravi, incharge of a customer service point (CSP) of a bank, said he used to collect thumb impressions of the voters twice – one for casting their votes and another for withdrawal of money. Ravi is a resident of Tilbaria police station under Haveli Kharagpur sub-division in the district. Ravi was deployed at the polling booth to handle biometric system being used at polling booths to avoid rigging. Initial investigations revealed that Rs 36,000 was withdrawn from the bank accounts of different voters. Panchayat election was held in 53 blocks spread over 35 districts in the state on Monday in the ninth phase.

For the convenience of commuters, a lane has been opened on the road for light passenger vehicles while heavy vehicles have been prohibited. A PWD official said that a Delhi Jal Board pipeline had leaked at six locations and hence, the repair work for the pipeline would be completed first, following which PWD would start fixing the road. On Monday too, commuters had to face snarls on the nearby Barapullah, Ashram and Lodhi roads. Commuters travelling to south Delhi or heading towards central Delhi via Ashram were stuck in traffic jams not just during rush hours but also during daytime. During the morning and evening hours, traffic moved at a snail’s pace from Barapullah towards Lodhi Road and even at Ashram since the construction of the underpass was already underway. Delhi Traffic Police opened one lane on the affected road for ease of movement to commuters and allowed cars to pass through. However, heavy vehicles and buses have been prohibited and they will continue to take an alternate route. A PWD engineer, who visited the site on Monday, said: “The DJB pipeline was leaking from six places and will take 24 hours to be fixed, following which we will start the road repair.

The teenager claimed that he wanted to join the defence forces and while his parents did not tell the age of the bride to be, the boy claimed that she was same age as him. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “We have taken all the measures to ensure that the boy’s wedding is stopped and he also appeared before the district magistrate. We have spoken to his parents as well and the boy is keen to join the armed forces. He told us that he was not ready to get married till he was settled professionally.” He had sent the photo of the wedding card and his Class 10 mark sheet as proof of age. In less than two weeks, this is the fourth child marriage stopped by the child commission. In all the cases, the children themselves got in touch with RSCPCR to ask for help. Two girls from Udaipur had asked for help to stop their weddings while one girl from Jodhpur also sought intervention from the child panel for the same. The National Family Health Survey 2020-21 (NFHS-5) revealed that in Rajasthan the percentage of women between 20 and 24 years, who were married off before turning 18, came down to 25.4%, a decrease of 10% from NFHS-4 conducted in 2015-16 . This decrease was also visible in men between 25 and 29 years who were married before turning 21. In 2020-21, 28.2% of men fell in this category as compared to 35.7% in 2015-16. Child marriage continues to be higher in rural areas with 28.3% of girls married off before the age of 18 years as compared with 15.1% in the case of their urban counterparts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/teen-who-stopped-his-wedding-wants-to-join-def-services/articleshow/87991461.cms||---

The driver managed to escape taking advantage of the darkness. Gogunda SHO Kamlender Singh Solanki said during a routine checking of vehicles, a car was asked to stop, but it fled knocking down a barricade that cops had put up near Jhadoli-Jaswantgarh cut on NH-27. He said the car was chased for a few kilometres but when it did not stop, police deflated the front tyre by firing a shot. But even after that, the smuggler kept driving. Later, he stopped the car and fled taking advantage of the darkness. Police seized the car and recovered 160kg poppy husk from it. Police registered a case against an unknown person and handed over the case to Bakeriya police station for further investigation. Police said the car was a stolen one as its number did not match. Illegal poppy husk is sold in Marwar markets for Rs 3,000 to 4,000 per kg.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gogunda-police-seize-160kg-of-illegal-poppy-husk-from-car/articleshow/87991475.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Despite the rally, investors on Dalal Street are on guard, watching global developments and if the new Covid variant ‘Omicron’ could impact economies and markets. Jittery about a sharp fall in the US markets on Friday, mainly on the back of uncertainties about the Omicron variant of the virus, the sensex opened sharply lower and dipped to an intra-day low of 56,383 points. But it recovered as buying emerged in RIL and Kotak Bank. The gains in RIL came after its mobile services arm Jio on Friday said it would raise tariffs from December 1, the third major telecom services provider to do that. The rally in Kotak Bank followed RBI’s announcement that promoters of private banks can hold up to 26% in these lenders, thus paving the way for Uday Kotak to raise his stake outside of the central bank’s special nod. The surge in the stock was also boosted by RBI’s nod to life insurance major LIC to raise its stake in the private bank to almost 10%, from below 5% currently, dealers said. Beyond the sensex, however, D-Street witnessed strong selling with the BSE’s midcap index closing nearly 1% lower, and the smallcap index ending nearly 2% down. The selling was led by foreign funds, which recorded a net sale figure of Rs 3,332 crore, BSE data showed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-kotak-help-sensex-gain-153-pts/articleshow/87992157.cms||---
---||Business||LIC can hike Kotak stake to 10%: RBI||Mumbai: The RBI has allowed LIC to hike its stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank to up to 9.99% from the current 4.96%. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s shares rose 3% following the announcement. The RBI’s permission comes in the wake of the central bank finalising new norms on ownership of private banks where it clarified that non-promoters would be allowed to hold up to 10% for individuals and non-financial institutions. Analysts feel that this is an enabling provision to ensure that the insurance giant is not in breach of norms. The RBI requires prior permission before investors buy more than 5% stake in a bank. At current levels, LIC was very close to the 5% limit. In an exchange filing, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that it has received an intimation from LIC of the approval, which is valid for a year. Some analysts speculated that this would ensure that LIC would continue to remain compliant should Kotak Mahindra Bank acquire any entity where LIC already held stake. LIC is the largest institutional investor in Indian banks. Besides holding majority (54%) stake in IDBI Bank, it is among the largest investors in ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. The insurer has also picked up shares in a host of public sector banks as part of the government’s efforts to improve their capital position a few years ago.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lic-can-hike-kotak-stake-to-10-rbi/articleshow/87992181.cms||---

The co-lending agreement aims to enhance last-mile finance and drive financial inclusion to MSMEs by offering secured loans between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore in tier-2 and -3 markets. “We believe this collaboration will provide the nimble footedness of an NBFC and quality credit to the right set of population, which will further deepen lending to MSMEs through the last-mile connect. We are also confident that, in days to come, co-lending can generate employment opportunities through MSMEs, which can translate into the country’s GDP growth,” said SBI chairman Dinesh Khara. Earlier, Union Bank of India had partnered CGCL for a similar co-lending agreement to disburse MSME loans across more than 100 centres in India. In November 2020, the RBI had issued guidelines enabling banks to co-lend with finance companies to the priority sector.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-capri-global-tie-up-for-co-lending/articleshow/87992179.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||IndusInd Bank micro fin arm’s CEO, ED exit||Mumbai: IndusInd Bank on Monday said that two senior executives of its microfinance institution (MFI) arm Bharat Financial Inclusion — MD & CEO Shalabh Saxena, and ED & CFO Ashish Damani — have resigned. The bank has appointed an executive director and another senior executive to hold fort until a new management is in place. The announcement appears to indicate a resolution of the row between the bank and Spandana Sphoorty Financial Services. Last week, the bank had said that Saxena and Damani were not relieved from their positions and they needed to continue in order to be part of a review of certain transactions. The announcement was in response to Spandana Sphoorty Financial declaring the appointments of Saxena and Damani. On Monday, IndusInd Bank said that both the executives had tendered their resignations to the chairman of the board. The bank also said that they have offered their assistance in the ongoing review of transactions related to Bharat Financial, for which the bank has appointed a “renowned international audit firm” to conduct independent review and ascertain the veracity of the anonymous complaints. Shares of IndusInd Bank rose in early trade but closed marginally in the red, ending at Rs 895 on Monday. Last weekend, the RBI announced that it would allow promoters of private banks to hold up to 26%. It added that it would permit those promoters who have already diluted stake to increase it up to the new limit. “We eagerly await the operating guidelines as it gives the promoters an opportunity to inject capital to increase stake up to 26%,” Ashok Hinduja, chairman of IIHL, Mauritius, promoter entity of IndusInd Bank, had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indusind-bank-micro-fin-arms-ceo-ed-exit/articleshow/87992184.cms||---
---||Business||When Parag regretted wasting time tying IIT-JEE supplements||Mumbai/New Delhi: It’s not just Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder, who gives top rating to Parag Agrawal, the new CEO of the micro-blogging platform. Some of his teachers too remember him as someone special. “When Parag was taking the JEE exam, he completed all the questions that he knew in the first 40 minutes and went to ask for additional supplements. But the invigilator said there was no concept of giving additional supplements. He came back to his seat and read the instructions, which said, ‘Tie all the supplements correctly in the right order’. He went back to the invigilator and told her that she must order for supplements. He came out and was quite upset that he had lost precious time over this,” says Praveen Tyagi, a teacher, who coached him for the IIT-JEE in 2000. Agrawal secured 77th rank in the IIT joint entrance exams and joined the computer science department at IIT-Bombay. Professor Supratim Biswas, a former head of computer science and engineering at IIT-B, recalled him as being a good student. “He did two courses with me and, if I remember correctly, he graduated as the department topper,” he told TOI. Not much is known about Agrawal as he left for Stanford after graduating from IIT-B and completed a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University. Agrawal, whose mother was a school teacher and father was in atomic energy, is now in his early forties. After Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai came to head Microsoft and Google in the first decade of the new millennium, Agrawal has got one of the most high-profile (and often, high-pressure) roles after Dorsey announced his departure from the micro-blogging platform, naming him as his successor. Agrawal — a former researcher at Microsoft, Yahoo and AT&T Labs — had joined Twitter in October 2011 as a software engineer, and was appointed the chief technology officer in October of 2017, according to his profile on networking site LinkedIn. In his appointment, which resulted in a surge in the shares of Twitter, Agrawal stamps the dominance of Indians in the fast-paced and high-profile world of Big Tech, which has been embroiled in several controversies in recent years as social media and internet companies have come to define public perceptions and online viewpoints, much to the discomfort of governments and regulators worldwide. Parag was the “first choice” of Dorsey, the much-acclaimed but controversial co-founder of Twitter who called him someone who “deeply understands the company and its needs”. Not much is known about Parag and his personal life except that he passed out from the Atomic Energy Central School in Mumbai. He is married to Vineeta Agarwala, a venture capital investor whose Twitter profile describes her as a physician and adjunct clinical professor at Stanford Medicine. The couple have a young son called Ansh, who also happens to have a Twitter handle. Agarwala has top-notch credentials, having graduated in biophysics from Stanford University, and then earning MD and PhD degrees from Harvard Medical School/MIT. She is currently a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, where she leads investments for the firm’s bio fund across therapeutics, diagnostics and digital health. In his reaction after being named to the top position at Twitter, Parag thanked Dorsey for his “mentorship and friendship”. “I know that some of you know me well, some just a little, and some not at all. Let’s consider ourselves at the beginning — the first step towards our future. I’m sure you have lots of questions, and there’s a lot for us to discuss. At the all-hands tomorrow, we’ll have lots of time for Q&A and discussion. It’ll be the beginning of ongoing open, direct conversations I wish for us to have together.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/when-parag-regretted-wasting-time-tying-iit-jee-supplements/articleshow/87992194.cms||Pankaj Doval

Four persons have been arrested and cops seized a firearm from them. According to locals, the incident took place around 4.30pm while the 15-year-old resident of Panihati Angel’s Nagar stepped out of school to return home. “A group of around 15-20 youths from Dunlop were waiting outside. They accosted the boy and started beating him up. One of them whipped out a gun and hit him with the revolver’s butt. They pointed the gun at him and he started screaming for help while he ran back inside the school,” said Subhadeep Banerjee, a local. Locals rushed to the spot and caught four of the accused and informed police. A team from Khardah police station reached the area and arrested the accused. “They attacked a student of our school. We have lodged a complaint with Khardah police station,” a senior official of the school said. Police suspect the attack on the student was the fallout of a dispute following a triangular love affair. “The accused are being questioned and they will be produced in a Barrackpore court on Tuesday,” said a senior officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/school-student-attacked-by-armed-youths/articleshow/87990977.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Long flu lays Kolkata low, experts say may be result of untested asymptomatic Covid||KOLKATA: The fever has gone, and the cough-and-cold is better. But symptoms like fatigue, sleeplessness and loss of appetite continue to plaque some people. While influenza is common throughout the year, mainly during seasonal change, many people have recently been complaining about symptoms persisting for an unusually long period. Asymptomatic Covid infection that had not been detected could be a reason for this, health experts said. Professor of medicine at School of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital Partha Sarathi Karmakar said that in some patients, the recovery is delayed due to several reasons, including co-morbid conditions. “Another reason could be that many had suffered from asymptomatic Covid, for which no RT-PCR tests were conducted at that time. That infection could have caused some sort of immunity alternation or a bit of lung damage, due to which they are taking longer to recover from flu infection,” said Karmakar. While it could take about 10 days for a person to completely recover from influenza infection, in some it can take as long as three weeks to a month. “While the common symptoms include cold, cough and sudden chills with high-grade fever, some people might get diarrhoea, confusion and severe muscle pain, fatigue, headache, poor appetite and loss of sleep even weeks after recovery. These are more frequent in the elderly with co-morbidities like diabetes, kidney, liver and heart diseases and they are more likely to have more symptoms. No specific treatment is generally needed, but some people can get secondary bacterial infection in the lungs which can lead to prolonged fever and cough,” said Rahul Jain, internal medicine specialist at Belle Vue Clinic. Doctors said even a section of patients suffering from common cold are getting a more severe disease this time. According to pulmonologist Raja Dhar, common cold is caused by the likes of Rhino virus and Respiratory Syncytial (RS) virus. “Influenza is a slightly severe disease than common cold. For Rhino and RS virus infections, this time we got more severe cases in patients with asthma and COPD,” said Dhar, director of pulmonology at CMRI. Due to the confusing symptoms, some patients continue to visit hospitals to get swab samples tested. “Many suffering from seasonal flu continue to come to the OPD. They are testing negative to Covid and hardly anyone is needing hospitalisation. Some are coming back with complaints of persisting symptoms even two weeks after the first consultation,” said the administrator of a hospital off Bypass.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/long-flu-lays-kolkata-low-experts-say-may-be-result-of-untested-asymptomatic-covid/articleshow/87991011.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The government has received the list of travellers from the bureau of immigration and ordered mandatory RT-PCR test of all those people who have returned to Bihar from abroad in the last couple of days. Sanjay Kumar Singh, special secretary of state health department, said the districts have been provided with the list of people with foreign travel history. “The district authorities have to trace these people and ensure their RT-PCR test. If found positive, they will be quarantined. Contact tracing will also be done. All positive samples will be sent to IGIMS-Patna for genome sequencing as per the WHO guidelines,” he said. “The list of travellers that we have got is of people with Bihar’s addresses. This does not necessarily mean that all of them have arrived in the state. Altogether 289 people of Bihar had come to the country from abroad on November 26. We have sounded an alert and ask the districts to track these people. The officials concerned have been asked not to irritate these people by making several calls. Otherwise, they will switch off their cellphones as was the case during the previous two waves of the pandemic. The officials will make just one call and collect the samples of these people,” Singh said. State chief secretary Tripurari Sharan Monday held a meeting with officials of health department, DMs and civil surgeons on Monday to chalk out strategy to prevent the outbreak of another Covid wave. He asked the officials concerned to intensify vaccination. Sharan also visited IGIMS-Patna and suggested genome sequencing even if there are fewer Covid positive cases. Health minister Mangal Pandey said the department was keeping a close watch on the situation. “Special vigil is being kept on people coming from abroad. All RT-PCR laboratories have been asked to immediately inform the headquarters if any new information is received,” he said. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumar Singh said efforts were on to locate the people who have returned to the district from abroad in the last couple of days. “Asha workers and ANMs have been asked to identify all such people with the help of addresses mentioned in their passports. RT-PCR samples of such people will be collected,” she said. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the district administration was better prepared this time to fight the virus in terms of availability of beds, medicines and oxygen plants. “Premier hospitals in the district are equipped with cryogenic oxygen plants,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-starts-tracing-people-with-foreign-travel-history/articleshow/87989812.cms||Faryal Rumi

Random test of flyers coming from other states is also being done at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport here. A booth has been set up at the airport by the state health department in association with Care India for the purpose. Thermal screening of passengers, which was stopped at Patna airport following improvement in Covid situation, has resumed. A Patna airport official said passengers travelling to Maharashtra and abroad in connecting flights are required to furnish a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours. “Thermal screening has also started at the departure gate as a precautionary measure,” the official added. Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar said he has written to the district administration about the guidelines that should be introduced for the passengers arriving at the airport. “If RT-PCR test is compulsory, the district administration will have to set up the booth for the purpose. We are conducting random rapid antigen test of passengers as only two domestic flights operate from the airport per day,” he added. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said random test of travellers is being done at airport, railway stations and bus depots. Meanwhile, the railways has provided space to the health department at all the major railway stations to conduct Covid test of passengers. “We are keeping a close watch on those reaching Bihar from states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat and Delhi,” a railway official said. ECR CPRO Rajesh Kumar said booths for Covid test would also be set up at Ara, Buxar, Begusarai, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga stations. “The state health department will ensure that the Covid test is conducted uninterrupted at railway platforms,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/thermal-screening-of-passengers-restarts-at-airports-railway-stations/articleshow/87989846.cms||Kumod Verma

He said that ‘kanyadaan’ in the Indian tradition is the greatest gift and the biggest achievement for any individual and it was an honour for everyone to be a part of such an auspicious ceremony. Congratulating the department of labour and employment for having organised the event under the Samuhik Vivaah Yojna, the CM said: “Jab apne aur paraye ka bhav samapt hua, tabhi pradesh ka vikas sambhav hua (When the difference between ours and yours ended, only then it became possible to develop the state properly). We are working with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas aur Sabka Prayas’, as a result of which, government schemes are benefitting every needy and are uplifting every deprived person without any discrimination on the basis of caste, language, religion and region.” The CM said that the labour department was in place even before 2017 but no efforts were made to improve the lives of the poor, needy, labourers and workers. When he launched the community marriage scheme, he said, opposition parties had termed it as ‘disrespect’ to girls but the scheme prevented malpractices such as dowry and child marriage and also conveyed a message of social harmony and unity. “Mass marriages invoke the sentiment of ‘Gaon ki beti, sabki beti’,” he said. The CM said that the aim of the central and state governments is to uplift every poor, develop every village, benefit every crop-grower, provide employment to the youth and establish a safe environment for all women in the state. The CM also expressed happiness that all couples wore masks, saying that the corona infection had thrown life out of gear in many countries but the world has seen the successful management of Covid in UP and India. “UP was the first state to provide a sustenance allowance to labourers, street vendors and poor, benefitting 54 lakh people by it. The state also introduced the concept of community kitchen, distributed free gas cylinders and health insurance,” he said. Stating that labourers are the builders of the nation, the CM added that the foundation of a country lies in the strength of its labourers and workers. The stronger our workers are, he said, the more well-built the nation will be.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/2-5k-couples-tie-the-knot-at-mega-event-in-up/articleshow/87992098.cms||Arjumand Bano

Speaking to reporters after a Covid 19 review meeting with senior officials, he said that around 2 lakh people above 18 years are yet to take the second dose. “In Mysuru city alone, around 1 lakh people above 18 years are yet to take the second dose. Keeping in mind the safety of all, including their own family, all must take the Covid-19 (vaccine) second dose,” he said. “In Mysuru city, an average of 40,000 people from all the three constituencies are yet to take the second dose. All must work with us in our fight against Covid-19. This is the important stage for vaccination,” he appealed.  He added that the “first dose is due for around 1 lakh people.” “In the last one to two months, vaccine hesitancy has developed among a few. Even though we are doing door-to-door vaccine drives, a few have developed complacency. Mysuru has a large, educated population. Still, over 1 lakh people have yet to take the second dose. The people’s response is poor,” he lamented. He also said that 10 per cent of the total Covid tests will be done in educational institutions. DC Bagadi added that in two nursing colleges, 72 students have tested positive last week. Among them, only 21 were symptomatic. He said he would speak to police officers on ferrying excess students in school autos and vans. He will speak to DPI officials on continuing online classes for students along with offline classes, Bagadi said. The government has also directed the district administration to postpone all the social, cultural, and educational programmes which were not essential, he added. At the Bavali check post which is on the Karnataka-Kerala border, “we are maintaining a strict vigil. In the last 10 days, we sent 160 vehicles back for not following the RTPCR test rules,” he said. “In the last one month, we conducted 90,734 tests. The positivity rate is 0.83 per cent. In the past week, the positivity rate is 0.97 per cent,” he said. Negative report mandatory for Maha travellersAccording to state government directives, an RTPCR-negative certificate not older than 72 hours is now compulsory for travellers from Kerala and Maharashtra. “All the travellers who have arrived from Kerala and Maharashtra between November 12 and 27 to the district also must undergo RTPCR tests. The government has issued an order in this regard. Those who arrive from these two states with RTPCR-negative tests must also undergo RTPCR tests seven days after their arrival to the district,” DC Bagadi said. In containment zones, all must undergo RTPCR tests seven days after testing negative. In all schools and colleges, all the students must undergo screening for Covid 19 symptoms. In each school, 5 per cent of students must undergo RTPCR tests randomly.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/more-than-one-lakh-people-yet-to-take-second-dose-in-mysuru-says-dc/articleshow/87990332.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ‘Smart’ cities up against unplanned urban growth||AMARAVATI: Increasing migration to towns and cities in the state is turning out to be one of the government’s biggest challenges as it is adding to the already high population in urban slums. Andhra Pradesh has the highest number of urban slums in the country after Maharashtra. According to a recent study report by Niti Aayog, about 16 per cent of the urban population in the state lives in slums, close on the heels of Maharashtra’s 18 per cent. “Growing urban slums are posing a big threat to planning of urban areas. While increasing migration to urban areas is a welcome sign as urban areas are considered as growth engines, the unplanned growth of townships is expected to cause more troubles,” said an expert urban planner and dean of planning at School of Architecture and Planning (SPA), Vijayawada, Dr Abdul Razak. Interestingly, AP created the highest number of urban civic bodies in an attempt to draw more funds from the Centre for improvement of infrastructure. However, the creation of new urban civic bodies without proper planning has led to an expansion of urban slums, said experts. “Urbanisation is intrinsic to development and often serves as a major driver of economic growth. As India reaches the tipping point of transitioning from a mostly rural to an urban society, the focus must be on ensuring the best opportunities for economic growth for all sections of the society,” observed Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar in the report. Dr Razak said planning for small and medium towns should be the priority of the local government. He observed households in slums should be integrated spatially through creating spatial access, which includes potable drinking water, primary health service, basic sanitation facilities, places for recreation and socialisation. Unplanned urbanisation in the state has already resulted in a number of problems. AP has about 17 municipal corporations, nearly 80 municipalities and 30 nagar panchayats. But full-time planning officers with required qualifications are available only in a few cities. Officials such as town planning supervisors and building inspectors often have little knowledge of the processes of town planning. The state government had appointed a large number of planning secretaries in ward secretariats across the state two years ago. Although, a good number of engineering graduates have entered the field, they are from the civil engineering stream and not graduates from planning schools. According to recent study reports, AP has 6,239 slums spread over nearly 140 urban local bodies. “This is going to wreak havoc with urban infrastructure, leading to frequent floods in the coming years,” warned noted architect Md Hakeem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/smart-cities-up-against-unplanned-urban-growth/articleshow/87990100.cms||Samdani MN
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Govt depts asked to deposit funds only in SFSC||AMARAVATI: The state government has directed all departmental heads not to deposit money in any bank in the state, and place the deposits only in AP State Financial Services Corporation. Citing the recent incidents of misappropriation of fixed deposits placed by different government departments in the banks, all government institutions including universities have been asked to divert the available funds to the newly-created APSFSC. It may be recalled that 14 people, including bankers, were arrested last month in connection with liquidation of FDs worth Rs 14.6 crore belonging to AP Cooperative Oil Seed Growers’ Federation and AP Warehousing Corporation by using fabricated documents. The state government has secured a non-banking license from the RBI to float an exclusive corporation (APSFSC) to handle the financial matters of the government under the Companies Act in April 2020. Temple committees and trust boards, including the TTD, are exempt from the restriction. The governing council of NTR University of Health Sciences recently took a guarded move to divert about Rs 400 crore to APSFSC. After objections from employees’ associations, the university governing board resolved that it would deposit money in any bank or financial arm, which offered it higher rate of interest. While APSFSC offered an annual interest of 5.5 per cent, the nationalised bank offered 5.1 per cent, following which the amount was deposited with the government corporation. The government has now decided to completely withdraw all fixed deposits from banks and place them in the APSFSC. “The decision has been taken to protect public money,” said a senior official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/govt-depts-asked-to-deposit-funds-only-in-sfsc/articleshow/87990159.cms||Samdani MN

With the usual lifespan of a train being 30 years, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had started the process of refurbishing the old rakes to deal with their “midlife crisis”. The first such train was unveiled by DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh at the Yamuna Bank depot on Monday. In February 2019, TOI was the first to report that DMRC was planning to refurbish its first batch of 70 four-coach trains, which were inducted between 2002 and 2007 and deployed on the Red (Rithala-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda) and Blue (Dwarka-Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) lines. “In a first-of-its-kind exercise, Delhi Metro has successfully completed the mid-life refurbishment work of the first train that was introduced into service in 2007. The trains are being retrofitted and modified with many new features to bring them on a par with the remaining trains that were introduced into service in DMRC’s Phase-II and III expansions,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Some of the major refurbishment of the trains include replacement of old floors, repainting of interiors and upgrading electrical panels. The trains are also being provided with mobile and laptop charging sockets as part of the retrofitment near two seaters in each coach, CCTV surveillance and fire detection systems. The floors of the old trains were showing the most visible signs of deterioration, such as cracks, bulging and uneven surfaces. Passengers complained that it was resulting in ankle tilting. “The floor has now been replaced by modern fibre composite boards to enhance passenger safety and comfort and to give an aesthetic look,” Dayal said. DMRC has also taken care of peeled off paint, scratches and dents. The refurbished trains now boast of LCD-based dynamic route maps like their younger counterparts, instead of the old static sticker-based route maps. “Now, 50% of static route maps will be converted into LCD-based dynamic route maps staggered throughout the train giving dynamic live information to the passengers,” said Dayal. “Initially, seven train sets at the Yamuna Bank depot and three at the Shastri Park depot are being refurbished. These 10 trains are expected to be fully refurbished by September 2022. In addition, tender work is also in progress for taking up the refurbishment work of the remaining 60 train sets on similar lines,” Dayal added. All 350 trains in DMRC’s fleet, including both old and new ones, undergo periodical preventive checks for their upkeep at maintenance depots and workshops. The preventive maintenance includes 72-hour checks of all systems like airconditioning, lights, brakes, doors, etc, apart from routine visual inspection every 15 days to check systems like pantograph, traction motors, wheels, suspension system, cab equipment, etc. Apart from this, rigorous checks are carried out every 45 days or after a run of 15,000 kilometres, after every six months or 60,000 km, every year or 1.2 lakh km. The overhauling of trains takes place after 4 lakh kilometres and after every eight years.

Recently, traders at the market wrote to Punjab governor-cum-UT administrator Banwari Lal Purohit, highlighting their problems. Ram Karan Gupta, president, grain market association, said roads in the area were potholed, making driving dangerous, especially for two-wheeler drivers. He said shoppers at the market encountered heaps of garbage and leftovers and reeking piles of rotten vegetables. Even the parking charge of Rs 20 in the market were on the higher side, particularly since the contractor did not provide space to park vehicles in view of encroachments, he claimed. Mohit Sood, general secretary, grain market association, demanded that the MoU signed between the administrator office of the Market Committee, Sector 26 and the MC for allocation of sanitation work to the latter be scrapped. He claimed that things had worsened after the MoU.

One of the bus drivers — Ganesh Heganna (28) of Kolhapur — lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station the next morning. According to the FIR, Heganna’s bus was heading towards Sangli from Swargate with passengers. It had reached the Katraj ghat section, when unidentified men threw a stone and damaged its windshield. “There were few passengers in the bus, but none of them were injured,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. Another Shivshahi bus was heading in the same direction behind Heganna’s bus. “The suspects also threw a stone on its windsheild and fled,” Kalaskar said.

Accordingly, RT-PCR testing for Covid will be further ramped up at Ahmedabad international airport with all incoming passengers from countries identified as ‘at-risk’ for Omicron by GoI will mandatorily undergo RT-PCR testing upon arrival. Separate queues for passengers ‘at-risk' countries will also be created. Those who test positive will be shifted directly to state-monitored isolation centers. Top sources said that just like the beginning of the pandemic and later the Alpha variation threat from the UK, isolation centers, both government and private, are being identified to ensure any passenger suspected to be carrying the Omicron variant remains isolated. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, told TOI that the state is taking all precautionary measures to ensure stringent screening of international travellers. “We will ensure no inconvenience is caused to travellers. There will be enough teams for sample collection and testing. All information will be provided by the airlines in advance so that travellers are aware of the SOPs on arrival,” he said. Shivahare along with senior officials visited the airport on Monday evening. Top health department sources said that all positive samples from Gujarat will be sent for genomic sequencing at Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC). Samples of positive international passengers would be accorded priority in genome sequencing. Number of tests at arrivals of different locations including airports, railway stations, bus depots and highways will be increased in the next few days, officials said. The next two months are crucial for Gujarat which is poised to see a sharp rise in international passenger footfalls due to the wedding season as well as a flurry of events scheduled around the high profile VGGIS 2022. According to the SOP, all travellers from these countries must undergo RT-PCR upon arrival. If they test positive, they should be admitted to an isolation facility. Even if they test negative, they must remain home-quarantined for seven days and take another RT-PCR on the 8th day. Even for travellers from other countries, a negative RT-PCR is a must to enter the state. The arrivals area of the international terminal at SVPI airport has six counters for RT-PCR testing, said senior officials. Airport sources said that this will further be increased. The airport operator is also mulling over installing machines for conducting RT-LAMP tests that can give results in 30 minutes. Out of 100-odd RT-LAMP machines at the departure area, some may be shifted to arrivals if required, they added. It was discussed that there will be a separate queue of passengers who arrive from At Risk countries and will have to mandatorily undergo an RT-PCR test. These passengers will not be allowed to leave the city airport premises until their reports are out,” said a well-placed source at the airport. While the city airport has not imposed any RT-PCR requirement for the domestic passengers, Surat airport mandates a negative RT-PCR report from the incoming passengers while Kandla has a similar rule in place only for passengers coming from Maharashtra. At present, Ahmedabad has three weekly flights connecting the city with London with 150-odd passengers arriving at the airport with each flight. Likewise, Surat has two flights every week to Sharjah.

The duo shattered the hopes of around ten thousand cricket fans who had assembled at the stadium to witness India’s victory. Only a few hundred fans reached the Green park on Monday morning, but the number started increasing when on the very first ball after lunch Umesh Yadav clinched the wicket of Tom Latham. With the fall of Latham’s wicket, the fans were rejuvenated and hoped that India would exploit the wicket and win the Test match. The fans knew that in order to cheer their team, their presence on the ground was essential. By the time of Tea break, except the VIP pavilion and public stand, all stands were packed with fans who were blowing horns and raising special “Kanpuriya slogans” to boost the morale of Indian players. The support of Indian fans enhanced the performance of India as in the post-tea session, visitors lost three more wickets. Smelling the victory, fans started beating drums and dancing at C balcony gallery and there was a loud roar every time when Indian players made an appeal. With the fall of the ninth wicket, the fans were sure that India would register a win now. But Ravindra and Patel stood like a rock and luck favored them twice when DRS was sought against them. The duo foiled all attempts of Indian spinners to separate them. After the ninth mandatory over, their bad light appeal was admitted by the umpires and they called the match. With this, the crowd was stunned and there was a pin drop silence for a few minutes. The disappointed fans thereafter came out silently from the stadium. The petty street vendors reduced the rates of their articles after the match. The t-shirt which they sold during the match for Rs 200 was offered on Rs 100 only. Kundo and other vendors said they earned some money in the last two days otherwise their Kanpur venture was at a loss.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/pin-drop-silence-at-green-park-as-fans-return-dissappointed/articleshow/87991446.cms||Anant Shekhar Mishra
---||India||Why road agencies don’t pay for accidents||NEW DELHI: Anju Vidyanand Sahu’s family demanded action against the road-owning agency, which had put a temporary iron sheet on Santacruz-Chembur Link Road in Mumbai that resulted in a fatal crash and consequent death of the 18-year-old girl recently. Now, police have filed an FIR against the driver of a dumper. Manoj Wadhwa of Faridabad who lost his three-year-old son in February 2014 has been fighting a court case to hold the road owning agency and contractor accountable for his son’s death. While the family members of such victims have the right reasons to allege negligence on the part of the road-owning agencies, the police across states often lodge FIRs against drivers of bigger vehicles and that is because they have limited options as the Indian Penal Code doesn’t have enough provisions to book road crashes other than the section of “rash and negligent driving on public way”. So, all road crash cases get registered under these two heads and road owning agencies easily go scot free. A comparative analysis of the past five years’ reports on ‘accidental deaths’ and ‘crime in India’, published by the National Crime Records Bureau, reveal that 88-99% of the road fatalities were attributed to only “rash and negligent driving”. So, all other reasons behind such crashes were hardly recorded by police. This has serious consequences as the government’s policy making is primarily driven by the annual reports on road crashes published by the NCRB and road transport ministry. Both the agencies use the data provided by police and it’s unlike several other countries which have convergence of data from police, hospitals and insurance firms to find the root cause of road crashes. “It depends on the investigating officer. If there is evidence of deficiencies on the part of road owning or any other agency, the IO can register a case under Section 268 of IPC (negligence and public safety) and can add Section 304(2). This should be done because the agency or contractor, in such cases, is aware that such negligence is likely to cause death, though there is no intention to cause death or any bodily injury,” said T Krishna Prasad, ex-DGP and chairman of road safety authority in Telangana. Conviction in such cases can attract jail terms of up to 10 years. Prasad said there is a tendency among policemen to catch the driver of bigger vehicles rather than finding the root cause of crashes. Bala Gangadhar Tilak, a retired railway signal and telecommunication engineer, who is popularly known as ‘Road Doctor’ for his crusade against potholes, said, “If we are challaned (fined) for not wearing seatbelt or helmet, why the police should not slap challans on agencies when they can’t fill potholes or maintain roads? They should take photos of the road; send them to agencies concerned and file a case, if they fail to repair in time. But police are always after vehicles because they get extra earnings. This is a good source of income for them.” Anju’s brother, Vikas Sahu, who was driving the ill-fated two-wheeler with his sister as pillion, said while the FIR is a necessity for legal purposes, he wants the road-owning agency to make the stretches safe. “Any amount of compensation can’t bring my sister back. I just want this should not happen with anyone else. Had there been no iron sheet, my bike would not have skidded when I applied the brake to avoid hitting the dumper ahead and lose my sister forever. The agencies building and maintaining roads must give top priority to the safety of users,” he added. Pavitra’s father Manoj said there is inertia within government agencies to take action against another even when there is evidence. In his case, an FIR was initially lodged against a truck driver. But only after a court order, a special investigation team (SIT) was set up to reinvestigate the case and an FIR was lodged against the road owning agency and the contractor concerned to investigate the negligence on their part. “Majority of the rules that the governments have made ensures that the victim keeps fighting his case for years. Though the government introduced a provision in the Motor Vehicle Act in 2019 to impose Rs 1 lakh fine on a contractor or road owning agency in case any faulty design or poor maintenance claims any life, there is hardly any sign of implementation. Should the government agencies wait for the loss of some lives to swing into action? Why can’t they take steps before any life is lost and who pays for their inefficiency and criminal negligence?” he asked. It’s not that there is no legal provision to investigate road crashes, but the police are hardly concerned about detailed investigation of such cases. The section-135, which was included in the Motor Vehicle Act in 1988, details the mechanism that the states can adopt for proper investigation of accident cases. B L Soni, director general of police (ACB) of Rajasthan, who earlier served as Jaipur, admitted that while police have legal limitations while FIRs in road crash cases, detailed crash investigation is necessary to find the real cause of crashes and that will help the government agencies to take the corrective steps.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-road-agencies-dont-pay-for-accidents/articleshow/87992860.cms||Dipak K Dash

People on social media accused the MLA of illegally organising the wedding of his 19-year-old nephew. The legislator has refuted the claims made in social media and said his nephew is 21 years and provided documents to the administration to prove his point. Since Saturday, after Chaman Yadav, the nephew of Tijara MLA got married, people on the social media started a debate saying Chaman’s age is 19 years.

Till 2018, it was like any other noon meal kitchen in a government school. But the school headmistress, T D Mala, who took charge four years ago, realized it was essential to transform the kitchen to change the perception among the parents about the government schools.The kitchen, which was equipped with a wood stove, was dark and it was painted black. The first thing she did was to white wash the walls with the help of the city corporation.“I approached the noon meal personal assistant to collector and managed to get an LPG connection. On seeing the transformation of the kitchen, officials suggested us to apply for ISO certification and offered all support,” she said.However, obtaining the ISO certification wasn’t easy. “It was on our fourth attempt that we received the certification,” Mala, who received negative remarks when the ISO team came for inspection for the first time, said.She said they had provided aprons and head caps to noon meal organizer and cook, set up an RO water system to prepare food with hygienic water, installed CCTV cameras to monitor cooking and appointed two parents to check the (cooking) process. “A teacher will always check the quality of food before serving the same to students.” The school has also set up an organic garden to grow vegetables for the noon meal and a dining area with tables for the children to sit and eat. Mala said the noon meal kitchen had, among other things, helped them increase the student strength over the years. “The school has a strength of more than 1,000 students and the number is increasing.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/corporation-school-kitchen-awarded-iso-certification/articleshow/87991482.cms||Sampath Kumar

In a statement, Southern Railway said it was committed to take all preventive measures in coordination with the state forest departments to prevent elephants from getting hit by trains.There was permanent speed restriction of 45 kmph in place from 6pm till 6am in view of the frequent crossing of wild elephants in the location where this incident had happened.Listing out the measures taken by the railway to avoid elephants hit by trains, the statement said regular clearing of vegetation along the railway tracks was done to facilitate loco pilots for clear sighting of elephants crossing railway tracks. Apart from doing solar fencing at ground level to deter elephants from crossing the track, elephant ramps have been constructed at suitable locations in Walayar–Ettimadai section at high bank location for passage of elephants without getting entrapped near railway track area.Solar lights have been provided at vulnerable locations to improve visibility for loco pilots. Further, Kerala and Tamil Nadu forest departments have engaged elephant trackers who regularly patrol the railway tracks and communicate the information on the movement of the elephants near the track. Many incidents of elephant hitting have been averted and lives of elephants have been saved in the past, the statement said.Twenty-four incidents of elephants sighted near the tracks have been reported during the year 2020-21 (till September 1, 2021). During 2020-21, 2019-20 and 2018-19, 69, 61 and 24 such incidents have been reported respectively.TNN||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/committed-to-prevent-elephant-deaths-rly/articleshow/87991478.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Opposition to ration scheme faulty, says AAP||NEW DELHI: The AAP government on Monday defended its doorstep delivery of ration scheme before Delhi high court, saying that it is a “complete misconception” that fair price shops cease to exist on implementation of the scheme. It contended that the scheme is an optional one where beneficiaries can opt out anytime. It claimed that not a single beneficiary has questioned the mode and manner of implementation of the scheme. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, however, said the emphasis is that the fair price shops (FPS) should not be ousted from the system with the implementation of the scheme. “The Centre’s submission is that FPS is an integral part of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), therefore, you cannot do away with that,” the bench remarked. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, assured the bench it is a misconception the State is seeking to do away with FPS. “In last two years, there has been home delivery of everything, be it Covid-generated or non-Covid generated. It is a complete misconception or wrongly implied that FPS ceases to exist. This doorstep delivery is an optional scheme and beneficiaries can opt out anytime. This is nothing but proxy litigation set up by somebody else who is not the petitioner,” Singhvi argued. He further said with the march of technology, doorstep delivery has become the norm, and this is something that needs applause and not criticism. He cited examples of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka as places where identical doorstep delivery schemes have begun. The court, which was hearing a plea by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh challenging the Delhi government’s scheme for doorstep delivery of ration—Mukhymantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, listed the matter for further arguments on December 3. During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Centre, said the court should not allow any state to interfere with the structure of NFSA and destroy its architecture. “As Union of India, we are only concerned with complete compliance of NFSA,” she submitted even while applauding the Delhi government for implementing the Central government’s One Nation One Ration Card scheme under the NFSA in an “exceedingly well” manner. The AAP government has maintained that the scheme is for the poor who are now being threatened by fair price shop owners to opt out of the home delivery mode otherwise they will not be given ration.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/govt-in-hc-opposition-to-ration-scheme-faulty/articleshow/87991485.cms||---

The BMC dashboard showed that only 5.6% of 16,939 Covid beds in the city are occupied. State government officials said that with cases dropping and a rise in vaccination, people in the state seem to be dropping their guard and not following Covid-appropriate behaviour.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/mumbai-daily-covid-cases-at-19-month-low/articleshow/88003343.cms||---

Apart from residents, a large number of commuters are also affected by the pathetic condition of the roads. The 3rd Street of Lakshmi Nagar is one of the badly damaged stretches, said Krishnamanikandan Subramaniayan, a resident. “The entire stretch is pothole-riddled. As a portion of the road is heavily damaged, motorists are using only the other side, leading to chaos during peak hours,” he told TOI.City corporation officials ignored their complaints, said K Velayutham. “Civic officials should allot more fund for Kavundampalayam, considering the plight of roads here.”Themaiyan Street, a few hundred metres away from 3rd Street of Lakshmi Nagar, is also in poor condition. It has been ages since the road was laid and as a result, the stretch has turned into a muddy morass. Commuters struggle, especially when it rains. A city corporation official promised to set things right after the monsoon ends. “We will conduct an inspection before launching maintenance work,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/damaged-roads-make-commuting-a-nightmare-in-kavundampalayam/articleshow/87991494.cms||---

---||Mumbai||All classes to open in Maharashtra on Wednesday, plan for Mumbai likely today||MUMBAI: Physical schools will reopen for all classes in the state from Wednesday, even as the state began taking measures to tackle the new Omicron variant. Schools and parents are treading cautiously. The final decision on reopening rests with civic chiefs and collectors. In Mumbai, a decision on reopening is expected on Tuesday. The government circular issued on Monday following a cabinet meeting allows reopening classes 1-7 in cities and classes 1-4 in rural areas. Schools can bring in students in a staggered manner and attendance will continue to be voluntary. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “The government is sensitive to the possibility of a third wave and no laxity in implementation of the standard operating procedure will be permitted.” Health minister Rajesh Tope said as no case of the newly detected variant has been detected in the state, there is no reason why schools should not reopen as planned. “All the sectors which have been allowed to reopen will continue to function. Even schools have been allowed to reopen based on the go-ahead given by the pediatric task force and the health department,” said Tope. Existing healthy practices such as masks and social distancing will continue. Staff and school bus operators will have to be fully vaccinated. Schools will set up health clinics or tie up with the local health department for emergencies. Schools will be on for three to four hours without any recess. Cultural and sporting events will not be allowed. Schools should avoid science experiments for Class 1-4 students where possible or take small groups. In Mumbai, schools had got down to planning a staggered reopening last week. The initial enthusiasm of sending children to school after 19 months seemed to be waning following news of the southern African variant. “Parents who had given their consent are doing a rethink. We too want to adopt a wait-and-watch policy for a few days after reopening,” said the principal of a school in Kurla. Attendance of Class 8-10 students that had picked up after the Diwali vacations starting November 22, is shifting to online classes, said teachers. “Our attendance was around 85% last week. On Monday, we had more students in virtual classes,” said a Sakinaka school teacher. Parents said confusion over Omicron may put a break on schools. “My son is enjoying school but for the next few weeks we have asked him to attend online,” said a parent of a Class 10 student from Goregaon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-all-classes-to-open-in-state-on-wed-plan-for-city-likely-today/articleshow/87991510.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Closure order for Arvind unit||AHMEDABAD: Huge drama unfolded at Gujarat High Court on Monday, during the hearing of a petition filed by Arvind Limited against the civic body’s move to disconnect its Naroda unit’s effluent connection to the sewage treatment plant. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board informed the court that it had issued an order for the closure of Ankur Textiles, a unit of Arvind near Raipur Darwaza, after civic officials cut its sewage connection. To counter the claim, the firm’s lawyers came to court with water bottles, claiming it contained water after being treated at its effluent treatment plant. Not to be outdone, advocates representing AMC also submitted samples and bottles containing orange liquid, claiming it was treated water from the unit that still contained toxic levels of matter. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati proposed that the judges and lawyers involved in the litigation should take a sip from the bottle. Following HC’s directions to take strict action against industrial units discharging trade effluents illegally into sewage lines, the AMC had snapped the unit’s connection used to release treated effluent into sewage network. Taking exception to this, Arvind knocked on HC’s door. However, the court also found that the effluent, despite being treated, contained high TDS as well as mercury and chlorides three times the permitted value. This was causing damage to the sewage treatment plants. As a result, the water ultimately discharged into the Sabarmati took a toll on “environment, ecology and health”. The court questioned why Arvind did not connect to the mega pipeline and discharge effluents directly to CETP. Its advocates said, “The company has no objection, but it is not feasible as it requires a 5.5-km pipeline and the unit is in the middle of the city.” Putting an end to the heated discussion, the court said, “Our last word. Your (Arvind) trade effluent should not go into the drains. Till you make necessary arrangements. Perhaps we may permit you with strict conditions that you adhere to parameters. You will have to come out with a plan.” The court, however, asked the authorities not to pass any order about the Naroda unit of Arvind and posted hearing on its applications on December 3.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/closure-order-for-arvind-unit/articleshow/87991536.cms||---
---||Delhi||Mask up and shed complacency, say experts as Omicron variant looms large||NEW DELHI: There are many things that governments need to do to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant and its potential impact. But, public health specialists say, people also need to shed complacency and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent the disease from spreading. TimesViewMedical knowledge about Omicron and its behaviour is limited as of now. Nonetheless, Covid-appropriate behaviour must continue. Which means wearing a mask, social distancing wherever possible and, of course, getting yourself fully vaccinated.“We need a social movement against the pandemic. People need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as wearing a well-fitting mask and maintaining social distance. Those who haven’t received the vaccine should get it. All this will help reduce the impact of newer variants of the novel coronavirus,” Dr Neeraj Nischal, additional professor, department of medicine at AIIMS, said. He added that people with a history of travel to countries affected by Omicron, the new and highly mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, should come forward on their own to monitor their health. “We have seen in the past how some people tried to hide their travel history or delayed communication about their illness, which led to the disease spread, often affecting the direct contacts of the person. It should be avoided —for their own sake as well as the society’s,” the AIIMS doctor said. On Monday, Delhi government ordered a separate isolation unit at Lok Nayak Hospital to isolate and treat patients detected with the new, Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. “At present, there are no confirmed cases of Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant in the state, but we are prepared to deal with any situation,” Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, said. Lok Nayak hospital was designated as a Covid-only hospital during the first wave of the pandemic. Dr Kumar said all staff members, including doctors and nurses, have received both vaccine doses. “Looking at the worldwide trends, it appears that a booster dose. But the expert committee appointed by the government has to make a final call on that,” the Lok Nayak hospital director said. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it is not yet clear whether Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. “Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants,” the UN health body said on Mondays.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/mask-up-and-shed-complacency-say-experts-as-new-variant-looms-large/articleshow/87991505.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Ahmedabad||Tax evasion suspect walks out of hospital||Ahmedabad: A key player in a tax evasion case, 48-year-old Niraj Jaydev Arya, allegedly fled from the Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) on the Civil Hospital Campus in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Arya, who is at the helm of affairs of Rajkot-based Utkarsh Group, had been transferred to GCRI on November 22 from a private hospital in Rajkot. Following a raid on Utkarsh Group by the state goods and services tax (SGST) department for suspected tax evasion on November 19, Arya complained of chest pain and got himself admitted at the private hospital in Rajkot. During the course of the raid, it was found that Utkarsh Group was allegedly involved in tax evasion to the tune of Rs 31.09 crore. SGST officials seized stock, attached the factory building and shed, plant and machinery, bank accounts, seven residential plots owned by Arya and a fixed deposit of Rs 12.7 crore. Meanwhile, Arya had moved an anticipatory bail plea at the sessions court in Ahmedabad apprehending arrest. The plea was rejected based on an affidavit filed by the SGST officials, about his involvement in the tax evasion. “Just before Arya’s arrest procedure began, he complained of chest pain and moved to the hospital. We asked the hospital management to inform us before discharging him as he is an accused,” said a senior SGST official. “He was found to have cancer, and was shifted to the cancer hospital on the Civil Hospital campus in Ahmedabad. We informed the hospital authorities in Ahmedabad to keep us in the loop about his discharge,” the official added. Sources said Arya fled the hospital from the backdoor of the building and left in a cab. “He was dressed in a business suit when he left the hospital,” the source said. Sources also said that there is suspected involvement of the hospital authorities in his escape. When Arya fled, a few officials of SGST department were present in the hospital. The SGST department issued a lookout circular for Arya. The department received a tip-off that Arya has been admitted to a Nadiad hospital. After investigating the books of accounts and related documents seized from Utkarsh Group’s offices and the residence of the company’s chartered accountant, Himanshu Chomle, it is anticipated that the amount of tax evaded may be higher. Chomle’s bail plea was approved by the sessions court. Further investigation in the case is underway.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/tax-evasion-suspect-walks-out-of-hospital/articleshow/87990877.cms||---

---||Delhi||Gang in Delhi cracked exams for a price||NEW DELHI: A gang that used to remotely access and hack various online competitive examinations has been busted by the Intelligence Fusion & Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police. Two coaching centre owners from Ahmedabad and a Delhibased technical expert, who worked as a solver for the gang, have been arrested. The solver, Akhlaq Alam (29), is a resident of Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi, while the other two, Rajesh (45) and Deep Shah (19), are from Gujarat. DCP (Special Cell) KPS Malhotra said the gang’s specially designed software disguised as operating system files could bypass advance checks by examconducting agencies, like AI systems to monitor pupil movement of the eyes, and proprietary software to disable unauthorised remote access. “Initial investigation shows over 200 candidates had used the gang’s services to clear online exams till now,” added Malhotra. IFSO received a tip-off that a few services were active on Dark Web in which crooks claimed to hack and get the desired score in online exams in lieu of a hefty fee. A team comprising ACP Raman Lamba, inspectors Vijay Gahlawat and Bhanu Pratap and others was formed to investigate the case. The suspects were identified by crawling over DarkNet and social engineering over Surface Net. A decoy was arranged to crack a deal for an online certification. The decoy generated the requirement for CompTIA A+Certification (Core1) examination. The hacker was contacted over VoIP and the desired sum of money was transferred to the account provided by him. The accused asked the decoy candidate to download a software, Iperius Remote, through which they gained control of his laptop and attempted the exam on October 25. The decoy candidate was declared passed with a score of 736. “This decoy deal established that online certification exams were being manipulated by hacking. Technical analysis of the phone number, bank account and internet usage of the accused was tracked to Ahmedabad. Raids were conducted and Shah was arrested on November 24,” said the DCP. Shah’s father ran an institute, Grass Solutions, at Ahmedabad providing IT courses. It was found that his father was also involved in the racket. The duo was assuring 100% guarantee to candidates for getting online certification exams cleared. The applicants who wanted to get these certifications without having the required knowledge and skills for the domain used to approach the gang through this coaching centre. Alam hacked the exam by getting remote access with the help of apps. The online certification exams were cleared through the exam solver. Later, Alam and Shah’s father were arrested. Alam owned a computer training institute in Noida. He reportedly has top-level IT certifications in networking, is Cisco CCNP certified and has over 12 years of experience as network implementation and design engineer. During interrogation, the accused said they took advantage of the private sector and IT industry, in particular, relying on online certification and started illegally assisting candidates in clearing the exams. Their demand increased enormously post Covid-19.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gang-cracked-exams-for-a-price/articleshow/87991504.cms||---

FSSAI had declared a street in Saravanampatti as the first such hub in 2019. The officials considered a few places in the city including VOC Park and Vilankurichi Road for the initiative. They found the VOC Park area to be better as Vilankurichi is a long stretch with shops scattered. VOC Park attracts people of all ages due to the presence of a zoo, a skating ground and the park. The place is preferred by people to spend quality time with family and friends. While evenings come alive with people thronging the place, weekends are crowded. However, compared to the pre-Covid times, the number of eateries has come down. Eateries set up around the park serve a wide variety of delicious dishes, be it sundal, bhaji, panipuri, fried chicken, spicy soups or fresh chips. FSSAI had launched the initiative to ensure food safety and hygiene, an official said. “We will train eatery operators on preparing quality food, improving ambience and establishing a brand. The initiative will improve the economic condition of street vendors by attracting more customers. Registration and license will be made mandatory,” he said. The clean street food hub in Saravanampatti will be spruced up soon, the official said. “Eateries there lack in some areas, as we could not focus on them due to the pandemic.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/2nd-clean-street-food-hub-to-be-set-up-at-voc-park/articleshow/87991508.cms||V Devanathan

Police said that the accused was not only sending messages on the mobile of the murdered girl for long, but was also harassing her mentally. “It was circumstantial evidence and the last messages delivered on the slain girl’s mobile that helped us zero in on Pawan Kumar Saroj,” said a senior cop associated with the investigations. He has been detained on the charge of killing the four members of the family in the trans-Ganga village. The bodies were found on the morning of November 25. He added that the accused was not cooperating in the investigation and also tried to mislead the police several times by drafting false stories over the incident. Cops have also noticed some injury marks on his body during the medical examination and are now compiling evidence to nab three to four more persons who might have assisted the prime accused in eliminating the family members on the fateful night. The accused kept on changing the names of his accomplices despite the fact some of his close relatives have escaped from their respective villages ever since police nabbed Pawan from his Tharwai village. The police are relying on call details and DNA profiling to nab the other accused. Police also made it clear that the persons who were named in the FIR by the kin of the deceased had nothing to do with the killings as per the investigations done so far. These persons against whom FIR was lodged by the kin of the deceased had a dispute with the brother of the deceased man. The prime accused even refused to have any link with the deceased girl and also denied sending even a single message to her. But when police showed his messages sent on the girl — name saved as ‘Gori Man’ — on mobile, the accused had no answer. Police investigations also claimed that the deceased girl was raped by one person as per forensic evidence and medical reports. Additional DG (Prayagraj zone) Prem Prakash said, “After scanning the WhatsApp chat of the accused made with the slain girl on November 21 evening and detailed investigation, police identified him as Pawan Kumar Saroj, a resident of Tharwai, who was sending messages to the slain girl on her mobile.” Police said Pawan has admitted that he had been chasing the girl for a long time but she was constantly ignoring him. After being irked over her behaviour, he claimed to have executed the crime. “Pawan was a jilted lover and wanted to teach a lesson to the girl,” police added. Earlier, a case was lodged against 11 persons under sections 147, 148, 149, 302, 376 (D) and 3/4 of POCSO Act and SC/ST Act regarding the incident. The killings became a major issue as political leaders of various parties, including Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Samajwadi Party attacked the government over the law and order situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/forensic-tests-to-be-done-on-prime-accused-in-phaphamau-killings/articleshow/87991501.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops crack down on cell use while driving||KOLKATA: As many as 470 of the 853 licenses temporarily suspended this month, which translates to around 55%, are those drivers and bikers who threw caution to the wind and kept moving even when on the phone. Around 255 other licences were cancelled for red-light violations and illegal lane-cutting. As many 128 licences have been suspended for drink-driving. The aim, said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha, was to discipline motorists, two-wheeler riders and all road users before December and January. Records show that these two months witness the maximum number of accidents on city roads. The crackdown on motorists who keep talking on the mobile follows the Supreme Court guidelines that harp on dangerous drivers, said Lalbazar sources. Earlier, phone-driving only led to a Rs 100 spot fine. But police on Monday indicated they would suspend licences as the message needs to be "loud and clear”. “The act in itself poses danger to others. Drivers of bus, minibus, auto, taxi and app-cabs — along with private car owners and bikers — will be kept under lens,” said Sinha. Senior officers said all traffic guards have been asked to continue with the standard operating procedure, whereby sections 218 (2) and 218 (3) of WB Motor Vehicles Rules will be invoked and licences suspended for three months. Around 56 licences were suspended this weekend alone, said a source. “Arrests will be made in cases where the act endangers the life of others or the violator is involved in multiple offences,” an officer said. Police will also be equally strict while dealing with red-light violations. Section 184 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, says police can arrest anyone if they feel he is driving too dangerously. This penal section can land one in prison for six months and attract a Rs 100 fine. But if the same offence is repeated within three years, the prison term will be for two years and the fine Rs 2,000.  Drivers of cars moving dangerously or speeding past when the traffic signal has turned amber can now also have their driving licence suspended for at least three months. “This provision for suspending the driving licence for at least three months has always been there. We have now decided to enforce it more extensively,” said an officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/cops-crack-down-on-cell-use-while-driving/articleshow/87990889.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The five medical stores are situated close to one another in the Nashik Road area near NMC’s Bytco Hospital. Police said they were investigating the case despite no official complaint being registered by the owners of the medical stores. Senior police inspector of Nashik Road police station Anil Shinde said a closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of the burglary went viral recently after which police began the investigation on their own. In the footage that went viral, three to four burglars can be seen entering a medical store and removing money from the cash counter. Shinde said that the incident took place a few days ago. “After the video went viral, we went to the owners of the stores concerned. However, since only change had got stolen from their shops they did not register an offence,” he said. Meanwhile, taking serious note of the incident, the police are investigating the case to check the criminals who are behind the theft. Of late a large number of thefts and burglaries are being reported in the city. This year, till October end, 146 cases of house break-ins have been registered with the city police, out of which only 32% cases have been detected.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/police-investigate-5-break-in-cases-reported-in-nashik-road/articleshow/87989191.cms||---

It reportedly took over possession of these sites recently. The clubs were given the properties on yearly licensing fees before Independence. “Now, we need these properties for carrying out remunerative and other development works. We cancelled the licence deed and asked them to give back possession of the land some time ago. When no concrete reply was received, the land and estate department filed a petition with the estate officer for getting the properties vacated and direction was given in favour of north corporation,” said a senior official. “An order was issued in this regard in September, while possession was taken in the beginning of November. The licensee took the matter to the district court, but no stay was issued. It took us around two years to get the matter resolved,” added the official. The corporation claimed there was a fourth club there and proceedings were on to take its possession. There are no plans to continue with the clubs or allow any recreational facilities in them. “We need the land for various purposes. The Public Works Department has asked us for land to widen the roads near Old Delhi Railway Station. We also need space to develop proper parking facilities to reduce congestion. Once we get all plots, a decision will be taken for their utilisation,”’ said the official. In the proposed budget estimates for FY 2022-23, the north corporation commissioner had mentioned the market price of these club sites was around Rs 200 crore. “We have sites in Karol Bagh and SP Mukherjee Market too, but these clubs were the prominent ones,” the official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/n-corpn-readies-plan-to-redevelop-areas-around-old-delhi-stn/articleshow/87991521.cms||Vibha Sharma

He said that the Gujarat government too has ratified this movement of AGP by the seventh pay commission. “As per the circular issued by the office of the Director of Technical Education, Gujarat, the verification of service books of 20 assistant professors of FTE by pay verification unit of the state government has been completed three months ago. But till date, they have not received the seventh pay commission benefits because of the lethargic attitude of university officers,” said Kahar, who along with other teachers, submitted a memorandum to MSU registrar K M Chudasama. Chudasama said that there is no delay on the part of the university. “There are a couple of teachers, whose stickers are awaited from the Director of Technical Education. Once we receive them, the faculty will finish the process and the teachers will start getting the benefits as per the new pay-scale,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/expedite-7th-pay-commission-benefits-for-technology-teachers/articleshow/87990890.cms||---

It was discussed that there will be a separate queue of passengers who arrive from At Risk countries and will have to mandatorily undergo an RTPCR test. These passengers will not be allowed to leave the city airport premises until their reports are out,” said a well-placed source at the airport. The arrivals area of the international terminal at SVPI airport already has some six counters for RT-PCR testing. Airport sources said that this will further be increased. The airport operator is also mulling over installing machines for conducting RT-LAMP tests – which is an equivalent of RT-PCR tests as approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “One can get the report with RT-LAMP tests within 30 minutes and this will help save upon a lot of time of passengers,” said a source. Passengers can opt for either RT-PCR or RT-LAMP test and are required to bear the cost of these tests upon arrival. While RT-PCR test would cost around Rs 400, the RT-LAMP test will cost Rs 2,700. State health department officials said that the medical staff would be increased to ensure wider and quicker coverage for the incoming passengers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/passengers-from-at-risk-countries-to-take-test/articleshow/87991532.cms||---

The convict has been identified as Chetan Shelke of Vinchur Dalvi in Sinnar taluka. “Judge B B Deshmukh of the special court, who held Shelke guilty of rape and pronounced the verdict, also slapped the convict with a fine of Rs 10,000,” informed assistant public prosecutor Deepshikha Bhide. The incident took place at Vinchur Dalvi in January 2018 when the survivor and two other girls had gone in the fields to graze goats. Shelke had offered chocolate to the other girls and then dragged the survivor to a desolate place and raped her. The girl did not speak about the incident to anyone. After few days, Shelke again approached the girl and tried to force himself on her. However, when the refused refused to give in, she was beaten by Shelkhe and the latter also threatened the three girls of dire consequences if they spoke about the incident to anyone. Soon after the thrashing, the rape survivor brought the incident to the notice of her parents following which an offence was registered and Shelke was arrested by Sinnar police. Bhide said during the course of hearing as many as nine witnesses were examined. On the basis of the statements of the complainant, witnesses and evidences submitted, the judge Deshmukh held Shelke guilty. He was also awarded one-year RI on charge of voluntarily causing hurt. The convict would serve both the sentences concurrently. “The accused was acquitted under Pocso as the birth certificate of the victim was not available following which the court held that the girl’s minority has not been proved. We also examined the head master of the school in which the victim was studying to prove that she was 16-years-old,” Bhide said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/sinnar-man-gets-10-yrs-ri-for-raping-girl/articleshow/87989207.cms||---

Though even some junior students returned in many private schools, a lot of children did not turn up for physical classes even after their parents agreeing to the reopening earlier. Many parents are now citing concern over the Omicron variant of novel coronavirus. However, in government schools, principals said it was encouraging to see students return. At The Indian School, students of classes VI to XI were called. Class IX and XI students had their practicals, so the attendance was fine. “In the middle section, the attendance was very low. Many parents who had given consent also did not send their children. Some of my teachers called and were told they wanted to be careful about the new variant of Covid,” said principal Tania Joshi. The school has decided to wait before calling junior students, she said. At Mount Abu Public School, Rohini, many junior students returned. People dressed in teddy bear suits welcomed children at the gate and visited classes teaching them about sanitisers and social distancing. “It was encouraging to have the children back. In our school, it was the first time that junior students returned after a gap of almost one and a half years. The attendance, however, was just around 30%,” said principal Jyoti Arora. In most schools, all students couldn’t be called due to the ongoing board exams of classes X and XII. At ITL Public Schools, Dwarka, just two sections of each class were called. “For junior classes, attendance was 40-45%. Hopefully, it will increase slowly. For the seniors, it was over 90%,” said principal Sudha Acharya. At Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8 in Rohini, the attendance ranged from 60% to 70% for classes nursery to XI. “Classes X and XII had major board exams. Otherwise, it was great to have the children back. They also said we should not close the school again as they are getting bored at home,” said principal A K Jha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/kids-back-after-pollution-pause-attendance-thin/articleshow/87991545.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The ward war rooms have been one of the biggest highlights of the civic body in its fight against the virus during the first and second Covid waves. While in the first wave, ward war rooms were struggling to help patients find beds, when the second wave hit Mumbai, they have become adept, be it calling up positive patients, allotting beds to symptomatic patients or sending an ambulance. A senior BMC official said that ward war rooms never shut down completely but their staff strength, which included doctors and teachers, had been brought down as there was not much work. “There were doctors to counsel patients, teachers to help trace positive patients and private data entry operators to list out the number of patients in every ward and also to follow up on their health condition. Over the last few months, there was no need felt for almost 20 of these and hence we brought down the numbers. All wards have now been instructed to augment the strength once again,” said the official, adding that staff are being used to trace patients.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmcs-war-rooms-gear-up-to-battle-omicron/articleshow/87991547.cms||Richa Pinto

Additional superintendent of police Chandrakant Khandvi said the officials of all police stations in Malegaon city have been instructed to serve notices to the owners or managers of cinema halls in their jurisdiction. On Sunday, Chhavani police arrested two youths, both 24-year-old, for bursting firecrackers during a movie screened inside a cinema theatre. At around 9 pm, the accused lit the firecrackers inside the cinema hall while a movie was being shown. The loud noise led to panic among other customers and created a sort of pandemonium inside the cinema hall. A senior police officer said the duo engaged in an activity despite having the knowledge that their act could lead to fire in the cinema hall that could destroy the building and also endanger lives of those watching the movie. “Such incidents have taken place in Malegaon earlier as well. On this backdrop we have issued notices to owners and managers of the cinema halls to deploy adequate security personnel for frisking people coming to cinema halls to watch movies,” Khandvi said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/police-issue-notices-to-cinema-halls-in-malegaon/articleshow/87989218.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Madurai||HC: Do not criminalise criticism by oppressed; hear and remedy it||Madurai: Madras high court has quashed a police case, registered against Tamil film director Pa Ranjith for his comments on caste system during King Rajaraja Chola’s era, saying when the voice of the oppressed is expressed by way of criticism, it should not be criminalised. Instead, it should be heard and remedied, the court said.Though Ranjith criticizing the Chola-era for the present day situation may not be proper, it does not exceed the limit and right that has been conferred upon him under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution. “It was not aimed at creating enmity between two groups of people,” said Justice G Ilangovan. Caste system, its formation, effects and ill-effects are one of the most discussed topics ever since its inception, he said and added: “History shows that what started to indicate the classification of people on the basis of profession or avocation became geneticized. This paved the way for the suppression of one group of the society consisting of landless poor making them as 'class' of themselves. The ill-effects of such a sort of classification were revolted by the people from the beginning.”The soul of the Constitution wants to heal the wounds of the oppressed by lifting them to the level of brotherhood, the judge. Unless the voice of the oppressed is heard and remedial measures are taken, the aim of social fraternity, which the preamble portion of the Constitution aims to achieve, will fail, he said.Pointing out that Ranjith, in his public speech, stated that the caste system had been stated to be introduced during the Chola era by referring to the works of historians, Justice Ilangovan said police cannot take actions against those historians for having made such comments."The main purpose of the history is to take lessons from the society of yesteryears for reforming the present day society. So, beyond that, going back to history and making the comments criticizing the erstwhile monarch and kings are not going to serve any purpose," observed the judge.Ranjith made the speech on casteism at a meeting organised by Neelapuligal Movement on June 5, 2019, and discussed casteism and land rights during King Rajaraja Chola period. A case was registered against him by the Thiruppananthal police.In defence, Ranjith said the crux of his speech was on how to erase casteism and how to create a casteless society. His speech was also about how the people in the delta region became landless. He said his intention was not to hurt the sentiment of any particular community, but was only to voice in favor of aggrieved people. Hence, he sought to quash the FIR registered against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/hc-do-not-criminalise-criticism-by-oppressed-hear-and-remedy-it/articleshow/87990897.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Jaipur||Jaipur doctors monitoring Omicron symptoms||JAIPUR: Doctors have informed the state government about Omicron variant’s features and the pace at which this Covid virus can spread. But, a lot of questions are being raised about the new variant’s clinical spectrum and its ability of escaping infection and vaccine-induced immunity. SMS Medical College is now focusing more on genome sequencing. “Omicron variant is more transmissible and infective. It is to be seen whether it escapes vaccine-induced immunity. Also, it also need to be ascertained whether mutation in Omicron has changed the clinical picture. In the first wave of Covid, cases were presented with different symptoms. In the second, thromboembolism and fibrosis was seen. So we need to closely monitor the clinical presentation of the new strain,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. WHO has labelled the new variant as “variant of concern”. However, no case of the new variant has been detected in the state yet, but doctors are cautious and analysing the behaviour of the virus which is spreading in South Africa. “Since it is highly transmissible and it can infect large number of population in very ahort time, there is a need to take all precautions. It is even more infectious than the Delta variant, which dominated the second wave in the state. People should continue using face masks, follow social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS Hospital. Ministry of health has revised the guidelines for international arrivals on Novermber 28. The updated guidelines require all travellers (irrespective of Covid vaccination status) coming to India from countries identified as‘countries at-risk’ to mandatorily undergo post-arrival Covid testing at airports on arrival in addition to pre-departure Covid testing undertaken 72hours before departure. For passengers found positive in these tests, they will be isolated and treated as per the clinical management protocol besides their samples also taken for whole genome sequencing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/docs-watchful-on-clinical-spectrum-of-omicron/articleshow/87990909.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Sure that Punjab Lok Congress, allies will form next govt: Captain Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Former Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh threw down the gauntlet to Congress on Monday, saying he was confident his newly-floated Punjab Lok Congress and its allies would form the next state government in 2022 with a little help from BJP through seat-sharing. Amarinder, who had met Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Chandigarh earlier in the day, denied the interaction had anything to do with his political strategy. “It was purely a courtesy meeting. I had spoken to him a couple of times over the phone, and told him that I will meet him whenever he is free. No political development. I had a nice cup of coffee with the chief minister,” he said. On whether he had initiated a seat-sharing arrangement with BJP yet, Amarinder said that he would meet the party’s central leadership whenever he visited Delhi next. “We are expecting to get the symbol (from the Election Commission) in the next few days. It takes about three weeks to register a party, and it has been three weeks (since he applied for it). The membership drive started about 10 days ago and is doing well. People are very upbeat. God willing, we, along with our allies, seat adjustments with BJP and (a tie-up with) Mr (Sukhdev Singh) Dhindsa’s party (SAD Sanyukt), will form the next government,” he said. The former Congress veteran wouldn’t say if some prominent names in Punjab politics were already lining up to join his party. “Wait for the time,” he said. Amarinder, for whom the new farm laws were the main hurdle to forging an understanding with BJP, said the topic was now buried as the central government had repealed the three contentious pieces of legislation and agreed to look into six-seven other issues raised by farmers. “When the government of India says so, both Punjab and Haryana will look into withdrawing the police cases against farmers,” he said of one of their primary demands. Amarinder also tweeted, “Congratulations to all our farmers as the central government has formally repealed the three farm laws in both houses of Parliament on Monday. I a, confident that the government will sympathetically look into the pending demands of our farmers.” On the show-cause notice issued by Congress to his wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, Amarinder said, “That is up to her to do (reply).” He maintained that it was beyond him to comprehend the actions of state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was the trigger for his quitting the party. “He says something in the morning and something else in the evening. How do I react?” Haryana Congress functionaries Randeep Surjewala and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that Amarinder’s meeting with Khattar was his business. “It is his wish. He is not part of us,” Surjewala said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sure-that-punjab-lok-congress-allies-will-form-next-govt-captain-amarinder-singh/articleshow/87992902.cms||---

The officials are accepting nomination forms filed by candidates contesting in various categories of elections that will be held for formation of the new senate body. But they have suspended the scrutiny process citing a general circular sent by Gujarat government which states that it should be consulted for all important decisions. A group of senate members along with a couple of candidates on Monday sent a legal notice to MSU chancellor, vice-chancellor and registrar questioning their move of approaching the state government. “The process of scrutiny has been stopped under the pretext that the university has to take guidance and approval from the state government. But as per MSU Act 1949, there is no requirement/ rule of seeking permission of the state for conducting senate elections,” said senate member Narendra Ravat. In the past there have been several incidents where people have challenged and asked for delay/ cancellation of elections in court. But they were not entertained under the same clause that once the election procedure has started it cannot be stopped, the memorandum submitted to MSU registrar K M Chudasama states. “The orders, passed by the registrar to stop scrutiny/ election procedure for approval of the state government, are illegal and against the provisions of MSU Act,” said Ravat. Chudasama said that the university has sent details of the election schedule, ordinances and processes to the state government. “Since scrutiny is part of a decision-making process, we have sought the state government’s directive. Once we get any directive, it will be conveyed to all the stakeholders,” he said. Ironically, the state government’s general circular does not talk about the election process. It has asked all the universities to seek approval regarding major decisions related to finance, recruitments, investment apart from nominations to senate/ syndicate bodies and “similar such” decisions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/msu-officials-draw-flak-for-suspending-scrutiny-process/articleshow/87990875.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Colour coded tokens for city bound trucks||Kolkata: City-bound trucks will now need a destination-specific colour coded token to enter the city. Transport minister Firhad Hakim on Monday met police officers and gave sanction to the idea of issuing tokens for Kolkata Port-bound trucks. They are top priority vehicles and need clear and unhindered passage to the port area, to and fro. There were concerns over congestion and accidents in port areas. Police have already carried out a survey to identify blind spots on city roads. “We put emphasis on regulating truck movement in the city. Besides causing congestion, they also hugely contribute to pollution of the city’s ambient air,” said Hakim. The port area attracts 700-800 trucks daily. Trucks that trudge through Garden Reach Circular Road, Kidderpore Road, Hastings and Vidyasagar Setu, cause traffic snarls and pollution. The transport department has asked port authorities to start RoRo (roll on, roll off) ferry services to facilitate movement of trucks by avoiding city traffic, Hakim said. “The restriction on heavy vehicular movements into and out of the port during day time has severely impacted cargo shipments through Kolkata Port," said a port official. If the restriction is not removed, it would have a serious impact on port operations as terminal/vessel operations will be badly affected with imports piling up inside the port leading to congestion, said a spokesman for the Container Shipping Lines Association, a group representing container lines operating in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/colour-coded-tokens-for-city-bound-trucks/articleshow/87990934.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

We get important information on which we have acted on time. I get a lot of such messages seeking leave every day in WhatsApp and Twitter. Some are from students who even ask declaration of leave for a part of the day so that they can watch the first show of their favourite star’s movie. I don’t respond to such messages,” Virudhunagar collector told TOI.“Holidays are declared depending on the weather forecast for the coming day or days by the state disaster management authority and feedback from the chief education officer on water stagnation in institutions and from the revenue department on damages caused to the roads connecting the institutions,” Tuticorin district collector K Senthil Raj said and added that decisions on the same are not made merely based on requests by students or the public.Another district collector in the region who did not want to be named said that he used to be flooded with WhatsApp messages and SMS asking if there is a holiday or asking for one to be declared. “We should engage in healthy conversations such as getting alerts from people in distress,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/collectors-reply-to-requests-in-social-media-with-humour/articleshow/87990914.cms||M K Ananth

Out of the 50% of the 8,000 quintal onions auctioned on Monday were fresh late kharif onions. An APMC official said kharif onion crops were badly hit due to rains in September. The arrival of kharif onions began from mid-October, but it was delayed by a month due to rains. “The supply of fresh late kharif onions started around a few weeks ago, but in low quantity — around 5% of the total arrivals. But the arrivals have now increased drastically in the past two-three working days,” the official said. “The supply of fresh onions is expected to increase at Lasalgaon during the next couple of weeks. The shelf life of late kharif onions is less than a month. Hence, farmers have no option but to sell the produce at the prevailing market rates,” he added. “Around 40% of the summer onions arriving in the market are of poor and medium quality that has led to drop in average wholesale prices of summer onions,” the official pointed out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/arrival-of-fresh-late-kharif-onions-increases/articleshow/87989235.cms||Tushar Pawar

He said that they were insisting on the use of the PM’s picture alongside the CM’s picture as the people should know that those schemes have the participation of the Centre.The BJP leader added that their demand was only based on a GO issued by the public (general I) department in 1990 which said pictures of nine leaders, including the PM, may be displayed in public offices.“The pictures of the CM, and not those of the PM, are used even on central government schemes that are implemented in the state,” he said.“We will wait for 15 days for the Madurai district collector to act on our petition and will file a public interest litigation before the Madras high court seeking fulfilment of our just demand,” Saravanan added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/bjp-wants-modis-pictures-in-all-state-govt-offices-schemes/articleshow/87990923.cms||---

The resident doctors of government’s RNT Medical College in Udaipur are protesting against the delay in NEET PG-2021 counselling. The resident doctors went on strike on Monday resulting in long queues of patients outside the OPDs. The already admitted patients too had to suffer because of the non-availability of doctors. The senior doctors and specialists took charge and tried their best to provide relief to the patients. Out of the 260 resident doctors, 250 are on strike. The scheduled surgeries in many wards had to be postponed because of the strike. Many patients, in absence of proper treatment, were shifted to private hospitals by their relatives. According to Dr Navratna Shrama, president, Udaipur Resident Doctors’ Association (URDA), their demand is that the NEET PG-2021 counselling should be expedited. Because of the pandemic, the admission to various courses under NEET PG-2021 has been delayed. The resident doctors are facing a lot of problems in the hospital. For more than eighteen months, the work of around 400 resident doctors is on the shoulders of 260 resident doctors.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/patients-left-in-the-lurch-as-resident-docs-go-on-strike-in-udaipur/articleshow/87990949.cms||---

But with a few exceptions, Gujarat airports do not require domestic arrivals to either carry the negative RT-PCR report or be fully vaccinated. Surat and Kandla airports have made it mandatory for incoming passengers to carry the negative RT-PCR report with the test taken within 72 hours of travel. But no such stipulation has been imposed on passengers arriving in Ahmedabad, not even on those from certain states. The state government has done away with the mandatory RT-PCR testing requirements since May 8, 2021. According to the latest state-wise guidelines of the Airports Authority of India, there is no requirement to check the vaccination certificate nor the negative RT-PCR report upon arrival in Ahmedabad, Bhuj, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Rajkot, and Vadodara. In another major city of Gujarat, Surat, incoming passengers are required to submit a negative RT-PCR report of their Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of their flight. A similar regulation is implemented at the industrial hub of Kandla as well, albeit only for passengers from Maharashtra. The state has all the rules in place for international passengers. They include submitting a self-declaration form, conducting the RT-PCR test on arrival, and uploading of the negative RT-PCR report of a test taken 72 hours prior to flying. But no such rules have been set for domestic travellers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/no-covid-checks-for-domestic-fliers/articleshow/87991581.cms||Niyati Parikh

Praising the police for effective working during the two waves of Covid, the DGP said policemen should not be harsh but ensure that people follow Covid protocol. He was addressing police after felicitating eight IPS and 10 RPS officers among 66 policemen for exemplary work. “We will have to be more vigilant as we are witnessing a rise in Covid cases. As the new variant is dangerous, we should ensure that people follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” Lathar said. He added that cases triggered by the Omicron variant were gradually rising. “The way we worked during the two waves was appreciated by the public. So, it is high time we should again be cautious and vigilant. It is a big responsibility on your shoulders and I hope you will do whatever required in ensuring infection does not rise,” he said. At the function, eight IPS officers including additional DGP Sanjiv Kumar Narjari, IG (Intelligence) Rupinder Singh, DIG (personnel) Gaurav Srivastav, additional commissioner-II Haider Ali Zaidi were given DGP disc.

---||Kolkata||RBI Museum a repository of history for visitors||Kolkata: Did you know that the first governor of the Reserve Bank of India's office was in Dalhousie? Or that Bengali cinema superstar Uttam Kumar worked as a cash clerk at Kolkata Port Trust? These are among the nuggets of history that visitors to the RBI Museum at 8 Council House Street and the Kolkata Port Maritime Heritage Centre at the Fairlie Warehouse on 6 Strand Road got to know during a visit to various industrial heritage museums in the city. The walk was organised by Bespoke Art Unique Legacies (BAUL), an organisation that organises unique heritage tours and awareness programmes on the city’s heritage buildings. The KoPT Maritime Heritage Centre housed in one of the four red brick warehouses (the Strand Warehouse was destroyed by fire in February 2010) built between 1901 and 1903 has artefacts, memorabilia, archival material and navigational items that date back to the late 18th century including how huge tracts of land in the city of Kolkata were vested with KoPT. "Kolkata Port may not be hogging the limelight today but it was the key to Kolkata emerging as a metropolis. The museum has inspection log books on the Southern lighthouse at the confluence of the river and the sea that are dated around the 1770s,” KoPT advisor and heritage researcher Gautam Chakraborty said. Matinee idol Uttam Kumar worked at the Kolkata Port Trust from 1946-47 till the release of the 1952 movie ‘Basu Paribar’. Less than a kilometre away is another red brick building on Council House Street that was constructed in 1892 and functioned as the Alliance Bank of Simla before Reserve Bank of India was set up in 1935 and took the building on lease to serve as its headquarter. Two years later, the bank was shifted to Mumbai. “The first RBI governor Osborne Smith sat in this building. We inaugurated the RBI Museum in 2019. But unfortunately, not many have been able to view the panels and research materials owing to Covid restrictions,” said RBI Kolkata general manager and museum in-charge Suddhoswatto Ghosh. The museum houses a replica of the RBI’s gold vault in Nagpur and various locks to bank vaults that have evolved over the years. There are also currencies like a trillion dollar bank note from Zimbabwe that was hit by hyper-inflation. “We are going to expand the museum in the second half of 2022. Among other things, we plan to display printing press machinery,” Ghosh added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/rbi-museum-a-repository-of-history-for-visitors/articleshow/87990968.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Govt resident doctors strike work for a day||Ahmedabad: On Monday, resident doctors from several medical schools in Gujarat went on strike for a day to protest the postponement of NEET-PG counselling, stating that the delay in admission resulted in severe scarcity of doctors, increasing the pressure on junior doctors. Hundreds of professors and lecturers from different government and GMERS-run medical institutions staged rallies around the state over long-standing demands, including payment of arrears in accordance with the seventh pay commission's recommendations. The Centre has postponed NEET-PG 2021 counselling till January next year due to a number of issues. Striking doctors have claimed that in the absence of a new PG batch, only 66 per cent resident doctors are available to attend to patients. “This puts extra pressure on the resident doctors, who are already fatigued by long hours of COVID-19 duties," JDA president Dr Vishwajeet Raj said. Meanwhile, hundreds of professors and lecturers affiliated to the Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA) and three other similar bodies in the state gathered outside various medical colleges in the state to register their protest over some of their long-pending demands. Govt rolls back vacation for docs The state government has cancelled the Diwali vacation for professors at medical college and have asked them to report to duty in a day or two. Usually a section of professors are allowed to vacation for 17 days till November 15 as apart of their Diwali holidays, while the next batch of professors go on leave till December 2. Owing to the strike the medical professors have been asked to report to duty with immediate effect. A letter in the regard was issued by dean, BJ Medical College.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/govt-resident-doctors-strike-work-for-a-day/articleshow/87991613.cms||---

The decision to shift the venue of the session from Nagpur to Mumbai was taken in the business advisory committee meeting held on Monday considering the health of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The CM had undergone a spine surgery earlier this month and has been advised against air travel. Parab said keeping in mind concerns raised over the Omicron variant, it has been decided that only fully vaccinated people will be allowed inside Vidhan Bhavan and that too with a negative RT-PCR report. “The CM will be present during the winter session,” said Parab. Meanwhile, Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis expressed his annoyance at the government restricting the winter session to five days. At the business advisory committee meeting on Monday, Fadnavis said he asked the government to take a break around New Year and then extend the session by a week in the first week of January. “The government said it would hold another meeting of the BAC to consider it on December 24. It’s been two years and the government is running away from holding a proper session. This is nothing but suppression of democracy,” he said. Parab said 12 bills will be introduced.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-winter-session-of-legislature-in-city-due-to-cms-health/articleshow/87991587.cms||---

In a series of tweets, Sidhu said, “Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones at others. Kejriwal ji, you talk of women empowerment, jobs and teachers. However, you don’t have one woman minister in your cabinet. How many women in Delhi get 1000 despite the revenue surplus left by (ex-CM) Sheila Dikshit ji!” “In your 2015 manifesto, you promised eight lakh new jobs and 20 new colleges in Delhi. Where are the jobs and colleges? On the contrary of your failed guarantees, the unemployment rate of Delhi has increased by almost five times in the last five years,” he added. He said women empowerment meant mandatorily engaging women in every step of the electoral process, like Congress was doing in Punjab.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sidhu-takes-on-kejriwal-over-poll-promises-guarantees/articleshow/87992938.cms||---
---||Goa||Visa uncertainty defers charters to Goa, omicron adds to woes||PANAJI: As India isn’t issuing e-visas to tourists from the UK and Kazakhstan, charter arrivals from the two countries have been deferred. The first from Kazakhstan may arrive on December 15, while UK’s Tui Airways has scheduled its first flight on December 23. “Also, for the first time, Air Astana, Kazakhstan’s national carrier, will fly charters to Goa. In the past Goa used to get one charter a week from the country, but this time, we will see three, bringing in 500 travellers,” said Anupam Kumar, director, Caper India, which will handle these flights. He added that the flights will arrive on Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. While operators are facing cancellations due to non-issuance of e-visas, a fresh threat — the omicron variant — has kept them on tenterhooks. A tour operator said that Tui Airways shifted dates as the carrier was unable to get bookings, with delays in issuing visas and e-visas not being issued. “The first flight from the UK will likely land on December 23 if the situation does not change much,” the operator said. Travellers who were keen to holiday are either deferring their plans or cancelling bookings over their visas. Vice-president of Minar Travels Abida Kumar said there’s so much uncertainty, nothing can be said till a flight lands, although slots have been booked. Over the past few days, she said she has seen cancellations of bookings. “Only when a charter lands, we can say tourists have arrived,” she said. Another operator said that countries are compelled to tighten travel guidelines due to omicron. Though things looked good a month ago, unless there’s clarity on how dangerous and infectious the new variant is, travellers will likely put off their plans, he said. Meanwhile, even as Goa is slated to receive the first Russian charter on December 30, the operator said he would choose to wait and watch the situation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/visa-uncertainty-defers-charters-to-goa-omicron-adds-to-woes/articleshow/87991596.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Madurai||Pvt schools tell govt not to choke them with new restrictions||Madurai: Urging the government not to choke them with restrictions especially as schools are still recovering financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic setback, the Federation of Private Schools Association (FePSA) has threatened a state-wide strike by closing the schools in January if their various demands are not met.State president of FePSA, M Arumugam, said that the government has made minimum land requirement mandatory for private primary and nursery schools despite only minimum building requirement being needed previously. “This has come as a shock to us as establishing a nursery and primary school will now need land requirement that is equal to a matriculation school. We also don’t know what will happen to existing schools. As per the Tamil Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Act, 1973, no minimum land requirement for nursery and primary schools is needed. Why is it being changed now unnecessarily,” he said.It was also pointed out that directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) approval not being required for buildings built after January 2011 as per a court verdict has not been implemented with a GO.The association also rued the fact that there is now no permanent recognition given for private schools even if it gets its recognition renewed for more than 10 years. “All this shows that the rights of private schools are being attacked and taken away. Even the state government’s decision to provide 7.5% quota only for government school students is affecting us badly as parents are turning to government schools,” said Arumugam. The other demands of the association include providing reimbursement for RTE admissions in two instalments by the government, failing which an interest of 1% is levied every month. It also demanded for primary schools to be upgraded to middle schools under the RTE Act, which is being followed in other states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/pvt-schools-tell-govt-not-to-choke-them-with-new-restrictions/articleshow/87990967.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai must wait a week to know if Omicron is here||MUMBAI: It will take another five to seven days to know if the Omicron variant is present in Mumbai as the BMC prepares for its sixth genome sequencing exercise. At present, only one traveller—an engineer from Dombivli—who reached the Mumbai airport on November 24 has tested positive for Covid. His samples were taken to the BMC’s genome laboratory located in Kasturba Hospital, near Saat Raasta, on Monday morning. The BMC has reached out to and tested 100 others who landed in the city in the past 15 days from countries where the new Omicron variant has been detected. None of them are Covid-positive, said officials. Another 400 who landed at Mumbai airport from these countries in the past fortnight live outside city limits or in other districts. The BMC tests 300 to 350 samples in every sequencing cycle at its Kasturba lab. “We already have 200 Covid-positive samples collected as per our routine protocol from hospitals and airport,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC will collect another 100-150 samples in the next 24 to 48 hours before beginning the sequencing, which will take over three days to be completed. “We may have answers only by the weekend or Monday,’’ he said. Ever since the BMC lab was set up in August, five sequencing exercises have been carried out and each showed that the Delta variant, which caused the second wave between March and June, was the dominant one. When the Delta variant was detected in Vidharba, the second wave was already at its peak; the variant had spread across the state and country by April. While inaugurating the Kasturba genome lab on August 4, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said if the Delta variant had been traced earlier in Maharashtra, its spread could have been checked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-city-must-wait-a-week-to-know-if-omicron-is-here/articleshow/87991608.cms||---

The guidelines also allow open-to-sky spaces to operate at 25% capacity. The PMC’s order is divergent from a decision announced at the Covid-19 review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar of allowing theatres and auditoriums to function at 100% capacity from December 1. After assessing the local situation, Pawar, who is also Pune’s guardian minister, had favoured to do away with 50% operational curbs on cinema halls and theatres from December 1. The meeting was held on November 27, however, on the same day the state government had issued an order allowing enclosed spaces such as theatres to operate at 50% capacity. In case of open-to-sky spaces, for any events or gatherings, people up to 25% of the space capacity will be allowed. The PMC through its order issued on Monday, however, has continued to go ahead with state government’s guidelines. The PMC’s order stated it will also be applicable in the limits of Pune and Khadki Cantonment boards till further orders are issued. The government’s guidelines also stressed on adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. All public transport shall be used only by fully vaccinated persons. Any shop, establishment, mall, event, gathering, where a member of public has the right to come and get services, must be manned by fully vaccinated persons and all visitors, customers to such places should be fully vaccinated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pmc-to-follow-50-capacity-rule-for-theatres/articleshow/87991597.cms||---

With an air quality index (AQI) of 389, on a scale of 0 to 500, the national capital was the third most polluted city in the country after Gurgaon and Motihari. According to the monitoring agencies, the air quality may improve within “very poor” category over the next two days. On Monday, AQI remained “severe” in the morning hours. However as the wind speed picked up during the afternoon to 10-15kmph, the region received some ventilation. But the air quality in some areas like RK Puram, JLN Stadium, Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri and Mundka remained “severe”. The weather conditions may turn in the city’s favour as India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted rain in the city due to two upcoming western disturbances. Over this week, IMD expects that the rain may flush more pollutants out. Track the pollution level in your city“Delhi-NCR is likely to experience significant changes in wind and weather conditions during the next one week. Two consecutive active western disturbances are likely to affect weather over Delhi region from December 1 to 3, and then from December 5 to 7,” said R K Jenamani, IMD’s senior weather scientist. “There is a possibility of light rain or drizzle on December 2 and the winds are likely to be easterly and around 10-15kmph. Then there will be rain again between December 5 and 7 with even stronger winds.” He added that the minimum temperature was likely to fall from December 8-9 when the winds changed back to westerly. On Monday, the mercury dropped slightly with a minimum temperature of 10.3 degrees Celsius as against Sunday’s 10.8. According to Skymet, however, the air quality will see significant improvement only after December 6. “The best improvement could possibly happen towards December 6 when Delhi may receive moderate rainfall,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of climate change and meteorology at Skymet. Meanwhile, the volume of particle pollutants in Delhi’s air remained well above the safe limit as PM2.5 oscillated between 196.7 and 227.2 micrograms per cubic metres, according to Central Pollution Control Board. This was over three time the safe limit as per national standards. Monday saw only 2% contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5. According to SAFAR, AQI may improve slightly but will remain within the upper end of “very poor” in the next few days. Meanwhile, experts cautioned stating that a “very poor” AQI was not a significant improvement and posed health risks. “Very poor air quality is not a sign of relief, it poses health risks. Upon prolonged exposure, it may as well cause respiratory illness to anyone, especially those with heart or lungs conditions,” said Shambhavi Shukla, deputy project manager of air pollution at Centre for Science and Environment.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/smoke-without-fire-aqi-very-poor/articleshow/87991598.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rain predicted for today, chill sets in at 20 degrees||MUMBAI: The week began for the city with minimum temperatures dipping to 20 degrees. However, weather bureau officials said that the pleasant weather conditions are short-lived and a spike in temperatures can be expected again due to a low pressure area which is likely to form over East central Arabian sea, off Maharashtra coast, around Wednesday. The rain is also expected to be back as thunderstorms with lightning, light to moderate rain and gusty winds at isolated places, have been forecast for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar on November 30, December 1 & 2. On Monday, IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded minimum temperatures of 20 degrees while the Colaba observatory recorded minimum temperature of 22.6 degrees. This was a relief from the 25 degrees recorded last week. Mansi Jain, a Ghatkopar resident, said that it was extremely hot till last week while mornings from the last few days have been very pleasant. “The difference in weather conditions was very evident while I was on my morning jog,” she said. Weather officials, however, said that with south easterly winds expected, a 1-2 degree rise in temperature can be expected. “This is owing to a low pressure area which is likely to form over the East central Arabian sea off Maharashtra coast around December 1. Currently, a trough at mean sea level runs from Southeast Arabian Sea to east central Arabian sea off Karnataka coast,” said an IMD official. The pleasant weather conditions have also brought down high levels of relative humidity that were causing much discomfort to Mumbaikars. As on Monday the relative humidity recorded at the Colaba observatory was 50% and at the Santacruz observatory was 41%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-rain-predicted-for-today-chill-sets-in-at-20-degrees/articleshow/87992527.cms||Richa Pinto

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has written to official liquidators of 11 defunct mills along with their tax dues for these 16 properties. These mills had closed 25 to 30 years ago and the AMC has been raising tax bills every year. Prominent on the list are Calico Mills Ltd, established by the Sarabhai family in 1888, which shut in 1998. Calico owes AMC Rs 50.76 crore. Calico Mills is owned by Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Printing. “We approached the official liquidators of these mills and requested them to consider our tax demand. Based on the list provided by the official liquidators, we have issued recovery demands amounting to Rs 149 crore,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee. “Whenever large companies that have properties such as mill compounds or factories go into liquidation and are sold, the official liquidator has to calculate the due taxes and pay them,” Vakil said. The revenue department’s pending tax claims include Rs 50.76 crore from Calico Mills, Rs 18.5 crore from Aryodaya Spinning and Weaving Mills owned by Sheth Mangaldas & Brothers, Rs 33.16 lakh from Arodaya Ginning Mills, Rs 30.18 crore from Amruta Mills, Rs 23.56 crore from Jubilee Mills, Rs 28.80 crore from The Commercial Ahmedabad Mills Co Ltd, Rs 40.62 crore from Star of Gujarat Textile Mills Ltd and Rs 10.59 crore from New Gujarat Synthetic among others.

During a workshop on Monday, the officers of the department were made aware of the usefulness of RAMS. Chief engineer Sanjeev Mathur said the purpose of RAMS was to store inventory of roads and bridges, information about their condition and to estimate the need for maintenance and budget requirements. A mobile app has also been created to facilitate various inputs. “The annual maintenance plan and multi-year plan of PWD will be prepared by RAMS. Apart from this, property lists can be used to get information related to current and future road condition, traffic, details of works done and proposed. This system will provide a systematic approach for planning maintenance of roads and bridges. This will also ensure better utilisation of public funds,” an official statement read. Secretary of the department Chinn Hari Meena informed that RAMS was capable of selecting roads for maintenance and making priority lists for any budget. “It is also capable of predicting the budget requirement for maintaining different categories of roads,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/gis-enabled-system-developed-for-management-of-states-road-network/articleshow/87990973.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Trichy||After 16 years, Trichy city flooded||Trichy: After 2005, Trichy was on the brink of a flood on Monday as several neighbourhoods in the western parts of the city were submerged. Though the city and the suburbs did not witness major rainfall in the past 48 hours, surplus rainwater from neighbouring Karur, Dindigul and Pudukottai districts flowing through the city to merge with the Cauvery marooned hundreds of houses and affected traffic on the highways.While surplus water in Ariyar inundated parts of Dheeran Nagar, Pirattiyur, the overflowing Kodingal river flooded hundreds of houses on Kuzhumani Road. The Kudamurutti river that collects water from Korayar and Ariyar flooded Vayalur road neighbourhoods. The Ariyar river that collects surplus water from the Dindigul district breached on Punganur near Srirangam, causing inundation on Trichy-Dindigul NH near Pirattiyur. Anticipating a breach on the Kudamurutti river, the PWD strengthened the banks at Thyagaraja Nagar near the Vekkaliamman temple in Woraiyur. Residents who were hesitating to move out of the houses panicked as the water level increased from knee level to hip level overnight, forcing them to find refuge in their relative’s houses. Inundation on the arterial roads brought the Monday morning traffic to a standstill even as dry weather prevailed in the city. “In the 2005 floods, rainfall added to the woes. We are fortunate to have dry weather. Residents spent the night worrying as water level was gradually increasing,” M Sivakumar, president, Lingam Nagar residents’ welfare association, said. On Monday, the PWD had diverted the entire quantum of incoming water from the Mettur dam to the Kollidam river, the flood carrier. No water was released into the Cauvery. “Rainfall has subsided in the catchment areas. We expect the overflow of water in the rivers to return to normalcy by Tuesday morning. All the flood drains passing through the city swelled simultaneously, causing the trouble,” a source with the PWD said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/after-16-years-trichy-city-flooded/articleshow/87990974.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Ahmedabad||HC orders action against highrises sans fire NOC||Ahmedabad: Citing the fire accidents that occurred in the city on Sunday, the Gujarat high court on Monday ordered the state and civic authorities to take immediate and strict actions against the highrises which lack either valid building use permission or wanting in installation of proper fire-safety prevention systems. The court said that the authorities should demolish a couple of buildings to set an example, for it is better to put people out of their houses than watching them charred to death. The judges said that prevention is better than cure and the court does not want to cause inconvenience to any residents, but “any tears shed subsequent to untoward incident occurring would be of no avail as much as the precious life cannot be brought back”. It further said, “It would be apt and appropriate for authorities to take immediate steps against highrise buildings where fire engines, equipment or personnel do not have access to put down the fire.” The court was all for drastic steps including sealing of the upper floors and hoped that the authorities would leave no stone unturned. “It is high time that authorities take immediate steps at least in respect of high-rise for lacking fire NOC or BU permission in the state. Those buildings which are contrary to building bye laws or without approved building plans, drastic steps including sealing of such buildings would be a succour in saving precious lives,” it said. During the hearing of a PIL demanding proper implementation of fire safety rules after eight Covid-19 patients died in Shrey Hospital last year, petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal cited news reports about the fire incidents and how firefighters found it difficult to get into a highrise for rescue operations. He demanded drastic actions against defaulters. After hearing the petitioner, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri raised several questions to the state authorities. They said that the GDCR empowers authority to take action against unauthorised or unsafe buildings. As the government and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) continued to seek more time to implement the BU permission rules and asserted that they are enforcing Fire Safety Act on priority, the court made it clear that BU permission is omnibus and the court was concerned with the highrise buildings and the authorities should deal with the highrises on priority basis for implementation of BU permission. When the resistance continued on part of immediate implementation of BU permission on the ground that there are 93 lakh buildings and the exercise is not possible, the court questioned the authorities how many buildings have been demolished till date. It said after a month the government can inform the court how many buildings are compliant to the rules. The court also said that it knows that not even a brick would be removed. The court has posted further hearing on December 23 and sought action taken report as well as details on total number of high-rise buildings across the state and their status.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-action-against-highrises-sans-fire-noc/articleshow/87991605.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai: Rain, water released from Vaigai dam flood Thanakkankulam, SRV Nagar||MADURAI: The rains that have been pounding the district for the last month coupled with water released from the Vaigai dam have left residents of Mullai Nagar in Thanakkankulam and SRV Nagar in Thirupparankundram inundated in water up to 3-4 feet. Residents said that desilting of the Koothiyarkundu kanmoi was the only permanent solution to prevent such flooding. “I have been residing in Mullai Nagar for more than 40 years. Usually, water enters the area during heavy rains but release of water from Vaigai dam happens once in 3-5 years only. Even last year, though there was water entering, the level was not this high. If the rain and water release continues further, the area will submerge soon,” said K Muralidharan, a resident. He added that residents have to wade through the water to reach the main road to access drinking water and that there is also fear of snakes and insects in the water. There are around 500 houses in Mullai Nagar. “Residents who live in front of Mullai Nagar fare slightly better, but for those living in interior areas it is very difficult to wade through so much water. While water has entered the southern part of Mullai Nagar, water is being carried through a stream the northern side leading to flooding. The rain has to ease and even then, it can likely take up to two months for the water to clear,” said Guna Sudha, a ward member of Thanakkankulam panchayat. She added that desilting of the Koothiyarkundu kanmoi was the only permanent solution for the residents, otherwise the same crisis would repeat every year. Similarly, in SRV Nagar, water has entered the residential area due to overflow from the nearby kanmoi. VOC Street is the last street in the area with 13 sub-streets and around 80 families residing. “This street acts as a direct connecting link from the kanmoi. Previously, surplus water used to be used for agricultural field work. However, every year, during rains, water is stopped on one side of the kanmoi to stop it from entering the fields in excess and naturally the road gets inundated and water enters the residential area leading to flooding,” said B Rajasekar, secretary, ward 96 VOC Street Residents’ Welfare Association. He added that despite repeatedly raising the issue with corporation officials and Thirupparankundram MLA V V Rajan Chellappa, no proper action has been taken to lay a proper road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/rain-water-released-from-vaigai-dam-flood-thanakkankulam-srv-nagar/articleshow/87990971.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Delhi||Rs 5,000 aid to workers as construction to stay on hold: Gopal Rai||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai said the Delhi government will give financial aid of Rs 5,000 each to workers as construction activities will remain banned till further orders.  The ban on entry of non-essential trucks, except electric and CNG trucks, has been extended till December 7. In the ongoing campaign against open burning of biomass, a total fine of about Rs 28.7 lakh has been imposed so far on violators. TimesViewMost construction workers are daily wagers. Such bans stop their earnings, often forcing them to consider leaving the city. Hopefully this step will lessen the degree of their suffering, stop them from leaving.Rai, who conducted a meeting with various departments to review pollution, said, “All construction and demolition work in Delhi will be banned till further orders. Under this, electrical work, interior decoration, plumbing and carpentry can continue. All construction workers will be given a compensation of Rs 5,000.” The environment minister added that entry of goods trucks in Delhi is banned till December 7. CNG and electric trucks are exempt from this ban. Talking about the campaign against open burning, Rai said 8,480 sites have been inspected and violations were found at around 1,000 places. The violating agencies, organisations and individuals have been fined about Rs 28.7 lakh so far. However, the second phase of the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign, which was scheduled to end on December 3, has been extended. The third phase of the campaign will start on December 4 and will continue till December 18. As schools, colleges and institutes have reopened in Delhi and the work-from-home directives for government offices have also been lifted from Monday, Rai said they have started a special bus service for colonies where government employees live in huge numbers. There are 14 such major colonies — Gulabi Bagh, Mayur Vihar Phase-2, Motia Khan, Shalimar Bagh Block-A, Timarpur, Hari Nagar, Sector-3 Dwarka, Nimri Colony, Ashok Vihar, Sector-11 Rohini, Karkardooma, Model Town Phase One, Vikaspuri, Paschim Vihar and Vasant Kunj. “The bus will leave from these colonies around 8.30 am to go to the Secretariat and will return from there around 5-5:30 pm. This will help them to come to their offices and reduce vehicular pollution at the same time,” said Rai. Commenting on steps taken to reduce vehicular pollution, he said 18 lakh PUC certificates were issued in October and November. Around 14,000 people have been fined Rs 10,000 each in the past two months for not having PUC and violation of other norms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/rs-5k-aid-to-workers-as-construction-to-stay-on-hold-rai/articleshow/87991638.cms||---

The woman is seen wearing a red palazzo suit and striking different poses with her back towards the gurdwara. The photographs also carried a caption offering 50% off on women’s clothing. Reacting to the incident, Hartej hospital managing director HS Nagpal said “This is a gross violation of maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct). Keeping in view the religious sentiments of Sikhs, such incidents should be avoided in future.” Sources said that since Pakistan’s economy was in dire straits, the Pakistan government had allowed the project management unit, a government department responsible for the management of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartaprur Sahib, to rent out the premises for commercial purposes to raise funds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/photos-of-bareheaded-woman-modelling-at-kartarpur-sahib-draws-ire-of-sikh-community/articleshow/87992945.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The BMC board of administrators’ chairperson, Krishna Chakraborty, accompanied the civic officials who visited some houses in the AK block. The civic team found mosquito larvae in the accumulated water of jars, pots and buckets at some houses. The civic authorities have formed six quick action teams visiting houses in Salt Lake and Rajarhat for dengue inspection. On last Saturday, Chakraborty had also visited some houses along with the civic team in the CJ block and found mosquito larvae, including that of aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue, at some houses. “We conducted drone surveillance on Monday to make an aerial inspection of the AK block in Salt Lake. We will continue with the surveillance. We have already sent notices to several residents, requesting them to clean up the premises of their houses to keep the dengue menace at bay. The civic officials will visit these houses again to check whether our instructions are being followed,” said Chakraborty. “The civic body has been taking a slew of measures throughout the year for dengue prevention like spraying larvicide and fogging. We are seeking cooperation from the residents so that the civic team can conduct dengue inspection at their houses,” Chakraborty added. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has also taken up a similar dengue prevention drive and the officials are using drone surveillance to locate any accumulation of stagnant water. There has been a spike in dengue cases in the areas under BMC area since October. About 300 residents of Salt Lake and Rajarhat have been detected with dengue this year while two deaths were reported from the Baguiati area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/fight-against-dengue-eye-in-the-sky-to-spot-stagnant-water-in-salt-lake-houses/articleshow/87991004.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Mumbai||Blotter paper must be considered while measuring LSD weight: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Merely because a blotter paper can be licked or put in a glass of water does not necessarily mean that it must be excluded while determining the LSD weight, ruled the Bombay high court on Monday. Justice Revati Mohite-Dere held that blotter paper be considered while weighing Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) based on an “underlying principle” enunciated by the Supreme Court, which in a case pertaining to heroin, had contemplated the whole ‘mixture’ while deciding its weight. LSD, a hallucinogenic narcotic drug, is placed as small dots on blotter paper for consumption. “The whole of the quantity — LSD with blotter paper — is to be taken into consideration whilst considering small or commercial quantity,” said the HC. The court held that the Mumbai forensic science laboratory (FSL) report was “not clear”, and in the interest of justice directed that the seizure of 31 blotter papers from Anuj Keshwani (30) be sent to the Gandhinagar FSL in Gujarat for a fresh test to ascertain whether each of the blotter paper contains LSD. Keshwani (30) was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau last September in the case against Rhea Chakraborty, former girlfriend of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The NCB had claimed that Keshwani was found in possession of 0.62gm LSD, a commercial quantity. The Gandhinagar FSL must give “weight of each of the blot papers purportedly containing LSD on it”, said the HC. It directed the laboratory to submit its report within six weeks to the special NDPS court. “LSD put on a blotter paper is capable of being swallowed after placing it on the tongue. It is thus evident that the blotter paper is capable of being swallowed and is used as one of the methods for consuming LSD,” said Justice Mohite-Dere. “It is important to bear in mind the legislative intent, the object and reasons, and, the preamble of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act while considering whether LSD is to be weighed sans the blotter paper.” The judgment was in a petition filed by NCB which said paper weight must be factored in to decide quantity of LSD seized. The agency’s special counsel ASG Anil Singh and counsel Advait Sethna with Shreeram Shirsat cited the recent Supreme Court ruling in Hira Singh’s case arguing that it required weight of drugs sold on street to include any ‘neutral substance’ mixed in it, not just its pure form. The HC said, as noted by the SC, it was never the intention of the legislature to exclude the quantity of the neutral substance and to consider only the actual content by weight of the offending drug. It is also pertinent to note that illicit drugs are seldom sold in a pure form. “They are always adulterated or cut with other substances or put in a gelatin or blotter paper, as in the present case,” said the HC. The Mumbai FSL report was silent on whether blotter paper was weighed too and thus “defective”, argued Keshwani’s counsel Rizwan Merchant and Taraq Sayed. The NCB said 32 complete blotter papers and 10 more together weighed 0.62gm. The FSL report said 31 blotter papers weighed the same, which “seems improbable”, said the HC. It accepted that “the FSL report is not clear whether it checked every blotting paper for LSD or not, or whether only one sample test was done”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/blotter-paper-must-be-considered-while-measuring-lsd-weight-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/87992561.cms||Swati Deshpande

Both the districts fall in red zones. Beed district has 63.13% vaccination coverage involving the first dose and 30.03% vaccination using the second dose. Nanded district has vaccination percentage of 63.36% and 25.98% involving the first and the second dose, respectively till November 27, as per official data. Beed district health officer Dr Rauf Shaikh said villages with poor vaccination coverage have been identified to boost the vaccination drive. “A rigorous vaccination drive has been launched in these areas since November 28. On day one of the drive, we carried out nearly 35,000 vaccinations. We have roped in different government authorities including the police department to strengthen the drive,” he said. Besides vaccination linked curbs, Shaikh said awareness and counselling measures were also taken. Beed district had 65 active cases by Monday. Nanded district collector Dr Vipin Itankar said organised efforts are being taken to increase the vaccination coverage. “We are optimistic that the vaccination drive would offer to a large number of beneficiaries, who are yet to take the jab, in the days to come,” he said. Nanded district had 24 active cases by Monday. All the eight districts of Marathwada have vaccination percentage below the state average.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/poor-vax-coverage-in-beed-nanded/articleshow/87989284.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad moves from red zone to yellow||Aurangabad: The joint efforts made by different authorities over the past few weeks has resulted in Aurangabad moving to the 18th position in Covid vaccination coverage in the state. The district had slipped to the 31st position earlier finding itself in the red zone, which has now changed to yellow zone, authorities said. The zone which a district falls in depends on the percentage of population covered as against the total number of beneficiaries. “The state-level ranking of Aurangabad district is continuously improving. With rigorous measures to enhance the Covid vaccination coverage, we hope to rise further in days to come,” said Aurangabad district health officer Sudhkar Shelke. Appreciating efforts made by the government machinery, he appealed to the beneficiaries, who have to be vaccinated, to take the jab at the earliest. With 72.35% vaccination involving the first dose and 31.38% involving the second dose, Aurangabad district has lesser vaccine coverage than the state average. Maharashtra as a whole has covered 79.93% vaccination with the first dose and 42.21% involving the second dose. Mumbai tops the list in the state with 101.98% vaccination with the first dose and 71.80% vaccination involving the second dose, whereas Nandurbar district is at the bottom with 61.60% of partial vaccination and 31.33% fully vaccinated beneficiaries by November 27.  Aurangabad district administration has already announced a slew of curbs linked to mandatory partial vaccination. It includes ‘No vaccine- No ration’, ‘No vaccine- No fuel’, ‘No vaccine- No LPG refill’ and ‘No vaccine- no travel’ to name a few. Also, vaccination has been made mandatory for visitors at all government offices. The district on Sunday reported 11 cases and two Covid deaths. The total count of Covid cases in the district has reached 1,49,543, which includes 1,45,813 recoveries and 3,637 deaths, as per the official data.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/aurangabad-moves-from-red-zone-to-yellow/articleshow/87989305.cms||Prasad Joshi

In a meeting on the campaign on Monday, Gehlot stressed the need for having labs for testing adulteration in every district to make the campaign more effective. At present, very few districts have labs for the testing and often test result takes days to come in diluting the case against the culprits. "All concerned departments related to the campaign, including civil supplies and health, must maintain coordination for the success of the campaign," said Gehlot. It is primarily, the duty of both departments to carry out inspections and issue guidelines for the same, he said. The campaign that ran from November 2020 had attained great success, said officials, adding that it will restart from January 1 with a larger aim of creating an adulterant-free Rajasthan. Officials said they were following a zero-tolerance policy on the culprits involved in adulteration rackets endangering the lives of the people.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/check-food-quality-regularly-cm-tells-officials/articleshow/87991007.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Zafar Khan, founder-president of School Headmasters Charitable Association (SHCA), said, “It’s like going to school at the start of the year. Technically, students are entering campus when half the session is over, but still this is like the first day at school for them. So yes, this is something that parents from lower socio-economic background will have to prepare for.” Schools run by the government, through local bodies or specific departments, do not face this particular issue because uniforms and books are provided free of cost to students. But many parents from low socio-economic background have admitted their kids in private schools and due to the pandemic, their financial condition has seen an upheaval. So while such parents will send their kids to school, they are well aware of the immediate cost of doing so. Pravin Uikey, whose primary source of income comes from painting houses, said, “This Diwali, we finally got some good work after almost one year of no economic inflow. But the money goes into other pending things and now suddenly to spend Rs1,000-Rs2,000 on new uniform is a bit steep. For the first few weeks, I will be sending both my children in casual clothes, because now the old uniform is not fitting properly due to fast growing age.” Shops and wholesalers of uniforms are not seeing an immediate uptick in demand. Nitin Tutheja, director of Lords Wear Pvt Ltd, said, “For senior students, yes there is a constant demand as probably more parents are now sending their kids to school. But for primary kids, we have not seen any movement yet. I think only after a week or so, the demand from this segment will come.” Premlata Tiwari, principal of Bhola High School, said while it’s an upfront cost for parents, many of them can manage. “I think that almost everyone who sends their child to a private school, regardless of the fee there, can afford the costs of uniforms. I am not saying that it’s negligible and does not warrant a second thought, but no parent will ever hold back their child at home just because of the cost of uniform,” said Tiwari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/back-to-school-upfront-cost-of-sending-kids-worry-some-parents/articleshow/87991002.cms||---

While the wife was on the first line antiviral drugs, he was taking third line medicines dispensed only at select centres in Mumbai. Without ART, their health could start deteriorating. Realising that it could affect many more like Santosh, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) used a novel approach–home delivery of ART drugs, an idea the agency had been toying with but didn’t implement over concerns of patient confidentiality. As the pandemic pushed agencies world over to find new ways to deliver HIV drugs without compromising on patient identity, MDACS used postal services to drop medicines at the doorstep. Since last year, 95 patients benefited from home delivery. Patients from UP, Bihar, Bengal and far-off districts in Maharashtra registered in Mumbai for HIV treatment, availed of the delivery via speed post. Santosh told TOI the drugs came in neatly packed nondescript boxes with no hint of what they contained. “My wife is aware of my HIV status, but my children are not. I was worried about not being able to travel to JJ Hospital for my medicines,” said the man, who feared getting beaten up by cops enforcing lockdown. “Due to the postal delivery, I continued my treatment uninterrupted,” he said. The only requirement at the postal department was to reveal the contents of the medicine box before it was shipped. Once they okayed it, the box was sent to the address desired by the patient. The boxes were sent only with the consent of the patient concerned. The home delivery began ast year under an umbrella programme called ‘ARTMitra’. Until the pandemic, HIV patients took their medication in person from ART clinics. But as travel restrictions disrupted movement last March, many couldn’t keep up with appointments. “The count of missed appointments was nearing 10,000 by April. We needed an alternative urgently,” said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS. The body has over 36,000 receiving free ART medicines, including 2,000 from MMR. The main challenge was in delivering medicines to those displaced by the lockdown, she said. As per their preliminary list, 7480 people missed appointments by April. As 14 program assistants tried to contact them, only 47% of patients could be reached. MDACS then tied up with CDC, US to start an interactive voice response system (IVRS) that informed patients about the closest centres to collect drugs. In the second wave, IVRS was replaced by a text message worded casually without a hint of HIV or AIDS. Up to 15,000 patients got the text of which 72% chose to collect their medicines from an ART centre. Also, MDACS designated sites where staffers met HIV patients at a convenient public place to hand over medicines. “Those who couldn’t reach a health facility or even a community site relied on home delivery in a big way,” said Sushil Nikam, assistant director, MDACS. Of patients contacted through different modes, more than 70% chose to pick up their medicines from an ART centre. Dr Acharya said that from thousands, count of patients who missed appointments has returned to its regular range of 1,500-1,800 now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-life-saving-drugs-sent-by-post-to-hiv-patients-amid-lockdown/articleshow/87991647.cms||Sumitra Debroy

While the dominant variants got changed from Alpha to Delta globally, the new variant B.1.1.529 named Omicron from the Greek alphabet is now the variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). If one looks at the history of variants in Gujarat, the second wave of the pandemic coincided with the rise of Delta variant (B.617.2). According to analysis by the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), April and May witnessed complete dominance of the variant with over 80% of cases testing positive for Delta variant and its sub-categories. “After the end of the second wave, Delta remained dominant strain for the state with other variants accounting for about 10-15% of the cases. Out of the total samples sequenced completely, Delta accounts for 48% or nearly half of the total variants during the entire pandemic even when it was first reported in end of March this year,” said an expert. Dr Urvesh Shah, professor and head of microbiology at GCS, said that mutation of Covid-19 depends on several factors including local conditions and host. “It’s widely believed that the Omicron variant is result of low vaccination in African countries as the virus got a chance to spread for a longer time,” he said. According to GBRC data, after 1,407 sequencing of Delta, B.1.36 is reported 311 times, B.1 236 times, B.1.113 123 times and B.617.1 95 times. The alpha variant (B.1.1.7) is found in 81 sequencing from out of 2,932 sequences.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/covid-variants-delta-is-still-numero-uno-for-gujarat/articleshow/87991657.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Aurangabad||Transportation to be bone of contention||Aurangabad: As more schools are likely to reopen from December 1, transportation of students is likely to create friction between the school administration and parents. While a section of schools, having their own buses, has expressed inability to provide buses to primary students, some others were contemplating charging more fee for student transportation. Sanjay Tayde, founder of Maharashtra English Schools Trustees Association (MESTA) on Monday, said many schools were facing multiple issues in providing bus transportation to students. “The seating capacity of buses will reduce to half if we are to follow Covid prevention norms while transporting students. It will have a cascading effect on the fleet of buses required and the expenditure incurred overall. Additional financial burden will obviously get passed to the parents,” he said. MESTA authorities also said some schools need to renew their contract with bus operators which is not possible immediately. “The Covid situation being dynamic in nature, the policy decisions involving reopening of schools cannot be announced in advance. The schools need to arrange things at their level once the decisions are officially out,” Tayde said. Principal of one of the leading schools in Aurangabad said parents have been informed that bus service will not be available from December 1. “We have technical issues at our end in restarting the service. An intimation regarding the same has been given to parents while seeking consent forms,” she said. Renuka Beedkar, a parent, said private transportation is a must for commuting needs of students who stay at a distance from schools. “The schools should not give any shocker to parents by making hefty hike in charges towards student transportation. Also, considering the relatively smaller age of children from the primary section, many parents will have to drop and pick up their wards from schools till the bus services start,” she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/transportation-to-be-bone-of-contention/articleshow/87989313.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Why the picture was hazier than usual this November||NEW DELHI: This November saw prolonged smog episodes with intermittent breaks. Data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that severe smog episodes began on December 5 (a day after Diwali) and continued till November 13, with a break of two days when the air quality improved marginally to the upper end of the “very poor” category. The Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the “severe” category for three days in a row, from November 26 to 28. Experts said a combination of factors led to the high level of pollution this month. Between November 5 and 13, the air quality remained in the “severe” category and touched the “very poor” category on just two days, November 8 and 10. Though air quality remained mostly “very poor” from November 13 to 24, it reached the extreme end of “very poor” on November 25 with AQI clocking 400. It stayed in the “severe” category for three consecutive days. In 2020, the smog episode stretched from November 5 to 10. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The prolonged smog episodes with intermittent breaks this November were one of the longest in recent times. As farm fires are reducing, local and NCR emissions are impacting the air quality. Taking lessons from previous years, when smog episodes occurred in December and January, it’s important to plan strategies for reducing emissions.” Experts said a combination of factors, mostly high impact of stubble burning, calm wind during night and local and regional sources of pollution, affected the air quality in the first half of November. However, the impact of stubble burning became negligible in the second half. As winter set in, local and regional sources of pollution became prominent due to meteorological factors like low temperature, high moisture, low mixing layer height and slow winds during the day. SAFAR analysis showed that the share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was 30% from November 9-13 and it reduced to 4% from November 23-27. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Our analysis suggests that while the first half of November 2020 was marginally more polluted than this year, the second half of November 2021 was more polluted than last year. Ventilation parameters like wind speed and mixing height slightly favoured the dispersion of pollutants, but declining temperature and reduced wind speeds resulted in poor air quality. Unlike last year, we didn’t experience any rain this November.” Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “On many days, the mixing layer height was reduced to 200-300 metres, which is normally over 500 metres during winter months. This resulted in concentration of particulate matter. Wind speed also remained low on many days, affecting the dispersal of pollutants. A strong forecasting system is needed and studies should be done on health impact on high pollution days.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-the-picture-was-hazier-than-usual-this-november/articleshow/87991650.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Cops said the victim, Shukla Das, had touched the refrigerator at her kitchen while cleaning the floor. Rina Das, a relative of the victim, said, “On hearing her scream, I rushed to the kitchen and found her frothing at the mouth. I turned off the main switch of the house before attending to her.” The woman was taken to a Salt Lake hospital, where she was declared dead. Cops suspect that the victim’s necklace might have got stuck with some part of the refrigerator while she was cleaning the floor of the kitchen. “She was dipping a cloth in a bucket of water. Her hands and feet were wet as well,” said an officer, adding that the refrigerator was a decade-old and kept on the floor without any plastic stand. However, the incident shows the necessity to maintain old electrical appliances regularly. “It seems that some live wires had got in touch with the metal frame of the refrigerator, thus turning into a live electrical conductor. The woman might have touched the refrigerator and got electrocuted. If the paint of an old electrical appliance flakes off, it may result in electrocution. In some cases, if the earthing conks off, that can turn the device into a live conductor,” said a senior professor of electrical engineering at Jadavpur University. The professor added that people should maintain old electrical appliances periodically and not ignore even minor signs of malfunction, which may lead to an accident like the one on Monday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/woman-dies-after-fridge-electrocution/articleshow/87991030.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Mahesh Patil from Kasba Bawda area said, “The school authorities had asked for our consent but I have refused to send my daughter for offline lectures. The students haven’t been to school in the last one-and-a-half-year, it would be better to start offline classes next year. The children are not vaccinated and it is shocking to see how the government is allowing offline classes amid the ongoing fear of Omicron.” Shilpa Sawant, a resident of Nagala Park said, “ When the cases were fewer, the government didn’t start offline classes. Now when the cases are increasing and there is panic due to the new variant, they are starting primary schools. My child is in Class 3 and he doesn't even know how to use a mask properly.” School teachers are confused over the current scenario. Meenakshi Mane, a primary school teacher, said, “As a parent of a 10-year-old, I can understand why the parents are fearing to send their students back to school. Most of the parents have not given consent to offline classes and we will conduct both online and offline classes from December 1.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/parents-unwilling-to-send-children-to-school/articleshow/87989324.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Her dentist advised her to wait for the first trimester to complete. In the second trimester, another dentist tried to reduce the swelling by minimal invasive root canal treatment. But the swelling didn’t subside, leaving her face disfigured. In the last one year, Shaista consulted several doctors who unsuccessfully attempted to restore her aesthetics as the swelling persisted. In her last trimester, she was referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, who found she was suffering from a rare jaw tumor ‘Cementifying Fibroma’. Akola-based surgeon Dr Zubair Ahmed and his team successfully restored her normal facial symmetry post surgery, recently. “In some days, she will be able to chew food after dental implants,” said Dr Ahmed, director of GR Dental and Maxillofacial Care. Dr Ahmed said because of her pregnancy no doctor was able to operate. “She was unable to go out anywhere. The swelling was not reducing. It had hardened. She had to keep her face covered all the time. The patient’s routine life was badly hampered,” he said. Dr Ahmed asked the patient to wait and planned a 3D CBCT scan after delivery of her baby. “The advanced scan revealed a big periapical lesion below the roots of the lower first premolar to second molar teeth. It was approximately 3×4 cm surrounded by a sclerotic margin,” he said. As per the radiologist’s report, a cystic lesion of the jaw was suspected. “As the lesion was in close approximation to the inferior alveolar nerve, there was risk of permanent paresthesia (loss of facial sensation) in the associated region. Removal of the complete jaw or need to fit reconstruction plates were the other risks,” he said. Dr Ahmed explained all possible complications of the surgery. Following patient’s consent, the surgery was performed under general anesthesia. A team of maxillofacial surgeons — Dr Palak Umadiya, Dr Umesh Bhutekar beside Dr Ahmed and anesthetist Dr Kanjarkar performed the surgery. The tumor was removed from the jaw and closure was done in layers. The histopathology department confirmed it was a rare ‘Cementifying Fibroma’ of the jaw. The rare tumor may have multiple causes, including dental infection, poor dental hygiene, history of injury or trauma. The infection starts in Cementum – a substance between the tooth and jaw bone. Sometimes, the exact cause remains unknown. In this case, the cause is yet to be established.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/doctors-treat-rare-jaw-tumour-restore-womans-lost-smile/articleshow/87991034.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Even Mumbai saw over one lakh vaccinations in a day after two weeks.  Till 10pm, over 10,80,699 people had taken the Covid-19 vaccine, taking the total number of doses administered in Maharashtra to 11.3 crore. Over 80% have been vaccinated with a single shot in the state while more than 42% have taken both the shots. While many wondered if the sudden rush was due to the fear of the Omicron variant, district officials said it is a consequence of the local measures taken to push people to get immunized.  The numbers are only set to rise, said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary. “We have been doing well since the last seven to 10 days by clocking seven to eight lakh vaccinations,” he said. Dr Vyas said since many who got vaccinated in August and September will be eligible for the second shot now, the daily numbers should pick up further.  The city had last recorded 1.1 lakh vaccinations on November 13. The city’s first dose coverage has crossed 101% while the second dose has crossed 70%. Dr Gautam Bhansali said a notice would be sent to all hospitals to check what percentage of their staff has been fully vaccinated. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-state-logs-10l-jabs-in-a-day-max-in-2-mths/articleshow/87991661.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur police search for ‘jewel thief’ who has been targeting hotels||JAIPUR: Jaipur police suspect the role of notorious ‘jewel thief’ Jayesh Ravji Sejpal in the Hotel Clarks Amer theft case wherein diamonds worth Rs 2 crore and Rs 95,000 was stolen from a Mumbai-based couple’s room last Thursday. City police believe that the suspect is a confident trickster who is alleged to have been involved in multiple cases of inter-state burglaries and thefts at star hotels in different cities across India. From Chandigarh to Hyderabad and from Mumbai to Jaipur, the man is now under police scanner. “Preliminary probe hints at the involvement of Jayesh, who has been wanted in as many as 13 other thefts of a similar fashion in different cities,” Lamba said. A senior official who is part of the investigation informed TOI that city police had shared the CCTV clips of Hotel Clarks Amber heist with their counterparts in other states. “Cops in other cities hinted at the possibility of Jayesh Sejpal’s role in the offence. The suspect caught in the hotel’s CCTV bears a strong resemblance to Jayesh’s gait and demeanour,” the official said, adding that police, however, will only confirm the accused’s involvement after his arrest. According to police, Sejpal is believed to be a resident of Mumbai. He was arrested by Hyderabad police in 2018. He targets well-heeled guests staying at star hotels for weddings and confidently tricks hotel staff before burgling into rooms. In Clarks Amer case too, he had impersonated the occupant of room number 734 to gain entry and soon decamped with diamond sets and cash which were kept inside a safe. On Saturday, TOI had reported about the suspect’s footprints in a similar theft that took place in room number 112 of a five-star hotel in Udaipur. A New Delhi-based couple had filed the FIR for the theft at Udaipur’s Amba Mata police station on November 20. Jaipur police had confirmed that the modus operandi used in Udaipur and Jaipur cases was similar and the same suspect could have staged both burglaries.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hotel-heist-cops-hunt-for-jewel-thief-who-has-been-striking-at-star-hotels-across-india/articleshow/87991035.cms||Dishank Purohit

However, the Zilla Parishad (ZP) has decided to go ahead as per the instructions of the state government and it will issue its orders separately on Tuesday. The state government has issued guidelines to the local authorities on reopening of schools for students of Classes I to VII in urban areas and Classes I to IV in rural areas. According to state guideline, the schools can start functioning physically from December 1. Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief Kailas Jadhav, however, said, “The decision to restart the schools physically has been put on hold till December 10.” The NMC’s education department has issued an order to the civic schools saying that there was a proposal to start schools from December 1, but because of the spread of new variant of the virus, it has been decided otherwise. “The new Covid strain is spreading fast. We have little information on it at the moment. Following the discussion with the NMC commissioner and deputy director of education, the decision has been deferred. However, this will not affect the school sessions for the students of Class VIII and above,” said Sunita Dhangar, the education officer said. In the rural areas, the ZP has decided to go ahead with the decision of reopening schools. “I had a word with Nashik collector (Suraj Mandhare). We then decided to start the physical assembly for students of Classes I to IV in rural areas by following Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB),” said Leena Bansod, the CEO of Nashik ZP. Due to mobile data network problems, lack of infrastructure and some parents’ inability to buy the children mobiles etc. in the rural areas, the teachers have been conducting the classes physically for some time now. The classes are not arranged formally, as the teachers visit villages and hamlets, gathering students in the open at some locations and teaching them. “With the government guidelines, the schools will now be started formally,” Rajeev Mhaskar, the primary education officer for Nashik ZP, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nmc-defers-reopening-of-primary-schools-to-dec-10-zp-to-go-ahead-with-dec-1-schedule/articleshow/87989341.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In busy areas of the city like Shalimar, MG Road, College Road, Nashik Road, it has been observed that many shoppers are without masks. While many wore masks but did not cover their noses. Even shopkeepers are allowing rush of people in front of their shops violating Covid safety protocols. In the meeting held on Monday, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav directed the departments concerned to start taking action against those violating the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials said, “We have formed 18 teams comprising three health officials and employees in each team across six divisions to conduct surprise checks in public places to ensure people follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour.” The erring city residents, who are found without masks in public places, will be slapped with the penalty. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje said a section of people is not wearing masks in a market or public places. Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing are the key measures to prevent the spread of Covid. Meanwhile, NMC’s health department had conducted a survey to find out the percentage of the active patients, who were infected even though though they had taken both doses of Covid. NMC officials said the city had 172 active patients by November 17. The survey found that 97 patients had taken both the doses, while nine active patients had got the first dose.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/many-nashik-residents-continue-to-ignore-masks/articleshow/87989342.cms||Tushar Pawar

Piles of garbage can be seen lying on roads all around with more than 200 complaints pending at the corporations regarding irregular trash collection. Mahesh Nagar resident Pinky Taneja said, “To prevent trash being dumped on the roads, we have been provided with the door-to-door garbage collection. Vehicles come on alternate days or after every two days. We are fed up with this. You can see garbage being piled up at every road corner.” In JMC-Heritage, things are worse because vehicles do not visit interior areas. BVG Company that picks up garbage went on a third strike in two months on the issue of non-payment. Both the corporations have given more than 500 notices to the company for not working properly, but nothing has changed. MLA Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Monday said BVG Company had no right to strike. “It is the responsibility of the mayor to stop the corrupt practices of the company. Mayor should take strict action to curb corruption in the company. On Tuesday, I will hold a meeting with officials of JMC-Heritage and discuss the cleanliness arrangements.” JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar said they were thinking of replacing the company but legal issues were preventing such a move. “We will have a meeting to improve the sanitation condition of the city. We are thinking of doing some major changes,” said Gurjar. JMC-Greater has decided to purchase vehicles. Many councillors have gone on strike to protest the degrading sanitation conditions in their respective wards.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jaipur-yet-to-improve-sanitation-conditions-after-low-rank-in-survey/articleshow/87991042.cms||---

The increase will be applicable from January 1, 2022. Opposing the hike, president of Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry (FORTI) said the increase in GST rates on footwear and clothing was contrary to the basic concept of GST. Agarwal said while implementing the system in 2017, it was said by the central government that most of the items related to the common consumer would be gradually brought in to the minimum slab. “The government also followed this announcement and after some time, while revising the rates of GST, it was reduced on many consumer goods, but now the GST Council has increased the rates on clothes and shoes. This is against the sentiment.” A large number of textile and garment manufacturers, stockists, distributors and retailers of Rajasthan are members of FORTI. Other members of FORTI like its general secretary Naresh Singhal said that roti, cloth and house are included in the basic necessities of citizens. “There is no tax on food and the government is giving subsidy on houses. In such a situation, increasing the rate of GST on primary use items like textiles is an injustice”. Similarly, the youth wing of the industry body president Dhirendra Raghav says that the delegation of FORTI will go to Delhi and submit a memorandum to the ministers of the concerned ministries. “We will also meet chief minister Ashok Gehkot and submit the demand for persuading the Centre to reduce the rates on the items,” said Raghav.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/industry-protests-against-gst-hike-on-textiles-shoes/articleshow/87991052.cms||---
---||Dehradun||UP orders felling of over 8k trees despite NGT notice, later backtracks||Dehradun: Two days after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued a notice and impleaded the DFO of Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh in a matter pertaining to cutting of over 11,000 trees for the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, the UP government released a government order (GO) giving go-ahead for felling of over 8,000 trees for the project. The NGT notice was issued on November 25 while the UP forest department order came on November 27. When queried, UP forest officials claimed that the GO was ‘just a procedural step’. “The GO is a procedural step after a project gets stage I, stage II and wildlife clearances. We have stayed the felling of trees at present as the matter is sub-judice,” said Shweta Sen, DFO, Shivalik forest division of UP, under whose jurisdiction lies the stretch where the trees are marked for felling. Around 8,800 trees are slated to be axed on the almost 17-km-long stretch of NH-72A between Ganeshpur (Uttar Pradesh) to Daat Kali temple (Uttarakhand). Interestingly, the order, issued by the UP government, a copy of which is with TOI, mentions that “trees across 47.7 hectares of the Shivalik forest division have to be felled in accordance with the permission granted by the Centre and Supreme Court orders.” However, environmentalists point out that the Supreme Court has not given any such tree felling orders. “Which SC order is the UP government citing? The apex court has not passed any such order but has instead referred the matter to NGT,” said Doon-based environmental activist Reenu Paul, who had also filed a case in the Uttarakhand high court regarding the large-scale tree felling being planned for the expressway. She alleged that “even before the UP government issued the order, tree felling had started on the stretch and we have evidence to prove it” DFO Sen meanwhile reiterated that “no trees are being felled currently and we have also made provisions for afforestation and transplantation of trees in lieu of cutting existing ones.” The tree felling issue was initially taken to the Supreme Court by members of the NGO, Citizens for Green Doon on September 7 this year. The apex court directed it to NGT, saying it is an environment-related issue. But NGT refused to entertain the issue citing legalities. The petitioners moved the apex court again on November 16, which then put a stay on any tree felling till November 26. The SC also directed the petitioners to approach the NGT once more. The final hearing of the case by NGT is on December 2. Environmentalists have expressed worries regarding the large-scale deforestation due to the project, saying it would hit the Shivalik landscape, which acts as a natural sponge, absorbing excess water coming down from the Himalayas during rain while releasing excess water during droughts. The Doon-based Wildlife Institute of India has also pointed out through a study that the destruction of the landscape would lead to soil erosion and the fragmentation of a very critical wildlife corridor in the area.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/up-orders-felling-of-over-8k-trees-despite-ngt-notice-later-backtracks/articleshow/87990298.cms||Shivani Azad

The accused had said that if he was not paid the amount, he would inform the income tax department and other agencies about the firm’s financial transactions and all other confidential information. Two units of cryptocurrency in India were estimated to amount to Rs 48 lakh at the time the FIR was registered in July. The accused, Ankit Goel was arrested on Friday in New Delhi and produced before a local court in the capital for transit remand. He was brought to Mumbai and produced in court on Monday, following which he was remanded to police custody till December 1. “We had his mobile number, but he would switch it off frequently, so we had to wait to find his location. Our teams were in New Delhi for a couple of days and nabbed him there,” said a senior officer. Goel worked in the accounts department at the developer’s office for around two years. He resigned in March this year and left without completing the exit formalities and his full and final payment was also not initiated. After quitting the job, he had allegedly messaged an official at the developer’s office, threatening to inform several government agencies about the developer’s confidential financial data. He had allegedly threatened that he would inform the income tax department about some tax evasion. The developer’s manager then approached the police and lodged an FIR. An officer said, “We have arrested him and are investigating the case from all angles,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-new-delhi-man-tries-to-extort-cryptocurrency-from-employer/articleshow/87991692.cms||---

The government has decided that those who are coming from high-risk countries to the state will be quarantined for 14 days. “So far no suspected cases of Omicron have been reported in state. The screening of passengers, who are coming from abroad through airports and ports, has been intensified,” George said. It has been decided that if persons coming from abroad (high-risk countries) test positive, then their samples will be sent for genome sequencing. As per the Centre’s guidelines, all travelers who are coming from the UK and other European countries and other 11 high-risk countries will have to go for quarantine when they arrive here. The minister added that the state will be following the travel advisory issued by the Centre and hence RT-PCR certificates have been made mandatory for those who are coming from high-risk countries. But they will have to go for another RTPCR test at the airport and undergo a seven-day self-quarantine. After seven days, they will have to redo the RT-PCR test. Even if the RT-PCR test result is negative after the seventh day, the traveler will have to continue home quarantine for another seven days. Centre has directed the state to set up special Covid wards in select hospitals to keep persons who test positive for the virus. Hence it has been decided to set up such wards in the select hospitals in a few districts. Even if people are not coming from the list of high-risk countries, the Centre has asked the state to do random checks on the samples taken from arriving passengers. Based on this directive, it has been decided to conduct tests on 5% of the travelers coming from other countries, she added. All steps have been taken to ensure the quarantine of these travelers and to strictly monitor them too. Special health squads have been deployed at all the four airports, said the minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/14-day-quarantine-for-high-risk-passengers/articleshow/87991074.cms||---

During that camp, the SMO asked me to come to his cabin. When I went there, he started passing lewd comments at me. He said he would take me to a flat. I went numb and could not say anything for a few seconds. I came out of his cabin and told my colleagues about it. They suggested that I should take up the matter with the senior officials. The next day, I talked to the senior officials in the hospital and they gave me permission to lodge a complaint against him,” she addedChief medical officer SP Singh said, “The matter is in my knowledge.

---||Ludhiana||Neighbour planned to abandon girl to harass her family||Ludhiana: Neelam, 35, who was arrested on Sunday for kidnapping and killing her neighbour’s two-year-old daughter Dilroze Kaur, initially planned to abandon the girl at an isolated place to harass her family. As Neelam and her family were relocating from Shimlapuri and were to vacate their house on Sunday, she thought of taking a revenge from Dilroze’s family by kidnapping her.Assistant commissioner of police (Industrial Area-B) Rajan Sharma said, “Neelam thought people targeted her children and her. She was upset as Dilroze’s father, Harpreet Singh, too, had scolded her sons. Neelam had not planned anything before executing the crime. As her family was relocating on Sunday, she thought of kidnapping Dilroze on seeing her standing alone outside the house. Within a few seconds, she took the girl along on the pretext of giving her a ride on her two-wheeler.”“Neelam revealed that when she kidnapped Dilroze, she thought of abandoning her near Phillaur to harass her family. But when she crossed Jalandhar bypass chowk and reached near Eldeco residential locality, she decided to abandon her there. After stopping near a vacant plot, Neelam gave Dilroze a push and she fell down. Thereafter, she buried her face and escaped from there,” the ACP added.Shaminder Singh, grandfather of Dilroze, said, “My family had gone out and returned home around 2pm. My daughter-in-law was in the house and Dilroze was standing outside when Neelam abducted her. When we were looking for Dilroze, Neelam’s son told us that his mother had taken the girl along on her two-wheeler. When we called up Neelam, she said Dilroze was not with her. We started looking for Dilroze again and a resident of the locality too said that he saw Dilroze with Neelam on her two-wheeler. After some time, Neelam returned home alone. She again lied that Dilroze was not with her. We called up the police and found the footage of a CCTV which had captured the two.” “Neelam’s family had sold their house and was to vacate it on Sunday. While leaving, Neelam thought of taking a revenge from us and killed our daughter. Her entire family is involved in this conspiracy and police should take action against all of them,” he added.The ACP said the role of Neelam’s family has not been found yet and the case was being investigated. Neelam was produced in a local court on Monday that sent her in two-day police remand. Dilroze died of asphyxia A board of doctors at civil hospital, comprising Dr Gurwinder Kaur, Dr Varun Saggar and Dr Rupidama, conducted the post-mortem. The doctors said Dilroze had a minor injury on her forehead and another on head that must have occurred when the accused pushed her on the ground. The girl died of asphyxia, they added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/neighbour-planned-to-abandon-girl-to-harass-her-family/articleshow/87990326.cms||Payal Dhawan

Siddaramaiah, interacting with members of the media in Mysuru, warned the state government against negligence, reminding members of the ruling dispensation of the price that the pandemic had exacted during its second iteration. “We saw hundreds of people die because of the government’s negligent attitude when the state was in the grip of the second wave of Covid. So, it is imperative that the state government take precautions to prevent a third wave of infections,” Siddaramaiah said. Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who in his recent ‘Mann Ki Baat’ broadcast stated that he did not covet power and only wished to serve people, the former CM said, “Leaders wish to become CM and PM only to serve people. It is sad that Modi has realised only that the primary objective of occupying the PM’s post is to be of service to people. Politics is about serving people, and working for the welfare of society.” On the forthcoming elections to the local bodies’ seats in the legislative council, Siddaramaiah sounded confident of the Congress winning 15 of the 25 seats heading for the polls. “Congress will win most of the seats even if the JD(S) supports the BJP. The JD(S) has always had an understanding with the BJP when it comes to contesting elections,” Siddaramaiah.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/take-measures-to-pre-empt-a-third-wave-siddaramaiah-tells-govt/articleshow/87990239.cms||---

The police have registered an FIR. According to sources, the hackers who allegedly stole data left a message asking for a ransom in bitcoin. DCP Pradeep Gunti said that an FIR has been registered and an investigation is on. Ehraz Ahmed, a security researcher from the city, said the only way to prevent such attacks is to do a security check periodically. Also, antivirus usage should be updated from time to time. The servers used to store the data should be secured, a backup plan should be employed for all critical and sensitive data and access to such data and servers should be restricted, he said. Also, the firms should ensure that they do not install and run unwanted third-party software. This will help keep the servers secure and will prevent any malware from spreading through the network, Ahmed said. Money stolenThe CEN police have also registered two cases in connection with conmen withdrawing money using unverified apps of two victims in a fortnight. In the first incident, reported on November 26, a 27-year-old woman alleged that she lost Rs 1.73 lakh after installing an app as suggested by a person she contacted over the phone, assuming that he was the customer care representative of her credit card company. In the second incident, a 48-year-old resident of Vijayanagar lost Rs.1.57 lakh after installing an app as suggested by a person who contacted him over the phone and asked for a KYC update.

When the park’s compound wall was being completed a few years ago, a pack of stray dogs got enclosed there and had been living there ever since. Venkatesh Mudaliar, an avid bird watcher, said the strays had developed sharp hunting skills and their aggression was posing danger to visitors. “It’s a pack of around 20 or so and they have hunted down peacocks, rabbits and langoors. Quite a few of them were born inside the park only, so their instinct is almost like that of a wild animal,” said Mudaliar. A regular visitor to the park, Mudaliar has captured the strays’ aggression on camera too. “I have photos of them dragging a langoor which they killed as pack, which shows how they have evolved living inside the park. They have taken down quite a few birds and even devoured eggs laid on the ground. So while they may be stray dogs, their instinct is not,” said Mudaliar. An aggressive alpha male in the pack had started being a cause for worry in the park. Last year, various stakeholders got together to find a solution, which did not involve harming the dogs. Kundan Hate, member of state’s wildlife advisory board, said, “A meeting was held in which forest officials, dog activists and even civic officials were included. The main purpose of this meet was to find a safe way to catch these dogs and remove them from the park premises.” But before these discussions could move to more advanced stage, the park started playing host to a regular visitor. “Camera traps captured images of a leopard, which was frequenting the area. Soon, the number of dogs started falling. It’s very likely that the leopard started picking up these easy targets, which also happen to be a preferred meal for it,” said Hate. Forest officials however believe that the receeding stray dog menace could be the result of two things. Bharat Singh Hada, deputy conservator of forests said “Initially we did see one or two dog kills, but now there is a possibility that the dogs have moved out. Even though the boundary is secured, dogs can leave even through an open gate. If the leopard starts picking up dogs, then they will run away from that area.” Recently, reports of leopard sighting on Ordnance Factory premises has increased. Some forest officials speculate that the same leopard might be roaming in Gorewada to Ambazari to Ordnance Factory areas and the dogs at the bio-diversity park are now its stable prey base.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/leopard-solving-stray-dog-menace-in-ambazari-bio-diversity-park/articleshow/87984733.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||Maharashtra probes PBS and Waze’s closed-door courthouse meet||MUMBAI: State home minister Dilip Walse Patil has asked Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to conduct a probe into a closed-door meeting that took place between former city police chief Param Bir Singh and dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in a room adjoining the Justice K U Chandiwal commission’s courtroom on Monday. When former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Shekhar Castellino found out that Singh and Waze were sitting in a separate room for a long time, she objected, saying this was illegal. Waze was then asked to sit in the witness box by the commission, which is probing Singh’s letter to the CM making corruption charges against Deshmukh, while Singh was asked to leave. Singh appeared before the panel suo motu on Monday, resulting in the commission cancelling the non-bailable warrant issued against him. Waze, who is in jail, was to depose. “My attention has been drawn to the prolonged meeting between Param Bir Singh and Waze. I have asked Nagrale to conduct a probe. We will wait for the outcome of the probe,” Patil told TOI. Castellino said, “I took strong objection to the meeting and brought it to the notice of Justice K U Chandiwal.” According to a senior cabinet member, it appears prima facie that the meeting was not a coincidence but by design, particularly in view of the fact that Waze was the trusted aide of Singh when the latter was Mumbai police commissioner. Singh had stated in his letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray in March that Deshmukh had given a target to Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Monday’s was the first meeting between Waze and Singh since the controversy broke out. Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe demanded a high-level inquiry into the meeting. “Both Param Bir Singh and Sachin Waze are main accused in a series of cases. Though they are witnesses before the commission, it was still wrong to meet. Their meeting is not in line with the rules, because as per rules, they can’t meet. Why did they meet? Who permitted them to meet? Someone must have facilitated the meeting. It is a serious lapse on the part of the police escort team which could hamper the probe,” Londhe said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-probes-pbs-and-wazes-closed-door-courthouse-meet/articleshow/87992994.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The district health authorities said the Union health ministry has revised the existing guidelines, which they have not received yet, but these are usually the same for all mutants. Civil surgeon Dr SP Singh said he held a meeting with senior medical officers (SMOs) of both urban and rural centres and issued instructions to ramp up testing and keep a watch on international travellers though the government has asked them to board flights with a negative RT-PCR report. The officials said the government has deputed nodal officers for international travellers and special focus would be on monitoring the passengers coming from at-risk countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. “Though we are yet to get the revised guidelines, we have learnt that the passengers coming from these countries will have to undergo RT-PCR on arrival and if they test negative they will have to stay under home quarantine for seven days. After that they will have to undergo re-test and if tested negative they will have to self-monitor themselves for the next seven days,” said a health department official.The officials said samples of the suspected patients would be sent for genome sampling. Experts suggest strict adherence to norms. “Unlike last time, the authorities need to ensure that the guidelines are strictly enforced. The international travellers should be monitored, but there is no need to panic,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal.“As per the WHO’s instructions for South-East Asia, there is too much uncertainty about it as there have been 30 mutations. Transmissibility of Omicron is higher and vaccination may have no impact on it. WHO has said it can be more severe here, so we need more surveillance and genome sequencing. People have to be very careful and follow Covid appropriate behaviour, including wearing of masks, besides the high-risk patients should be vaccinated,” said Dr Anurag Chaudhary of community medicine department, DMCH.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/dist-health-authorities-on-alert-keep-watch-on-intl-travellers/articleshow/87990367.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Kochi||Covid cases decline in Kerala, but reality is different||KOCHI: Is Kerala really seeing a decline in Covid-19 cases or is it because of reduced testing? Even now more than 50% of daily new Covid cases and 60% deaths reported in the country are from the state. Between November 22 and 28, the average daily new cases were less than 5,000 (after a long time in the second wave). However, the testing during this period had reduced drastically with an average of 54,216 tests done during the week. In contrast, a week earlier — between November 15 and 21 — when on an average 62,157 tests were conducted per day during the day, the average daily new cases was 5,704. Even between November 8 and 14, the number of average daily new cases was 6,509 when the average number of tests conducted per day was about 67,352. Interestingly, in the first week of November, the number of average daily cases was high at 6,892 even as the number of average number of tests conducted per day was 64,586. “Kerala had relatively fewer natural infections when compared with other parts of India. In many parts of India, sero prevalence is very high, indicating either the majority is infected and/ or vaccinated. But in Kerala, this sero prevalence is largely built by vaccination. We controlled the infection so well in the beginning that in a sense there is still wood remaining now for the fire to burn,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, research cell, IMA Kerala. “This slow burn will continue till the next surge. Everyday people are turning positive, a small percentage of them are getting hospitalized. We have recently noticed a slight uptick in Kerala but it is yet too early to comment on this,” added Dr Jayadevan. Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are the top three states with the majority of new cases in the country. Yet the number of daily new cases in the other two states is much lower compared to Kerala. While Kerala reported 4,450 new Covid cases on Sunday, in Maharashtra it was 832 and in Tamil Nadu it was 736. Kerala continues to have its long plateau phases and the plateau seems to reduce with reduction in daily testing and not due to natural hybrid immunity or vaccination. Also, breakthrough infections remain high in the state. However, well-known virologist Dr Jacob John T said that Kerala should be compared with Europe and not the rest of India. “In Kerala, the epidemic didn’t burn out. Here people are winning and the virus is losing. Whereas in every other state in India, the virus won and people lost. The state managed to keep the virus under check and now when the numbers are reducing in the state, it is not due to the infection burning out but due to the high vaccination coverage,” said Dr John.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cases-decline-but-reality-is-different/articleshow/87991087.cms||Preetu Nair

Colonel Jasjit Singh Gill (retired) had written about the rubber mulching proposal in the Ludhiana edition of The Times of India and had mailed the article to the then NHAI chairman, Sukhbir Singh Sandhu. Thereafter, the NHAI undertook the project on a pilot basis. Sukhpreet Singh, managing director of the landscaping company that executed the work, said meetings for the project had started in June-July, and he began collecting material in August after getting the work order. He added that they started pasting in November. The rubber mulching has been done on 200-metre length and its width is four metres, he said. The project cost Rs 9.7 lakh. Col Gill, who is also the founder member of NGO ‘Let’s Clean Ludhiana’ and a member of the state task force on Buddha Dariya Rejuvenation, said, “This project was initiated following the article in TOI. As the cost of used tyre scrap rubber went from Rs 6 per kg to Rs 35 kg during the pandemic, the project cost escalated. So we found a novel method to employ used industrial rubber sheets instead. The sheets put on both sides of the bypass toll plaza will have a minimum estimated life of 40 years and will have different functions, including water harvesting and direct flow of water to the plant pits due to inward slope. This will stop evaporation of water, and since there will be no weed growth, the median will have zero maintenance. The soil nutrients will be used only for plants and not weeds. It will also keep the root zone cool in summers and warm in winter and increase healthy microbial activity under the mulch. There will be no dust from wind as well as speeding vehicles, thus the median will remain clean.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/rubber-mulching-of-median-at-ladowal-bypass-completes/articleshow/87990393.cms||Shariq Majeed

The deceased, Suryakant Jadhav of Hansal village, was murdered over his relationship with a woman. The Mukramabad police have arrested the woman’s father Pandhari Gavalwad (55) and maternal uncle Madhav Thotve (36) on the charges of murder and kidnapping. Police said after the murder, Suryakant’s body was decapitated and buried in a farm. Following a confession by the arrested, the police in the presence of panchas exhumed the body. Mukhed sub-divisional police officer Sachin Sangle said Suryakant’s brother Ravikant had lodged a missing persons complaint stating that he suspected the woman’s father of having a hand in the disappearance. During their investigation, police found that the suspects were not happy over Suryakant’s relationship with the woman. More recently, the woman’s father warned Suryakant to stay away from her and threatened him with dire consequences. When police failed to track down Suryakant, they started keeping an eye on the woman’s father. Finding his behaviour suspicious, they brought him in for questioning, where he gave vague, evasive answers. When the police intensified the questioning, the man broke down and confessed to the crime and named Thotve as his accomplice. Police said the duo abducted Suryakant, brutally assaulted him and murdered him. Later, they slit his throat and buried the body five feet into the ground in their farm. Police said the suspects were produced before a court, which remanded them in police custody till Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/24-year-old-man-brutally-murdered/articleshow/87991081.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The state government has issued guidelines that all people connected with the organisition of any programme or visitors shall be fully vaccinated. Bhujbal, who is also the president of the welcome committee of the literary festival, said, “Since complete vaccination is somewhat tricky as the beneficiary has to wait for 84 days before the next dose, we have decided that any person who has not taken even one dose will not be allowed to enter the venue.” The Marathi literary festival will be held at ‘Kusumagraj Nagri’ at Bhujbal Knowledge City, which has capacity of accommodating over 22000 people but the organisers have regulated entry to not more than 8,500 people. Dr Prashant Bhutada, the head of the health committee of the festival, said that all visitors will be screened for body temperature and symptoms, irrespective of their vaccination status. If there are no symptoms, the visitor will be allowed entry with ‘green’ mark on his hand. Those with symptoms will have to undergo tests and allowed entry only after the report is negative. Bhujbal said that the condition is applicable only to those aged over 18 years of age and hence the children participation in any form will not be affected. “The Bal Sahitya Sammelan will also be held at the venue and those under 18 will not be restricted if they are not vaccinated,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/no-vaccine-no-entry-at-literary-fest-bhujbal/articleshow/87991086.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mumbai||Just 50% work on medical oxygen units done in 16 districts, says Maharashtra state||Mumbai: Work towards ramping up the generation and storage capacity of medical oxygen appears to have reached only halfway in several districts, according to data from the state’s public health department.  After facing a crisis of medical oxygen during the second wave, the state had begun augmenting its capacity based on instructions from the Centre. The formula was to create three times the capacity of oxygen that respective districts needed during the peak of the second wave.  A total of 551 PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen generation plants were proposed that could generate 675 metric ton (MT) of oxygen. In addition, 303 liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks with a combined capacity of 4809.99MT were to be installed in districts.  Data from the public health department, though, shows only 268 (49%) plants have been installed, while barely around 156 (51%) LMOs, which are used in ICUs and high oxygen dependency units, have been installed till now. The installed LMO tanks can collectively store up to 2,307.8MT of medical oxygen now while PSA plants can generate another 265MT. The numbers would have seemed adequate but for the projection that the state may require 3,838MT of medical oxygen during the peak of a possible third wave.  Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said that the state currently consumes only 50MT of oxygen for Covid patients against the production capacity of 1,600MT. He added work across districts is being monitored. The state data shows at least 16 districts are lagging in PSA installation while 15 haven’t managed to reach their LMO targets. Interestingly, several districts have contested the public health department data and said their actual progress has not been captured. Mumbai has been named among the 16 districts where the PSA work is much behind. The state data shows that of the 17 proposed PSA plants, only eight have been installed. Civic authorities have contested the numbers saying they have already installed 23 PSA plants while another 45-odd are in the pipeline. P Velrasu, additional municipal (projects), said Mumbai is currently generating 70.95MT of medical oxygen through PSA plants and can store 534MT of medical oxygen in LMOs. He said against the target of 690MT given by the state, the corporation is creating a capacity of 1,115MT. “We have put emphasis on PSA plants as they can generate oxygen in hospitals if there is any disruption in LMO supply,” he said. Among other laggards as per state data are Beed, Chandrapur, Dhule, Hingoli, Jalgaon, Latur and Nagpur. Officials from Beed also debated the state numbers saying they have installed seven of the 11 planned PSA plants. Similarly, five of seven approved LMOs have been installed. “A few have been kept in hold since we have already fulfilled our requirement of three times of the second wave peak,” said civil surgeon Dr Suresh Sable. The state report said Beed has installed four PSAs and three LMOs. The state, meanwhile, received 19,082 concentrators from PM Cares and CSR funds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/just-50-work-on-medical-oxygen-units-done-in-16-districts-says-maharashtra-state/articleshow/87992644.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||HC: Competing Rights Of Parents Are Secondary To Child’s Interests||New Delhi: Claims of feuding parents are “subservient” to the interests of the child, Delhi High Court has reminded subordinate courts, staying one such order allowing a father to take his toddler out for a couple of hours daily. Justice Yashwant Varma pointed out the anomaly in a decision by the family court judge permitting the estranged husband to take a two-and-a-half-year-old child out of the mother’s house every day, so that his claim of visitation rights as a father are fulfilled. “The order ultimately passed requires the minor child to be moved out of the residence and be taken by the respondent (father) for a period of two hours on a daily basis. The principal judge has clearly failed to weigh or consider the disruptive and deleterious impact that this may have. Matter requires consideration,” justice Varma noted, while staying the order. It also pointed out that at no point of time the allegations before the family court were that the mother was failing to discharge her obligations or adequately caring for the needs and welfare of the minor child, yet the custody for two hours every day had been handed over to the father to take the toddler out of the house. “The court also bears in mind the fact that the minor child in question is merely 2½ years old. Prima facie and as this court goes through the order passed by the principal judge, it is apparent that the court proceeded on the incorrect path of seeking to consider and evaluate the competing rights of parents to be accorded custody and/or granted rights of visitation. The above claims, which are raised by competing parents, must necessarily be recognised as being subservient to the interest of the child that has always and consistently been recognised as being paramount,” the court further underlined. The wife, through senior advocate Geeta Luthra, contested the order passed by the trial court last month. She pointed out that already the court had restrained the father from removing the minor child out of the custody of the mother, but later it granted two-hour custody for such a small child.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/hc-competing-rights-of-parents-are-secondary-to-childs-interests/articleshow/87991740.cms||Abhinav Garg

The TCP department has also started checking the documents submitted to the Old Goa panchayat and TCP for “repairs” of the structure that falls within the heritage conservation zone. On Saturday, CM Pramod Sawant said that he had directed the TCP department to re-examine all the documentation and permissions regarding the project that has earned the ire of local activists and sparked a hunger strike. Officials said that Sawant’s note was received on Monday, and department officials immediately began to re-examine the file and all the permissions for the project. “The CM directions have arrived. The file is being examined. It is too early to say anything more,” said a source. Over a thousand people participated in the protest rally at Old Goa demanding demolition of the structure within the heritage precincts of St Cajetan church, and several activists have also started a hunger strike. Sawant had said that action would be taken “in accordance with law”, but has remained non-committal when asked if this meant demolition of the structure. Sources said it would take the TCP officials a few days to review the documents and permissions that were granted for the controversial riverfront project. The project has also sparked a war of words between Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and Sawant. Sardesai has claimed that permissions for the construction were granted when Laxmikant Parsekar was the chief minister and former Mapusa MLA Francis D’Souza was TCP minister. Sawant has in turn pointed fingers at Sardesai and claimed that permission for the bungalow repairs were obtained by a former GFP senior functionary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tcp-dept-starts-checking-old-goa-bungalow-files/articleshow/87991736.cms||---

Spotting of the tiger highlights the importance of conservation reserve to the wildlife as last week a black panther was rescued in the conservation reserve. Deputy conservator of forests MD Naranwar said, “A tiger was recently caught by our camera trap while eating hunting — a domestic cow. The camera trap was set by Sawantwadi forest department. Few days ago, a black panther was also found in Kudal region of Sindhudurg district. Tiger stays at the top of the food chain and its presence signifies the richness of the forest and its biodiversity.” He added, “We have urged the local dwellers to contact the forest department immediately if their cattle or pet gets killed by a wild animal so that compensation can be given to them as per government guidelines.” Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests, said, “A tiger has been spotted in Tilari conservation reserve. Earlier, a tiger was spotted in Amboli and Chandgad conservation reserves. It appears that these conservation reserves are acting as a good and safe habitat for these big cats.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/camera-captures-image-of-tiger-in-sindhudurgs-tilari/articleshow/87991114.cms||---

The policy aims to create 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the sector by 2025. With the focus on establishing Goa as a model of international standards for EV adoption supported by a world-class charging infrastructure and ecosystem, the policy looks to promote conversion of Internal Combustion Engine (IEC) vehicles to EVs, convert 50% of all ferries to electric by 2025, and encourage start-ups and investment in the field of electric mobility and associated sectors. The policy wants to promote service units which include electric vehicle and battery repair and maintenance stations, promote R&D, innovation and skill development within the EV sector. To give the sector a startup thrust, it has envisaged incentives — purchase and scrapping incentives, interest subvention on loans, waiver on road tax and registration fees, a wide network of charging stations and swappable battery stations, and publicly owned database of the same. Additionally, the government will subsidise the first 3,000 two-wheelers, 50 three-wheelers and 300 four-wheelers. The policy, which will be applicable for a total of five years from the date of its notification, will cover all classes of two-, three- and four-wheeler EVs, including passenger cars and commercial light/heavy vehicles that are either Battery Electric Vehicles, Strong Hybrid Vehicles or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. The department of new and renewable energy will be responsible for the administration of the policy, including constitution of a high-powered committee and a State Electric Vehicle Board, and developing an intensive public outreach programme focused on creating awareness about the benefits of electric vehicles and key elements of the policy. To achieve its goals, the policy aims at the active incorporation of all sustainable initiatives, including smart-city development, promotion of energy conservation and creation of integrated transport mechanisms.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/eye-on-30-evs-by-2025-state-gives-nod-to-electric-mobility-policy/articleshow/87991753.cms||Murari Shetye

On Monday, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami was given a report reviewed by cabinet sub-committee -- headed by tourism minister Satpal Maharaj -- on the matter. According to TOI sources, the report suggests the CM to take back the law, which has brought over 50 temples, including the Char Dham shrines, under the state government’s control. The report has been drafted by a high-power committee -- headed by former Rajya Sabha member Manohar Kant Dhyani -- that was set up in August this year. Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI, “Manohar Kant Dhyani handed me an 89-page report. Subsequently, we compacted all their recommendations in a one-page report and handed it over to the CM. It is upon the CM to take a call on the issue now.” Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “After going through various details and keeping in mind the feelings and emotions of people, we have prepared the report and handed it over to the CM.” However, the minister remained tight-lipped over the recommendations made in the report. Notably, Char Dham priests have been protesting against the Uttarakhand government since the bill was tabled by the then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat in the state assembly in 2019. During his brief stint, former CM Tirath Singh Rawat had announced to remove 51 small temples from the ambit of the Devasthanam Board but he couldn't deliver on the announcement. Later, CM Dhami, during his visit to Uttarkashi in July this year, had announced to get the Act reviewed. A few weeks back, the priests had even prevented Trivendra Singh Rawat from entering the Kedarnath temple premises. State minister Dhan Singh Rawat and BJP state chief Madan Kaushik were also made to sit in the Kedarnath area for over an hour and listen to the demands of the priests.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/repeal-devasthanam-board-recommends-cabinet-panel-sources/articleshow/87990452.cms||Kautilya Singh

The plea, which is yet to be listed, says that her Facebook account and page has been hacked and the hacker is “publishing nudity, explicit and illegal material” while she has no access to or control of the Facebook page. Her petition says despite reporting the matter to Facebook authorities, “at no point of time, any action was taken by the social media company.” “Posting of illegal and immoral content on the Facebook page of the petitioner has caused grave prejudice to the petitioner and injury caused to the reputation of the petitioner cannot be compensated in terms of money… She has been receiving mails from friends, relatives, fans and followers regarding the immoral content being posted on her Facebook account,” it said. “Though the petitioner has tried to reason upon them to clarify that account has been attacked by the hacker but it is difficult for her to reach out to her 40 lakh followers among whom the reputation of the petitioner has badly suffered. That due to posting of the obscene material on the Facebook page the petitioner's image which she had created with hard work in the last 10 years has suffered adversely that would take years for the petitioner to revive.” The actor says she believes Facebook would not be able to support her since despite complaints, “the access of the page created by the petitioner due to her years of labour and determination, which had more than 40 lakh followers, was not in her hands.” The plea says petitioner was “shattered to see that from her hacked Facebook account, immoral and obscene pictures and videos were being posted. Thereafter the hacker started posting explicit sexual content on page of the petitioner, which was in public view.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bhojpuri-actor-in-hc-seeking-access-to-hacked-fb-account/articleshow/87991757.cms||---

The Lokayukta, Justice V M Kanade, has now asked the BMC to submit a report in four weeks listing out the steps it has taken to acquire the land meant for road-widening. Bachchan did not respond to queries from TOI. TOI had reported on July 2 on the BMC’s intent to raze Bachchan’s ‘deewar’ four years after it first sent a notice to the star. In 2017, the actor’s family had, along with owners of neighbouring plots, been asked to surrender a portion of land from the bungalow off Linking Road. Officials stated that in a bid to reduce traffic bottlenecks in the lane leading from Prateeksha bungalow towards Iskcon temple, the civic body will take the compound portion of these structures and widen Sant Dnyaneshwar Road from the current 40 ft to 60 ft. In 2019, BMC demolished the boundary wall of premises adjoining Bachchan’s bungalow, effectively taking over part of the land. However, the compound of Prateeksha was left untouched. Congress corporator Tulip Miranda had taken up the issue with the BMC’s K West ward. Miranda had said that while other properties were acquired, BMC was deliberately delaying acquisition of Bachchan’s property. In July, BMC said it would acquire the land as soon as the city survey office finalised demarcation of the portion that has to be acquired.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-in-lokayukta-as-bmc-hits-the-wall-on-big-bs-deewar/articleshow/87993002.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

But the new Omicron (B1.1.529) variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is said to be highly contagious than the previous Delta variant, has put the state back on alert. For the same, the state wants to leverage its huge village/ward volunteer network to track the returnees from those nations identified as ‘at-risk’. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy conducted a review meeting on Covid-19 situation in the state and the new variant of concern ‘Omicron’. Speaking to media after the meeting, state health minister and deputy chief minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas (Nani) said there is no need to panic about the new variant.  “Chief Minister has directed the officials to take all measures to make sure that that the new variant does not enter the state. “Chief Minister asked the officials to conduct Covid-19 tests on all international passengers coming to the state. Jagan Mohan Reddy has also directed the officials to speed up the vaccination process to conclude it at the earliest. People should strictly adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said Alla Nani. Speaking to TOI, director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences and state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr K Rambabu said that the health department is planning to take a range of measures to meet any eventuality considering the reports of the mutation’s immune escape behaviour and high transmissibility.  “As done in the first wave, the volunteers would identify the foreign returnees. Based on the RT-PCR tests, the positive samples will be sent to whole genomic sequencing. The surveillance and tracking mechanisms would be augmented for the new variant,” said Dr Rambabu. According to the state Covid-19 nodal officer, when a new variant is found, it ideally goes through four stages – VBM (variant being monitored), VOI (variant of interest), VOC (variant of concern), and VOHC (variant of high consequence). “But the B1.1.529 (Omicron) simply jumped the ladder for the World Health Organisation to label it as a VOC.” The updated guidelines, which will come into effect on December 1, require all travellers coming to India from countries identified as ‘countries at-risk’ to mandatorily undergo Covid-19 testing at airport on arrival. Meanwhile, state reported 101 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the cumulative caseload to 20,72,725. This is the lowest one-day case total in over 260 days after the state recorded 118 infections on March 9. The toll increased to 14,439 as one more patient succumbed to the pandemic. Altogether, 138 patients were declared cured.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/state-steps-up-vigil-over-omicron-variant/articleshow/87990455.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Miranda had said that while other properties were acquired, the BMC was deliberately delaying acquisition of Bachchan’s property. In July this year, in a reply to Miranda, BMC said it would acquire the land as soon as the city survey office finalises demarcation of the portion to be acquired. The letter issued by the K-West Ward to Miranda had said they had “requested the City Survey Office to give the demarcation of the Prateeksha bungalow so that this office can acquire the land.” Miranda in October filed a complaint with the Lokayukta. “I had no option but to file a complaint with the Lokayukta. In the hearing, the BMC has said they issued a notice to Bachchan under Section 299 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act but he has not replied. They have been waiting for him to reply for four years now. This is unfair and against the rules,” Miranda said. “The BMC is deliberately delaying acquisition of the Prateeksha plot. The adjacent properties have been acquired, but only this plot has been left untouched. Because of this, the road-widening work has been held up and people are stuck in traffic,” Miranda said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-lokayukta-asks-bmc-for-action-taken-on-bachchans-deewar/articleshow/87991764.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The minister demanded that the state government first make foolproof arrangements for paddy procurement for this season. He asserted that the Centre has not backed down from procuring paddy from Telangana. Speaking to reporters in Delhi, the minister said: “Who said paddy will be procured only in Punjab and not in Telangana? CM K Chandrasekhar Rao is partisan towards Gajwel and ignores Dubbak but accuses us of bias.” He said the Centre was buying paddy as per the agreements arrived between the Food Corporation of India and state governments.  “We have never said that we will not be purchasing the paddy. Telangana has written to the Centre that it will not deliver parboiled rice to us. And as agreed, the Centre will procure only paddy of this season,” he claimed. He criticised the TRS government for not having a clear-cut plan on parboiled rice. Alleging that the state government had failed to deliver seeds to farmers in time, he wondered what steps had been taken by the state in this regard. He said it had become a habit for the state government to pass the buck to the central government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-has-double-standards-on-paddy-issue-kishan/articleshow/87991122.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He agreed to meet Shaikh at Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli. When he arrived there, Shaikh asked to use his cell phone for the job registration. He then vanished with the phone.

---||Jaipur||Climate change fuels migration in Rajasthan: Study||JAIPUR: The variation in climatic conditions and its resultant impact on the socio-economic conditions are behind the increasing migration in the state, revealed a report prepared by the International Institute for Environment and Development based in the United Kingdom. The study mentioned that 28% of the households in the desert state have at least one person migrating twice a year due to a decline in economic opportunities related to drought. "Also, 97% of the migrants are those who earn up to Rs 5,000 per month. The majority of the migrants are heading to Delhi for work followed by Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, and Jammu," it said. Over 35.56% of the migrants have migrated due to climate shocks and the experts believe that more people are likely to move in the coming years. The report said 28% of the migrants had gone out due to repeated droughts, while other factors include land degradation, loss of income in a season, or multiple seasons. "The average age of person intending to migrate is 44 years and 76% of them are males. Of the total migrants, 58% people were into agriculture and 22% of them were dependent upon MGNREGA," mentioned the report. MGNREGA is an alternative to migration that can assure them at least 100 days of guaranteed work. "Around 68% of the households do not intend to migrate in the future, but the economic stress due to current income levels forced them to migrate. A large portion cannot buy enough food and non-food essential items, pay for healthcare or send children to school," said the report. The revenue model in the report suggests that on average, a family requires between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per month to prevent feeling stressed. The researchers observed that during climate distress, slow-onset events such as drought can threaten natural resource-based livelihoods such as agriculture, livestock, and fishery, compromising people’s ability to earn a living. "This can push them to consider migration for better economic opportunities elsewhere. The effect is stronger when rapid-onset hazards such as hailstorms or floods damage crops, cultivable lands, and property, leaving few or no options for the communities to adapt in-situ. Under such situations, migration is the only viable option for survival," reads the report. Migrants send remittances once every month or every two to three months. More than half of the remittances, regardless of their frequency, are up to Rs 5,000. They are used in the village mainly to meet daily consumption needs (food, daily necessities), and to some extent, for healthcare and education and to buy household goods (household appliances, furniture, and garments). The survey had chosen three states, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh ad Uttar Pradesh, which have witnessed a higher frequency of droughts and expansion of drought-affected areas since 1950.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/climate-change-fuels-migration-in-state-study/articleshow/87991760.cms||Shoeb Khan

Samples of all the patients have been sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant of the virus. Three of the tourists, whose samples were collected as part of contact tracing of a patient, had returned to their countries before the health department received their test reports. They apparently managed to fly back to their respective countries with the help of their negative test reports received from a private lab. Health officials said three of the six women foreign nationals are from Lithuania (30 years), Spain (44 years), Austria (41 years), and the rest three are from Russia (aged between 34 and 51 years). The seventh is a 47-year-old male from Switzerland. Three of them were fully vaccinated, said health officials. Talking to TOI, medical officer of community health centre in Vrindavan, Dr Swati Jadia, said, "After the woman from Lithuania tested positive for Covid-19, a total of 44 samples were taken in connection with contact tracing, and six foreign nationals tested positive for the disease. Three tourists, including two Russian women and a Swiss male, had left the country before we received their RT-PCR reports." She told TOI that when health officials contacted the Swiss male tourist, he shared a picture of his "negative" antigen report. However, the department hasn't been able to establish contact with the Russian women so far. The other patients are stable and have been isolated in Girdhar Dham Ashram and neighbouring Jeeva institute, where they had been staying. The ashram has been declared a containment zone. Reports of a few people are still awaited, Dr Jadia added. Nodal in-charge of the rapid response team Dr Bhudev (who goes by the first name only) said, "The Lithuania woman tested positive for coronavirus in the RT-PCR test conducted prior to her scheduled departure to her native country. All tourists are devotees of Lord Krishna and had come to India on tourist visa. The other two patients are locals," said Dr Bhudev. Chief medical officer Rachna Gupta said, "All foreign tourists had come to Vrindavan on November 15. The health department is on alert and random sampling is being done in the city. The ashram will be sanitised fully with the help of the municipal corporation."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/seven-foreigners-test-covid-ve-in-vrindavan-amid-omicron-concerns/articleshow/87990473.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The works to develop a dedicated software are underway and will be completed soon,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, a senior official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). According to PMC officials, around 1 lakh properties in the jurisdiction of civic body will be benefited with the scheme. This number may go up by 40,000 after the approval to extend the scheme’s benefits to merged villages. “Cases of submission of fake documents had come to light earlier. So, we are taking steps to make sure that a foolproof system is in place and this software will help in achieving this,” said PMC officials. Gunthewari development involves the plots formed by unauthorised sub-dividing privately owned land with buildings on such plots, including excess vacant land under Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976, not vested in the state government but excluding land under encroachment. According to PMC data, an applicant will have to pay three times the charges compared to the ready reckoner rates for getting the plan approved. “Though the online process is good, an offline process should also be made available. A meeting regarding the policy is scheduled,” said Prithviraj Sutar, leader of Shiv Sena in PMC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/owners-wait-for-gunthewari-plan-launch-continues/articleshow/87991131.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Farmers harp on price stabilisation, seed supply ahead of paddy switch||Hyderabad: As the state government battles with the Centre on the paddy procurement issue and warns farmers not to grow paddy in the rabi season, farmers in Vikarabad district said seed availability and price realisation hold the key before they make the shift from paddy to other crops. Interacting with TOI, several farmers came up with a demand for price stabilisation mechanism which required that price ranges were not unreasonably high or low. This, they said, will ensure convincing price both for themselves and consumers. “In the case of paddy, the returns are high and secure. An acre yields an income of Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000. If we opt for cereals or pulses, the income may not exceed Rs 5,000. So, first of all, we need a better price mechanism to switch over to other crops,” said C Venkata Narasimha, farmer from Yennepally village. Progressive farmers like N Mohan Reddy said it would be foolhardy to transport the crop to markets if they do not get a good price. “In my village of Kothagadi, ginger is not a regular crop. But, I cultivate the crop out of my own interest. I have been waiting for a good price in the last two years. The crop is still there on the farmfield and is yet to be harvested. If I don’t get a good remunerative price, it is better to leave the crop instead of spending money to transport the crop to the market,” he said. Mohan Reddy says the ginger crop can be left on the field for up to two years. Some farmers claimed that despite the direct benefit transfer scheme, they continue to be in a financial mess in what they attribute it to rising costs of cultivation. “Post-pandemic, labour expenses have increased doubly. Not only our labour costs have gone up, other incidental expenses have also seen a steep rise. Any changes in agriculture like switching over to other crops, etc., must be planned taking all the factors into account,” Malreddy, farmer from Kothagadi, pointed out. Farmers’ concerns on seed supply are not without a reason. Companies prepare seeds depending on the predicted demand for the season and when the farmers are in dire need of the seeds, the private firms may not have seed stocks. “That is why changing the crop pattern abruptly may cause havoc in farmers’ minds. Not only seed subsidy is accessible to farmers, getting quality seed is also another matter of concern for farmers if they have to switch over to alternate crops,” Ravi Kanneganti, state committee member of Rythu Swarjya Vedika, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/farmers-harp-on-price-stabilisation-seed-supply-ahead-of-paddy-switch/articleshow/87991133.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Siddharthsinh Chavda, a taxi-driver, said in his FIR with Pethapur police that his friend Ravi Dalal who is also his neighbour attacked him with a stick when he refused to keep a liquor bottle in his car on Saturday. Chavda said that Dalal called him up on Saturday evening and told him to accompany him to attend a friend’s wedding procession. He said that he took Dalal along with him in his car and began driving towards the marriage venue. Before reaching the marriage venue, Dalal told him to stop the car and told Chavda that he will keep a liquor bottle in the car to celebrate the wedding. But Chavda refused to keep the bottle and then began driving again towards the marriage venue. Dalal kept quiet there. They were returning after attending the marriage, when Dalal told him to stop at a tea stall in Pethapur. When they were having tea, Dalal raised the issue of not keeping the liquor bottle in the car. Before Chavda could clarify his stance, Dalal began thrashing him and then attacked him with a stick which was kept in Chavda’s car. Dalal fled and Chavda went to hospital for treatment. Chavda later filed a complaint of causing hurt with Pethapur police against Dalal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-attacked-for-refusing-to-keep-liquor-bottle-in-car/articleshow/87991134.cms||---

The transfers have been made, given the national medical council inspection in these new medical colleges. Doctors have protested against this transfer and have alleged that the health department is going for stop-gap arrangements instead of creating posts in the new medical colleges. The director of medical education has transferred 23 doctors to Konni and 16 doctors to Idukki medical colleges. Among them, a few have been transferred based on the working arrangement. They have been asked to report for duty with immediate effect. Among this, 12 doctors from Thiruvananthapuram, six from Kottayam, four from Thrissur and one doctor from Manjeri medical college have been transferred to Konni. To Idukki, six doctors from Thiruvananthapuram, four from Kozhikode, three from Kottayam and three from Thrissur have been transferred. Instead of creating new posts, the department is transferring doctors from existing medical college hospitals which will create deep trouble in the functioning of several departments, said Dr Benoy S, state president of Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA). It is a fact that in several medical college hospitals, including Thiruvananthapuram, surgeries are being postponed due to the shortage of doctors. This transfer has come during such a situation, he added. In addition to this, doctors from medical college hospitals are being appointed for Covid duty in several places. Apart from this comes the Sabarimala duty and also VIP duties. “It is an eyewash before the national medical council. For the headcount to parade doctors, we are being transferred like this. This is purely an unethical practice being done by the health department,” said Dr Nirmal Bhaskar, state secretary of KGMCTA. The association has warned of an agitation if the health department is not ready to withdraw this transfer order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/health-dept-transfers-docs-to-konni-idukki-medical-colleges/articleshow/87991137.cms||---
---||Delhi||Police had pressured witnesses to give statements: Khalid||New Delhi: Former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a northeast Delhi riots case, alleged before a court on Monday that police had pressured the witnesses to give statements. Khalid’s counsel further told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that if a protected witness was already in touch with police and informing them about the alleged planning of the riots, why did they allow it to take place. “He (protected witness) says that ‘I was regularly in touch with SHO who asked me to keep him updated’. So, the Seelampur SHO knew everything. How did we have riots in the city? This brilliant intelligence he had about this and he did not register an FIR. If you are in touch with the SHO, why did you not ensure that nothing went on?” senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, asked. He further alleged that the statements of four protected witnesses were written by the police and given to them to endorse. “For the Seelampur meeting, you (prosecution) have six witnesses. One witness absolutely has nothing on me. Another witness had nothing on me in the police statement, but introduced a provocative speech in a statement before the magistrate… A third witness is a person who was miraculously in touch with police since January and kept the SHO informed at every level but did nothing about it. One other witness is the only person who says there was a secret office, and not a meeting. No witness calls it a secret meeting. These statements without any doubt are procured,” the senior counsel argued. While reading out the statement of another protected witness, he pointed out that the witness did not mention about the secret meeting in his statement to police on April 16, and “miraculously remembered the meeting after seven days” in his statement given to the magistrate. Pais argued that one of the protected witnesses didn’t claim to be present at the meeting, but gave granular details of the meeting. “He (witness) doesn’t call it a secret meeting, but the chargesheet calls it a secret meeting,” Pais submitted. He added that advocacy against a law was not a crime.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/police-had-pressured-witnesses-to-give-statements-khalid/articleshow/87991769.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Denying the allegation of opposition leaders Edappadi K Palainiswami and O Panneerselvam that the state government had failed in taking up flood preventive measures, the minister said that the AIADMK had failed to improve the water management infrastructure in its tenure.Distributing aid to 469 families residing in the Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camp in Kottapattu, Nehru said that the Ariyar division of PWD was asked to prepare a detailed project report for a Rs 100-crore redevelopment work to strengthen the Korayar, Ariyar and Kodingal rivers. “If AIADMK had focussed on building and maintaining canals in the past 10 years, the floods would have been avoided,” he said. The minister said that a breach at Punganur village was attended by the authorities.“Some farmers have weakened the bund of the Ariyar leading to a breach. We will install motor pumps and erect retaining walls to prevent inundation,” Nehru added. School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi who was also present at the event said that the PWD was asked to inform the school education department about weak school buildings so that classes will not be conducted in such buildings.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/vulnerable-spots-in-koraiyar-kodingal-rivers-will-be-strengthened-nehru/articleshow/87992248.cms||---

As the arterial roads were inundated, youths formed human chains for pedestrians and two-wheeler riders to help them wade through the flood water safely.As the water level in the three main neighbourhoods of Trichy including Vayalur Road, Kuzhumani Road and Pirattiyur surged on Monday morning, a section of locals was quick to mobilise coracles from Kallanai in Thanjavur district. While the fire service and rescue personnel were rescuing a section of people in Lingam Nagar vicinity, local youths were quick to hire the coracles to rescue families with infants and children. Around 15-20 youths from the adjoining Marunthandakurichi village volunteered to rescue around 50 residents from the inundated Santhosh Estate locality falling under ward 60 of Trichy Corporation. Food prepared by the corporation for about 3,000 people were also handed over through the volunteers. “In the early hours, our friends in Lingam Nagar informed us about the rising water levels. We mobilised a team to wade through the hip-level water for rescuing senior citizens,” T Selvam, a volunteer in Kuzhumani road, said. Locals alerted car and load carrier owners to park their vehicles on high-lying areas. The coracles were used to guide the animals to safe shelters. Youths at Vayalur Road near MM Nagar and Shanmuga Nagar diverted traffic and helped the fire service vehicles reach the affected areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/locals-pitch-in-to-help-citizens-animals/articleshow/87992247.cms||---
---||Pune||Duo booked on charge of beating loan agent to death||Pune: The Bharati Vidyapeeth police have booked two moneylenders for allegedly assaulting an independent loan agent to his death at Ambegaon Pathar near Katraj-Dehu Road bypass around 1.30am on Monday. Police said victim Sharad Aware (27) had taken a loan of Rs1lakh from the duo. He was supposed to repay it in four instalments. Aware had paid three instalments, and only one instalment was pending. “We have established the identities of the two suspects and booked them. One is a resident of Kothrud, and another is a resident of Sus. Both had lent money to Aware and had abused and issued threats to him, demanding return of the money. Both do not have licence to work as moneylenders,” said senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police. Kalaskar said, “Aware was affiliated to a few non-banking financial institutions and used to process loans for individuals. At the same time, he used to take money on loan and lend it to others at higher interest rate.” “On Sunday, Aware, his wife and children had gone to Alandi to offer prayers. The family returned home around 10.30 pm when one of the suspects asked Aware to meet them immediately. The two reached Aware’s house, one sat pillion on his motorcycle while the other rode on another two-wheeler. After spotting an isolated spot, the duo assaulted him with a sharp weapon,” Kalaskar said. “Aware sustained injuries on his head, shoulders and chest,” Kalaskar said. Aware’s friend Prashant Mahadev Kadam (31) of Dhankawadi lodged a complaint with cops. “We identified the suspects after studying the phone record of Aware and the CCTV footage. A police team visited residences of the two men, but they were not found there,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/duo-booked-on-charge-of-beating-loan-agent-to-death/articleshow/87991138.cms||---

The state government has sanctioned Rs 653 crore for developing 1,075 such ‘missing link’ roads. Also, Rs 81 crore has been sanctioned for construction of 370 kms of non-patchable roads in all the assembly constituencies across the state. In the state government’s budget announcement it was proposed to sanction Rs 5 crore each for every assembly constituency for the construction of ‘missing link and non-patchable roads’. There are 200 assembly constituencies in the state. Public Works Department (PWD) minister Bhajanlal Jatav in his first review meeting with the officials of the department had stressed on the need of strengthening quality control and expanding road network apart from repairing roads that were damaged due to excessive rainfall in some parts of the state. He had directed the officials to initiate patching work on roads which fall under the defect liability period (DLP) by summoning the concerned contractors and take up repair of roads which have exceeded DLP through department funds. “The state government is committed for better accessibility to every village in Rajasthan,” the minister had said. He said would make efforts to identify such regions where the road network was not good and construction work would be initiated under various schemes of the state or central government in all such areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/2-3k-km-of-missing-link-roads-across-state-to-be-developed/articleshow/87991767.cms||---

The woman said that she got married on July 17, 2016, after which she began living with her in-laws in Kadi. She said that she had a habit of taking a nap after lunch, which did not go well with her husband and in-laws. “From the beginning, they used to object to me taking a siesta. As I used to wake up early in the morning, I could not keep myself awake in the afternoons,” she said. The woman said her husband and in-laws began harassing her for sleeping after lunch and later began thrashing her for it. When her husband thrashed her the first time, she filed an application with Kadi police, but they later struck a compromise and she again began living with him again. The woman said that her husband and in-laws did not help her when she was pregnant and sent her to her parents’ place. On September 18, 2017, she gave birth to a girl, which also did not go well with her in-laws and husband who harassed and thrashed her for not delivering a male child, she said. The woman alleged that her husband abandoned her on February 7, and even after the intervention of community leaders, her husband refused to take her back. She thus approached police and filed a complaint for domestic violence against her husband and in-laws.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/husband-in-laws-beat-woman-over-afternoon-rest/articleshow/87991226.cms||---

He said the government was ready to discuss all issues and answer all questions. Speaking to reporters just before the winter session started, Modi said, “I hope that in future, benchmark should be how the House functioned, how much contribution was made and not who made how much efforts to forcefully disrupt the session...benchmark should be how much productive work happened during the session.” He said citizens want that in this session as well as in the future ones, Parliament debates on issues of national interest and finds ways for development of the country in the spirit of those who fought for India’s independence. The PM also said as the country marks 75 years of India's independence “we would want that questions are raised in Parliament and also decorum is maintained”. He added that voices against government and its policies should be as forceful as possible but dignity of Parliament and the Chair should be maintained. “I hope that in this session, we speedily take decisions on issues of national interest which fulfil the expectations of the common people,” he said. He called for maintaining the sort of conduct in Parliament that would inspire younger generations. “This session of Parliament is very important. The country is celebrating Amrit Mahotsav. The people are making efforts and fulfilling their responsibilities in order to realise the dreams of those who fought for our independence,” the PM said. He also urged people to stay alert in the wake of the new variant of Covid-19, Omicron and also called on all MPs to be cautious as everyone’s health is a “priority in this hour of crisis”. The PM said India is moving towards the administration of 150 crore Covid vaccine doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judge-winter-session-by-work-done-not-disruptions-pm-modi/articleshow/87993014.cms||---

In a recently issued order, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil asked the civic body’s health department not to pick up garbage from the housing societies or shops if they fail to comply with the garbage segregation diktat. The order stated that as per the Centre’s 2016 guidelines, it is mandatory for establishments generating garbage to segregate at the source. Accordingly, all shop owners, including street vendors across all zones, will have to keep two dustbins with them to segregate garbage. Street vendors will have to comply with the same by December 15. Notably, the civic body collects around 1,200 tonnes of garbage every day, which is processed at Moshi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/segregate-waste-from-jan-1-or-pay-fine-pcmc/articleshow/87991152.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The average testing in the state over the past week was around 27,000 tests per day with a positivity rate under one per cent. However, with the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the virus, experts have pointed out the need to ramp up testing immediately so as to ensure that cases do not go unrecorded. “Currently, the spread is all related to travel and therefore stepping up testing is compulsory. Not just people travelling in from affected countries but also people who have come during the last 15 days need to be actively traced and tested,” said Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, director of Centre for Health Care Management at Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). Dr Kandamuthan said that if possible, each person coming in should undergo RT-PCR testing. “In future, everyone coming from designated at-risk countries needs to be tested and business travel from affected countries should be halted,” he added. Meanwhile, other health experts have suggested bringing back the tracking, testing and treatment model which was put in place during the first and second waves is the need of the hour. The need to ramp up RT-PCR testing has also been mooted. “Ample testing infrastructure needs to be operationalised to tackle any surge due to this mutated virus. It has been observed that the overall testing as well as the proportion of RT-PCR tests have declined in some states. In the absence of sufficient testing, it is extremely difficult to determine the true level of infection spread. States must strengthen the testing infrastructure and strictly implement the testing guidelines,” the Centre said in a recent letter to chief secretaries of all states.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/daily-testing-around-30k-experts-call-for-ramp-up-to-prevent-spread/articleshow/87991414.cms||Amrita Didyala

Launching the vaccination drive at the Masjid Mohammad Mustafa in Rajendranagar on Monday, AIMIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi emphasised, “A good vaccinated population will reduce the risk of hospitalizations and mortality.” To help these efforts, the Helping Hand Foundation (HHF) – an NGO – along with SEED, a US-based government organisation will be taking up immunisation drives at mosques and bastis. Over 100 volunteers, counsellors, vaccinators, data operators, supervisors, along with support personnel from mosques will help the immunization efforts set to take place over six months. Volunteers will be going door to door in slums to inoculate residents. According to a preliminary assessment, vaccine coverage in Old City areas is still low, with 35 per cent of eligible adults yet to take their first dose while around 67 per cent have not taken their second dose. The drive will be led by three mosques in Rajendranagar, Hasanagar and Shaheen Nagar which operate basic health care centres. Imams will also be debunking rumours over vaccines at sermons during the course of Friday prayers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/mosques-to-help-boost-vax-coverage/articleshow/87991436.cms||---

The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker said that it resumed exporting Covaxin this month and plans to step up exports further as part of efforts to make Covaxin an integral part of the global fight against the pandemic. “Long pending export orders have been executed during November, to be further expanded during the following months. With the number of countries that have granted emergency use approvals for Covaxin increasing, exports to additional countries will also commence from December,” Bharat Biotech said on Monday. While the company did not provide details of countries to which exports have been resumed, company sources said the first set of shipments are being delivered to about 8-10 countries. “Emergency Use Authorisations (EUA) have been granted by more than 20 countries. Regulatory approvals are in process in more than 60 countries,” a company source said. “Several countries also evaluating Covaxin as booster doses In adults and for children,” the source added. Bharat Biotech was granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on November 3 following which several countries granted automatic emergency use approval, even as others like US, UK, Canada, among others, granted recognition to the `Made in India’ vaccine enabling those vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine to travel internationally without having to undergo quarantine. The two-dose, inactivated whole virus vaccine has been developed by Bharat Biotech along with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/bharat-biotech-resumes-covaxin-exports/articleshow/87991486.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

"Second, with the state government granting persons with disabilities (PwDs) below poverty line (BPL) status, reservation in NREGA work must be allowed for them. Granting them the BPL status means the state government believes that they need extra cover in social security schemes," he added. "Third, the state government has increased the number of days of work for them under NREGA to 200 days," he said. "Fourth, it has been promised to make them financially independent in the Congress party’s Jan Ghosna Patra. I had cited these four points in the disability court advocating need for giving them 4% reservation in NREGA work," said Goyal. Based on petition filed by Rajasthan wing of Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh, the court of chief commissioner for persons with disability had directed department of empowerment of PwD, under ministry of social justice department, to introduce a central policy to ensure 4% reservation for specially-abled persons in NREGA work. tnn||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/grant-4-quota-in-nrega-job-for-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/87991779.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||In municipal poll pitch, Nadda says AAP govt is obstructing schemes||New Delhi: BJP chief J P Nadda on Monday said the Aam Aadmi Party government had obstructed many central welfare schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Ujjwala Yojna, and urged people to vote for BJP during the municipal elections next year. Nadda was speaking at a public function organised by Delhi BJP in Anand Parbat to mark the conclusion of Jhuggi Samman Yatra organised over a long period to interact with people living in slums. The conclusion of the event was seen as an informal launch of the civic election campaign by BJP. Nadda claimed that the AAP government was only blaming others for its problems while failing to address even basic issues like water supply in slums. The Kejriwal government “talked about procuring vaccines on its own, but within 10 days, took a U-turn and put up the demands of vaccine before the central government”, Nadda said. He also claimed that the people of Delhi were not getting clean water and illegal water tankers were growing. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s handling of Covid-19, Nadda claimed Modi had ensured that nobody slept hungry. “Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, the Modi government distributed free ration to over 80 crore people. But some people used the ration to distribute under their own name,” he alleged. He said over 70 lakh eligible people were deprived of Ayushman Bharat in the capital. “I had asked Kejriwal not to let his ego obstruct the scheme,” Nadda said. He asked party workers to inform people about the AAP government not implementing it. During Jhuggi Samman Yatra, Delhi BJP provided free gas connection to 6,793 families and employment loan to 10,840 people. It has covered several slum clusters located under 31 assembly constituencies and Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and several other functionaries took part in the programme. Nadda said BJP was committed to the welfare of slum dwellers and ensure that they got empowered. Gupta said the yatrta was conducted in honour of around 25 lakh people living in the slums. No reaction from the AAP government was available despite TOI’s attempts.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/in-municipal-poll-pitch-nadda-says-aap-govt-is-obstructing-schemes/articleshow/87991805.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the order, the director of transport stated that the licences of vehicles without meters be “cancelled immediately”. “The registered owner is further directed to surrender the permit in the office of State Transport Authority, directorate of transport, Junta House, Panaji, within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order,” transport director Rajan Satardekar stated in the order. The transport department submitted to the high court that 5,732 taxis have been fitted with the digital fare meters and that enforcement agencies have issued challans to 1,457 vehicles who have not installed the meters. They also stated that they are checking taxis to ascertain whether the meters have been installed. “The permit holder will have the option of installing the meter within one month if the offence is to be compounded, failing which, the proceedings will continue before the magistrate,” Satardekar submitted to the high court. With the number of bookings piling up, the directorate of transport called for a meeting of the two agencies carrying out installation of digital meters to increase the pace of installations. Both the agencies were directed to take proactive steps to improve inventory and increase fitment capacity so that the process of installation can be completed at the earliest. The transport department stated that the process of enforcement will continue and that it will also continue to monitor the process of installation of the meters by the two agencies. The high court has been monitoring the installation of digital fare meters after petitions and contempt petitions were filed by the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa and other tourism stakeholders highlighting the government’s dragging of feet over the issue.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/state-to-cancel-licences-of-taxis-without-digital-meters/articleshow/87991821.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Earlier, the court had directed schools to not compel parents to send their wards to school for physical classes if they were not inclined to do so.

---||Hyderabad||Health department pushes to up vaccine coverage in Telangana districts||HYDERABAD: While the state has 83 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine on hand, 25 lakh people are due for the second dose. Concerned about their reluctance to take the dose immediately, the health department set up call centres in some districts to approach them and tell them about the importance of getting the jab.  The call centres will be reaching out to individuals who have not taken their second dose even as senior officials warned against any laxity on the part of those who are not inoculated yet. According to health officials, since there has been no increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in recent months many people are under the impression that there is no need to take the vaccine right away. “This is wrong thinking. Doses must be taken before the spike occurs. People should know that dosages do not provide instant immunity as they take some time to settle down,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health. Previously, the state administration had asked the central government to consider narrowing the gap between the two dosages of Covishield after the officials proposed that the current dosage interval between the two doses be lowered to 42 days from 84 days. Senior officials, who recently met with representatives of the World Health Organisation, discussed the vaccine coverage. It was observed that there were over 30 lakh people in Telangana who have not received even a single dosage of immunisation. Interestingly, when compared to the targeted eligible population to be vaccinated, Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts have a higher percentage of first dose vaccine coverage. While the targeted population in Hyderabad is 31,44,002, 32,94,100 first doses were administered, bringing the first dose coverage to 106%. Similarly, in neighbouring Rangareddy district, against a target population of 23,28,538, almost 105% first dose coverage was seen. According to official sources, the higher coverage is most likely attributable to floating population and a higher population density. Both districts are also ahead of the state in terms of second dose coverage, with approximately 67% (22 lakh people) in Hyderabad city having received their second dosage and 71% (15.5 lakh people) in Rangareddy district taking their second shot.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/health-dept-pushes-to-up-vax-coverage-in-districts/articleshow/87991396.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Mumbai||National Film Archive preserving amateur movies to map cultural heritage||MUMBAI: A jerky video shows a sari-clad woman in her 50s seated cross-legged on a carpet with a bow-stringed instrument resting on her lap. The camera pans around what looks like a traditional Rajasthani living room before zooming into her left hand moving gracefully along the fret and her right hand bowing a raag. This domestic scene shot on an 8mm handheld camera sometime in the late ’70s is both ordinary and exceptional at once. The familiar tropes of a classic home movie is what makes it ordinary while a family film captured on an amateur camera is made exceptional by the esraj, an instrument that’s almost obsolete today and its player, a middle-class woman—together, an uncommon combination at the time. This footage of astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar’s mother on a typical day in their Jodhpur home has recently been preserved as an archival artifact at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) in Pune.  Lord Wavell, viceroy and governor general of India at the time greeting leaders at the 1945 Simla conference.“Any form of moving image is heritage and documents a particular space and time historically. Naturally, Dr Narlikar’s mother, a Sanskrit scholar, playing the ‘esraj’ is interesting because a middle-class woman playing a string instrument that very few people play today is a private moment that can now be safely termed as a social document,” said Prakash Magdum, director NFAI describing another Narlikar home video where one sees an elephant wandering into their porch in Jodhpur and the family feeding it bananas. “Everything about it was fascinating from a regional perspective.” Over the past six years, the NFAI has been collecting everyday, ordinary home movies and amateur films—usually considered an irrelevant pastime or nostalgic memento from the past—for preservation as archival objects in order to document stories of cultural or historical relevance. People’s private movies featuring family activities, a vacation, or a special occasion came to hold interest for an institution that has primarily worked for over five decades on acquiring and preserving the heritage of Indian cinema in 2014 when Indian physicist Homi Bhabha’s Mumbai house went up for auction. “A stack of films were discovered in his bathroom shot by Bhabha. We came to know of this when Suresh Chandvankar of TIFR, an avid collector of gramophone records, came to us with one of the spools. It was in a damaged state given Mumbai’s weather conditions and for being locked up for years,” says Magdum who reached out to the various institutions associated with Bhabha hoping to retrieve his other films but in vain. “That spurred us to look for more such material on a larger scale and NFAI adopted a strategy to welcome all moving image materials in every format. Following our wide outreach through social media and online platforms as well as through personal and professional circles, people started reaching out to us,” said Magdum. Since then, the NFAI has archived a number of home movies shot in 8mm and 16mm, Super 8 cameras, 16mm beta tapes, VHS and MiniDV cassettes. Describing the value and potential usage of private home movies, Magdum explained how home movies could help draw meaning out of where and why an amateur footage was shot. “It gives us the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific era and also helps us explore the regional history, informal tours, and events in common people’s lives, as opposed to the visual imagery we see on mainstream media and films.” This was evident in a precious 12-minute footage that NFAI received from UK-based Margaret South two years ago when South, while cleaning her house, stumbled upon 8mm home videos shot by her father William Taylor, a Royal India Naval officer in the ’40s. Taylor while shooting his personal travelogue on a trip to Himachal Pradesh had managed to capture historical moments of the 1945 Simla Conference. “His visit happened to coincide with the conference of which he had a rare view. He must have shot these from a balcony which is why most of them are top angle shots and captures many prominent national leaders at the conference, including Mahatma Gandhi, Maulana Azad, C Rajagopalachari, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Rajendra Prasad, Bhulabhai Desai and others.” The black and white reel also shows Gandhi walking back after the meeting at the Viceregal Lodge and Lord Wavell, viceroy and governor general of India at the time along with his wife, greeting leaders and exchanging pleasantries on the lawns. Not just the people in the movies but often just small mundane details about a room or the backyard, toys, cars and celebrations contain unique documentation of a way of life. For instance, a 1954 footage from the inauguration of Deccan Education Society’s New English School in Pune that NFAI now has in its possession features the then vice-president of India Dr S Radhakrishan arriving on a train and cars passing through Tilak Road. “It’s important also because it was shot in colour, a rarity in the 1950s.” The mere backgrounds of some of these films are of historical interest. For instance, footage of the first oil engine export from Kirloskar Oil Engine taking off from Pune airport during ’70s—donated to NFAI by the Kirloskar family—apart from providing a perspective of the company’s history, offers a glimpse of what the Pune airport looked like in that era. Six 16mm home video reels shot by photographer Punalur Rajan, documenting a day in the life of legendary Malayalam writer Vaikkom Mohammed Basheer also features a young PT Usha running in a national level athletics championship in Kerala. In NFAI’s pursuit of trying to resurrect people’s personal stories of the past, home movies are no longer reels carelessly tossed in a shoebox or stored in the loft. “We’ve been receiving films in conditions ranging from good to almost unsalvageable. Irrespective of that, we’re carrying out repairs of every material we receive and in the process of digitizing some of the footage,” said Magdum, assuring that the archives would soon make the material accessible for research and educational purposes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/national-film-archive-preserving-amateur-movies-to-map-cultural-heritage/articleshow/87988545.cms||Mohua Das

At this juncture, we don’t want to stop offline classes abruptly and create panic,” said S Narsimha Reddy, principal, The Hyderabad Public School Ramanthapur and chairperson, Hyderabad Sahodaya Schools Complex. He said that right from primary schools, the attendance percentage has improved lately with about 70% to 80% of students attending physical classes regularly. “Government has already started checking passengers in the airport. We will wait until the state makes a decision on whether or not schools can continue physical classes,” said S Srinivas Reddy, honorary president, Telangana Recognised School Management Association. Budget school managements said that if the state announces lockdown and schools had to be shut again, more than 50% of schools will not be able to survive. They said that even now they are finding it difficult to hire quality teachers as many have left the teaching field and are reluctant to come back. When it comes to government schools, teachers said that there has been a slight increase in the number of absentees in the last few days. “Several students are down with fever, cold, and other Covid-19 symptoms. Further, with increased coverage on omicron, it looks are parents are again hesitating to send their wards to school,” said M Ravindar, a math teacher and vice-president of Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/schools-in-city-reluctant-to-revert-to-online-mode/articleshow/87991424.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A teacher also tested positive. This is the third incident of students testing positive in educational institutions of Telangana in the last 10 days. Mahindra University near Hyderabad was shut down after 25 students and five staff members tested positive for the virus last week. Reports of the students of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Gurukul School came positive in the rapid antigen test (RAT). It all began when a girl student from Adilabad, who had fever, cough and cold, was taken to Hyderabad where it was confirmed that she had Covid-19. When this information was passed on to the school and health authorities, tests were conducted for all the 470 students, 26 staff members and 10 workers on Sunday. Out of these, 48 students and the teacher tested positive. “None of the students or the staff member who tested positive has shown any symptoms of the virus. They have been quarantined on separate floors on the hostel premises. There are no health complications,” DMHO Dr G Gayatri Devi said. In the gurukul school, the authorities quarantined five students in each room and the samples of the students who tested positive have been sent to Hyderabad for genome sequencing. Following the incident, the district administration has asked the education and health officials to keep a daily check at the hostels and institutions. They have been told to get Covid-19 tests done for the students if they show any symptoms. As many as 28 students had tested positive for Covid-19 at the social welfare residential school at Wyra in Khammam a week ago. It may be recalled educational institutions in the state had reopened on September 1. The Telangana high court allowed the reopening of residential schools in October last week following an assurance from the education department.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fresh-covid-scare-in-t-as-48-gurukul-students-test-ve/articleshow/87991409.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Masks drop even as new Covid variant looms||HYDERABAD: Even as the threat of new variant of Covid-19, Omicron, looms and government prepares to tackle a possible surge in Covid-19 cases, mask compliance in the city is at an all time low. Only around 30 per cent of the population is wearing masks, say officials. During the first wave the compliance was nearly 100 per cent, which slowly slipped over the months, especially after the peak of the second wave, say authorities. “Mask compliance has gone down significantly over the last few months. Currently 30% of the population is only wearing masks and many are not wearing them correctly,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director, public health, Telangana. Rao blames people’s misplaced sense of complacency after taking Covid vaccines for the drop in mask usage. Dr Srinivasa Rao stressed on masks still being the best precautionary measure. “Masks have been called ‘vaccines in your pocket’ and have been found to be highly effective, especially in indoor settings,” the state health director explained. Even in risk-prone settings such as hospitals, doctors say, patients walk in without masks. “There are so many people coming to the emergency room without even having a mask on. We have to keep masks to ensure that anyone who enters has it on,” said a doctor at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). Even among people wearing masks, many are not wearing them correctly. “Proper use of masks limits the volume and distance of expiratory droplets dispersed while talking, coughing and sneezing. Not wearing a mask increases the risk of transmission six times,” said Dr Anil Krishna, chairman and managing director, Medicover group of hospitals India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/masks-drop-even-as-new-variant-looms/articleshow/87991375.cms||Amrita Didyala

Task forces have been formed to monitor the Covid-19 situation in both universities with guidelines issued to all stakeholders. As a matter of precaution, Manuu has decided not to call newly-admitted students who were supposed to join the academic activities from December 7. “Their classes and other academic activities will continue in online mode only, until further orders,” dean of student of welfare at Manuu, Profesor Syed Aleem Ashraf said in a statement. First-semester students, except PhD candidates, were asked to stay at home and not proceed with their journey. A similar advisory was issued by the UoH task force with students told to keep their guards up in view of super spreader events being reported in various closed educational institutions. “It is alarming that many stakeholders seem to have discontinued Covid-appropriate behaviour on the campus. Also alarming is that the campus seems to have returned to working as if during pre-Covid 19 times,” read the advisory. “The campus may be restrained by the state and central government authorities if we let our guard down. The university cannot afford a super spreader event that will again affect our academic and research activities,” the UoH advisory said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/uoh-manuu-intensify-vigil-on-campus/articleshow/87991383.cms||---

The civic body has prepared a proposal for the project and forwarded it to the deliberative wing for approval before calling tender. A similar project has already been implemented by New Delhi Municipal Council in its areas. “The project has been planned because EDMC has limited staff and equipment to punish the violators. In the past, we made attempts and installed boards warning people for strict action if they found parking vehicles on roadsides. But with limited staff and equipment, reaching everywhere is difficult,” said an official. The concessionaire will be given six-month time to obtain machinery, staff and make other preparations before initiating action on ground. “It will be given areas/sites in a phased manner for action. For example, we will ask them to initially target highly congested roads where roads are used for permanent parking and later pay attention to congested and other areas. A drive will be carried out on priority in areas such as Laxmi Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Geeta Colony, etc. The concessionaire will be given the right to issue challan equal to the weight of the vehicle, as per DMC Act,” said the official. To ensure parking of lifted/challaned vehicles, the civic body is in the process of identifying open sites in different areas. “The amount collected from the defaulters will be transferred into an account, which can be accessed by EDMC also. The concessionaire will also need to give details of the number of vehicles challaned everyday on an online portal,” said the official. Of the total amount collected as fines from the defaulters, the concessionaire will share 30% with EDMC on a monthly basis. “The final rates will be decided only after the proposal gets approval from the deliberative wing,” said the official further. The civic body, meanwhile, claims to be working on proposals for developing multilevel parking on important stretches such as near Vikas Marg (Laxmi Nagar).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/short-staffed-east-corpn-looks-for-pvt-player-to-clear-parking-mess/articleshow/87991813.cms||Vibha Sharma

Wholesale traders on Sunday said caterers engaged in weddings are purchasing the items in bulk during marriage season which is leading to demand and rising prices. Traders however said in next week, prices would slide.“Though a dip in wholesale and retail prices of onions have started, the demand is still high. We are getting customers purchasing onions and tomatoes in quintals right from the mandi itself,” said Abdul Sagir, a wholesaler at Mohana Mandi. Onions are being sold at a price of Rs 35 to Rs 40 per kg, a slight dip in price compared to last few months. “Since the locally harvested onions have started coming, I hope prices will go down further,” said Shiv Shankar Sharma, a wholesaler at Mohana Mandi. On the other hand, tomatoes are been sold between Rs 60 and Rs 80 per kg. “Wholesale prices of tomatoes have been showing a dipping trend since Friday, but it will take another week to see its retail price below Rs 50 per kg. With its supply, we are expecting its wholesale prices to be Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg, which will lead to a retail price of around Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg by the first week of December,” said Vishnu Samtani, a wholesaler at Hasanpura situated vegetable market. Prices of tomatoes had started increasing from mid-September and remained steady at Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg. “We have now started getting tomatoes from the local market including Bagru, Bassi, Dudu, Newta, Hathoj and other parts of Jaipur.

---||Vijayawada||Regional dev councils to make comeback||Vijayawada: The state government is actively considering the proposal to create regional development councils in the state. According to the available information, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is keen on creating the councils. The chief minister has proposed four regional councils in the state representing 13 districts. Regional development councils were initially created in 1970s by the Congress government with MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other political representatives and some officials as members. However, when TDP came to power in 1983, the then chief minister NT Rama Rao dissolved these councils on the ground that they have become political and duplication of the cabinet. There were only three regional development councils then – Andhra, Rayalaseema and Telangana – covering all the three regions of the state. However, when the separate Telangana movement was at its peak after the death of Dr Rajasekhar Reddy in 2009, N Kiran Kumar Reddy, who succeeded K Rosaiah as the chief minister in November 2010, revived the councils in 2012-13. He created four regional development councils representing north coastal Andhra, south coastal Andhra, Rayalaseema and Telangana regions. These four councils too lived a short time as the state was bifurcated in 2014 and they had little time to sit down and plan for their regions as the state was boiling with Telangana agitation on one side and the Samaikhyandhra agitation on the other. After bifurcation, Chandrababu Naidu-led government was busy with capital-related issues and had no time to think of regional development councils. Now, having completed two-and-a-half years in office, chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is said to be looking at reviving these councils. This time, he is said to have proposed creation of four councils - at Visakhapatnam for north Andhra, Rajamahendravaram for the two Godavari districts and Krishna, Ongole for south coastal districts and at Kurnool for the entire Rayalaseema region. Sources say Jagan is looking at the possible names to head these councils, while the officials are working on the modalities. The councils are likely to be announced after Pongal, the sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/regional-dev-councils-to-make-comeback/articleshow/87990525.cms||Gopi Dara

Now, work has resumed after JDA intervention and the project is expected to be completed within 2 months.”The project, which was due to be completed January 2019, has already been delayed almost by two years. The work of approximately Rs 250 crore project started in December, 2016 . The work to connect the new elevated road with the existing Ajmer Road elevated road, which was constructed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, will also be started by the civic body.As per the plan, there was a provision to connect both the elevated roads. Commuters travelling the entire 2.8 km stretch will ascend at Shyam Nagar, Sabzi Mandi, before the junction using existing ramp of the Ajmer Road elevated road.Under the project, four ramps would be constructed for traffic to ascend and descend from elevated road. Once completed, a commuter will reach Ajmer Road via Hawa Sadak within 10 minutes.Commuters travelling from Ambedkar Circle will have an option to ascend at Nandpuri near Hilton Hotel using the ramp. An engineer said, “Two ascending ramps for commuters plying between Ambedkar Circle and Ajmer Road will benefit many. If the ramp was not constructed at Nandpuri, people living in the area would have avoided using the elevated road as they had to take a U-turn from Sodala to reach their destination.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jda-will-miss-dec-deadline-to-complete-sodala-flyover/articleshow/87991806.cms||---

From a mound, known locally as the ‘Katha mound’ in Khekhra, Jain found 16 coins made of silver and copper which have a bull and a horseman engraved on them. Some of the coins, he says, are from the late 12th century AD, which is the era of Rajput king Prithviraj Chauhan's rule. "I keep frequenting the area, which is rich in archaeological finds. This time, it revealed something considered fascinating in Indian numismatics. The coins which I found belong to a series of Rajput rulers who remained dominant in the region comprising Rajasthan, Haryana, and the western Gangetic plains from the eighth century to 12th century AD," said Jain, who is a member of the Culture & History Association, an organisation comprising historians from western Uttar Pradesh. K K Sharma, head of the department of history, Multanimal Modi College, Modinagar, confirming the coins' antiquity, told TOI,"This is an interesting find as the area remained with Rajput kings for a couple of centuries. Horse and bull inscriptions on coins were quite common in those days." He added, "Horses used to be the primary vehicle of soldiers during battles and their depiction on coins is not a surprise. In fact, close to two dozen rulers between the seventh and 17th centuries used horses in some form or the other on their coins.” Incidentally, Baghpat is well-known for the discovery of interesting historical artifacts, the most sensational being three chariots unearthed during the Archaeological Survey of India excavation held in Sinauli in June 2018, which marked the "first-ever" physical evidence of Bronze Age chariots in India. In 2014, a human skull with a copper crown, which historians say belongs to the Harappan culture, was discovered in village Chandayan, some 20 kilometers from Sinauli. In 2006, Sinauli had revealed Harappan-era burial grounds where several discoveries were made such as that of painted grey ware pottery, skeletons, bronze swords, and copper vessels.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/silver-coins-dating-to-prithviraj-chauhans-era-found-in-baghpat/articleshow/87990548.cms||Sandeep Rai

Known for famous poems like 'Ho gayi peer parvat si, pighalni chahiye', 'Saaye mein dhoop' and 'Kaun kehta hai aasman pe surakh nhi hota,' his works have inspired many and also featured in tele-serials and a few Bollywood films, including Irada, Singh Sahab, Halla Bol, Masaan, etc. "A proposal for a museum is being prepared, and it will be shared with the state and central governments," said DM Umesh Kumar Mishra. Recently, a police picket was also named after him in Bijnor. The cost of the museum will be borne jointly by the Central and state governments, he added. The postal department had earlier released a commemorative stamp with Kumar's image on it in September 2009. The legendary poet was born in 1931 in Rajpur Navada village, Bijnor, and died in Bhopal in 1975 at the age of 44. Poet Kumar's sons, Alok Tyagi and Apoorv Tyagi, along with the district magistrate, visited their village on Sunday. Speaking to TOI, Alok Tyagi said, "We have handed a consent letter to the DM so that our old house building can be developed as a museum in memory of my father. He had spent his childhood here." "My heart beams with pride on my father's accomplishments. The Indian department of posts issued a commemorative stamp with his image on it and a museum dedicated to him exists in CTT Nagar in Bhopal," said Alok Tyagi. According to social worker Ashok Madhup, “Ghazal emperor Dushyant Kumar is known for his poems across the country. Unfortunately, little has been done in his name in his own district. The efforts to develop his old house as a museum that will house his literary works are laudable." "I have recently met Union minister Arjun Meghwal and raised the issue of building a museum to house the literary works of the great poet, and he readily accepted the suggestion. The Bijnor district administration is preparing a proposal for the same," said BJP's MLC Ashwani Tyagi. The poem 'Ho gayi peer parvat si, pighalni chahiye' was sung by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal during the anti-corruption movement (2011-12) in India.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/renowned-poet-dushyant-kumars-bijnor-house-to-be-converted-into-museum/articleshow/87990559.cms||Harveer Dabas

No one was injured, but the entire facility was damaged. Four fire tenders of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) and the Pune Municipal Corporation reached the spot and extinguished the blaze around 2am. Sujit Patil, the station duty officer of PMRDA fire station, told TOI, “When we reached the spot, the entire restaurant had caught fire. It had a lot of furniture and the interiors were done in plywood.” He said, “We suspect that a short circuit in the false ceiling might be the reason behind the fire.

Every year, RU sells around 3,500 flower plants after the exhibition. This year, due to the pandemic and shortage of staff, instead of December beginning, the exhibition will be organised from December 13 to 15. The nursery at RU is spread across 6.5 acres of land. At one point, it had 180 gardeners which are now down to 20 permanent personnel. The two gardeners are appointed in colleges and rest in the university nursery. According to the university administration, within four years when the permanent ones will retire, it will be difficult for the university to maintain the nursery.Ramavtar Sharma, manager of the nursery, has requested the state government for appointment on the posts of gardener. “A gardener on contract will not be able to work as efficiently as a permanent one. We have maintained the nursery so well and will do even better if we get more staff,” said Sharma.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/ru-facing-shortage-of-gardeners/articleshow/87991812.cms||---

The couple were from Mumbai’s Masjid Bunder area. The police said the couple were travelling in the car with their six-year-old daughter. The car worth Rs5 lakh was also seized. A case was registered against them, and the two were arrested under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. A team headed by deputy commissioner of police (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge, police inspector Vinayak Gaikwad and assistant inspector Laxman Dhengle arrested Mohammedafjal Abdulsattar Nagori (40) and his wife Shabana (38) after receiving a tip-off.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Safari rates likely to be hiked by 10% at Sariska Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The forest administration at Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) has initiated an exercise to increase the safari rates by 10%. A proposal has also been mooted to revise the rates for nature guides and drivers after a gap of nearly three years. Field director of Sariska Tiger Reserve, R N Meena said, “The proposal received a nod in the local advisory board (LAC) meeting. Now, it will be tabled in a meeting chaired by forest minister on December 7 for final approval.” At present, gypsy booking price per person is Rs 854 and canter price is Rs 520 per person for the domestic tourists. Similarly, gypsy booking price for international tourists is Rs 1,484 and canter booking price is Rs 1,040. “The prices will be increased by 10%,” said a forest official. Though it appears to be an additional burden for the tourists, the move has been welcomed by the stakeholders. LAC member, Dinesh Durani said, “At Sariska the nature guides and drivers are comparatively getting way less than their counterparts in other parks and tiger reserves. The increase in price is an exercise to maintain uniformity in pay scale of front staff.” The proposals to develop new routes will be also tabled in front of the minister. As per NTCA norms, a maximum 20% of the core/critical tiger habitat can be used for regulated tourism. In Sariska, there are many tigers in Talvriksha range, but there are no safari and monitoring zones. “The park is near the NCR and more zones should be opened to reap the benefits,” said another forest official. The reserve is spread across an area of 1,281 sq km and is divided into six ranges. Though the tiger population has increased to 23, sightings are considerably poor. A source in the forest department said, “At present, there are only three zones at STR. There are times when tigers are not sighted for a week.” STR, once infamous for poaching, has scripted a remarkable success story in tiger conservation with five cubs born in the park this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/safari-rates-likely-to-be-hiked-by-10-at-sariska/articleshow/87991815.cms||---
---||India||Opposition slams suspension of MPs, plans House boycott||NEW DELHI: The opposition “unitedly condemned the unwarranted and undemocratic” suspension of 12 MPs from the Rajya Sabha, amid strong suggestions from parties that they should jointly boycott the winter session if the government does not revoke the decision. The opposition will meet in the leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge‘s office on Tuesday morning for a decision on the future course of action. However, well placed opposition sources late evening said that the possibility of a compromise was not ruled out, after a request for the revocation of the suspension order is made on Tuesday. The suspended MPs may meet the chairman of RS in his office as part of resolution to the suspension. Lashing out at the “authoritarian” order, a bloc of 14 like-minded parties issued a statement alleging that suspension of members for an unfortunate incident that occurred in the previous session violated the “rules of procedure and conduct of business of Rajya sabha”. When the opposition parties met in the evening to discuss the issue, there were suggestions from agitated members that the bloc should withdraw from the entire session if the suspension is not revoked. RJD MP Manoj Jha confirmed that the opposition was contemplating a boycott of the session. It is learnt that Kharge reached out to several parties whose leadership was not present in the meeting to elicit their views. The opposition statement was not signed by the TMC which did not attend the strategy meeting called by Kharge in the morning and evening both. However, TMC separately condemned the suspension which also includes its MP. Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury termed the suspension as “government vendetta”. CPM MP Elamaram Kareem said, “The BJP government is turning the Parliament into a hotbed of democratic destruction.” Congress MP Jairam Ramesh pointed to the irony that eight opposition MPs were suspended when farm laws were being passed in September 2021, while 12 MPs have been suspended after the farm laws have been repealed. Partap Bajwa said it was unprecedented that members should be punished for actions in the previous session. He said members had reacted emotionally to the prevailing sentiment over the passage of the farm bills, and they could not be expected to sit at home when there were stirs all over.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-slams-suspension-of-mps-plans-house-boycott/articleshow/87993038.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Primary classes get govt stamp to begin tomorrow||PUNE: Clearing the confusion among parents and teachers, the state’s school education department on Monday evening, issued a government resolution declaring the physical reopening of classes for Stds I to IV in rural areas and for Stds I to VII in urban areas from December 1. However, education commissioner Vishal Solanki clarified that the state education department has only given an in-principle approval for the reopening and if the local authorities feel that there is a Covid-19 threat in the area, they can withhold or postpone the decision to reopen. When the decision was announced, many parents had expressed anxiety about schools making it compulsory for students to attend the classes in person. Allaying their fears, school education minister, Varsha Gaikwad tweeted on Monday that the consent of the parents is of utmost importance. “Parents will have the final say on the physical presence of their wards in schools as attendance norms have been relaxed in schools. Schools will also work in shifts or on alternate days to ensure that only 15-20 students are present in class at a given time. One student will be seated per bench; a distance of 6 ft between benches will be maintained,” her tweet said. Amid fears about the new variant, state health minister Rajesh Tope, who spoke to reporters in Jalna, said that there is no change in the decision to reopen the schools as “Omicron variant has not been found in our state and there is no need for any fear of it at the moment”. Nashik Municipal Corporation has already decided to put the decision to reopen schools on hold till December 10. Education officer Sunita Dhangar cited the new strain of the Covid 19 virus as the reason. “We have little information about this new strain as of now. Following a discussion with the commissioner and deputy director of education for Nashik division, the decision to reopen has been deferred. However, this will not affect the classes from VIII onwards that have already reopened,” she added. Solanki said, “Till now the authorities could not have reopened the schools on their own. So, we gave a go-ahead which gives them an option to reopen the schools physically from Std I onwards. But they can always withhold or postpone the actual reopening depending on the Covid-19 cases or the likelihood of a new outbreak. That decision cannot be taken at the state level. The Covid-19 situation in every district, every taluka can change on a daily basis and accordingly the local authorities can decide for their own areas.” In her tweets, Gaikwad also said that only fully vaccinated staff will be allowed on premises including school transport operators. “School hours will be limited to 3-4 hours per day. No cultural or sporting events requiring a gathering will be permitted in schools. Schools will provide isolation facilities and need to tie up with the local health department for any emergency situation. In the event of the sickness of the student or a family member, the student is advised to stay at home. It will be the responsibility of the school to ensure such a student’s learning gap is compensated by the school,” she added in her tweets. Gaikwad also wrote that the focus in the first two weeks of school reopening will be to acclimatise and re-orient students towards attending physical classes. “Schools need to ease students into regular coursework. The government is sensitive to the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic and no laxity in implementation of SOPs will be permitted,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/primary-classes-get-govt-stamp-to-begin-tomorrow/articleshow/87991191.cms||Ardhra Nair

In a tweet, he wrote: "UPTET exam paper leak is like playing with the future of lakhs of youth. Action on small fish in this swamp will not work. The government should take strict action against the education mafia and their political patrons. Most of the educational institutions are owned by political influencers, when will action be taken against them?" The Pilibhit MP also shared a video clip explaining the importance of education. In the clip, a mason from a rural area can be heard telling a news reporter, “we don’t need food or clothes from the government, we need better education.” Varun’s tweet soon went viral online and was re-tweeted over 3,000 times, till the time of filing this report. It drew criticism from a few social media users as well. The BJP leader has been lately vocal on social media against his own government over the handling of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case. UPTET 2021, scheduled on Sunday, was cancelled due to the paper leak. Several candidates were stopped in the middle of their exam centres. At least 26 people have been arrested so far and chief minister Yogi Adityanath had promised to slap the National Security Act (NSA) and Gangster Act against the accused, and their properties would be seized. The CM, in a tweet, had also stated that the state government is standing firm with the UPTET candidates and a re-exam will be held in a transparent manner within a month.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/uptet-paper-leak-varun-gandhi-demands-action-against-political-patrons-of-education-mafia/articleshow/87990568.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

During a review meeting on Monday, it was observed that many residential houses, industrial buildings, commercial buildings and institutional buildings etc had not complied with the order of mandatory installation of solar power plant in Chandigarh. UT adviser Dharam Pal said directions have been issued asking all such building owners to install solar power plants as per building bylaws immediately, failing which necessary action would be taken against them. The administration had recently filed filed a review petition before the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) for implementation of Resco (Renewable Energy Service Company) model for solar plant installation in the city. The power regulatory commission had turned down the UT administration’s plea for implementing Resco model. The Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest), had moved JERC for implementing Resco model in city. Crest, nodal officer for the project, had proposed this model after approval of former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore, as residents were wary of the initial capital investment. Box: UT generates 46 MW solar power The ministry of new and renewable energy has enhanced the city’s solar power generation target from 50 megawatt (MW) to 69 MW, to be achieved by 2022. Till date, the UT has achieved generation of around 46 MW. Box: Deadline not extended after March 31 The UT administration extended the solar installation deadline till March 31, 2021 but it was not extended thereafter. Last year, the deadline was extended as lockdown was in force. At that time, the UT administration decided not to impose any penalty on residents till the lockdown ended. The administration, in a notification issued on May 18, 2016, had made installation of rooftop solar power plants mandatory in residential houses measuring 500 sq yd and above and group housing societies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ut-adviser-seeks-year-wise-action-plan-for-solar-plant-installation/articleshow/87990565.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

However, in urban areas’ government hospitals, it is 15.3%, shows the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) that was released recently.Overall the caesarean deliveries have gone up from 8.6% to 10.4% in the state. The NFHS-4, which was released in 2015-16 had pegged the deliveries at 8.6%. The percentage of babies born through C-section in urban areas is 19.7, much higher than in rural areas, where it is just 8.1%.The percentage difference of babies born in government hospitals by C-section with those in private hospitals is significant. In private hospitals (including urban and rural areas), it is 23.2% and in government facilities it is just 6.1%.Health department officials said that many couples opt for caesarean deliveries, while in a lot of pregnant women, the caesarean deliveries are indicated due to medical condition. “If the first baby is caesarean, there are high chances of the second body born by C-section. Also, due to anaemia, and other medical conditions, the C-sections are being conducted. More hospitals, including government ones in urban areas have better facilities, so families opt for hospitals in urban areas for C-section,” said a health department official.Institutional deliveries have also gone up to 94.9% from 84% in five years, which is a major boost for the health authorities.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/10-babies-born-through-c-section-in-raj-survey/articleshow/87991829.cms||---

Wankhede, a retired police officer, had filed an appeal against Justice Madhav Jamdar’s November 22 order which, while observing that Malik’s tweets’ were “actuated by malice” and posted without reasonable verification, had not granted a “blanket” restraining order on him, as sought. The single-judge bench had instead said fundamental rights of both sides be balanced and directed Malik to tweet only after reasonable verification in future. Wankhede, however, in his appeal said a stay order on Malik ought to have been imposed as his counsel Birendra Saraf and Divakar Rai said the Supreme Court has said once ‘malice’ is found, stay should follow. Malik’s counsel Karl Tamboly had, on a request of the division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav, undertaken on November 25 to not tweet till December 9. But the same day, Tamboly later said Malik wished to make a suggestion to bring the appeal to an end. The HC heard both sides on Friday when Wankhede’s lawyers sought time to consider his suggestion. On Monday, the two sides agreed that Justice Jamdar’s order be set aside and Malik or his agents and any other person through him, will not tweet against the Wankhede family till the single judge decides Wankhede’s plea to restrain him till his defamation suit is pending. Malik has to filed his detailed reply to Wankhede’s plea for interim orders before the single-judge bench by December 9 and Wankhede has to rejoin by January 3, 2022. The judge then has to decide, uninfluenced by the appeal bench order, within three months thereafter, on merit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-malik-wankhede-senior-call-a-truce-minister-will-stop-tweets-till-hc-order/articleshow/87991832.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||No. 7: Small ward, large problems in Secunderabad||SECUNDERABAD: Ward No. VII (Trimulgherry) in Secunderabad Cantonment is a small civilian ward with only 15 residential colonies. But people here have been struggling with several major issues, unresolved for years. VVIPs pass through the area regularly: Presidents (till 2010) used to pass on Rajiv Rahadari, which connected Trimulgherry to Rashtrapati Nilayam; even Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao regularly passes through this area to go to his Gajwel assembly constituency. Yet, pleas from this ward have been left unheard. After years of neglect, residents are demanding the merger of civil areas of the Cantonment Board with GHMC. Among major issues is the overflowing Trimulgherry lake. Half a dozen residential colonies abutting the lake were inundated in 2020 floods. This angered residents who requested the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) to protect them. Even a year on, however, there has been no change. The lake remains a cesspool and fear of inundation owing to rains remains. “The lake has become a mosquito breeding centre. The SCB has turned a blind eye. We are fed up with their attitude,” Venkata Ramana, an RTI activist and resident of Malani Enclave, told TOI. Another issue is the shifting of garbage transit point out of the area. Locals along with former ward member, P Bhagya Sree, also protested this, but their efforts have been futile. Rajendra Kumar, a resident of Shastri Nagar said, “This issue was also brought to the notice of Ministry of Defence (MoD) apart from Cantonment Board officials, but in vain. Residents of Shastrinagar and two other slums — situated few meters away from this garbage dump — cannot live with the stink, particularly during the rainy season.” Infrastructure in this ward is also in shambles. An football playground — on the way to Lal Bazar from Trimulgherry Crossroads — produced nearly 200 talented players. But it is now a mere cattle grazing ground. “The playground must be revived and for practice. The local defence authorities and SCB officials have to help youngsters show their talent at the national level,” Harry Francis, a national football player, who practised on this ground, said. Civilians in the area also face road restrictions. Two civilian roads have been restricted by the ‘local military authority’ (LMA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/no-7-small-ward-large-problems/articleshow/87991189.cms||Sunil Mungara

But this time, there was a surprise in store for bird watchers, who saw a rare Smew (Mergellus albellus), a duck species, floating about on the Ganga waters on Sunday. Local bird-watchers Ashish Loya and Ashish Gujjar, spotted the lone Smew at Haiderpur in Muzaffarnagar. "The Smew is quite an uncommon small diving duck. It's basically shy and is found alone and sometimes in small flocks. It prefers to roost near high altitude water bodies. We were lucky to have spotted this rare bird here,” said Loya. The bird is known for its cracked ice and panda-like appearance. According to P Sathiyaselvamm, assistant director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), “The Smew is a small duck generally found in high altitudes in Taiga Europe and Palearctic region apart from the Caspian Sea range and commonly in China. In India, it is spotted in northeast parts, particularly in the belt from Sikkim to Manipur, but even there, in quite small numbers. It is indeed rare and seldom seen in north India." The 18,000-acre Haiderpur Wetland is situated at the confluence of Solani and Ganga rivers on Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor border near the Ganga barrage. It lies in the Central Asian Flyway and is an important stopover for the avian visitors such as Bar-headed goose, Ruddy Shelduck, Gadwall and Eurasian Wigeon. Just a three-hour drive from Delhi, Haiderpur Wetland is emerging as a new birding hotspot of north India. It was given a facelift by the Muzaffarnagar Development Authority (MDA) and opened formally for tourists in November 2019 by then division commissioner , Sanjay Kumar. Kumar, a wildlife enthusiast himself, said, “Over the years, the bird species count in Haiderpur has risen from 172 to 322, now. Every winter, it hosts anywhere between 30,000 to 50,000 birds.” Recently, a large herd of around 150 swamp deer, state animal of UP, was spotted at Haiderpur wetland, which is also home to several endangered species like smooth coated otters, fishing cat and gharial.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/rare-migratory-bird-spotted-in-haiderpur-wetland/articleshow/87990574.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Tourists, visitors to undergo mandatory Covid-19 testing||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has decided to reinforce mandatory RT-PCR testing across all the border checkpoints and conduct Covid tests of all Covid warriors. The decision was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami on Monday. Health minister Dhan Singh Rawat and Dr Tripti Bhaguna, director-general of the health department, was also present in the meeting. The development comes in the wake of a fresh rise in infections in Uttarakhand over the last few days and the threat of Covid’s Omicron variant that is spiking infections in several nations. Speaking to media persons, Dhami said, “In view of the Omicron variant, which is told to be more transmissible, we have directed all the Covid warriors to undergo RT-PCR tests. Besides, random sampling has been mandatory at airports, railways stations, and borders checkpoints. Instructions have been given to district magistrates and district police heads regarding the same.” Also, residents have been asked to not lower their guards and strictly follow Covid protocols of wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing. Meanwhile, DGP Uttarakhand Ashok Kumar has said that all police officials will be tested for the virus. The meeting on the Covid situation comes ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Uttarakhand visit, scheduled in the first week of December. Earlier on Sunday, Uttarakhand recorded 36 new Covid-19 infections, state's highest one-day tally in two-and-a-half months. Among the 36 people who tested positive, 19 were security personnel who were supposed to be in the security convoy of President Ram Nath Kovind in Rishikesh. On Monday morning, a 70-year-old man died of virus-related ailments in Haldwani. His wife has also tested positive for the virus. As a precautionary measure, Prateek Jain, joint magistrate, Nainital, has converted the area near Sherwood College — where the couple lived — into a mini-containment zone. It has been decided that random sampling will be done at all crowded places -- including shopping malls and tourist spots -- in the district. Recently, 11 IFS officers had also tested positive for the virus. Notably, 35% of the state's adult population is yet to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/tourists-visitors-to-undergo-mandatory-covid-19-testing/articleshow/87990564.cms||Shivani Azad

According to police, victim Preetam Singh’s second marriage eight months ago and his intention to excommunicate his son (the accused) from the property and transfer it to his new wife’s name was the reason behind his murder. The victim’s first wife had died three years ago. “Fearing his father’s intention to excommunicate him from his property, Kailash Singh bludgeoned Preetam to death with an iron tool on November 26. He then lodged a police complaint against his stepmother Bachhali Devi,” said Bijnor superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh. The SP said, “Preetam’s body with several injury marks on his head was found in his room. During the investigation, Kailash, his brother-in-law Sandeep Kumar and his friend Sudhansu turned out to be the killers.” “There was a property dispute between Kailash and his stepmother, as Preetam had decided to transfer his property to his second wife’s name, prompting Kailash to hatch a conspiracy to kill two birds with one stone. First, he eliminated his father and then framed his stepmother for the crime in a bid to send her behind bars. But, police foiled his nefarious design,” added the SP.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/complainant-son-turns-out-to-be-fathers-killer/articleshow/87990589.cms||Harveer Dabas

Schools have ensured that the buses are cleaned and the maintenance has been done while the driver and attendants were trained for conducting temperature checks and other rules to be followed. The buses are also undergoing checks as they were not operational for many months. Shilpa Walunj, a school bus contractor with a fleet of nine buses and vans, said, “The school has now informed students of Std V onwards to come to school from December 6, so we are also ready with our vehicles to ferry the students. We have started getting calls from parents to check if we will operate and we have informed them about the details and safety measures that are already in place.” School buses have been non-functional for almost 18 months. Bus operator Rahim Shaikh said, “Since the buses have been complied with the guidelines on speed governor, colour, attendants and other things, we have not been able to use the vehicles for any other purpose. Many owners had to sell their vehicles because they could not pay the loan instalments. But, the news of reopening the schools has brought hope.” Director of the City Pride School in Nigdi, Ashwini Kulkarni, said school buses may have to be run in full capacity now with all sections getting permission for reopening. “The school is ready with all protocols as we have already started school for Std VIII and IX. We have instructed school bus operators, drivers and attendants to follow all the norms set by the government. We have also ensured that all our school bus staff will be fully vaccinated,” Kulkarni said. Dilip Joshi, a parent, said his child was in Std IV and they needed the school bus. “We have contacted our regular operator about the preparations and were assured that the driver and attendants are vaccinated and they have a temperature gun and oximeter for mandatory checks.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/buses-vans-ready-with-vaxxed-staff-safeguards/articleshow/87991194.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||CBSE schools in Pune to conduct exams today in semester pattern||Pune: After a gap of two years, students of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will take offline exams starting from Tuesday. The schools that have been appointed centres are also getting ready for the examinations following all the Covid-19 appropriate protocols. A student from Vibgyor Group of Schools, Aditya Nalawade, said, “I feel prepared irrespective of the mode of examination. My school has made me confident about appearing for the board exams. I am grateful to the school authorities for quickly making the necessary arrangements for the semester pattern and making us exam-ready.” Principal of the Orbis School, Nalini Samuel, said that they have been involved in preparing the students for the board examinations for a few days now. “We are following all the guidelines given to us by CBSE and have prepared our school accordingly. Our students and teachers have also been equipped with all the information required,” she added. Samuel added that the students have taken the semester pattern positively. “Dividing the year into two semesters has taken the pressure off the students and made it easier to prepare for a smaller portion as well as given them the opportunity to better their score in case they do not perform well in either of the two examinations. Besides, those who are unable to appear in any paper in any one of the Boards would have the benefit of being marked as per their performance in that subject in the other exam,” she added. Director of the City Pride School in Nigdi, Ashwini Kulkarni, said that they are an exam centre for both the exams. “It will be an objective type paper and only 12 students in one class are allowed. Hence, proper social distancing would be maintained. Papers are checked at the same venue by the external teachers from other schools on the same day. The exam pattern has been changed by CBSE from this year and the exam will be conducted twice in a year. Objective in the first term and subjective in the second term.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/cbse-schools-in-city-to-conduct-exams-today-in-semester-pattern/articleshow/87991198.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Jaipur||Rise in govt school enrolment impacts teacher-student ratio in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: A significant rise in student enrolments in government schools has started impacting pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) and infrastructure issues. The PTR has swelled to 42:1 for classes 9-12 against the norm of 30:1 provisioned under the right to education Act. Natwara gram panchayat sarpanch Neetu Kanwar is struggling to push the local administration to construct at least two additional classrooms and toilets in government girls’ schools in her village. “I ran a campaign which helped me in adding around 90 girls of my gram panchayat in the government school. It could be a matter of joy, but has become an area of concern as the school doesn’t have the space to accommodate the students,” said Kanwar. Several government schools are experiencing infrastructure shortages like classrooms, playgrounds and labs to meet the requirements of the increased number of students. The figure says the state has 5,19,693 classrooms including 9,136 classes as dedicated computer labs, while 41,126 required repairs in the 2019-20 academic year. Over the years, enrolments in government schools superseded private schools due to several reasons such as introduction of different categories of schools providing education better than usual schools and massive improvement in results which has helped to attract students from private schools. The report says the state has 3.98 lakh teachers in 70,031 government schools having a backlog of at least 1.5 lakh teachers. “The government has improved its quality of education than low and middle income private schools has led to rush of these students into government ones. On the other hand, recruitment in teaching is not regular and marred by chronic delays leading to utter chaos like situations in several schools,” said Puneet Sharma, an expert of education in the state. Educationist KB Kothari said the spurt in government school enrolments will continue for some more years until it reaches a point when quality starts to fall. “The education department needs to spend more money on infrastructure development like development of classes with inclusion of smart classes. The focus must be on improvising the existing schools rather than coming up with new schools and rationalising of teachers,” said Kothari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/rise-in-govt-school-enrolment-impacts-teacher-student-ratio/articleshow/87991830.cms||Shoeb Khan

The incident occurred at about 3am and a major accident was averted as there was very little traffic on the route at that time except for a minivan crossing over the bridge with five men on board that had a narrow escape. Video: Bridge over #Ramganga river on busy Uttar Pradesh highway breaks into three https://t.co/VAoM5C6sQk— TOIWestUP (@TOIWestUP) 1638242108000A high-level probe has been ordered by the state government. Describing the horror, Mohammed Mujeeb, the van's driver, said, “We started from Prayagraj and were on our way to Modinagar in Ghaziabad on Sunday night. At around 3 am, we were crossing Ramganga river when we heard a loud noise and our vehicle all of a sudden began to slope downwards. I somehow managed to hit the brakes on time." He added: "We realised much later that the bridge had broken into three parts and our vehicle was trapped in the middle. We called the police for help. I decided to stay back while others left in another vehicle for some urgent work.” District magistrate Indra Vikram Singh said, "Action will be taken against those found guilty following a thorough probe. We'll repair the bridge within a month.” The 1,800m-long bridge that connects Shahjahanpur with Budaun and Bulandshahr was built in 2011 and its foundation was laid in 1992. Traffic has been diverted via NH 24 and Mirzapur, and locals will now need to travel an additional 60 km until the bridge is repaired and becomes functional. Due to excessive toll plaza on highways, many commercial and private vehicles from Ghaziabad to Lucknow use this route, said Narendra Raghav, a local resident. "The bridge was just repaired last month," he said.

Data suggests that its capital, Hyderabad, saw over 53,000 new launches between March 2020 and September 2 – second only to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region – at a time when many markets are struggling to survive. Yet, the state’s Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA) continues to be only partially effective. A quick look at a RERA report compiled by Anarock Property Consultants shows that Telangana is the only major state where the authority has addressed zero consumer grievances till date – primary reason why it was constituted in 2017. Nationally, the number of cases disposed of by RERAs has crossed the 78,000-mark “This could only mean two things – no customer has ever filed a complaint against a builder in Telangana or that the authority has been ineffective,” said an industry representative, stressing the need to strengthen the regulatory body to protect brand-Hyderabad. The only other states, apart from Telangana, that have limited RERA activity are: Tripura, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Puducherry. While acknowledging that the absence of an active RERA has not impacted the demand for housing in Telangana – Hyderabad in specific – Ananrock Group chairman, Anuj Puri, said that RERA must undo “the damage of decades of opaque and unregulated activities in the sector”. According to him, RERA in India is gaining ground and gradually and fulfilling the “primary purpose of rebuilding confidence in the real estate sector”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/t-property-market-robust-rera-not/articleshow/87991197.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||MC starts survey to check sewage line shifting in 3 villages||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: After giving two months’ time to around 150 residents of Sarangpur, Khuda Lahora and Khuda Jassu villages to drain waste water from their kitchens and bathrooms to the sewage line instead of the storm line, teams of the Chandigarh MC engineering department have started ground survey of the houses. A report was also presented to the UT in this regard. The MC wants to know exactly how many residents have shifted their lines, after which illegal connections will be disconnected. “We have constituted teams to check each house in these villages to know whether residents of villages have shifted their lines from sewage to storm or not. Since we have given them time of over two months to shift their lines to storm drainage, we will be left with no option but to disconnect connections of residents who have not done it,” an official said. The civic body authority has identified around 150 residents of Sarangpur, Khuda Lahora and Khuda Jassu villages, who are draining out waste water of kitchens and bathrooms into the sewage line instead of the storm line. The civic body authority issued notice under the Water Prevention Act 1974. Currently, sewage from these houses flows into Patiala Ki Rao Choe in bulk. The matter was discussed in detail during a high-level meeting chaired by the adviser to the administrator. Since officials of the CPCC (Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee) were also part of the meeting, the ramification of this waste water and its effect on the ground was discussed. The MC proposed strict action and the adviser, after taking opinions of all senior officers, decided to give one month time to residents. The time period has ended and a fresh survey has been started. Since 13 villages have been transferred from the Chandigarh administration to the municipal corporation a few years back, survey of remaining villages is also going on. “We will cover all the villages one by one and inspect them properly to ascertain the disposal of their waste water,” sources said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/mc-starts-survey-to-check-sewage-line-shifting-in-3-villages/articleshow/87990593.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Pune||Land acquisition continues to delay Katraj-Kondhwa road-widening work||Pune: The project to widen the Katraj-Kondhwa Road is continuing to progress at a sluggish pace, three years after it was initiated. Incomplete land acquisition has been a major hurdle in widening the 3.5km stretch, a key connection between Satara and Saswad Road. While about 40% of the work has been completed so far, the PMC is yet to get possession of 50% of the required land plots. Officials said talks with land owners are under way and compensation options are being explored. The Katraj-Kondhwa is among the busiest stretches in the city. Commuters have been struggling with frequent traffic jams. They have also said that the existing road that motorists use is in poor shape and must be repaired. Former Hadapsar MLA Yogesh Tilekar, who pushed the project ahead, said the non-availability of land has led to the slow pace of work. “The project work began in 2018 but the administration faced many hurdles in acquiring the land. We have been talking with the land owners. The project should be completed at the earliest to minimise the hardships of commuters,” he said. Municipal corporation officials said the work has been started in stretches where land has been acquired. “A major hurdle is that we have got the land in pieces. As a result, we are not able to start work on a continuous stretch. For instance, the work has been started after Katraj Chowk for few meters, but after that there is a gap as the required land is not in our possession. We have put forth various options before the land owners and talks are under way,” said the official. Sources said there has been a demand for cash compensation, but this is not feasible as the administration will have to spend a huge amount. “The municipal corporation generally goes for options like TDR, reserve credit note for land acquisition,” sources said. Mahesh Shah, who often travels on the stretch said, “Widening the road is overdue as the existing road is narrow. There are huge traffic jams at all junctions on this road during rush hours. Several residential projects are also coming up in the area. The administration should boost road facilities,” Shah added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/land-acquisition-continues-to-delay-katraj-kondhwa-road-widening-work/articleshow/87991204.cms||---

The bail was granted on a surety of Rs 15,000 after Malik appeared before the court. The matter will come up for hearing on December 30 for evidence. Bharatiya’s lawyer Faiz Merchant said he has submitted a plea to initiate contempt proceedings against Malik for allegedly “scandalising the process of court, interfering with administration of justice and judicial proceedings, lowering the authority of court”. On November 8, observing that prima facie it is proved that the words spoken by Malik were such that it had harmed the reputation of the complainant, the court had issued proceedings against the minister. The court had summoned him then. In October, Bharatiya filed a defamation case in the Mazgaon metropolitan magistrate court against Malik for allegedly defaming him by claiming that his brother-in-law, Rishabh Sachdev, was among the three persons detained and then released by the NCB in the cruise drug bust case. Bharatiya, in his plea, said that Malik used his power and position as a cabinet minister on national television to raise doubts and spread frivolous allegations over the release of his brother-in-law. —Rebecca Samervel||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/court-grants-bail-to-ncp-neta-in-defamation-case/articleshow/87991840.cms||Rebecca Samervel

TRS floor leader in Lok Sabha Nama Nageswara Rao gave an adjournment notice to discuss the paddy procurement issue, which was, however, rejected by Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The MPs raised slogans in both the houses seeking justice to the farmers and not to punish states like Telangana. Holding placards, the MPs asked the speaker to take up a discussion on the paddy procurement instead of question hour. Later, the MPs staged a demonstration at Gandhi statue on the Parliament premises. Speaking to reporters, the MPs said that 1.2 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was cultivated in Telangana in 62 lakh acres in the kharif season. “The Centre is not procuring the paddy and doing gross injustice to Telangana farmers,” they said. Keshava Rao said paddy production in the state had increased tremendously in the last few years thanks to the initiatives taken by the Telangana government and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. “The government provided water to every acre in the state, quality seeds to farmers and implemented Rythu Bandhu scheme. Instead of encouraging such measures, the Centre is refusing to procure paddy,” Keshava Rao said. He said apart from purchasing the entire crop this year, the FCI should be directed to procure parboiled rice. “From the next season, the state government will try to divert the farmers to other crops,” the senior MP said. Nageswara Rao said the TRS sought time to speak on the issue in Lok Sabha during the discussion on repeal of the three farm bills. “But, the ruling BJP chose to pass them without hearing from us,” he said. MPs Joginapally Santosh Kumar, G Ranjith Reddy, K Suresh Reddy, P Ramulu and others were present.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/trs-mps-ruckus-over-paddy-issueseek-national-foodgrains-policy/articleshow/87991205.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Pune||Covid-19: Rural vaccination picks up, 1 lakh doses given in Pune in a day||PUNE: Around one lakh beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district on Monday, pushing the number of fully vaccinated people beyond the 50-lakh mark. Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP), said their health department teams were working relentlessly with the gram panchayat teams to ensure maximum inoculation across the villages, which were yet to record 100% vaccination with the first dose. Around 431 villages have been declared 100% vaccinated with the first dose. “People are yet to be vaccinated in certain pockets. There is also the floating population issue in some villages, which could result in low vaccination,” he said. Earlier, the district collector ordered to achieve 100% first dose vaccination in rural areas by November 30. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The vaccination pace has picked up quite well in the district post-Diwali. Requirement of the vaccination certificate in day-to-day life can be one of the reasons. With a new Covid variant making news, the response to vaccination might remain upwards henceforth.” He said the district was inching towards achieving the 100% first dose vaccination status with 81.09 lakh beneficiaries getting it. Deshmukh said they had around 4.25 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin in stock at present and more were likely to arrive in the next 2-3 days. It would be good enough to continue with the momentum of the vaccination, he said. One lakh people were administered Covid vaccines across the district’s 706 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm on Monday. As many as 1.31 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V have been administered in Pune, so far. Of them, 81.09 lakh are first doses and 50.12 lakh are second.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rural-vaccination-picks-up-1l-doses-given-in-dist-in-a-day/articleshow/87991210.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Also, the custody period of Thankachan – who was arrested for following the car that met with an accident – will end on Tuesday. “The case against him is for stalking; he forced the car to quicken its speed and this resulted in three deaths. The visuals found from his phone have no direct connection with this offence. However, we are probing if the accused had stalked or misbehaved with other women seen in these visuals. We received information about his connections with drug peddlers and an investigation is on in that regard,” said a senior officer with the investigation team. On Saturday, a magistrate court in Ernakulam had remanded him in police custody for three days. The remaining accused in the caseincluding the owner of the hotel where the party took place and the driver of the illfated car – were granted bail by the court despite police seeking their custody. But, the court had approved Thankachan’s custody application. Miss South India Ansi Kabeer and Miss Kerala first runner-up (2019) Anjana Shajan and their friend Mohammad Ashiq were killed in an accident when they were returning from a party at a hotel in Fort Kochi on November 1. The investigators later found CCTV footage and identified that Thankachan had followed the ill-fated car. The investigation team had collected CCTV footage from the route taken by the Ford Figo car in which the victims travelled and they were able to detect a clear spike in speed of the car after an interaction with the accused. Police booked him for abetment after finding that Thankachan tailing the car was an extra stimulus for its speeding. “There was a clear indication that he was pursuing them and asking them to stay back for an ‘after party’ and was repeating the same even after the women explicitly expressed disinterest. This was consistent with stalking and he was booked for the same,” an officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cops-checking-if-syju-had-misbehaved-with-women/articleshow/87991227.cms||---
---||India||Congress MPs to brass: Must be part of LS proceedings||NEW DELHI: Congress MPs on Monday told the leadership that the party should join the proceedings in Lok Sabha instead of disrupting them, which will give them an opportunity to raise important issues ahead of the crucial assembly elections scheduled next year. At a meeting of MPs called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday morning, several members spoke in favour of allowing the proceedings and forsaking disruption. They said it was important to raise issues in the House while underlining that the previous session was washed away in protests. Sources said the leadership agreed with the stand and it was decided that only the first day will be used to highlight the important subject of farmers and minimum support price (MSP). The winter session of Parliament took off on a stormy note, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accusing the government of repealing the farm laws without debate to duck sensitive questions about compensation to farmers who died during the protests, the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre and the demand for sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, and the issue of MSP guarantee. While Congress members expressed sentiment for normal functioning of the house, the party appears hobbled by the growing fragmentation in the opposition ranks, specially TMC which is looking to chart an “independent” course. Lashing out at the repeal of farm laws without debate, Rahul Gandhi said Congress wanted a discussion on “the power behind the PM... the crony capitalists” who, he alleged, the laws were to benefit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-mps-to-brass-must-be-part-of-ls-proceedings/articleshow/87993046.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

This will be accompanied by an indefinite daily strike from thereon. The teachers will boycott all academic activities, including end semester examinations to press their demand for implementation of revised UGC pay scales and withdrawal of the decision on delinking of their scales. The statement announced a complete “Education bandh.” The Principals’ Associations of GNDU, PU and Punjabi University have also extended their support to the protest. PFUCTO president Prof H S Kingra and general secretary Dr Jagwant Singh said in a joint statement that delay in the notification of their pay-scales was a breach of trust. He said that all cadres of employees had been given revised scales since January 1, 2016 and teachers in higher education were the only ones still awaiting pay revision. Describing this as gross injustice, PFUCTO pointed out that all other states had implemented new UGC pay-scales for their teachers. The All India Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organization (AIFUCTO) has expressed solidarity with their counterparts in Punjab, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/university-college-teachers-to-court-arrest-go-on-indefinite-hunger-strike/articleshow/87990633.cms||---

The allegation was raised by in an affidavit filed by ADGP (crimes) S Sreejith on behalf of police officers that includes the state police chief. Questioning ED’s role in the case, the affidavit said, “At this juncture, it is apposite to submit that the entry of the ED in the present case and its over-enthusiasm shown through its counsel to bring the CBI (which has no role either legally or factually in the dispute agitated by the petitioner in this writ petition) in the picture cannot be viewed lightly. The posture of the ED in the recent past against the State Government in certain cases are against the basic tenets of the federal system, which is an inalienable part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Hence it is clear that the statement on behalf of the ED that CBI may have to step in has to be viewed as a motivated one.” Through the affidavit, police claimed that the special investigation team is conducting an efficient probe and a CBI probe is not warranted. No allegations have been raised against the ongoing probe by any of the parties, police argued in the affidavit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/ed-suggesting-probe-by-cbi-is-motivated-high-court-told/articleshow/87991231.cms||---

According to the figures provided, between January and October this year, the rail division saw 655 cases of chain-pulling in trains. The number of people caught for the offence was 564. In 2020, a total of 326 chain pulling cases were reported and in 2019, a total of 356 chain-pulling cases were reported. “If people have to get reserved tickets only to travel in trains, how are the chain-pulling cases so high this year? Chain pulling incidents mainly occur if people want to get down at stations where the train is not set to stop. This clearly means that people with no tickets are entering the trains and the railway authorities are not doing much to stop them,” the Railway Pravasi Group’s chairman Harsha Shah said. At present, over 200 trains are running to and from the Pune station. While reservation is mandatory to travel by mail/express and inter-city trains, for travelling in local trains, one needs to be fully vaccinated, following which passengers can get a universal travel pass. The railway is providing monthly seasonal passes to commuters. Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer with the Pune rail division, said there were several reasons resulting in chain-pulling incidents. “The fact that a large number of people have been caught and fined for the offence proves that we are active in tracking them and checks are on. In many cases, passengers end up pulling chains as they sleep in the trains as they fall asleep in the trains and miss their destinations,” he said. “We are proactively checking and tracking such cases,” the official added. “Many tend to reach at the last moment for their trains and tell other passengers or their friends or relatives, who are already in the train, to pull the chain so that they can catch it,” Jhawar added. Passengers said there were instances when reserved coaches in the trains were occupied by passengers who didn’t have tickets. “There have been many instances of chain-pulling and the Pune rail authorities must intensify the checks and keep an eye on the smaller stations. If the chain-pulling incidents are more this year compared to 2019, it clearly means that unauthorized people have been successful in boarding the trains,” Samit Joshi, who often travels between Pune and Mumbai on the inter-city trains, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/chain-pulling-cases-in-pune-rail-div-highest-this-year-since-19/articleshow/87991251.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Chandigarh||Neglected, Chd rly stn is shadow of its ‘world class’ self||Barinderjit.saluja Chandigarh: At the Chandigarh Railway Station, there is next to nothing to suggest that it was designed as a world class facility. Tiles are falling apart, toilets on the premises are poorly maintained, bird droppings litter the platform, drinking water machines are defunct, glass doors are stuck and bottle crushing machine is missing. The Passenger Services Committee pointed out the ramshackle condition of the station during its recent visit. After dissolution of the premier agency Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC), development work was handed over to the Ambala division. Ambala division railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh said, “The development of the station has been handed over to our division as government dissolved IRSDC. Plans are being chalked out to construct Chandigarh as world class railway station.” Chandigarh Railway Station has been waiting for a facelift for the past three years so that it can be tagged as a world class railway station. However, there is nothing to show for it. During its inspection, the Passenger Services Committee (PAC) found many discrepancies pertaining to lack of passenger amenities and directed department heads to plug the gaps. Committee members inspected passenger amenities including pay and use toilets, lifts, luggage scanner machine, battery operated cars, bottle crushing machine, foot overbridge, catering stalls, current reservation berth availability display board, and tuck shops. The Committee found that the cloak room was in bad condition and the automatic drinking water dispensing machine, which provides drinking water in a glass for Rs 1, Rs 2 and Rs 5, defunct. Even the ATM on the station has been defunct for the past three years. The two ATM’s situated near the reservation building away from the main station building are non-functional. The plan submitted to the Ambala division marks 25 sensitive spots such as entry and exit, platform-ends, circulating area, and booking counter, which is also a part of world class facility. In 2013, the railway board approved an integrated security system, under which northern railway sanctioned 225 CCTV cameras for Chandigarh and Ambala. In 2016, the station improvement group (SIG) of the security department drafted a proposal for new CCTV cameras, baggage scanner, and metal detectors for entry and exit points on both Chandigarh and Panchkula sides of the local station. In 2017, the SIG called for upgrade of CCTV cameras. In 2018, railway minister Piyush Goyal decided in a meeting with the RPF that better security of the stations demanded body-worn cameras, hi-tech CCTV systems, and women's safety.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/neglected-chd-rly-stn-is-shadow-of-its-world-class-self/articleshow/87990640.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

We have also put them on a blacklist,” Prof Shashikant Udikeri, VSK university registrar (evaluation), said.The sub-committee led by syndicate member Padma Vithal submitted its report on the scam after conducting a detailed inquiry. The members of the syndicate accepted the report and admitted that the question paper for the exam, which sixth semester BCom students appeared for, was indeed leaked.In the wake of the question paper for management accounting being uploaded and circulated on social media platforms, the varsity had been forced to postpone three other examinations for final-year BCom students, which were held only in November, much to the chagrin of the students.Members of VSK university syndicate had initially dismissed all allegations of the question paper being leaked and attributed the postponement of the examinations to technical issues.The report submitted by the sub-committee, however, confirmed the question paper leak and recommended that the examination board members — of which the syndicate chairman was a member — pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh each to compensate for the expenses incurred owing to the postponement of examinations.It was found that Nagaraj Bommanal, a professor at the Vijayanagara College in Hosapete who prepared question papers for management accounting, shared it with some of the students in direct violation of the rules. Taking a stern view of his conduct, the university has written to the commissioner of the department of college education to initiate disciplinary action against Bommanal. The sub-committee has also recommended filing a complaint with cyberpolice to learn how the question paper found its way on social media sites.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/question-paper-leak-exam-board-members-fined-rs-1-lakh-each/articleshow/87989618.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
---||Kochi||Rise in steel, cement prices affects Smart City projects||Thiruvananthapuram: Major infrastructure projects under the Smart City project in the city have either been slowed down or temporarily halted owing to steep rise in cement and steel prices. The private firms which took up projects involving civil components have communicated to Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCTL) regarding revision of estimate. The sharp escalation in prices of steel and cement has forced the firms to demand the cost escalation from SCTL. In the past one month, price of steel has gone up by Rs 3,000-3,500 per tonne while 50kg weighing cement sack price increased by Rs 80-100. This has rattled the estimate plans of the firms which had won the bid quoting the then market rates for cement and steel. “Many of our contractors have asked for price escalation. We have put a letter to the finance department also asking for special exemption to smart city works as works need to be carried out in a mission mode,” said SCTL CEO Vinay Goyal. He said that the pace of the projects has been slowed down. SCTL officials said that it wouldn’t be feasible to give a cost escalation as it would go against the conditions in tender agreement. Chances of a consensus regarding the cost escalation looks grim and this would further delay the projects and SCTL may be forced to extend the timelines. The works on multilevel car parking project (MLCP) at Palayam and Thampanoor have been badly affected by the rise in steel and cement prices. MLCP at Thampanoor was awarded at Rs 18.8 crore. The project is in piling stage and 47 out of 254 piles have been completed. As regarding the construction of MLCP at Palayam A block, the work was awarded at Rs 30 crore. The test pile has just started for this project. Smart road projects have already been affected by incessant showers and rise in cement prices has added to the woes. MLCPs at Palayam and Thampanoor were expected to address the parking concerns in two busy stretches in the city. The project at Thampanoor envisages a G+4 storeyed smart parking system for 22 cars and around 400 bike parking spaces along with an electric vehicle charging system. The quotation for MLCP at Palayam was fixed as inclusive of cost of labour and material including wastage, tools and tackles, setting equipment and transport, hoisting, setting, fitting and fixing in position, preparation of drawings etc for the full execution and completion of work. The multi-level overground multigrid parking system should have independent motor-operated vertical and horizontal movement of the platforms/pallets with wire rope, chain and geared motors as per site requirements or any other appropriate equivalent technology, as per the scope of the work.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/rise-in-steel-cement-prices-affects-smart-city-projects/articleshow/87990647.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The administration has increased border surveillance. Deputy commissioner R Venkateshkumar has asked the authorities concerned to collect information from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) on a daily basis and share it with the district administration. The decision was made in part because of the upcoming winter session of the assembly, which will begin on December 13. “We asked the state government to gather the data because aggregating commuter data from different airports would be difficult. This will aid in the isolation of Omicron suspect patients as well as effective Covid 19 management ahead of the winter session,” the DC said.When asked about the fate of the assembly session, he stated that there has been no change in plan and that preparations are in full swing for the session.About vigilance on Goa and Maharashtra borders, he said that every vehicle crossing the border is subjected to a thorough inspection. No one is allowed to enter the state unless they have an RT-PCR negative report or a double dose vaccine certificate. A rapid antigen test centre has been set up at the Kognoli checkpoint in Nippani to conduct tests for medical emergency travellers. Thousands of people cross the borders, and police and health officials have become more vigilant, he said. As the implementation of Covid guidelines has become more stringent, many passengers who did not have the required documents were turned back at the border. Kumar stated that the administration will also increase testing capacity to ensure patient identification. He advised people not to panic because the vast majority of the population has been vaccinated, at least with the first dose. According to the district health department, the number of tests will be increased from 3,500 to 4,500.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/omicron-scare-belagavi-tightens-vigil-on-borders/articleshow/87989622.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Nagpur||Free first dose deadline, special camps spurs vax drive||Nagpur: Those delaying first and second doses seem to be rushing to get anti-Covid vaccination done at the earliest in the region. Buzz about the government stopping free first dose from December 1 and various measures such as night camps are said to have spurred the vaccination drive. November 30 was set as the deadline for completing first dose coverage among eligible beneficiaries in the state. Towards the end of last week, an equal number of first and second doses were taken among both types of districts — those having less and huge backlog. On Saturday and Sunday, when generally people have remained away in the previous corresponding weekend periods, large number of vaccinations were done. In Nagpur, over 67,000 doses were given while in Amravati over 64,000 took the jab. Disticts like Bhandara, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Washim didn’t record good numbers but large turnout were seen on Monday. The week ending Nov 27-Dec 3 recorded a whopping around 3lakh vaccinations in Vidarbha. Of this, 1.57lakh were first doses while 1.32 were second. Amravati division recorded 1.82lakh innoculations including a promising 1.10lakh first doses. Nagpur division tally stood at 1.15lakh. Unlike Amravati, Nagpur division witnessed more number of second doses at over 60,000 in this period. Yet, Nagpur district alone achieved 67,000 vaccinations as compared to Amravati’s 64,000. Amravati district had the highest number of 10lakh unvaccinated eligible population at the start of this month when local administration sprang into action. Local authorities said the announcement and tough measures in view of November 30 deadline are leading to the last minute rush. Some also felt that the fear of new variant Omicron is another trigger. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said its due to November 30 deadline. “Even the rural parts of Nagpur are getting good number of beneficiaries,” he said. Zilla Parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said extensive mobilization by involving all government and other agencies, SMS and voice messages to those due for second dose, night vaccination camps and Har Ghar Dastak were the reason for achieving a good number of vaccinations. Among the special measures holding back salaries of unvaccinated government employees too paid off. Many government officials who had been delaying second dose, have completed their vaccinations. The administration has also been able to convince large number of unvaccinated persons from slums and minority community areas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/free-first-dose-deadline-special-camps-spurs-vax-drive/articleshow/87991243.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

After watching a video recording from the scene, Justice Devan Ramachandran said it was an issue that could have been solved by the woman police officer instantly if she had given a hug and consoled the crying child. The visuals disturb the mind of the court, the judge said after watching the video. The officer, CP Rejitha, should have apologized to the girl but the ego of the khaki she was wearing did not allow her to do so, the court criticized. The girl was crying from the beginning and the officer should have thought about her situation, the court said, adding that the girl may not be able to see police as protectors ever in her life. Why didn’t the police officer show any empathy despite the girl bursting into tears and what kind of Pink Police is this, the court asked. The court also criticized the decision of the state government and police authorities to limit the action against the police officer to a mere transfer to a nearby police station.

The services will be implemented in such a way that the government offices, educational institutions and tourist spots get connected. The ‘good day tickets’ have also been introduced for passengers to travel in the city circular buses for 24 hours at a rate of Rs 50. This project aims at connecting seven circular routes in the first stage of the programme. The authority is also planning to bring eight more routes in the next level of the programme. To identify the routes quickly, different colours like red, blue, magenta, yellow, violet, brown and green are allocated for each route. The KSRTC will implement the interchange method to ease the transportation by which a passenger can travel from one place to another without having to reach the heart of the city. The interchange method helps transportation easier by allowing passengers to interchange the bus at certain places. The interchange points are the stops where more than one route bus meets. As many as 24 interchange points have been implemented in seven routes. The minimum charge for the city circular service will be Rs 10 and the maximum will be 30. For the successful implementation of the scheme, 278 bus stops have been selected. Low-floor buses will be used to make passengers comfortable. Passengers can also use travel cards by using the RFID system. Unified numbers have also been allotted to each bus stop.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cm-flags-off-city-circular-services/articleshow/87990655.cms||---

However, the boys have no symptoms of the virus, and have been isolated and medically attended to, officials said. Currently, the home has 24 children under its care. Though all were tested, the reports of other inmates, including all the 17 girls, returned negative, a senior official said. “None of them have symptoms, but they have been kept separately, and taken care of,” the official said. The children were tested after one of the boys who was to be repatriated to his home state Uttar Pradesh, tested positive. “As a procedure, he and two escorts were tested for Covid-19. The boy tested positive, but apart from mild cold and cough, he did not have symptoms,” she said. After testing positive, his repatriation was kept on hold, while all children and staff were tested. The boy will be sent to his home state after it is certified that he is fit to travel, she added. Chairperson of the child welfare committee North Goa, Esther Torres, said the CWC was kept in the dark about the children testing positive. “We came to know through other sources. It’s disturbing as we are the ones admitting the children into the home," she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/seven-boys-at-apna-ghar-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/87991248.cms||---

He was arrested in Pune. The accused was produced before the special court, Kolkata, which remanded the accused to Enforcement Directorate custody for seven days. He was nabbed from Amby Valley City, Lonavala, Pune, while attending a wedding.  Enforcement Directorate said that he had been on the run for more than six months after the special court (PMLA), Kolkata, had issued non-bailable warrants against him in April earlier this year. The anticipatory bail application of Sanjay Agarwal was also rejected by the Calcutta high court earlier this month. “The imported gold was originally meant for export purposes. The smuggled gold was diverted by Sanjay Agarwal and his associates to the domestic territory and sold illegally to generate proceeds of crime, which were then laundered and projected as untainted property and used to purchase immovable properties in the name of others,” Enforcement Directorate said. The case was initiated on the basis of investigations conducted by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) under the Customs Act.  Enforcement Directorate had earlier arrested Preet Kumar Agarwal in the case and filed prosecution complaint before the special court. ED has also attached gold weighing more than 54 kg along with three immovable properties, worth more than Rs 25.25 crore at the time of attachment. Bank account balances amounting to more than Rs 56 lakh have also been frozen and taken possession of under the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/ed-arrests-city-based-jeweller-in-pmla-case/articleshow/87991247.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation is facing it challenging to reach the target as some people in urban areas are still reluctant to take the first dose. To convince such reluctant people, the authorities have launched a door-to-door vaccination drive in Hubballi to vaccinate all eligible people. HDMC officials including HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal are visiting each ward which have reported less vaccination and convincing people to take the first jab at their doorstep since Sunday. Suresh Itnal told TOI, “We have almost achieved 100% vaccination of the first dose in Dharwad urban, but we have achieved only 88% vaccination in Hubballi as people in some wards have misconception about the vaccination.” “We have identified some areas including Ganesh Peth, Moulali Jopadi, Toravihakkal, Heggeri, Banatikatti and other areas in Hubballi where people are still refusing to take the first jab despite our efforts to clear their doubts. There is also the threat of a third wave and spread of new Omicron variant of Covid. So, we have launched the door-to-door vaccination drive,” he said. “Medical officers are visiting wards which have reported less vaccination and holding meetings with religious heads of all communities and leaders to convince people who are still not ready to take the vaccine. With help of local leaders, we have now vaccinated hundreds of people at their doorsteps in the last two days in Ganesh Peth and other areas,” Itnal said. We have formed six teams headed by a doctor to visit all wards which have reported less vaccination, he said. “About 90% people got the first dose in the district. Daily we are vaccinating nearly 20,000 people in the district, and soon we will achieve 100% vaccination in districts including Hubballi city,” he said. “We are also visiting cinema halls, swimming pools, hotels, bar and restaurants, malls and other crowded places to conduct at least 10% of the RT-PCR test target daily. Besides, we have told all owners of malls, cinema halls, marriage halls and other places to only allow people who are fully vaccinated to enter their buildings,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/door-to-door-vaccination-drive-launched-in-hubballi/articleshow/87989634.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

A sessions court on Saturday convicted and sentenced a Tardeo man, Raju Pal (27) to life imprisonment. The accused had turned up at the victim’s house in 2016 to stab her husband, Santosh Wankhede, as he had found out about the affair and forbid him from seeing his wife, Vandana. Finding Pal guilty, judge Sanjashree J Gharat said the prosecution proved that it was pre-planned, premeditated and gruesome murder by a dangerous weapon. “The accused has taken undue advantage and acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The accused initially assaulted the complainant (Santosh) and when his deceased wife tried to stop him, he stabbed her on her chest with the knife,” the court said. It said great loss was caused to Santosh and his daughter, both eye-witnesses, which cannot be compensated by awarding punishment to him. “The deceased had a minor daughter aged nine at the time of incident. She is compelled to stay at her native place due to the death of her mother. The father is staying at his workplace for earning livelihood,” the court said. Public prosecutor Kalpana Hire cited evidence of 12 witnesses, including Santosh and his daughter, to seek Pal’s conviction. Santosh told court two days prior to the incident, he had a quarrel with the accused. Both worked at a juice stall. He said through their employer’s son, he got to know that his wife was roaming with the accused. Santosh submitted that on January 24, 2016, he returned home from work at 1.30am. He deposed that while having dinner, somebody knocked on the door. The accused, outside with a knife in his hand, entered and stabbed him in his stomach. Santosh said he caught hold of the knife and broke it. He said the accused then took a knife from their kitchen and tried to run away. At that time, his wife went behind him. The accused stabbed his wife on her chest and ran away. He said he ran behind the accused but couldn’t catch up. Santosh told a patrolling cop about the incident and returned home. He said his friends took his wife and him to Nair Hospital. He said he was admitted to ICU. Santosh recalled that he was informed that his wife died.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-dies-saving-husband-lover-gets-life-term-for-murder/articleshow/87993071.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Faced with severe criticism, Tharoor later apologised for offending “some people” and said the “whole selfie thing” was done at the women MPs’ initiative in “great good humour and it was they who asked me to tweet it in the same spirit”. “Who says the Lok Sabha isn’t an attractive place to work? With six of my fellow MPs this morning,” he said and posted a picture of himself with Supriya Sule, Preneet Kaur, Thamizhachi Thangapandian, Mimi Chakraborty, Nusrat Jahan Ruhi and Jyothimani. His tweet sparked controversy with many accusing him of “sexism” and “objectification”. Reacting sharply, National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma tweeted, “you are demeaning their contribution in parliament and politics by making them an object of attraction. Stop objectifying women in parliament”. BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla also lashed out at Tharoor for his tweet, saying no woman in the country should be reduced to just about her looks. However, TMC MP Mahua Moitra defended Tharoor and tweeted “not surprised that a bunch of ugly trolls attacking @ShashiTharoor on a non-issue to detract attention.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shashi-tharoor-says-sorry-as-tweet-with-women-mps-sparks-row/articleshow/87993067.cms||---

She was 87. According to family sources, she was battling old age-related ailments and died at her house Almar Mahal located inside the Arakkal Palace grounds. She became the 39th head of the Arakkal family in May 2019 and assumed the title Arakkal Beevi following the death of Sultana Arakkal Adiraja Fathima Muthu Beevi. She was the wife of late AP M Alippi, a retired administrative officer at Chennai Ports Trust. She is survived by son Adiraja Abdul Shukoor and daughters Adiraja Naseema and Adiraja Raheena. Unlike many other dynasties, the Arakkal family follows the matrilineal system of descent and the senior-most member is selected as the ruler, irrespective of gender. Ashraf Adiraja, a member of Arakkal Adiraja Family Trust, said Sultana Adiraja Mariyumma was the third consecutive woman head of the family since 1987. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled her death. Her funeral will be held at the city's Juma Masjid late in the day. Adiraja Hameed Hussain Koyamma (80), is the next in line for the title, head of the family. The previous male head of family was Sultan Hamsa Ali Adiraja who held the title from 1980 to 1998. Arakkal dynasty was Kerala’s lone Muslim royal family which, for centuries, ruled Kannur and parts of Lakshadweep islands. The fortunes of the family were affected when British forces captured Kannur fort, which Arakkal Beevi had brought from the Dutch, in 1784. Though the then Adi Raja had to surrender most of his lands to the British during colonial rule, they were allowed to retain a part of Lakshadweep but had to pay tribute to the company. In 1905 the Adiraja ceded all claims and rights as sovereign over Laccadive islands in return of annual malikhana (payment) of Rs 23,000 per annum, hereditary title of ‘Sultan’ and holding rights over 1419.5 acres in Kannur.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/head-of-arakkal-royal-family-dies/articleshow/87991267.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Trust Covid-apt behaviour more than social media posts on Omicron’||Nagpur: ‘The virus is back, this time with more energy, tactics and camouflage. We don't cough, no fever...It takes less time to get to the extreme’. Such social media posts are doing the rounds but doctors say there is little truth in such claims. City doctors say global researchers are yet to come to any specific conclusion regarding the new variant of concern - Omicron. They said people must prefer World Health Organisation (WHO), European Union, government of India and health ministry websites of respective countries to get reliable information rather than believing WhatsApp posts. The WHO’s update as on November 28 too dispels many of the doubts and fears following discovery of the new variant. As per the WHO bulletin, studies are underway to ascertain the impact of the new variant. WHO too suggests that prevention – mask, distancing and sanitizer — are the best protection. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said so far official reports say not many major complications or hospitalisations took place due to this strain in Africa. “Numbers definitely have increased but can not be 100% attributed to the new strain. There are multiple other factors contributing. Yet, infectivity is definitely higher. It’s been reported by South Africa but seen in other countries also so origin country and further details are yet to come out,” she said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said citizens need to look out for joint official statements to get accurate information on new corona variants. “ As per South Africa’s official report, every thing is in evolution. Unless they have adequate number of cases, nothing can be said with surety. There has to be official publication of whatever data they are analyzing. Some people are also trying to cook up stories regarding the new variant. How can I comment when I have not seen patients affected by the new strain? It is also not seen in entire South Africa,” he said. Dr Sarnaik also pointed out that an important lesson the pandemic has taught is that spurt can take place anywhere and anytime across the globe. “Omicron has been detected there but it can’t blamed on South African as country of origin. We shouldn’t create a scare but remain alert,” he said. Internal medicine specialist Dr Mohan Nerker said till the variant is reported in India, how it manifest, what impact it has on vaccinated population, it is wrong to speculate. “People must take vaccines on time, follow Covid-apt behaviour of using masks, sanitizers. This will protect us from not just any variant but also from other infections,” he said, advising that people must prefer official verified information for self-education.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/trust-covid-apt-behaviour-more-than-social-media-posts-on-omicron/articleshow/87991254.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Chandigarh||Food to be served on Kalka Shatabdi Exp again, fare may rise||Barinderjit.saluja Chandigarh: With Covid cases on the decline and relaxation of restrictions by the ministry of railways, passengers on the Shatabdi Express from Chandigarh will now get food like before. However, the food facility will escalate the fare by approximately Rs 90 per passenger. The facility will start from December 15 in the morning Kalka Shatabdi Express (12006), reads a circular. In other Shatabdis, the facility is likely to start from January 1. The food facility, which was inclusive of the fare per passenger charged by the railways in Shatabdi express, will again be introduced in the morning Kalka-Delhi Shatabdi Express (12006). The decision came after the ministry of railways announced discontinuation of the special tag and restoration of operations on all Shatabdis, mail and express trains to their previous schedule. Pre-pandemic ticket prices were restored with immediate effect. Breakfast was served to passengers on board the morning Shatabdi Express departing Chandigarh at 6:50am and dinner was served in evening Shatabdi Express departing Chandigarh and Delhi. The food was categorised as vegetarian and non-vegetarian, including eggs. At present, the Shatabdi fare for chair car from Chandigarh to Delhi is Rs 545 per passenger. In 2019, it was Rs 635 per passenger, including food. Now, the ticket will cost Rs 635 per passenger including food. However, flexi fare will continue in all trains. Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh said, “Things are normalising and limping back. At present, food is being introduced in the morning Shatabdi and it will follow in other Shatabdis as well.” Since the easing of the lockdown, railways have only been running special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now even short-distance passenger services are being run as special trains with “slightly higher fares” to “discourage people from avoidable travel.” The Railways had stopped passenger services in March last year due to the pandemic, gradually resuming services from May 2020 onwards in a phased manner. However, most of the resumed trains were operating as special trains, for which ticket prices were higher than regular trains, without concessions for senior citizens. The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) has been asked to make necessary changes in the software to reflect changes. Additionally, each zonal railway has been directed to ensure that necessary arrangements are made to make the details available to staff concerned well in advance and necessary changes are made in the database.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/food-to-be-served-on-kalka-shatabdi-exp-again-fare-may-rise/articleshow/87990661.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

This is the 38th tiger death in Maharashtra, including mortality due to natural causes and poaching. The tiger must be from the sanctuary, said sources, adding electrocution cannot be ruled out. The carcass was noticed by owner of the farm Mahesh Kothiram Popatkar, Manora. ACF Narendra Chandewar confirmed the spot where the tiger was found dead is in survey number 16 in Mokhala beat under Bhiwapur round. “As it was dark, post-mortem could not be conducted on Monday and it would be done on Tuesday, as per National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) protocol. Only then we would know the possible cause of death,” said Chandewar. This is the second tiger death in two days. On November 27, a decomposed carcass of a six-year-old tigress was found with all her body parts intact in Ballarshah range. Electrocution and poisoning still seem to be major causes of tiger deaths around protected areas in the region. In January this year, tigress C3 and her two sub-adult cubs died in Karhandla beat due to poisoning. In January 2019, a tiger pair of Rai and Charger too had died due to poisoning in Paoni range of the sanctuary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/tiger-found-dead-near-karhandla-38th-death-in-maha/articleshow/87990676.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Kalluru Gangadhar, a resident of Yadiki, submitted a complaint to Anantapur SP K Fakeerappa on Monday. He stated in the complaint he was accused in a double murder case at Pulivendula in 2019. Gangadhar said after the murder of Y S Vivekananda Reddy, Madakashira inspector Sriram, who was part of the Special Investigation Team, called him for enquiry and coerced him to testify against Shankar Reddy. As he did not agree to testify, he alleged that Sriram harassed him. Later, CBI officials started harassing him to testify that Shankar Reddy made an offer of Rs 10 crore to kill Vivekananda Reddy, to which he agreed, and killed him. Gangadhar further claimed that he met Y S Sunitha, who offered him money to testify against the three. Later, CBI additional SP Ram Singh also forced him to give a wrong confession to implicate Avinash Reddy, Bhaskar Reddy and Shankar Reddy.

Sub inspector V Maheshwar Rao, constables Rasheed Patel and Janaiah were dismissed from the service and criminal cases were booked against them. It was the second postmortem and the judicial inquiry done by an Alair judge on the orders of the high court that established the cruelty displayed by the cops against the hapless woman. While the first PM report described Mariamma as a person suffering from a heart ailment that was stoutly denied by her family members, the second report said that she suffered a sudden heart attack. The accused cops were also issued notices under section 41-A of CrPC to elicit answers from them as to why they displayed such brutality against the hapless woman.

In December 2020, a buffalo of the Pavane family was killed by a tigress. However, apathy by the forest department then resulted in poisoning of a tigress, two cubs and a sub adult male tiger. This time, a month ago, a tiger had killed a jersey cow. Though, four domesticated animals were killed by tiger in a period of one year, fruitful dialogue of forest officers and rapport with the affected family as well as immediate steps taken for speedy compensation have helped in saving the big cats. For the loss of the cow, the department sanctioned Rs 50,000 to Deu Pingale of Surla. The Pavane family had informed forest officials about the killing of their buffalo by the tigress. Jebestin Arulraj, deputy conservator of forest of wildlife division North Goa, when contacted, said, “Our staff after receiving information had already reached the spot and are patrolling the area where the carcass of the buffalo is located. After post mortem, immediate steps will be taken to compensate the affected family.” Besides, this tigress, one more adult tiger and tigress are roaming in Mhadei wildlife sanctuary, Ramesh zarmekar, a wildlifer from Sattari, speaking to TOI, said.

Only those complaints regarding recording of tax paid will be received in the adalat. Ward-based time and day for adalats will be announced later. The city corporation had decided to organize a month-long tax adalat to address issues regarding property tax payment following allegations of fund fraud in zonal offices.

He picks up gold from flights operating from Gulf countries,” a DRI official said. After coming out of the airport with the gold, the accused hands over the bullion to other gang members. The DRI team could not arrest any of the associates of the accused and they were trying to gather more details about the operations of the gang. The accused has been arrested under the Customs Act. He was produced before court and sent in judicial remand.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/catering-staff-arrested-for-smuggling-rs-1cr-worth-gold/articleshow/87991269.cms||---

However, civic officials assume that many among the estimated 30,000 ante natal cases (ANCs) have been jabbed. Holistic data couldn’t be compiled as the vaccinator’s app doesn’t have the column to record pregnancy status of such beneficiaries. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said as per the feedback Har Ghar Dastak teams are getting, it is believed many pregnant women have taken the vaccination. “We have data of only those who registered in special camps or were already identified,” he said. The 781 recorded pregnant women are those who are under treatment at civic hospitals and urban primary health centres. Civic officials say while there is no separate column for pregnant women in Evin app, they don’t ask beneficiaries about their pregnancy status, which people may find rude or objectionable. The gender ratio also shows fewer women have been vaccinated as compared to men. As per Cowin system, over 1.27 lakh more men have taken the jab as compared to women in Nagpur district. More than 31.33 lakh have taken at least one dose in the district. Of these, 2.44 lakh are men while 2.31 lakh are women. NMC had been running special drive since July for pregnant and lactating women. Before that, many pregnant women were asked to bring fitness certificates amid lack of clarity on guidelines to vaccinate them. Dr Vaidehi Marathe, former chief of Nagpur Obstetrics and Gynaecologists Society (NOGS), said pregnant women were anxious to take the vaccine since beginning. “Documentation may be an issue but majority of pregnant women are likely to have started getting vaccinated once the government allowed. While the government allowed vaccination in any month of gestation, we would advise them to take it after completing the third month when foetal development is complete,” she said. Dr Marathe added the patients come in second or near their third month of pregnancy. “So, they have to wait for just two to three weeks. During this period, we tell them to follow all Covid protocols,” she said. Asked about the numbers gap, Dr Marathe said the patient’s biggest fear was if the vaccine would affect the baby’s growth. “None of the babies showed any development defect, which is complete after 14 weeks or the third month.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/781-on-record-but-civic-officials-believe-many-pregnant-women-jabbed/articleshow/87991279.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The boat has been non-operational for nearly a year and is sitting near the coastal police station at Talpona. Fernandes was speaking at a meeting organised by the president of Akhil Goa Kshatriya Pagi Samaj, Ashok Dhuri at Talpona in Canacona. Expressing his regrets at the incident that occurred off the coast of Talpona on November 25, where nearly 25 boats from neighbouring Karnataka were found fishing there, Fernandes said he will immediately hold a meeting with officials of the department concerned and get the problems of Talpona fishermen redressed within eight days. The Karnataka trawlers were found bull trawling within two to three nautical miles off the Talpona coast, thereby violating the 12 nautical miles distance set for them to fish. Fernandes said that the surveillance boat should have been repaired long back as it is the main ‘weapon’ of the coastal police to conduct patrolling.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/coastal-police-boat-to-be-fixed-in-8-days/articleshow/87991924.cms||---

The HC division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar upheld an order directing her to vacate it and said the special law meant for protection of senior citizens does contemplate removal of anyone from a house. The HC said, “It is our experience in this city, particularly or most especially among the wealthy, senior citizens and elderly parents are being harassed and deprived in their twilight years. In case after case, we have complaints from senior citizens that their sons and daughters are harassing them. In every case, harassment is an attempt to grab the senior citizen’s property in his/her lifetime without thought spared to the mental or physical health well-being or happiness of seniors.’’ “The present case is no different,’’ said HC. The bench had even taken an extraordinary step of speaking with the nanogenarian online where he was “emphatic’’ and “unambiguous’’ noted the HC when he said he did not want that daughter in his house “for one minute longer’’. The father complained that she demands “her share”. The HC said, “What is her ‘share’ while he is alive? She has none. He may give his flat and all wealth away inter vivos. That is his choice. She cannot prevent him from doing so. So long as he is alive, (the daughter) has no ‘share’ in his property.’’ HC in its judgment on November 25, uploaded on Monday, was dealing with a petition filed by the daughter, a German and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holder, who had challenged a November 27, 2020, order of the welfare tribunal and deputy collector in Mumbai on her father’s complaint of harassment and alleged ill-treatment by her. The father who has four daughters had objected to the German daughter who is also a singer, continuing to stay in his house. The father, a widower, is the sole and absolute owner of the flat and his daughter has “no right in that flat,’’ said the HC. Had said she contributed nothing to the house, but had been “rude and aggressive”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/leave-house-let-95-yr-old-dad-live-in-peace-in-mumbai-hc-to-kin/articleshow/87993085.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Delhi: Gang used forged papers to get SIM cards reissued, busted||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested four members of a gang that allegedly used to forge identity documents of people to get their SIM cards reissued. The SIM cards were then used to access bank account details and the money from these accounts stolen. The arrested people have been identified as Kasif Akhtar (23), Gaurav Kumar (26), Musa Gous Sheikh (32) and Mohammad Ali (48). Police have recovered three laptops, four mobile phones, forged IDs and a scooter used by them. The forgery came to light on October 24, when one Harish Chander gave a police complaint that he received a message on his mobile number about an alternative mobile phone number changing request. “Chander said he had got issued a new SIM just one day ago, so he considered it a normal request, but by the evening, his SIM was blocked. The next day, he found a net banking password generating request on his email. When he checked with the bank, he found that Rs 10 lakh was transferred from his account in three transactions into two accounts in Bihar and West Bengal,” said a senior police officer. Further, Chander got to know that his SIM was issued to an unknown person from a reputed call service agency in Laxmi Nagar. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Sagar Singh Kalsi said, during investigation, his team collected information from the call service provider and banks. “We managed to get a picture of the suspect who had presented himself as Chandra. It was further revealed that the cheated amount was transferred in the account of two people—Kumar Samrat in Bihar, and Manoj Dass in West Bengal. The cheated amount was also withdrawn from different ATMs,” Kalsi said. The DCP said that his teams conducted technical investigation and checked CCTV footage from areas near the call service agency in Laxmi Nagar. Finally, one Kasif Akhtar was identified, who had received the SIM from the call service centre. He was arrested from Zakir Nagar. On his instance, other suspects were also arrested, the officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gang-used-forged-papers-to-get-sim-cards-reissued-busted/articleshow/87991915.cms||---

In one of these cases, alert passersby at the Chandannagar vegetable market responded quickly to the 62-year-old victim’s cries for help and apprehended the chain snatcher, Tejas Bhalchandra Mokashi (30) of Dattawadi, before handing him over to the police on Sunday afternoon. Police recovered the gold chain worth Rs65,000 from his possession. The woman was having fruit juice at a stall in the vegetable market when Mokashi walked up to her and snatched her chain. She immediately raised an alarm, drawing the attention of some passersby who apprehended Mokashi, police said. In another incident, a man snatched a gold chain, worth Rs20,000, of an elderly woman on Saturday evening at Karvenagar. The woman on Sunday lodged a complaint with the Alankar police stating that the man entered a shop where she was buying something. He snatched her chain and ran to a motorcycle waiting nearby. He sat pillion on the two-wheeler and the two men drove away. Alankar police personnel said they have obtained CCTV footage of the incident and further search is on. In Pimpri Chinchwad, police are searching for a two-wheeler rider who snatched part of a gold chain, worth Rs 10,000, of a 74-year-old woman at Nigdi at 8.25am on Sunday. The woman was sitting on a cement concrete block taking break from her morning walk when the scooter rider came close to her and grabbed her gold chain. Reacting instantly, the woman pressed her hand down and a portion of the chain remained with her, police said. The Nigdi police said the scooter rider again targeted a 60-year-old woman in the area but failed to snatch her gold chain. The woman managed to duck and he sped away.

The painting portrays two seasons of mangoes one is the flowering stage and the other is the fruition. The paintings, based on the signature poems of Menon, are being done on the research building of the institution. Other than ‘Mambazham’, another poem ‘Sahyante Makan’ by Menon is also being featured on the wall painting. The paintings have a size of 600 sq ft. The artists were able to bring a new style to the mural paintings. The works had started two months ago. The medium used for these paintings is a mix of acrylic and inks. The artists have also painted a black and white portrait of traditional art forms of Kerala including ‘kummaattikali’, ‘kathakali’, ‘theyyam’ and a few other dance forms. “The mural painting has been a part of temple traditions and this programme aims at bringing the art form to public places, as temples are only accessible to a few category of people. This art form should not be treated like this. It should be available for all art lovers. This space can be efficiently used to exhibit this art form,” said Muthukulam. Muthukulam has been into the field of mural painting since 1989. He is the disciple of the first mural artist from Kerala, Mammiyoor Krishnankutty Nair. “The Samskrithi Bhavan has made a mark by recreating such precious art works. The artists have done a great job by portraying lyrics of the poems into pictorial representations. Authorities have also decided to organize a museum, which also includes belongings of the poet and it resulted in painting his poems too,” said T R Sadasivan Nair, former director of cultural affairs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/vyloppillis-poems-come-alive-on-mural-canvas/articleshow/87990699.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Shack operators keep fingers crossed over new strain fears||Colva: With many countries, including India, planning a review of international travel, shack owners are worried as the peak of the season is only a fortnight away. “We were hopeful that worst was behind us with the flattening of the Covid-19 graph, but with the new variant first detected in South Africa and soon after some other countries, including England reporting cases, this has not only dampened the excitement but it is also like a body blow,” said a shack owner. Since the beginning of the season early this month, shack owners were doing brisk business with plenty of domestic tourists visiting beaches and the shack owners were elated with the government of India opening up for foreign tourists. Edwin Barreto, a hotelier and shack owner in Cavelossim, said he has been receiving calls from his guests that they might not visit Goa due to the new Covid-19 variant Omicron. “So this season also seems to be bleak,” he said. Business during the last two seasons at shacks had suffered as they were permitted to open only late into the season and shutters had to be brought down much before the season could end due to a rise in cases in Goa along with the rest of the country. Shack opperator Malcolm Rodrigues said that he has not erected his shack this season but is of the opinion that the country cannot afford another lockdown because of the unemployment it creates. “The government should identify some hotels to quarantine international tourists for 5-6 days and charge a minimum fee, and as the tourists visit Goa for a fortnight, the visitors will have at least half their holiday to enjoy their vacation,” he said. President of the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society Cruz Cardozo said he that has also received calls from his Russian guests informing him of their uncertainty to travel to Goa. “We cannot help it, new entrants into the shack business will suffer terribly even though the government has waived 50% of the fees.” He also said that domestic tourists flocking to Goa in large numbers has helped them earn some revenue in this bleak period. Another shack owner simply had to say, “Keeping my fingers crossed and silently saying a prayer.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/shack-operators-keep-fingers-crossed-over-new-strain-fears/articleshow/87991283.cms||---
---||Pune||Be cautious about variant, don’t panic: WHO scientist||PUNE: World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Monday told TOI that all countries should scale up the surveillance, including genome sequencing, following the emergence of the new Omicron variant of Covid. “We cannot say much about the transmissibility of the Omicron variant of Covid as of now. The ongoing studies will let us know if it is more transmissible and virulent than the Delta variant or less. We may be able to say something about this in the next few days and weeks. But the way ahead is to allow scientists to complete their experiments (which take time as the virus first has to be cultured) and not jump to conclusions. We need to be cautious and should not panic,” she said. While we wait for the outcome of these laboratory and clinical studies, countries need to take actions such as stepping up testing, surveillance and whole-genome sequencing. Genome sequencing capacity will remain important in the fight against Covid, for all countries” Dr Swaminathan said. Countries using PCR tests containing the ‘S gene’ could also use the ‘S gene’ target failure as a proxy marker for infection with the Omicron variant. Further, other PCR tests are under development to directly test for the Omicron variant without the need for full sequencing. Dr Swaminathan said that countries should report all identified Omicron cases through the existing IHR (International Health Regulations) mechanisms and provide clinical data through the WHO clinical data platform. “Sequences should be uploaded on Gisaid – a public database that has allowed us to track the viral evolution. All countries with identified cases need to strengthen contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, as has been done before.” she added. The WHO chief scientist also said travel bans could act as a disincentive to countries for transparent reporting of new variants and viruses in future. “They should be used as a last resort and for a limited time. Screening of all international passengers is a preferable strategy, instead of banning flights from a few countries,” she said.  Dr Swaminathan also emphasized on the need to continue using face masks. “Masks have been called ‘vaccines in your pocket’ and, when properly used, found to be highly effective. Though vaccination continues to remain a priority, vaccine equity (within and between countries) still has not been achieved.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/be-cautious-about-variant-dont-panic-who-scientist/articleshow/87991291.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Justice Devan Ramachandran was considering the case regarding the widening of the Nadukani-Parappanangadi Road. The government pleader submitted that even though the original proposal was to construct the road at a width of 12-15 metres, it has been dropped and the decision now is to construct the road in the area available. Responding to the court’s query, the government pleader submitted that the available width may only be about 10 metres and the decision was taken in view of the financial crisis faced by the government. In an interim order, the court said, “Even when I hear the learned government pleader as afore, the fact remains that it is for the government to decide whether the roads should be constructed for future or whether it should be a relic of the past. Going by the rapid increase in traffic and potential of road accidents, no one will have any quarrel if this court is to suggest that the roads will have to be constructed with an eye on the future. Therefore, since there was an earlier proposal for widening of the road, dropping of the same merely because of lack of funds perhaps is a matter that the government will have to consider.” The court adjourned the case to December 14 to allow the government pleader to obtain specific instructions on the court’s suggestion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/build-roads-for-future-not-as-relic-of-past-hc/articleshow/87991292.cms||---

The arrangements have been made following a slew of directions from the Centre with the new Covid variant Omicron posing a threat of another wave. The WHO has sounded a warning that it poses a high global risk. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said that travellers from high risk countries who test positive will be placed in seven-day institutional quarantine and another seven days under home quarantine. Other travellers from the high-risk countries who test negative for Covid-19 will also have to undergo seven days of home quarantine, and only after a RT-PCR negative report by the respective health centre will a person be permitted to move. Both the facilities, she said, will be examined on Tuesday.

---||India||Opt for ‘dialogue & debate’ rather than disruption: VP Venkaiah Naidu||NEW DELHI: Asking Rajya Sabha members to draw lessons from the “bitter and unpleasant” experience of the previous session, chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday expressed hope that they would opt for “dialogue and debate” rather than disruption during the Parliament’s winter session. Stating that the disagreeable experiences of the monsoon session “still continue to haunt most of us”, Naidu said almost 70% of the valuable time was lost due to disruptions and incidents of unruly conduct by some members, “at the end of which there were no winners”. “All the sections of this august House ended up as losers, and so was the country. Should we not draw right lessons from such unpleasant experiences that entail huge costs to the democracy, besides leaving a bitter pill in the mouths of the people of our country who have pinned high hopes on the legislatures and their chosen representatives?” he said. Twelve opposition MPs were later in the day suspended from Rajya Sabha, through a motion brought in by the government, for their “unruly” conduct during the monsoon session. Naidu, on his part, said the treasury benches had wanted a detailed inquiry into the conduct of some members during the final two days of the monsoon session. He said he had tried to reach out to the leaders of various parties, but some of them made it clear that their members would not be a party to any such inquiry. Others, however, expressed concern over the way the functioning of the House was derailed and condemned the unruly incidents. “On my part, I was expecting and waiting for the leading lights of this august House to take lead in expressing their outrage over what had happened, with assurances of introspection and spirited efforts to prevent recurrence of such incidents. Such assurances by all concerned would have helped me in appropriately handling the matter. But unfortunately, it was not to be,” said Naidu.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opt-for-dialogue-debate-rather-than-disruption-vp-venkaiah-naidu/articleshow/87993091.cms||---

Property worth lakhs of rupees is stated to be destroyed in the fire that started from a pipe manufacturing unit at 6.15am. No casualty was reported in the incident. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, said Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire and emergency services department chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake. “A plastic pipe manufacturing unit and tyre remoulding unit were completely gutted in fire,” he said. Fire started at around 6.15am from pipe manufacturing unit Kisan Gold Industries, owned by one Junaid Ahmed. Soon the entire unit and plastic scrap stored on the factory premises was reduced to ashes. The fire then spread to adjoining tyre remoulding godown Baba Taj Tyre Repairing Centre. High flames and thick black smoke billowing from the area could be seen from far away. Eight fire tenders from NMC’s fire and emergency services department and one from Kamptee Municipal Council were pressed into service to douse the blaze. “NMC firemen used a nearby pond to refill the fire tenders, which saved time and allowed them to respond swiftly,” said Uchake. Apart from plastic granules, the pipe manufacturing unit had stored large quantity of plastic scrap, because of which the fire spread quickly and reduced the entire factory to ashes. It took almost seven hours for the firefighters to control the blaze. This was not the first fire incident at Kisan Gold Industries, said Uchake and added that some years ago, a similar incident was reported from there. “Consequently, the NMC’s fire and emergency services department had served notices to the unit and directed it to install firefighting equipment,” said Uchake. As the unit falls out of the corporation limits, the fire department had suggested it to implement the firefighting measures through Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority. It is learnt that after the past incident, the factory owner Ahmed had complied with the firefighting measures. “However, it was found non-functional when the fire broke out today,” said Uchake. The firefighting equipment installed at Kisan Gold Industries were also damaged in the inferno, he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/devastating-fire-devours-2-uppalwadi-industrial-units/articleshow/87990710.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Why should there be restrictions on the Kerala-Karnataka border at Talapady, when the Omicron variant of the virus was found in South Africa? asked many inter-state commuters. They also question the logic of checking at the border, though Covid-19 cases in Kasaragod district have fallen considerably in the last few weeks. Daily commuters, including students, employees and those travelling to Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) and hospitals here, are being screened at Talapady and other check-points. Shivakrishna Niduvaje @shivakrishna_n tweeted: “Again checking started in Talapady as @CMofKarnataka ordered checking across its border dist to Kerala & Maharashtra. But what is logic in checking at Kerala border as #OmicronVariant is found somewhere in South Africa. @BSBommai What is the logic in this? @DCDK9 (sic).” “Dear @BSBommai sir, why these restrictions for entry into Karnataka for people of Kerala to prevent the Omicron variant that was reported in South Africa? This is an injustice that restrictions are back in place within days after interstate buses are allowed,” members of the Sahayathri @sahayathri, a forum of interstate commuters from Kasaragod,” tweeted. Daily commuter Lokesha Jodukallu from Kasaragod said, “Perhaps people of Kasaragod, who depend on Dakshina Kannada, are the ones who suffered most during the Covid-19 pandemic. No facilities here, no opportunities and people’s representatives have no concern towards us.” Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that the chief minister has directed the district administration to increase border surveillance, since the positivity rate in Kerala is 8%. “Kasaragod and Dakshina Kannada have a common bond with a large number of people commuting between them regularly. However, we have the responsibility towards the health of people from both the districts. Hence, we must enforce restrictions at borders without troubling daily commuters much,” he said. DHO Dr Kishore Kumar M said the World Health Organisation has already declared the Omicron variant as a “virus of concern”. “People need not panic but adhere to all Covid-19 guidelines effectively,” he said, adding the restrictions at borders were part of the state government’s directions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/daily-commuters-question-logic-of-border-restrictions/articleshow/87989702.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||HC modifies status quo order on capital, dev work can go on||Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday modified the status quo order on capital in view of the new bill passed to repeal the twin legislations earlier brought for trifurcating the capital. However, the court said that all other interim reliefs given in favour of petitioners will continue till further orders. The high court observed that the status quo should not come in the way of state government from taking up developmental activities and it can continue to act in accordance with law that was in force prior to the enactment of impugned legislations which are now repealed. The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice D V S S Somayajulu said that they are not intended to come in the way of development and people of the state should not think that the courts are not letting the government to do its work. “We are not running the entire administration of the government and why should we suspect the government every time,” said the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice further observed that there cannot be any injunction against legislature from making laws. However, the courts will look into the legal aspects of any legislation as and when it becomes a legislation. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Shyam Divan said that even assuming that the state government comes up with a new legislation as it indicated in the reasons and objects for bringing Repeal Act, the petitions will survive and they will not become infructuous. He said that the core of the pleadings in the petitions was against the state government making legislations for changing the capital. Prabhunath Vasireddy, who argued for one of the petitioners, questioned the legislative competence of the state government in bringing the Repeal Act. He said that when the state government has no competence to enact Decentralisation Act, how can it repeal the legislation that was enacted without having competence. As the petitions are not being heard because the Repeal Act is not yet received assent of the governor and notified in the gazette, the Chief Justice suggested him to file a fresh petition for consideration on this aspect and said it will be heard along with the batch of petitions. Arguing on behalf of the state government advocate general, S Sriram, said that the courts cannot give future advisory guidance to legislature. As the Repeal Act has been passed by both the houses of assembly, all the petitions filed challenging impugned legislations would become infructuous, he said.

Devotees who were inside the church later said that some people barged into the building while morning prayers were in progress, creating an environment of fear. They denied that any conversion was happening in the church. The police intervened and the situation was brought under control. Vishwa Hindu Parishad taluk unit president Krishnegowda said: “In the taluk, forcible religious conversion is being carried out in more than 30 churches. They are using illegal buildings for this purpose. If the TMC fails to take action, we will agitate,” The church manager Suresh Paul said later: “No religious conversions were happening. Some of them barged into the church while morning prayers were being conducted creating a climate of fear.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/hindutva-outfits-protest-at-church-allege-forcible-conversion/articleshow/87990263.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Schools reopening, ST stir to hit rural students hard||Nagpur: As the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) strike continued on Monday causing inconvenience to lakhs of passengers, the corporation suspended 33 more employees in Nagpur division, taking the total number of suspensions to 380 in the last 22 days. Apart from this, over 90 daily wagers have already been removed from service. “From December 1, schools in rural parts are reopening. Over one-third of students studying in zilla parishad and gram panchayat schools use ST buses. They will be facing grave inconvenience,” said divisional controller Nilesh Belsare. Due to the strike, Nagpur division has suffered a loss of Rs9 crore in 22 days and the amount may be around Rs70 crore if eight other divisions — Gondia, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Amravati, and Buldhana in Vidarbha — are taken into account. As per official figures released on November 29, of the overall strength of 92,266 employees, 73,103 were on strike and only 19,163 were present on duty. Despite an interim pay hike of Rs7,200, the employees are reluctant to join duty and are firm on the demand for merger of the corporation with the state government. Senior MSRTC officials at the central headquarters admit that if the employees do not fall in line, doors for privatization of the corporation are open. The government may also revert the interim pay hike and offer long-distance travel routes to private players, they say. Talking to TOI, deputy general manager Shivaji Jagtap said an attempt was made on Monday to run a couple of buses for short distances from Amravati to Morshi and Daryapur, Yavatmal to Dhamangaon, Arni, Ghatanji and Kalamb, and to Sakoli and Deori from Bhandara depot. Remaining all depots in Vidarbha were closed for traffic. The MSRTC has a fleet of 4,400 buses in the region. “To maintain so many idle buses, those on the duty warm up the engines of the stranded buses in respective depots daily. Otherwise, the engine’s components may get damaged,” said a section of drivers. Jagtap admitted that after the schools reopen, students in rural areas, who mostly depend on ST buses for transportation, will be the worst sufferers. “The demand is high and supply is poor leading to exploitation of commuters by private operators, who are charging through the nose,” he said. Belsare said, “The striking employees are paying a huge price. Though we are not forcing them to withdraw the strike, but certainly pursuing them to come back as merger is not a decision that can be taken overnight.” The divisional controller said, “In Nagpur division alone, we cater to over 54,000 passengers daily. Even if the government has allowed private transporters to ferry passengers, it is impossible to cater to such a large number of travellers. People have either dropped their plans or travelling for urgent work only. For 60km, the private operators are charging as high as Rs150.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/schools-reopening-st-stir-to-hit-rural-students-hard/articleshow/87991295.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kolkata||Swasthya Sathi cancer treatment in limbo||Kolkata: Confusion continues as the government is yet to come up with a definite regulation on private hospitals prescribing chemotherapy drugs to patients admitted under Swasthya Sathi, the government health insurance scheme. Health department officials have been advocating for cost-effective chemo drugs for them, but some patients availing cancer treatment even at government hospitals have alleged that some state-run hospitals have been running out of low-cost medicines. A Swasthya Bhawan official said non-availability of cost-effective cancer drugs in state hospitals was due to the lapse of the tender to approve vendors. “Such drugs are supplied by approved vendors through the central medical store. The shortage is confined to a countable number of drugs and specific to only a few hospitals. The supply will hopefully be streamlined in a fortnight,” said a health official. The government in August set up an expert committee to draft a guideline, under which prescribing of certain high-value cancer drugs would be restricted for Swasthya Sathi patients. It was decided to bar the recommendation of certain chemo and immunology drugs after getting a whiff that some doctors over-prescribed high-molecule drugs that exhausted the Swasthya Sathi fund before the treatment ended. But so far, the committee has made the proposal and a guideline is yet to be framed. “Such a guideline cannot be framed in a hurry. All stakeholders are being consulted before the definite framework is shaped,” said a state health department official. “A guideline on chemo drugs will be of utmost help for us as well as patients,” said Sukanta Koner, general manager, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Hospital. Sources said while prescribing of low-cost cancer drugs for Swasthya Sathi patients was on the cards, talks were also on to increase the rate for chemotherapy as most hospitals complained that the existing rate barely covered the procedure. Hospitals pointed out that some Swasthya Sathi patients insisted on costly, high-molecule drugs. “We counsel them. In case a chemo drug is costly, we seek approval from Swasthya Sathi officials before going ahead with it,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. All hospitals have been asked to upload their chemo drug purchase invoice to get it approved. The current rule is hospitals have to upload the purchase invoice or 40% of the cost would be deducted while reimbursement. But some hospitals alleged cost was cut despite uploading of purchase invoices.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/swasthya-sathi-cancer-treatment-in-limbo/articleshow/87991300.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||Four research labs in Pune to check samples for new variant||PUNE: Four research centres in the city have taken up the task to exclusively carry out targeted genomic sequencing of 550 patients testing positive for Covid-19 in November to rule out the presence of the new variant of concern — Omicron (B.1.1.529) — in the Pune region. These patients had a cycle threshold (CT) value of 30 or less. The CT value is the number of cycles an RT-PCR device has had to run to amplify the viral RNA for it to reach a detectable level. A CT value of 30 or less indicates a high viral load in the infected person’s throat/nasal swab samples. State-run B J Government Medical College (BJGMC) and Sassoon Hospital is the central coordinating laboratory. It collates positive samples fitting the criteria of CT value from private and government laboratory and distribute them for whole-genome sequencing. The remaining three research-cum-laboratories that are part of the Pune Region Genomic Consortium (PRGC) are the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL). National Centre of Cell Science (NCCS) is a part of the consortium but it is not a part of genome sequencing of November cases. “We have sent 100 positive samples to the NIV for sequencing and 350 positive samples to the IISER and the NCL. At BJGMC, we shall sequence 100 positive samples. The sequencing work of all the 550 samples should be ready in a week's time,” said Rajesh Karyakarte, the head of the department of microbiology at B J Medical College and the state coordinator for genome sequencing. “The samples need a high viral load because they will be analysed again during genome sequencing. Some portions (viral particles) get used up during the first test with the RTPCR machines. Hence, we prefer positive samples of less than 30 CT values,” Karyakarte said. The BJGMC has sent another 100 samples from Pune for genomic sequencing to the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology (IGIB).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/4-research-labs-to-check-samples-for-new-variant/articleshow/87991297.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He also said that a highlevel meeting will be held on Tuesday with the health department, among others, to discuss precautions to prevent its spread. Sawant said that the state is following central guidelines on the issue and “will keep close watch on international passengers”. The chief minister urged the people of the state to take precautions against those arriving in Goa from outside the state and from abroad. He stated that testing for Covid-19 has already increased. The chief minister appealed to the people to take their vaccine to avoid the spread of Covid-19. He also said that the state government has only taken a decision to start offline classes for students of Classes VII and VIII, and not other (lower) classes. Classes IX to XII had already begun in a staggered manner since last month across the state. On Sunburn, Sawant reiterated that the electronic dance music (EDM) festival will not be held in Goa this year, “but if somebody is organising the same party in the name of Sunburn, then it is their event”. The chief minister claimed that during his tenure, police have started acting against the drug mafia, and that “big seizures” have taken place. He also said that his aim is to make Goa drug-free, and that action would be taken against the drug mafia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/airport-rail-stns-on-alert-high-level-meet-today-cm/articleshow/87991299.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Can’t cancel contracts over regime change in Mumbai: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: In a hard-hitting judgment, the Supreme Court on Monday said that mere change of regime cannot lead to mindless cancellation of public contracts entered into by the previous regime by parroting the specious grounds of public interest, loss to public exchequer and irregularities. The ruling came in a judgment dismissing appeals of City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (Cidco), which had challenged a Bombay high court verdict quashing its decision to allot 47,000 sq m land to highest bidder Metropolis Hotel at Navi Mumbai in 2008, when an airport was proposed there. Later, Cidco had allowed bifurcation of the land — 24,000 sq m for a five-star hotel and 23,000 sq m for commercial-cum-residential purpose. However, in 2011, the lease was cancelled on the ground of loss to exchequer and irregularities, which Cidco could not substantiate either before the HC or the SC. Nuancing the sanctity attached to government contracts, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant said, “by merely using grounds of public interest or loss to the treasury, the successor public authority cannot undo the work undertaken by the previous authority.” Writing the judgment, CJI Ramana said, “Such a claim must be proven using material facts, evidence and figures. If it were otherwise, then there will remain no sanctity in the words and undertaking of the government. Businessmen will be hesitant to enter government contract or make any investment in furtherance of the same. Such a practice is counterproductive to the economy and the business environment in general.” Castigating Cidco, the CJI said, “It is clear there is an element of abuse of bureaucratic power behind subsequent change in the tender allotm-ent. After conducting a tender process and receiving money, the government back-tracked which led to prolonged litigation. Cidco’s impugned order annulling the allotment on hyper-technical grounds can’t be sustained for being contrary to the doctrine of fairness. The reasons in its order cancelling the lease are perverse and per se based on extraneous considerations.” Upholding the land allotment to Metropolis Hotel, the SC said, “We are not able to identify any substantive violation of law or tender conditions, which mandate annulling the allotment and arrangements, thereby proving the conduct of appellant authority to be disproportionate.” The court also abhorred the increasing interference of PIL litigants in government contracts without any basis. “It appears that public interest litigation has opened a large window to entertain any tender, regardless of scale, which are now sought to be challenged as a matter of routine,” the SC said. “The purpose of imbibing the spirit of competition in a process, such as bidding process, is lost in this meandering exercise and delays suffered due to pending litigation. This causes disadvantage to the government and public sector. This court, in appropriate cases while interpreting the contract, can restrict the review mechani-sm by not inuring to the interpretation so provided by third parties or parties competing for the tender, unless the imp-ugned interpretation is sh-own to be gross abuse of law.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cant-cancel-contracts-over-regime-change-in-mumbai-sc/articleshow/87993096.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Goa||From tomorrow, RT-PCR tests for fliers on arrival from UK to Goa||PANAJI: Amid the scare created by Omicron, the new variant of Covid-19, Goa airport will start mandatorily testing travellers from ‘countries at risk’ upon arrival, including passengers from the UK, from December 1. Airport director Gagan Malik also said that fliers from countries not on the ‘at risk’ list will also undergo random RT-PCR tests upon arrival. Malik also said the evolving situation will weigh upon the charter season and scheduled international flights that were set to resume. “Passengers coming from nations at risk, including the UK, will have to undergo RT-PCR upon arrival, which was not the case earlier. If anybody is found to be positive, he/she has to undergo institutional quarantine,” said Malik. “Besides that, if any person tests positive, those samples will be sent for genome sequencing to ascertain the variant.” The countries placed on the ‘at risk’ list are the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. Malik said passengers coming from nations that are not on the ‘at risk’ list will also be randomly tested using rapid test kits. “About five per cent of these passengers will be tested. Although they were not being tested earlier, the airlines will now select passengers at random and subject them to testing on arrival,” said Malik. Passengers will have to pay for the rapid tests, while a team of government health workers will monitor and screen them. As of now, there is no change in protocol for domestic fliers who can enter the state unhindered if they have taken both doses of the anti-Covid vaccine. International passengers entering India will have to submit 14 days of travel details and upload a negative RT-PCR test report before their journey. The revised protocol has been put in place after the Union home ministry convened an urgent meeting in Delhi on Sunday during which all departments were asked to step up screening and surveillance on Covid-19 cases. The decision on resumption of commercial international flights is likely to be reviewed in view of the evolving global scenario. “The situation of charter flights will depend on the situation of Covid-19 in the world. We have approved around 27 slots, but it all depends on whether they will fly in now. Ultimately, the tourists and passengers need to be ready to come here,” said Malik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/from-tomorrow-rt-pcr-tests-for-fliers-on-arrival-from-uk/articleshow/87991306.cms||Newton Sequeira

As reported by TOI on Monday, ‘dieback’ disease, caused by fungus Phomopsis Azadirachtae, has been observed on neem trees across the region. Leaves of the affected trees dry and turn brown and slowly the trees die. Several residents called up TOI to tell that they have observed similar symptoms on neem trees in their area. “Two 40-year-old neem trees in my courtyard are showing symptoms of ‘dieback’ disease. Please help us,” said veteran nature lover Arun Ingle from Sahakar Nagar. Green activist Shrikant Deshpande said, “Researcher Shrutika Bagul, who is working in the field of bio-pesticides and micronutrients, will treat the identified trees on Mount Road with herbal solutions. Guidance from PDKV’s College of Agriculture is also sought.” Bagul said, “On Monday, we observed big and small trees affected in the city. As the treatment to big trees would need hydraulic equipment and more concerted efforts, we have identified 5-6 feet tall trees that are also being slowly affected by the fungus.” Saptataranga Research & Organic Private Limited, a startup firm of Bagul, has earlier successfully contained pests on paddy in Chandrapur district. “We will treat trunk and terminal branches of the affected trees with herbal solution. Soil application will also be done. We need to wait 10-15 days for results,” said Bagul. The disease was first identified in 1996-98 by Shankara Bhat, a professor in Karnataka. It is widespread in southern states. The fungus causes death at the terminal and lateral branches and later affects the leaves and twigs of neem trees. The disease appears at the onset of rainy season and becomes progressively severe between August and December. Research has shown that there are 13 types of diseases that affect neem trees. However, ‘dieback’ results in the progressive death of the tree, year after year. Researchers say the seed-borne nature of pathogens may be one of the reasons for the spread of the disease. The pathogen is highly variable and this may be because of the difference in environmental and ecological conditions of various geographical regions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/city-researcher-to-treat-dieback-hit-neem-trees/articleshow/87991304.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the complaint filed by the woman, Piyush Gajjar had abducted her on Saturday and thrashed her. The woman stated in her complaint that she was married 23 years ago and had five children. After divorcing her husband five years ago, she was living with her three children. Her two elder daughters were married. The complainant stated that the woman and Gajjar, who is married, were in a relationship for the last one-and-half-years. They used to meet often and Gajjar also used to visit her at her house. The complainant said that on Saturday last, Gajjar arrived in his car at the woman’s house and started shouting at her. He also slapped the woman couple of times before dragging her by the hair into his car, the complaint stated. Gajjar was angry at the woman and accused her of ruining his married life. The woman further stated in the complaint that after dragging her into his car, Gajjar drove to Jamnagar Road and stopped the car at a secluded farm. Gajjar asked the woman to come out of the car but she locked herself inside fearing assault. Gajjar broke the glass window of the car and slapped the woman again. It was only after the woman’s daughter phoned Gajjar and begged him to leave her mother that the accused let her go. Gajjar has been booked for kidnapping, causing hurt and criminal intimidation.

---||Goa||Tourism dept to convert its Kesarval property into stray dog facility||Panaji: Goa Tourism has decided to put its Kesarval property to unique use by planning a stray dog management facility and shelter in a bid to help tackle the canine menace across the state, particularly at beaches. Dog shows and allied events will also be held there for tourists and animal lovers. A tender for the selection of an agency to set up and operate the facility — which will also sport a cafeteria and restaurant — will be floated soon, a senior tourism department official said. The facility will be operated through a voluntary organisation working for the welfare of animals and has not been planned with the sole objective of generating revenue. The official said that although the project is not directly related to the tourism ministry, it will be used to help curb the stray dog menace that the department of animal husbandry and civic bodies have not had much success with thus far. “Tourists are also affected by the menace of stray dogs. We were of the opinion that there has to be dedicated place where such dogs can be lodged and looked after,” the official said. “Different breeds of dogs could also be accommodated there and it could turn into a tourist attraction.” Although the plan was conceived more than a year ago, it could not be implemented due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the official said even as he hoped that it would not be objected to since the property is in proximity to the Verna industrial estate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/tourism-dept-to-convert-its-kesarval-property-into-stray-dog-facility/articleshow/87991310.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Face cover comes off as citizens let guard down||PUNE: While the government and public authorities have time and again stressed on the importance of wearing masks, many citizens, especially those who have taken both the vaccine dosages, have been casual about it. It is common nowadays to see people walking on society premises or visiting nearby shops without face cover. “Many residents who step out for an evening stroll or walk in our garden have not been wearing masks. Whenever such violations are brought to the notice of the management, we tell members to follow safety guidelines. Some of them listen, while most don’t,” said Shivam Gunecha, a core committee member of a hosing society in Kharadi. Naresh Choudhary, a shopkeeper in Kondhwa, said, “Initially, customers followed rules such as waiting outside the store on marked positions, wearing masks etc. Many shops implemented the rule of no-mask-no-entry, but that has slowly been forgotten during the last couple of weeks.” Another trader from Raviwar Peth, said, “Customers often take their masks off when they enter a shop, many of them do not wear face cover, but carry it for fear of getting caught or fined. But the overall sense of precaution has worn off.” Doctors said that the commonly held belief that one does not need to wear mask after vaccination is wrong. Mahima Darda, a general physician at Apollo Clinic, said, “With different strains of coronavirus being discovered, it is imperative now more than ever to wear mask and protective gear as a safety precaution against the infection. Vaccination increases one’s immunity against the virus but does not offer complete protection from it..” “Mask should be compulsory for everyone irrespective of vaccination status/history of covid infection in the past,” said Swapnil Kulkarni, a pulmonologist at Lokmanya Hospital. World Health Organisation (WHO) advises safety precautions even after receiving vaccination doses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/face-cover-comes-off-as-citizens-let-guard-down/articleshow/87991305.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

However, fear over the new Covid variant Omicron is forcing organisers to scale down the event. Gaurav Hegde, joint secretary, in-charge, West Zone, Surfing Federation of India (SFI), told TOI: “We already had a preliminary meeting with the district officials last week, and we had almost decided on holding a national surfing event in May, and a stand- up paddling workshop in February, next year. “Last year, though a proposal was ready, we did not submit the same due to the pandemic. We are now keen on hosting the event, and in case there is a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, we could probably restrict public entry to the event. Exposure for athletes is important. A proposal about conducting a national event will be submitted to the tourism department. The administration has also assured that the Rs 10 crore sanctioned by the government, about three years ago, for the development of Sasihithlu Beach for surfing,which has remained unused, would be used for its development, after the elections. Meanwhile, we will also submit a detailed proposal on regulations and aquatic sports safety aspects to be implemented on the beaches,” he said. With the popularity of surfing growing, several surfing schools are mushrooming across the coast. “Those affiliated to the SFI have been asked to strictly follow the guidelines. When these guidelines are endorsed by the government, it is certainly going to make a difference, and would help in making beaches safer. A similar proposal has already been submitted to the Tamil Nadu government,” Hegde said. Tourism department deputy director Manikya said that several events to promote tourism, including a surfing festival and beach festival are being planned. Beach marathon In an attempt to promote tourism, the Mangaluru City Corporation and the tourism department are considering holding a beach marathon. A brainstorming meeting for the same was held recently.

It is expected that the report will be submitted to the director of health service (DHS) next week. According to sources, the official examined the treatment files of the deceased infants and spoke to the doctors at the hospital. The hospital authorities apprised the official of the lack of facilities and the need to upgrade it to a taluk hospital with 150-bed capacity. “Around 150 patients are getting admitted here daily. We have requested the authorities to create a staff pattern based on that and also sought a doctor for carrying out scanning, ambulance with ventilator facility and other facilities,” said a source. She also visited the parents of the infants at their hamlets. A team of health experts also accompanied her. They are also looking into the other measures required to improve the health of the tribespeople in Attapadi. As there is no doctor for scanning, three pregnant women were referred to Thrissur government medical college on Sunday. The doctor, who carries out scanning, visits the hospital only once in two weeks.

---||Pune||Experts now favour RT-PCR tests covering all genes, including ‘S’||PUNE: Public health experts want laboratories to conduct RT-PCR tests in whole for all the three genes, particularly on international travellers to detect the absence of the ‘S’ gene, with the emergence of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19. Maharashtra state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on Monday told TOI that a complete RT-PCR report for Covid included that of the ‘N’ , ‘S’ , ‘E’ and ‘ORF’ genes. “If the ‘S’ gene is absent in a person and the other genes are positive, it is an indirect way to know that the Omicron variant is present in him or her even without conducting genome sequencing. Unfortunately, not all laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests are checking for the ‘S’ gene,” he said. “A directive may soon come for all laboratories to additionally check for the ‘S’ gene in a sample. Deletion of the ‘S’ gene will red-flag Omicron ahead of genome sequencing” said the task force member. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force and also the national Covid task force, said with Omicron being stated as a cause for concern across the world, maintaining caution was instrumental. “The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is continuously monitoring the evolution of the virus,” said Dr Pandit, who is the director (critical care) in Fortis Hospitals Mumbai. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, state coordinator for genome sequencing and head of B J Medical College’s microbiology department, said the current testing kits included detection of two different genes, that could be either ‘ORF’, ‘RdRp’, ‘N’ or ‘S’. He said, “All kits used for Sars-Cov 2 RT-PCR test result will not miss the Omicron variant and will get a positive test result. But to ensure faster suspicion of the variant, RT-PCR kits detecting ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) due to deletion at Spike position 69-70 is similar to what is seen in the Alpha variant of the virus.” .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/experts-now-favour-rt-pcr-tests-covering-all-genes-including-s/articleshow/87991318.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Police said there was no casualty. According to police, at 6 pm, they received a call regarding the fire. The caller informed them that there was a fire in Kumhar Basti. “A team rushed to the spot and found that there was a plot in Neb Sarai village with 40-45 huts situated there,”an officer said. According to the fire department, narrow lanes of the area delayed firefighting operations. “It was a massive fire and a heap of plastic waste lying near the huts acted as a catalyst,” a fire department official said. Delhi Fire Service director Atul Garg said, soon after receiving the call at around 6 pm, 20 fire tenders were sent to the spot. The operation was led by assistant divisional officer (DFS) RK Yadav. According to the fire department officer, materials that were used for the construction of these huts were also highly combustible and in a very short period, all huts were gutted. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Benita Mary Jaiker said the plot belongs to one Rajneesh Balhara and one Ajeet. Both are residents of Neb Sarai village. “They had given the plot on rent to labourers and ragpickers,” the officer said. According to police, on inquiry, it was revealed that the fire started from one hut. “People who were living in the hut had lit the fire to keep themselves warm,” the officer said, adding that it spread to other huts. “The crime team also reached the spot. Fire is under control and no one was injured in this incident. Action will be taken as per law,” the DCP said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/out-in-cold-slum-fire-leaves-many-homeless-no-casualty/articleshow/87991928.cms||---
---||India||Revenue receipts RS 2 lakh cr short of Budget estimates: CAG||NEW DELHI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) tabled a report in the Lok Sabha on Monday on the Government of India’s account for financial year 2019-20, stating that the Centre fell short by more than Rs 2 lakh crore from the revenue receipts estimated in the budget. “Although the Union government envisaged a considerable reduction in revenue receipts at the RE (revised estimate) stage as compared to BE (budget estimate), actual revenue receipts were lower by Rs 2,05,344 crore than the revised estimate,” the CAG noted. The Union account scrutiny by the federal auditor revealed that in the case of tax revenue, though the revised estimate was lower than the budget estimate (Rs 1,44,685 crore), the actuals remained further lower than the RE (Rs 1,47,995 crore). This was primarily due to collections being less than the RE in the case of ‘taxes on income other than corporation tax’ (Rs 66,652 crore); corporation tax (Rs 53,624 crore) and Central Goods and Services Tax (Rs 19,929 crore). For non-tax revenue (NTR), the revised estimate was higher than the budgert estimate due to a sharp increase in estimates for interest receipts, dividends and profits (Rs 58,874 crore) even though estimates for ‘other non-tax revenue’ was reduced (Rs 9,046 crore) as compared with the budget estimate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/revenue-receipts-rs-2-lakh-cr-short-of-budget-estimates-cag/articleshow/87993098.cms||---

The CM came across the table on the dais to honour children who were shorter in height and could not reach out to collect their awards. Shubhkamna Sharma, a Class 1 student who won the junior fancy dress competition, thanked the CM for the gesture. Vaishnavi Sharma, fancy dress competition winner in the senior category, was delighted after getting the award. She was, however, disappointed because she was not allowed to carry to the hall the CM’s portrait that she had made. “I told the CM about it and he replied ‘acchha’ (good) with a smile,” she said. Shrishti Gupta, who won the first prize in slogan writing and painting competitions, said: “The awards gave me confidence to participate in many more competitions in future.” The ‘nukkad natak’ team, led by Kunwar Vaibhav Yadav, got appreciation from teachers and students for winning the competition. Shreya Sharma, who won the debate competition, said, “Getting awarded by the CM made me feel as if I am on top of the world.” Khushi Yadav, who won the first prize in rangoli competition, said her parents and relatives felt really very proud of her achievement.

---||Kochi||Cheating case: ED quizzes TN ex-minister||Kochi: Former Tamil Nadu minister and AIADMK leader C Vijayabaskar appeared before enforcement directorate’s (ED) zonal office around 10.30am on Monday to give his statement after receiving summons in connection with the probe in a cheating case. ED sources said he was called for questioning in connection with the probe that looked at the possible money laundering aspect in the cheating case registered at Angamaly police station in 2016. Source said that in 2016 a major firm dealing in jewellery in Kerala had lodged a complaint against a woman from Alappuzha named Sharmila. The allegation was that she took gold worth Rs 2.5 crore and did not pay the firm. According to the police, she procured the gold on credit claiming links with political leaders in TN and failed to clear her dues. Sources said that the accused had given a statement that she did not cheat the firm and the gold was given as a commission. “She claimed that she had influenced Vijayabaskar to purchase a large quantity of gold from the firm. She claimed that the gold that she received was a commission for the deal. The former minister was summoned to record his statement in connection with this case,” said an official source. Sources said that the central agency had earlier recorded Vijayabaskar’s statement in Chennai as well. “The amount claimed as commission is high and if that is the case then there must have been a big gold purchase. These findings are being verified. The man is already facing multiple cases in TN. A thorough probe is underway based on the statements given by Vijayabaskar, Sharmila and the jewellery firm,” sources said. According to reports, TN state vigilance department had registered a case against Vijayabaskar for amassing disproportionate assets last month. There were reports about him being under the radar of the CBI and income tax department as well. Meanwhile, Vijayabaskar too issued a statement. “Sharmila Rajeev from Kerala had already made unsubstantiated allegations against me in Tirunelveli in a complaint. I have proceeded to file a defamation suit against her through my lawyer. Based on a ‘witness summon’, related to Sharmila, who has a criminal background, I appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED),” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cheating-case-ed-quizzes-tn-ex-minister/articleshow/87991340.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Law for vigilant, not for indolence, says court; rejects plea in cheque bounce case||New Delhi: Law aids the vigilant and not for the indolent, a Delhi court has said while dismissing a petition seeking condonation for delay in filing a complaint in a cheque bounce case. The court was hearing a revision petition against a magistrate court’s order, which had dismissed the complainant’s plea seeking condonation of delay in filing the complaint regarding dishonour of a cheque. The magistrate court had also dismissed the complaint about taking cognisance of the offence against a man in the matter. The complainant company had filed the plea before the concerned court after a delay of approximately nine days, and notice of application seeking condonation of delay was ordered to be issued against the man, whose cheque got allegedly dishonoured. The counsel for the company had challenged the magistrate court’s order before the sessions court, saying the complaint should not have been dismissed for such technicalities, that is, delay in filing of the complaint. Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal said it was evident from the record that the revisionist did not come out with any plausible reasons for condonation of delay in filing the complaint. “It is observed that revisionist had attributed the entire delay on his previous counsel. However, there is nothing on record to suggest that if he has made any complaint against his previous counsel to the Bar Council or any other Authority for his fault or misconduct. It appears that revisionist is trying desperately to wriggle out from his indolence by conveniently shifting the entire blame on his previous counsel,” the court said in its order on November 24. It added that if the delay is not properly, satisfactorily and convincingly explained, the court cannot condone delay merely on asking of aggrieved parties.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/law-for-vigilant-not-for-indolence-says-court-rejects-plea-in-cheque-bounce-case/articleshow/87991947.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drop location to be visible to app drivers before ride||MUMBAI: Now, both Ola and Uber driver partners will get to know your destination before accepting the trip. This may, however, lead to more ride cancellations and frustration for commuters, most of whom have taken to social media in the past few days to complain against the ‘long wait time’ to book an app-based cab. An Uber official informed : “In our efforts to continually improve the Uber experience for riders and drivers, we are experimenting with showing drivers the destination of the trip before they decide to accept. We are actively taking feedback from driver partners and monitoring impact on customer experience.” The decision is currently applicable for the MMR region. Sources said these were “business decisions”. “The aggregator firms have to give the driver the latitude to decide if it’s worth the time spent. Traffic congestion is causing drivers to spend a lot of time even on short rides. So, he should be given a choice to decide on whether he wants to accept a ride or not,” sources said. On the flip side, passengers are not happy with the system as they feel that this could lead to cancellations/refusals by drivers and commuters will have to wait longer till the booking is confirmed. Said A V Shenoy from Mumbai Mobility Forum: “Will we not be going back to the old system where Kaali Peeli taxi drivers ask you where you want to go, and after knowing your destination, they refuse.” A few riders had a different view. “In a way it is good to give some choice to the driver, else he will keep on finding loopholes in the system and in the end, customers keep facing issues,” said a rider.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-drop-location-to-be-visible-to-app-drivers-before-ride/articleshow/87993136.cms||Somit Sen
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Police to turn up the heat on interstate ganja smugglers||VISAKHAPATNAM: As many as 650 interstate ganja smugglers and drug dealers involved in cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act, 1985 in the state have been absconding for the past 10 years. The 650 are from 16 states, with a majority from Telangana (130), Odisha (122) and Tamil Nadu (111). Andhra Pradesh DGP Gautam Sawang at a recent interstate coordination meeting on narcotics trafficking said the southern states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, along with Odisha and AP, will focus on cannabis grown in Vizag Agency along the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB). Data with the Special Enforcement Bureau show that over 4,600 persons from various states involved in ganja cases under the NDPS Act in Andhra Pradesh were arrested in the past 10 years. Among the arrested, 947 are from Tamil Nadu, followed by Telangana (908), Odisha (600), Maharashtra (560) and Karnataka (304). Data also revealed that non-bailable warrants (NBWs) are pending against 154 people (59 from Tamil Nadu and 39 from Odisha) in cases under the NDPS Act in the state for the past 10 years. Commissioner of SEB, Vineet Brijlal, said the SEB has been conducting raids and destroying ganja crops in hilly areas in Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. “We have observed that some people from Tamil Nadu and Kerala are behind the ganja cultivation and smuggling in Vizag Agency and AOB. It is a lucrative trade as one kilogram of dry ganja is sold over Rs 50,000 in the metros. We are collecting inputs through various sources to nab interstate drug dealers,” said joint director of SEB, Vizag, S Satish Kumar. However, leaders and activists of CPI(M) and some tribal associations said the big sharks in the trade are going scot-free while small-time operators are being arrested by enforcement officials. Until the kingpins, many who are from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, are arrested, it will be difficult to control ganja cultivation in tribal pockets, they said, and added that most cases end with the arrest of only a few people as there is no further investigation with interstate police to nab the masterminds.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/police-to-turn-up-the-heat-on-interstate-ganja-smugglers/articleshow/87990714.cms||Nalla.Babu

The Wari is to go on till December 4 and is attended by lakhs of warkaris from across the state. The authorities said that the number of warkaris is large this year as they could not attend the annual event for the last two years due to Covid-19 restrictions. “We have five vaccination centres and four Covid testing centres in the town. On Sunday, we carried out rapid antigen testing of 162 warkaris. and all of them tested negative. However, managing distancing norms is not possible due to the rising crowd,” said chief officer Ankush Jadhav. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) said the huge gathering of devotees, particularly senior citizens, is a matter of worry. “We have already started random checking of vaccination certificates. If someone has not taken two doses, we administer them at our centres,” Prasad told TOI. People from across the state, mainly from the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, come for this occasion. The main day of Wari is on Tuesday (Kartiki Ekadashi). “Testing of Covid-symptomatic persons is being done on priority,” added Prasad. Vikas Dhage Patil, one of the trustees of the Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple Trust, said, “We have been monitoring the health condition of every warkari coming for ‘darshan’. A team of doctors is already present for this task. We have already urged warkaris not to come if they have not taken two doses of the vaccination. Most of the dindi in-charges have responded positively to our request so far.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/rising-crowd-at-alandi-annual-festival-poses-serious-coronavirus-concerns/articleshow/87991320.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||Ghare Baire ends with a bang, takes visitors on a trip down memory lane to jewellery hub||Kolkata: A group of heritage enthusiasts walked around the narrow lanes of Garanhata in north Kolkata on Saturday afternoon, watching the artisans in the jewellery hub at work. The 21 participants had registered for the first-of-its-kind festival of art and heritage, The City as Museum. It was held by DAG Museums, the curator of museum-exhibition Ghare Baire that showcased 200 years of art in Bengal, in the 188-year-old recently restored Currency Building. The last day of the heritage walk coincided with the conclusion of Ghare Baire, which registered a high turnout this weekend, with at least 2,000 art lovers dropping by Currency Building to see the collection of Bengal art, supposedly the largest on public display anywhere in the world, The exhibition had been on since January 11, 2020, though it did see a few shutdowns due to the pandemic. Sumona Chakravarty, deputy director, Ghare Baire, DAG Museums, said, “While we celebrated the success of ‘The City as a Museum’, the mood was bittersweet for our team as Kolkatans streamed in to give the Ghare Baire museum-exhibition a grand send-off. As our social media pinged with ‘one last time’ messages, images from the festival gave us hope that the museum extends far beyond the walls of the Currency Building and that our work is just beginning.” The Chitpore walk, held in collaboration with Hamdasti and led by art historian Paula Sengupta, was a visual treat for the participants, one as young as 10 years old. Crowns, bangles and neck-pieces at every shop glittered in the mellow winter sun as the participants took turns to check out the manufacure process. Artisans showed their catalogues, each page flaunting a design with the common promotional line, ‘thokai hoy o dice pawa jae’. The phrase described the process of dice-making. As they walked down Rabindra Sarani, crossing the jatra para, litho printing and woodblock shops and Jorashano Thakurbari’s gate, some enthusiasts wondered why the museum-exhibition had come to an end only to be offered the official comment about the expired contract. The walk meandered through the lanes to reach Radha Krishna temple, known as the ‘Bat-tala mandir’ whose ‘chatal’ was the “birthplace” of the popular Bat-tala literature. The group then walked down the congested lanes near Nakhoda Masjid, where once lived the iconic Gauhar Jaan. The festival concluded on Sunday with a walk in Metizbruz, exploring the exiled kingdom of Awadh’s lasting influence on Bengal’s art and culture.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/ghare-baire-ends-with-a-bang-takes-visitors-on-a-trip-down-memory-lane-to-jewellery-hub/articleshow/87991322.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Addressing students from various schools during the centenary celebrations of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden, the CM said, “Hundred years is a long time and officials have done a commendable job in not only protecting and preserving the wildlife, but also ensuring timely development of the zoo.

He also named male and female tiger cubs on this occasion. Yogi asked the zoo and forest department officials to ensure more dialogue between experts and students to create awareness among children about wildlife, animals and their behaviour. “The zoo should always exhibit something new from time to time. Officials should get more MoUs signed with organisations which can contribute to the zoological garden. Experts of national and international stature should be invited to hold debates and dialogues with students about wildlife and environment conservation. This will not only create awareness but also engage more crowd. Painting and essay writing should become a routine event here,” the CM said.

---||Kolkata||Sunset cruise unites singles, celebrates spirit of sisterhood||Kolkata: A group of 20 women, all of them single by choice or circumstances, met on a sunset cruise on Sunday, to celebrate and discuss their status. They are members of Status Single, a Facebook community that advocates for single women’s rights and aims to dispel the stereotypes associated with them. In India, marriage and motherhood may still be considered the most expected —and accepted—part of life, but the single women’s population has also been rising. Status Single is India’s first and only community for urban single women who currently comprise 39% of the female population (74.1 million) of the country. The group aims to be India’s only collective for single urban women and hold Asia’s first single women summit by 2022-end.  Seema (45), who lost her husband in 2019, called this meet “inspiring”. She had quit her corporate job after pregnancy and stayed a homemaker for 17 years. “Only after my husband passed away did I begin to work to be financially solvent. No woman should quit her job as financial independence is crucial,” she said. Around 150 members, part of six city chapters, have met in Delhi, Mumbai-Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai and Lucknow and Kolkata. But the Sunday sunset cruise was different. “Most cruises are usually meant for wedding functions. But we were a diverse group that celebrated our status without shame, fear, guilt or a sense of inferiority. This is nothing short of a revolution in a country, where companionship is equal to couplehood and a woman on her own is fearful and conditioned to look at marriage and motherhood as an insurance cover for her old age. By January, we will onboard two international chapters in the UK and Dubai,” said author Sreemoyee Piu Kundu, founder, Status Single. The group looks to start legal, financial and medical wings for singletons. “ We will highlight stories of financially independent single women,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/sunset-cruise-unites-singles-celebrates-spirit-of-sisterhood/articleshow/87991333.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||India||Supreme Court seeks Tripura govt’s reply to plea on SIT probe into ‘communal strife’||NEW DELHI: Continuing to keep Tripura on its constitutional scrutiny radar for more than a fortnight, the Supreme Court on Monday sought response from the Biplab Kumar Deb-led BJP government on a petition accusing the state police of acting in a partisan manner and seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the alleged communal violence in the north-eastern state. A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna issued notice to Tripura government on a PIL filed by Ehtesham Hashmi, who through advocate Prashant Bhushan accused the Tripura police of investigating the communal violence in a partisan manner. Bhushan said that the police, on one hand, were not registering FIRs on complaints from the victims of communal violence, while on the other they were busy registering cases under UAPA against lawyers and journalists for publishing ground reports on communal violence and making social media posts about “Tripura burning”. The counsel said that the need of the hour is an independent investigation, preferably by SIT constituted by the SC. A fortnight before the just concluded civic body elections, there had been a flurry of petitions before the apex court, which entertained them and passed necessary orders. On November 17, a bench of CJI N V Ramana, and Justices Chandrachud and Surya Kant had given protection from arrest to a CPI(ML) member, a human rights activist and a journalist, who challenged slapping of UAPA charges against them for social media posts describing communal violence in the state as “Tripura is burning” and sought a restrictive meaning to ‘unlawful activities’ under UAPA to curb its rampant misuse. The Tripura police had said that action had been taken against various social media handles for falsely claiming that mosques have been burnt down in the state when this was not the case. Two days before the November 25 civic body elections, a bench led by Justice Chandrachud had refused to postpone the elections on a TMC petition alleging that it was being targeted by ruling party cadres but had directed the state to discharge its duties in a “non-partisan manner”. To obviate the grievance of the TMC. It had passed a slew of directions to ensure free and fair elections. On November 24, Justice Chandrachud-led bench had directed the Centre to deploy two additional companies of central paramilitary forces in Tripura as expeditiously as possible to keep the law and order situation in the state during the polls under control.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-seeks-tripura-govts-reply-to-plea-on-sit-probe-into-communal-strife/articleshow/87993164.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Hyderabad||1,500 docs took part in ‘No Shave November’||Hyderabad: Close to 1,500 doctors and medical professionals in the city of Hyderabad are observing the no shave November - “Movember or Mushamber’ in a first such move to popularise the worldwide anti-cancer awareness campaign in the city. Watching the doctors, many other professionals too have joined the cause. Common cancers in men include head and neck cancers, lung cancer, prostate cancer and testicular tumours. As part of the initiative, doctors do not shave for the entire month. “Patients who are used to seeing me clean shaved, started asking is everything okay in the family, why am I not shaving and then I tell them about men’s health issues particularly cancers specific to men etc. So basically, this is a way of raising awareness among people through our physical appearance,” said Dr AV Suresh, senior medical oncologist from Continent hospital, who is spearheading the initiative in the city. The doctor along with a team of 50 others has stopped shaving this month. Also doctors and medical professionals through their individual networks across the city, have ensured that there are 1500 participants, meaning that this is the first time ever that there is such a huge participation from the city. Captain Praneeth Kumar, a pilot from the city, is among people from other professions lending support to the No shave movement. “I got to know of this from one of my doctor friends and that is how I got interested in participating. Its an interesting way to draw attention to men’s health issues,” said Kumar. While world over, the money saved from ditching the barber goes in to the awareness funds but back in India it is solely about awareness.  “Although world over money saved from not shaving is collected and various activities are taken up, here we do not do it. Our primary aim is to raise awareness and we are doing it through various platforms including social media. Once it triggered interest, many people outside the medical fraternity too have joined the No Shave movement,” said Dr Mallik Singaraju, oncologist from Yashoda hospitals. While before the pandemic hit, this initiative had started in the city on a small scale but was brushed under the carpet during the pandemic. Incidentally, cities like Delhi and Mumbai have seen a good number of medical professionals sporting the bearded November look for the last few years now.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/1500-docs-took-part-in-no-shave-november/articleshow/87991362.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Pune||Maharashtra ramps up genomic sequencing of at-risk travellers||PUNE: The state health department has geared up to track and test travellers arriving in Maharashtra from at-risk countries in the last two weeks and thereafter to contain the spread of a new Botswana variant Omicron (B.1.1.529), the virus’ most mutated version yet. “About 3,600 positive samples of Covid-infected patients are genomically sequenced every month in Maharashtra to understand the threat from the circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. We have decided to primarily focus on prioritising the samples of international travellers coming from at-risk countries and their close contacts now for genetic sequencing,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said. Barring a sole passenger from Dombivli, none of the travellers from at-risk countries, including South Africa, has tested positive for Covid as of now in Maharashtra. “His sample has been sent for genomic sequencing and the report is awaited,” Awate said. His family members have tested negative. Experts stressed on monitoring the hospitalisation and death rates in an online interaction organised by the Pune Platform for Covid-19 Response (PPCR) — a group of volunteers comprising businessmen, citizens, NGOs and medical experts — on Monday. “Omicron — the latest variant of concern of SARS-CoV-2 — has 50 mutations but it should not cause panic if hospitalisation and deaths do not register a substantial jump. Besides, fully vaccinating people is important. The new variant may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines but those would still be effective,” said senior epidemiologist Raman Gangakhedkar at the meeting. “Unless we have data, we would not be able to suggest that the new variant is worrisome. After a week, we shall have some more clarity.Wear a mask and follow other Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. On reducing the gap between two doses of Covishield, Gangakhedkar said, “Reducing the gap may lead to reducing the efficacy of the vaccines. It is a good thing that India has not started on the booster doses yet. It is better to wait for sufficient data to emerge.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/maharashtra-ramps-up-genomic-sequencing-of-at-risk-travellers/articleshow/87991363.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Providing details about the case, special public prosecutor Venkataramana Swamy said that the accused Irfan,28, an electrician, had got in touch with the survivor, then a II PU student over phone. He had told her that he was in love with her, and expressed interest in marrying her. On August 4, 2014, when the survivor was on her way to the college to write exams at 8.30am, the accused arrived in a car, near a wood industry, and kidnapped her. From there they went to Chikkamagaluru and stayed in a lodge, where he raped her, and also threatened to kill her, in case she revealed anything to her family. The next day, the survivor’s father lodged a missing complaint, and the police launched an investigation. The police picked up the accused and survivor from the lodge in Chikkamagaluru on August 6. While the accused was arrested, the victim had to undergo a medical examination. A chargesheet was submitted by inspector Savitra Tej. The court examined 15 witnesses and 22 documents were marked. The court ordered the accused Irfan to undergo rigirous imprisonment for a period of three years, and also pay a fine of Rs 5,000 for the offence punishable under IPC Section 366(A) (kidnapping).

---||Mumbai||National film archive collects amateur movies to map cultural heritage||A jerky video shows a sari-clad woman in her 50s seated cross-legged on a carpet with a bow-stringed instrument resting on her lap. The camera pans around what looks like a traditional Rajasthani living room before zooming into her left hand moving gracefully along the fret and her right hand bowing a raag. This domestic scene shot on an 8mm handheld camera sometime in the late ’70s is both ordinary and exceptional at once. The familiar tropes of a classic home movie is what makes it ordinary while a family film captured on an amateur camera is made exceptional by the esraj, an instrument that’s almost obsolete today and its player, a middle-class woman —together, an uncommon combination at the time. This footage of astrophysicist Jayant Narlikar’s mother on a typical day in their Jodhpur home has recently been preserved as an archival artifact at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) in Pune. “Any form of moving image is heritage and documents a particular space and time historically. Naturally, Dr Narlikar’s mother, a Sanskrit scholar, playing the ‘esraj’ is interesting because a middle-class woman playing a string instrument that very few people play today is a private moment that can now be safely termed as a social document,” said Prakash Magdum, director NFAI, describing another Narlikar home video where one sees an elephant wandering into their porch in Jodhpur and the family feeding it bananas. “Everything about it was fascinating from a regional perspective.” Over the past six years, the NFAI has been collecting everyday, ordinary home movies and amateur films—usually considered an irrelevant pastime or nostalgic memento from the past—for preservation as archival objects in order to document stories of cultural or historical relevance. People’s private movies featuring family activities, a vacation, or a special occasion came to hold interest for an institution that has primarily worked for over five decades on acquiring and preserving the heritage of Indian cinema, in 2014 when Indian physicist Homi Bhabha’s Mumbai house went up for auction. “A stack of films was discovered in his bathroom shot by Bhabha. We came to know of this when Suresh Chandvankar of TIFR, an avid collector of gramophone records, came to us with one of the spools. It was in a damaged state given Mumbai’s weather conditions and for being locked up for years,” says Magdum who reached out to the various institutions associated with Bhabha hoping to retrieve his other films but in vain. “That spurred us to look for more such material on a larger scale and NFAI adopted a strategy to welcome all moving image materials in every format. Following our wide outreach through social media and online platforms as well as through personal and professional circles, people started reaching out to us,” said Magdum. Since then, NFAI has archived a number of home movies shot in 8mm and 16mm, Super 8 cameras, 16mm beta tapes, VHS and MiniDV cassettes. Describing the value and potential usage of private home movies, Magdum explained they could help draw meaning out of where and why an amateur footage was shot. “It gives us the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific era and also helps us explore the regional history, informal tours, and events in common people’s lives, as opposed to the visual imagery we see on mainstream media and films.” This was evident in a precious 12-minute footage that NFAI received from UK-based Margaret South two years ago when South, while cleaning her house, stumbled upon 8mm home videos shot by her father William Taylor, a Royal India naval officer in the ’40s. Taylor while shooting his personal travelogue on a trip to Himachal Pradesh had managed to capture historical moments of the 1945 Simla Conference. The reel also shows Gandhi walking back after the meeting at the Viceregal Lodge and Lord Wavell, viceroy and governor general of India at the time along with his wife. Not just the people in the movies but often just small mundane details about a room or the backyard, toys, cars and celebrations contain unique documentation of a way of life.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-national-film-archive-collects-amateur-movies-to-map-cultural-heritage/articleshow/87993175.cms||Mohua Das

Police said the incident took place near Kewari turning on the outskirts of Fursatpur on NH-722 at around 7.45pm when Nipin Das was returning to Kolkata from Chhapra in his car after collecting money from some local jewellery shopowners. Nipin told the police that five criminals, including three in police uniform, in a white SUV with police logo and fitted with a siren, overtook his car and forced the driver to stop it at gunpoint on the pretext of vehicle checking. They searched the bag while posing as police personnel and took away the cash, his cellphone and the car key. The victim somehow informed the police about it at around 11pm. “I couldn’t suspect any foul play as three of them were wearing police uniform and carried weapons,” Nipin told the investigating officer. Saran SP Santosh Kumar said the jeweller had come to Chhapra four days ago and stayed in a rented accommodation. On Sunday, he was returning to Kolkata after collection, he said. “A special investigation team has been set up to crack the case at the earliest. The modus operandi suggests that it’s the handiwork of a professional gang,” the SP told this newspaper over the phone. The police have obtained CCTV footage from the area to identify the gang. In Gopalganj, another jeweller was robbed of some gold jewellery and cash near Brindawan village under the Uchkagaon police station area on Monday. “The details about the incident are awaited,” a senior police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/criminals-in-police-uniform-rob-jeweller-of-rs20l-in-saran/articleshow/87990218.cms||Ramashankar

---||Surat||Textile industry to oppose GST hike||Surat: Representatives of the textile industry from different sectors have decided to jointly oppose the increased GST rates. The GST on textile trade has been hiked from 5% to 12%. The decision was taken in a joint meeting called by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) and Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry on Monday. The meeting was held at a Samruddhi in Nanpura. The participating business and industry representatives have supported the idea to make a strong representation to the government and demanded that the increased rate of GST should be rolled back. Representatives of the Central Silk Board in Bangalore and businessmen from Mumbai also participated in the meet. The move came after union minister for state, textile and railway, Darshana Jardosh had said: “Textile industry people do not make representation with unity as it is being done by the diamond industry.” Manoj Agarwal, president of Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), said that the tax hike will badly impact the industry. “Surat sarees will become costlier by 30% with the revised tax slab. Around 40% of the textile business will be closed permanently due to the tax hike,” Agarwal said at the meeting of the industry representatives. Narendra Saboo, president of Surat Mercantile Association (SMA), said that the tax hike is unfortunate. “In a business of 2% to 3% profit, how can we pay 12% GST,” Saboo said. “It was decided that we should come on a common platform and make joint representation against the tax hike. The government should maintain the status quo till all concerned parties reach an agreement,” said Ashish Gujarati, president SGCCI. Raising issues faced by the businessmen from villages, Ashit Gandhi, a businessman, said, “The worst affected due to the GST hike will be the garment sellers in villages. They hardly make a profit of around 5% on sarees.” “Weaving industry is the only sector in the textile industry that comes under MSME. Weavers will be severely impacted due to the GST hike and many units will close permanently,” said Ashok Jirawala, president, Federation of Gujarat Weavers Welfare Association (FOGWA).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/textile-industry-to-oppose-gst-hike/articleshow/87990761.cms||---

While Mani secured 96 votes, his opponent Sooranad Rajasekharan got 40 votes. Of the 140 votes, 137 votes were polled. While T P Ramakrishnan and P Mammikutty abstained from voting from the LDF side, P T Thomas from the UDF also did not vote, all due to health reasons. One of the votes from the LDF side was declared invalid due to improper marking of the choice against the name of the candidate. The LDF has 99 members while the UDF has 41 in the 140-member assembly. Jose was elected as a Rajya Sabha member in 2018 when his party was with the UDF. He had resigned from the position in January this year, when he decided to contest to the state legislative assembly from the LDF. However, he was defeated in Pala by sitting member Mani C Kappan. After the LDF decided to field Jose K Mani as the LDF candidate in the last assembly elections, Kappan had left the NCP to join the UDF and won the seat once again. The LDF then decided to field Mani himself for the bypolls to the Rajya Sabha seat which he had vacated. He will have a tenure as Rajya Sabha member till July 1, 2024.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/jose-k-mani-elected-to-rajya-sabha/articleshow/87991369.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Centre gives Padma awards to those who work for society: Governor Anandiben Patel||LUCKNOW: UP Governor and Chancellor of state universities, Anandiben Patel, said the NDA government at the Centre has been honouring only those with Padma awards who have contributed immensely to the society. Speaking at the 8th convocation ceremony of the Dr Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMNRU) on Monday, the Governor said, “Pehle Padma Shri ya anya award aise logon ko diya jata tha jo ooper baithe logo ke rishtedar hua kartey the. Thoda sa kaam kar diya Padma Shri mil gaya. Lekin aaj ye unko hi milta hai jo samaj ka karya karte hain (Earlier, Padma Shri was given to the relatives of people sitting at the top, but now it is given to those who work for the society).” “I want the university to let students know who all have been given Padma Shri this year, in what field, and what was their contribution, so that students get motivated. This year, Padma Shri was bagged even by men and women who are 90 years and above and have been working to conserve our rivers and forests, and are educating children,” she added. Citing the example of Padma Shri awardee Harekala Hajabba, a fruit vendor from Mangalore, Karnataka, she said: “Once a foreigner asked him the name of a fruit in English. Since he was illiterate, he couldn’t answer him. That day, he decided he will ensure education for children in his village. He saved money and built an English medium school in his village. Around 200 students are enrolled in the school.” To motivate students, she also gave the example of Gautam Budh Nagar DM, Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj, who despite being specially-abled, overcame all odds and made India proud by winning a silver medal para badminton event in Tokyo Paralympics. The Governor asked the students to believe in the ‘can do spirit’ and quoted the example of young entrepreneur Mayur Patil who received the financial assistance of Rs 90 lakh under the Atal New India Challenge (ANIC) initiative for creating air filter technology that can reduce carbon emissions in vehicles by 40% and increase fuel efficiency. Patil has set up a factory for mass production of air filters. She also asked the university to organize programmes to spread awareness about organ donation. “One person who has lost the battle for life can save at least five persons by donating organs,” she added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/centre-gives-padma-awards-to-those-who-work-for-society-guv/articleshow/87992009.cms||Mohita Tewari

Meanwhile, the absence of senior Congress leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala at the UDF meeting raised eyebrows. The UDF meeting observed that the K-Rail project is unscientific and will pull the state into deep financial burden. While detailing the decisions taken in the meeting, UDF convener MM Hassan said that UDF has decided to conduct mass marches to the Secretariat and also to district collectorates on December 18. It has been decided to form protection councils in all panchayats through which the KRail project has been planned. These councils will be formed before December 10. For this, it has been decided to give the charge to UDF leaders in each district. The UDF district committees will be meeting on December 2 and 3 to chart out the formation of councils in each panchayat. “UDF is not against any development projects in the state. UDF has always been instrumental in beginning several ongoing development projects. But the K-Rail project has been planned without conducting any environment impact study. There is a severe threat to our environment if this project comes up. It is estimated that 20,000 families will have to be displaced,” said Hassan. The state government has put the total project cost as Rs 64,000 crore. However, the Niti Aayog has estimated the cost as Rs 1.33 lakh crore. This project will undoubtedly put the state into a huge financial liability, which no government will be able to bear, Hassan added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/udf-plans-massive-campaign-against-silverline-rail-project/articleshow/87990772.cms||---

Police said that none of the passengers on two bikes were wearing helmets. “Had they been wearing helmets Ashok could have been saved and the impact of the accident could have been mitigated,” said the officer.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/1-dead-4-injured-as-bikers-crash-on-delhi-mum-express-highway/articleshow/87991372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Local factors to blame for bad air, try to tackle them: Bidhuri||New Delhi: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Monday said that though cases of stubble burning are now negligible in neighbouring states, the capital continues to witness severe air pollution. In a statement, the BJP functionary said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been blaming stubble burning for the air pollution and asked the CM to apologise to the farmers. “Kejriwal and many other AAP leaders mainly blamed stubble burning and fireworks during Diwali for pollution. Now there is neither stubble nor firecrackers. So, Delhi government should tell us the real cause of pollution in the city,” Bidhuri said in a statement. “The government should accept that the capital is getting polluted because of local reasons and sincerely work to address them.” Bidhuri further said that no DTC buses had been purchased for Delhi in the last seven years. “People were forced to use their vehicles and obstacles were placed on the expansion of the metro in Delhi. The condition of the roads of Delhi is so bad that dust is blowing from them all day. Scientists also say that dust is the cause of pollution in Delhi,” Bidhuri said, adding that the air purifiers installed by the AAP government did not work. There was no reaction from Delhi government in spite of several attempts by TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/local-factors-to-blame-for-bad-air-try-to-tackle-them-bidhuri/articleshow/87991371.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of these, the highest number (11) is in Kozhikode. Some offices spent huge amounts over the salary of cleaners of the road rollers, which are idling ‘white elephants’. Some employees were transferred to other offices, says the reply received by RTI activist Raju Vazhakkala. PWD has not spent anything for maintaining the road rollers after 2016, said the RTI reply. “Why should the government retain old road rollers now? Most PWD works are now carried out by private contractors who have all kinds of equipment. The government could have made money by disposing of it. Government will have to meet the salary of those who run the ‘white elephants’ over the years. Retaining it will incur huge expenditure for the government,” said Raju. PWD officials said that they have initiated steps to dispose of all the road rollers in their possession. “We don’t lease out our road rollers to anybody as all contractors are equipped. Also, there are no new road-roller driver posts. We have started tender procedures to dispose of the old road rollers,” said a senior PWD official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/pwd-has-51-idling-road-rollers-rti/articleshow/87991373.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Kumar was addressing the students during DSMNRU convocation ceremony as chief guest on Monday. He also gave students the example of actress and dancer Sudha Chandran who continued to pursue her dreams with the help of an artificial leg. “There is nothing that is impossible for you. Technology has made everything possible. IIT-Delhi has developed a smart stick that is of great help for the visually impaired, the stick shakes and alerts the user, whenever any object is about to come on their way,” said Vikram. He said similarly in Chennai, a limb has been developed using artificial intelligence in which fingers of the limb automatically start moving to pick objects as a person thinks of it. There are several such technology-driven tools for specially-abled that have made their lives easy and have helped them to attain their dreams, he added. “Students you are graduating today, leave the university campus with an oath to ensure that you will not just keep your house clean but also public places,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/use-tech-to-achieve-goals-physicist/articleshow/87992021.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC okays Rs 15 crore tender for penguin upkeep||MUMBAI: The BMC standing committee on Monday cleared a Rs 15-crore tender for maintenance of the penguin enclosure at Byculla zoo for three years. The Shiv Sena-led panel cleared the proposal even as the BJP opposed the spending, citing that the cost of maintenance was too high, while also alleging irregularities in awarding the contract to tainted companies. The BMC claimed that income from the zoo increased by Rs12.26 crore after the penguins were brought in 2017. Footfall of visitors increased just around 30% after the opening of penguin exhibit in March 2017, but the income rose close to 500% as the BMC hiked the ticket prices drastically the same year. The Humboldt penguins were brought to the city from Seoul, South Korea, as a novel attraction to push tourism development. The move is considered the brainchild of state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. “The tenders were rigged to favour only one company, which had been penalised in the past. The penguins have adjusted to Mumbai but our BMC staff still don’t know how to take care of them and the zoo has been forced to appoint a private company for their care. The per day cost is Rs1,06,613 now which will go up to Rs1,39,282 per day. This is a 30% increase in present rates. Only Rs3.16 crore was allocated in the budget but now they are spending 63% per year more. We will move the court on this,” said BJP Corporator Vinod Mishra. According to data given by the BMC in a written reply to Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh, there were 12.51 lakh visitors in the year 2015-2016 and the zoo earned Rs70.03 lakh from ticket sales. The year after that, in 2017-2018, the footfall rose to 17.57 lakh and the income to a whopping Rs4.36 crore. In 2018-2019, the number of visitors dropped again and was just 12.7 lakh but income was Rs5.42 crore. In 2019-2020, there were just 10.66 lakh visitors but the zoo earned Rs 4.57 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-okays-rs-15cr-tender-for-penguin-upkeep/articleshow/87993179.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Officials said that a total of 1,100 tonnes of tomatoes have been purchased from its farmer groups (mainly in Palakkad) while Horticorp purchased another 300 tonnes in an attempt to stem the skyrocketing prices of tomatoes. The procured vegetables were sold in their markets at a lower price. “We have 290 markets in state where the farmer groups can sell their produce. The procurement was done from Wednesday to Saturday in which all available vegetables were purchased and it amounted to 684MT. The farmers received about Rs 2.25 crore in the process,” said VFPCK deputy manager (Marketing) Remesh Augustine. He said that tomato production is expected to peak by Dec-Jan and as of now, the availability is 1-1.5 tonnes/week. Winter vegetables were procured from Vattavada and Kanthaloor, especially potatoes, carrots and cabbage. Horticorp has also procured 2.5 tonnes of vegetables from these farmers. However, following the price hike, farmers from these areas are selling in open markets as they are getting higher prices. There is also an issue of delay in payment from governmental agencies and hence farmers are reluctant to sell their produce to official procurement agencies. Meanwhile, though prices of tomatoes came down to Rs 40-50 in Tamil Nadu and it appeared that it would come down in Kerala too, it hasn’t happened. Prices on Monday remained on the higher side. Most of the fruit and vegetable farmers in central and southern districts were affected by the non-stop, unseasonal rainfall. Most of the affected farmers are from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Idukki, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Thrissur. Pathanamthitta farms are mostly cultivating Nendran bananas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/vfpck-horticorp-step-in-to-curb-price-hike-of-veggies/articleshow/87991390.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The state-level retirement home for dogs, a very unique facility in the country, started by the Gujarat police in Anand has been thrown open for the public. After the Indian Army, which has a K9 old-age home in Meerut, Gujarat police is the only second force in the country to have an old-age home for its canines.To ensure that the four-legged colleagues of the state police spend their post-retirement life with dignity and respect, the state police had opened the facility which started at Anand police headquarters. It was inaugurated by state DGP Ashish Bhatia in July. The facility currently has 17 retired police dogs including three German Shepherds and Labradors. “After its inauguration, we are receiving many requests from people who want to visit the facility. So, under our public outreach programme, Suraksha Setu, we have decided to open this facility for the general public,” said Anand district superintendent of police Ajit Rajiaan, himself a canine lover. In fact, a lot of donors have come forward offering winter jackets and toys for the inmates for whom shelters, open ground and obstacle courses have been set up at the facility to keep the retired dogs active and fit. The facility will be open for school and college students every weekends for two hours from 9am to 11am and again two hours in the evening from 4pm to 6 pm. “People can pet, play, take a walk, feed the dogs in presence of police dog handlers. Similarly, NGOs too can actively contribute during these hours,” said Rajiaan, adding that it will be a win-win situation for both the human and his ‘best friends’. The dogs earlier handled tough jobs like sniffing out narcotics, explosives and helping detect crimes by tracking down the accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/pamper-retd-canine-warriors-at-their-home/articleshow/87990781.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Hyderabad||Canada, the new land of opportunity||By - Abhay RainaTORONTO: The Canadian government’s new programme -- Global Talent Stream – launched to attract skilled workers, has been a boon for the global workforce. In two years, up to January 2020, as many as 40,000 tech workers landed in Canada through this channel that provides temporary work permits in as little as two weeks. Interestingly, Canadian government estimates suggest that a majority of these permits were issued to Indian citizens – many of them from the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Global Talent Stream also complements the federal Express Entry programme to attract skilled individuals as permanent residents. Over 80,000 Indians moved to Canada in 2019, comprising one-quarter of all immigrants who arrived that year.  So, what is driving this surge of qualified professionals from India to Canada? Former residents of Hyderabad, who have moved to Canada in the last three years, attribute this to the possibility of an enhanced job profile and a seat at the table. Abhay Raina “Being in India means you are in the background, often with no real-time interaction with clients. The onsite team feeds you information” says Subal Saini, who worked in Hyderabad for one of India’s largest IT companies and now works for a provider of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in Toronto. Karan Singh Rajput, who is part of a global professional services firm and works on technology innovation agrees. “In India, I was an executor, even as a project manager. Here, my decisions matter more than they did in India,” he said. While not all those migrating to Canada are IT professionals, they certainly appear to be the dominant group by a stretch.  In fact, many who previously migrated to the US are also looking to move to Canada, given the uncertainty and long wait times in getting a US green card. “I know a lot of people who are interested. They ask me about schools and life in Canada. It is more stable here,” said Karthik Pedaramangalam, an IT project manager who moved to Canada from Hyderabad in 2020. Also, for families with kids, a move to a first world nation seems like a good way to provide better opportunities in secondary and college education. Karthik says that education was a key criterion in his move. His family is set to join him next month, after a year of living separately due to Covid-19 restrictions on travel. “This was an important criterion for me -- kids’ education in the long-term. It was a big plus in the move from Hyderabad. I love Hyderabad and it wasn’t an easy decision”. Subal adds, “In India you have a long waiting list for good schools and the process is challenging. Here the process is very smooth.” Challenges galore But it isn’t all smooth sailing for those looking to move to Canada. Many people who directly arrive through the Express Entry programme do not have job offers in hand. They realise upon arriving that it is a challenge to get employment without Canadian market experience. Subal’s wife, for instance, is a PhD in Biotechnology and has been looking for a job for the past year. He recommends getting local experience even if the compensation or level is not as per expectation. “I got a job with a startup which was low paying, but the right profile. When I started to look for a change, I got many calls and interviewed with seven-eight companies,” he says. Subal is joining a global technology consulting firm next month. Karan pointed out how there is more value for money in India, along with comforts like that of household helps. He also thinks that people do not prepare effectively for the initial period without a job. “The express entry is a tedious journey and people are so busy with it that they do not focus on post-landing issues. Also, the Canadian job market is seasonal, so one needs to consider that.” For context, this is the time of year when hiring starts to slow, only picking up again in February.

A bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar reserved the order after hearing solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate A M Singhvi who appeared for Alapan. Mehta contended that the Calcutta HC had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition against the order passed by chairman of the tribunal in Delhi for transferring the case to the national capital. Raising strong objection to the HC passing observation against the chairman, Mehta contended that such remarks with political overtones was not expected from a constitutional court. The HC, while setting aside the order passed by the principal bench of CAT on the Centre’s plea for transfer of the case filed by Bandyopadhyay from the Calcutta bench to itself, said, “The entire modus operandi adopted by the Union of India reeks of mala fides, it is unfortunate that the principal bench of the CAT nurtured such efforts by passing the impugned transfer order, thereby paying obeisance to the diktat of Union of India.” Challenging the order passed by the HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta contended that it was a “disturbing order” and very unwanted observation passed by the court and the order must be set aside. He said that the bureaucrat was an all-India cadre Officer and he could challenge departmental action only before the principal branch of the tribunal. Singhvi, however, submitted that his client had worked for more than 30 years from Kolkata and he never went out on any deputation in his career and the cause of action is also Kolkata as he was then serving as chief secretary. He said that the disciplinary action was initiated against him on the basis of his non-participation in the event organised by the PM after his retirement and his case could be heard and decided by the Calcutta branch of CAT. Bandyopadhyay had been issued a show-cause notice for allegedly abstaining from a meeting held by the PM in Kalaikunda in May this year. On May 31, the last day of Bandyopadhyay’s tenure, he was directed to go to Delhi to join the central government’s service. He, however, retired on the same day without going to Delhi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reserves-ruling-on-hc-order-against-transfer-of-alapans-case-to-cat-delhi/articleshow/87993180.cms||---

Addressing a news conference in Kozhikode district Congress committee office on Monday, he said that the party state unit will witness significant changes from the booth level onwards and added that the process of strengthening the grassroots level committees by setting up CUCCs was progressing well in the state. Anwar said that no party leader was unhappy with the semi-cadre organizational set up which the party was envisaging in the state and added that no one had raised any objections in this regard. “There is no conflict between senior leaders and the current party leadership in the state. The decisions are taken after holding consultations with the leaders,” he said, adding that even if anyone had grievance, it will be sorted out through talks. Responding to a question on senior leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala skipping the UDF meeting held in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday, he said that he would hold discussions with the two leaders and check if they had any grievances. Anwar said that the Congress will organize a strong agitation against the anti-people policies of the central government. “The lives of people have become miserable due to inflation and unemployment. But the central government has been adopting a totally indifferent stand. The Jan Jagaran Campaign by the Congress party is an attempt to make interventions at the grassroots level and find solutions,” he said. Asked about Congress leaders joining Trinamool Congress in many states, Anwar said that none of the key leaders had left the party and those who had gone were just power seekers.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: ‘100 rain-less years resulted in Kutch sand dunes 5,000 years ago’||RAJKOT: A joint study carried out by the Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and Kutch university has revealed interesting insights into the formation of Kutch’s sand dunes and beaches. According to the study, the present day Kutch’s shoreline and the sand dune deposition is the result of hundreds of years of rainless years around 5,000 years ago. Due to this severe climate conditions, the sea levels fell, leading to the formation of dunes along the coastline. Interestingly, this event also triggered migration of Harrappan settlement here, scientists said. “The study focussed on the climate during Meghalayan time period when there was a period ranging from 100 to 200 years when there were no and very little rain. The sea level fell at that time due to this prolonged dry years which exposed the sand. The Harappan people living here also started migrating because of distress,” said Subhash Bhandari, one of the authors of the paper and head of Kutch university’s archaeology department. The study states that couple with the lowering of sea level, strong gusts of winds continuously blowing during this dry period resulted in the huge mounds of sand. It is estimated that the sea level fell by anything between 04 m -5 m during this period and this has been derived from the current erosion of dune face and optical ages calculated from the samples from Kutch coastline. The lessening of sea levels first resulted into formation of beaches and subsequently the sand deposition. “This is a study focussing between 5,800-4,200 years before present (BP). Based on this study, we can study the climate change effects and their impact in the future,” Bhandari added. The Mehgalyan age, which is also known as Holocene period, was the most severe climate event that lowered the sea level and led to the formation of the dunes on the Kutch coastal line. According to study, the geochemical data generated from the samples of the coastal dune suggest a semi-arid to semi-humid climate with increasing chemical maturity and weakening monsoon during the time of deposition. The study further said that the sea must be at a lower level to attain a preferable condition for the deposition of dunal landforms. The lowering of the sea exposed the beach with sandy material. The study claims that these years became the most conducive environment of coastal dune formation. Sea level studies worldwide indicate that during that period, the earth witnessed a period of cold and dry phase resulting in exposure of open land and the formation of beaches and deposition of dunes. “The current erosion of dune face by the sea, we can assume that the Kutch coastline was exposed due to the lowering of sea level. During this time, the berm and beach ridge were present, and the winds intensified due to the cool and dry climate. If the sea level was the same or higher than the present day, the coastal dunes could not have formed in the current location.” the study states. This study was done by Madhavi Dabhi, Adarsh Thakkar, Anil chavan, Gaurav Chauhan, Rakesh Bhagora, Naveen Chauhan, Anil Shukla, Subhash Bhandari and M G Thakkar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/100-rain-less-years-resulted-in-kutch-sand-dunes-5000-yrs-ago/articleshow/87989910.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Mumbai||Allegations show Param Bir Singh’s co-accused extorted Rs 50 lakh||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting the bail pleas of police inspector Nandkumar Gopale (51) and assistant police inspector Asha Korke (49), a magistrate’s court said that prima facie, the allegations clearly disclosed that while Gopale demanded Rs 50 lakh from builder Shyam Sunder Agarwal, it was paid to and accepted by Korake. The court also pointed out that the alleged offence is serious and non-bailable, investigations are ongoing, the co-accused—who are the police officers—are absconding and the extorted amount is yet to be seized. The case pertains to a complaint by Agarwal at Marine Drive police station against former police chief Param Bir Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde, businessman Sanjay Punamia and six other police officers. “It appears that since the date of registration of FIR till their arrest, the material placed on record nowhere disclosed in between this period they assisted or co-operated with the investigating agency,” the court said. It further said that investigations are at an initial stage. While the FIR was registered in July, the accused were arrested on November 8. Two accused, including Punamia, were earlier granted bail. The court, however, refused to grant Gopale and Korke bail on parity. “The allegations and the case of each accused is required to be dealt with independently in respect of their role in commission of the offence,” it said. The court also pointed out that the process of recovery of alleged chats from the phones of the accused is still on. “Both accused are police officers...If enlarged on bail, the possibility of creating hurdles in investigations cannot be ruled out,” it said. The duo has now moved the sessions court seeking bail. Defence advocate Aniket Nikam presented arguments on Monday seeking bail. The court is likely to pronounce the order on December 7. Special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap opposed the duo’s bail pleas. The prosecution submitted that being police officers they know the provisions of the law, the importance of evidence and know the criminal world. “Therefore, if they are granted bail, there is a strong possibility of intimidation of witnesses as well as tampering with the evidence,” the reply said. It said that Singh is also an accused. The prosecution submitted that the duo may flee like their co-accused.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbaiallegations-show-singhs-co-accused-extorted-rs-50-lakh/articleshow/87993194.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In a press note on Monday, NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair said that the commission has agreed to the objections raised by NSS regarding this. Nair said that he had written to the commission asking to stop the survey and on Monday he received a reply letter from the commission agreeing to the objections raised by the NSS. He also said that the letter says that an earlier study report of Justice AV Ramakrishna Pillai commission is under the consideration of the government. The report had recommended a detailed and scientific survey, which is also NSS’s demand, he said. “However, the reply letter says that the sample survey is being conducted with the intention that at least those facing extreme poverty should get the benefit before the end of tenure of the present commission chairman and its members. KSCEBCFC is a permanent commission. So this stand of the commission to do something, which has no benefits, has no justification and is against the interest of the forward communities,” said Nair.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/survey-to-identify-ews-unscientific/articleshow/87991408.cms||---

The man was produced before a court on Monday that ordered to hand him over to the police on one-day remand for interrogation. The three persons held captive have been rescued. The accused was identified as Arun Kumar Sharma (59), a resident of Chutkala under Kankadbagh police station in Patna, Bihar. A local from Kaithunipole police station area on Friday last week lodged a report stating that his brother Devkinandan Sharma had left for Ropar in Punjab on October 21 and had been communicating with the family on phone. He further stated that his wife had received a threat call from Devkinandan’s mobile number for ransom of Rs 20 lakh, said Kota city SP Vikas Pathak. On the basis of call details, the special team formed to nab the accused, in coordination with cyber cell, traced the location in Ropar in Punjab, from where they rescued the three persons held captive and detained the accused with the help of local police on Saturday. The accused is a construction contractor. On pretext of work, the accused took the three persons — identified as Devkinandan Sharma (51) of Kaithunipole of Kota city, Bharat Singh Rathore (39) alias Rinku of Dadabari area of the city and Tapeshwar Mukhya of Sitamani in Bihar — in his car from Murthal toll plaza in Haryana on October 23 to Chamchor, Ropad in Punjab, where he allegedly held the three captive in a rented room in a school premises.

The instruction of excise commissioner S Aananthakrishnan was taken in the wake of the ambiguity in whether the offenders can be issued bail by the excise station house officers themselves or by the courts. As per the Section 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, all such cases involving drugs are cognizable and non-bailable. However, in a verdict by the high court in Robul Saikh vs State of Kerala case of 2016, it said that such cases are bailable cases. It is in the wake of the ambiguity in the matter that the excise commissioner has instructed not to grant bail from the excise station, and they should be produced in the court instead. In February this year, the excise commissioner had instructed all the excise officials to strictly go by the rules and inform the relatives and friends of those arrested in drug cases about their arrest, in the wake of the habitual offenders themselves coming to bail out the arrested first-time offenders. In his circular to joint commissioners and the deputy commissioners then, the excise commissioner had said that since in many cases, those coming to bail out the arrested are habitual offenders, those being bailed out and those bailing them out develop a connection, by which the first-time offenders end up in more serious drug dealings later. In minor drug cases, at present, those being arrested are being given bail at the excise offices itself, when there are people who are ready to bail them out. The excise commissioner had instructed that the excise officials should make use of the provision 50A of the criminal procedure code, by which the details of the arrest of a person should be informed to the parents of the arrested, and such details should be recorded. “It is safe to produce them in the court rather than bailing them out in the station itself. The practice of bailing out at the stations makes things more easy for them, thereby increasing the chances of returning to such offence again. Also, those coming to bail out such offenders are themselves offenders in many cases,” a top excise official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/no-station-bail-to-accused-in-minor-drug-cases/articleshow/87990803.cms||---

Several stray cats, in some cases entire families, have been wiped out due to the outbreak over the last two months, said local veterinary doctors in the city. Panleukopanea refers to the decrease of white blood cells in the body. FPL is caused by a virus of the parvovirus family called the feline panleukopanea virus (FPLV). The symptoms may include vomiting, dull fur, secretions from the eye and nose as well as others. Cat lovers who used to feed and support cats and their kittens suddenly find that all cats that used to visit and stay near their homes have gone missing. “Earlier this month, I lost all the six cats that used to stay in my home. A cat had come to our home around 2.5 years ago and during the stay, she gave birth to kittens. She and five of her kittens of different ages died within 12 days,” said Moin Bhavnagari, a resident of Tandalja. Tandalja is not the only place where such cases have been reported. Similar incidents have come to light in Tarsali, Mandvi and Makarpura besides Tanjdalja. “This has happened within a span of around two months. Our team members are aware of the development,” said the coordinator of the Karuna facility for treatment of animals Jaimil Dave. Amirhussain Momin, another resident of Tandalja, said that he had seven stray cats including three kittens at his residence. All of them died due to the disease. “I was on a tour when this happened. The doctors say that such cases are being reported elsewhere too,” he said. Veterinary doctor Sagar Khimani said that he was aware of at least 20 to 30 cases with symptoms similar to FPL. “No confirmatory tests have been done as the tests are costly and most affected cats are stray,” he said. Khimani added that pet cats are vaccinated against FPLV by doctors. He added that most victims of the virus were kittens and cats of young age. Khimani also clarified that the virus does not infect humans and is seen only in cats.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/stray-cats-dying-due-to-suspected-viral-outbreak/articleshow/87990798.cms||Sachin Sharma

In fact, we feel there has been huge delay in taking action against him. Government took serious note of his prolonged absence from duty,” a senior home department official told TOI.  Singh took over the reins of Mumbai police from Sanjay Barve on March 1, 2020. Singh is due for retirement on June 30, 2022. Earlier, he led the ACB and prior to that he was Thane CP. For a long period, there were no complaints against him, but he was shunted out and posted as DG, home guards, after his letter to the CM making corruption allegations against then home minister Anil Deshmukh. It was then confirmed the government would conduct a probe against him, and suddenly, complaints of extortion and corruption starting pouring in against him. The state had asked additional chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty to conduct a departmental probe against Singh. The inquiry has been completed and a report submitted. The probe found that reinstatement of now-dismissed API Sachin Waze was wrong and Singh’s letter to the CM was in breach of rules.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-cp-may-be-suspended-by-home-dept-in-a-day-or-two/articleshow/87993202.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Gandhi, who has been conveying his ire with BJP dispensation subtly for the past few months, categorically demanded action against the ‘education mafia’ and owners of educational institutions who, he said, wield ‘significant’ political patronage. “Inpar karyawahi kab hogi (When will action be taken against them),” he questioned. Varun’s hard stance vis-a-vis TET paper leak came a day after opposition parties fired pointed salvos at the ruling BJP saying it smacked of an attempt to play with the future of lakhs of youth. The MP’s remark stressing on ‘political patronage’ to the education mafia left BJP ranks in a state of chagrin. “This was true in the previous governments. CM Yogi Adityanath has already issued strict directions of slapping NSA and Gangster Act on the paper leak accused and announced that the test would be conducted within a month. There is no point in getting worked up and raising an issue which the state government is addressing and taking requisite steps,” said a senior UP BJP leader.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/varun-raises-heat-demands-action-against-edu-mafia/articleshow/87992056.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||Case against Bharat Mala staff after man loses son in mishap||Jodhpur: Negligence in putting up warning signs on the roads under construction by the officials of Bharat Mala Project cost them dear. A man has filed a case against them here after his son lost his life to the alleged negligence of the project officials. The case has been filed at the Balesar police station of Jodhpur under Sections 336, 337 and 304A of IPC, which have the provision of jail sentence from 3 months to 2 years. One Rajnish Gupta, a businessman from Jodhpur and son of a retired judge NP Gupta, had met with an accident on Saturday afternoon near village Dhandhania under Balesar police station of Jodhpur. “He was returning from Jaisalmer along with one person on Saturday in a personal vehicle. His vehicle overturned at one sharp turn in Dhandhania, on a road which is under-construction under the ambitious Bharat Mala Project,” said an official. He succumbed to injuries while in transit to the hospital, while the other person has been undergoing treatment in a hospital in Jodhpur. Two days after the incident, his father filed a case against the officials of the project stating that it was the negligence of the project officials in putting up adequate information/signs for the vehicle drivers about the condition of the road, which caused the accident and his son could not know what was lying ahead. He said that neither at the accident spot nor at any spot of the project, has any warning signs been put up, alerting the drivers so that they could act accordingly in time to avoid mishaps. “Even the sharp turn where the accident took place did not have any warning sign. Due to this negligence of the project officials, my son met with the accident and died,” said Gupta. This is said to be one of the rare cases of a person filing a case against the project officials over such an accident, holding them responsible for the mishap.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/case-against-bharat-mala-staff-after-man-loses-son-in-mishap/articleshow/87991412.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh, Sachin Waze have closed-door meet next to courtroom, Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil orders probe||MUMBAI: Home minister Dilip Walse Patil has asked Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to conduct a probe into a closed-door meeting that took place between ex-city police chief Param Bir Singh and dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in a room adjoining Justice K U Chandiwal commission's courtroom on Monday. When ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh's counsel Anita Shekhar Castellino found out that Singh and Waze were sitting in a separate room for a long duration, she objected, saying this was illegal. Waze was then asked to sit in the witness box by the commission probing Singh's letter to the CM making corruption charges against Deshmukh, while Singh was asked to leave. Singh appeared before the panel suo motu, resulting in it cancelling the non-bailable warrant against him. Waze, who is in jail, was to depose. ‘Param Bir and Waze’s meeting seems planned’State home minister Dilip Walse Patil told TOI on Monday, “My attention has been drawn to the prolonged meeting between Param Bir Singh and Waze. I have asked Nagrale to conduct a probe. We will wait for the outcome of the probe.” Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Shekhar Castellino said, “I took strong objection to the meeting and brought it to the notice of Justice K U Chandiwal.” According to a senior cabinet member, it appears prima facie that the meeting was not a coincidence but by design, particularly in view of the fact that Waze was the trusted aide of Singh when the latter was Mumbai police commissioner. Singh had stated in his letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray in March that Deshmukh had given a target to Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Monday’s was the first meeting between Waze and Singh since the controversy broke out. Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe demanded a high-level inquiry. “Both Param Bir Singh and Waze are main accused in a series of cases. Though they are witnesses before the commission, it was still wrong to meet. Their meeting is not in line with the rules. Why did they meet? Who permitted them to meet? Someone must have facilitated the meeting. It is a serious lapse on the part of the police escort team which could hamper the probe. Such an incident has never happened in the state in the past. Some conspiracy against the MVA government must have been hatched during their meeting,” Londhe said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-param-bir-and-wazes-meeting-seems-planned/articleshow/87993206.cms||---

Prior to the incident, the deceased, Chagan Zapda, had scolded two of the accused for not disposing off the waste material of the eatery properly. Police said that five accused — Aslam Fakir, Kadarsa Fakir, Gulam Hussain Fakir, Dharmesh Parmar and Ravi Parmar — have been arrested for allegedly killing Zapda, a driver by profession and a father of two. Two of the accused, Aslam and Kadarsa run a non-veg food joint near the residence of the victim. In absence of proper disposal of the left-over and other waste material by the eatery owners, the area has been infested by stray dogs, sources informed. Many residents of the area have fallen victim to the dog menace and the deceased’s uncle too suffered a dog bite recently, they added. On Sunday, Zapda, after seeing the shop surrounded by dogs, scolded Aslam and Kadarsa for not disposing of waste properly. Also, Zapda allegedly asked them to close the shop so as to bring an end to the dog menace. “This resulted in Zapda getting into a heated argument with Aslam and Kadarsa.

---||Mumbai||Cabinet wants flights from 12 ‘Omicron nations’ suspended||MUMBAI: The state cabinet on Monday urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on increasing restrictions on passengers arriving from “at-risk” countries where the Omicron variant has been detected. Many ministers, including Thackeray, feel the state should press for suspending direct flights from the 12 countries where the new Covid strain has been detected. “Keeping in mind citizens’ safety, the cabinet was of (this) opinion. The state will send a proposal to the Centre seeking their reply on the issue,” said a senior minister. Thackeray, who attended the meeting virtually as he is recovering from spinal surgery, said the state should regularly receive information regarding passengers landing in the state from abroad for better monitoring. “At the moment there is a delay. By the time we get information and civic teams trace the person, he already has been in contact with many others,” said an official. Thackeray said there is no way to check passengers who arrive from abroad without directly landing in the state, but who come via other modes of transport like rail or road. “To trace these passengers it would be easier if domestic airlines and international airlines share passenger details with each other, which should then be shared with the state as well,” said Thackeray. A few ministers said the state should come up with travel restrictions imposed by Dubai for passengers from the affected countries. “They have very strict protocols for passengers from these countries. They are all tested at the airport and only when they clear tests are they allowed to step out and are still advised quarantine,” said an official . But health minister Rajesh Tope said the government is cautious, and there is no need to panic as there is not a single case of the new variant in the state yet. “Even in the countries where the strain has been detected the death and hospitalisation rates are not yet known,” said Tope . Meanwhile, environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray held a review meeting of Mumbai’s readiness at the BMC headquarters. The aspects looked into included vaccination and jumbo centres. He said Mumbai is prepared to fully vaccinate by mid-January provided the Centre lessens the dose gap.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Warrant cancelled by panel; Param Bir Singh fined||MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Monday appeared suo motu before the Justice K U Chandiwal commission, following which the non-bailable warrant issued against him was cancelled by the commission though it asked him to deposit costs of Rs 15,000 in the CM’s relief fund for Covid-19 within a week. Singh’s lawyer Anukul Seth informed the commission that Singh’s ill-health and ailments had precluded him from physically remaining present before the commission, which had twice in the past issued non-bailable warrants against him. The court had imposed costs because of Singh’s non-appearance. Singh apparently appeared as a result of the protection from arrest extended by the Supreme Court by its November 22 order. On October 6, Singh had submitted that he does not wish to cross-examine any person and lead further evidence before the commission, and therefore his personal presence was not necessary. The commission took the affidavit on record. The Chandiwal commission was set up by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to probe the allegations of corruption made by Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. It was alleged by Singh in a letter that he sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in March this year that Deshmukh, as the state home minister, had asked now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze to mobilize Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurant owners in the city. Following Param Bir Singh’s ‘letter bomb,’ Deshmukh quit the Maha Vikas Aghadi cabinet. Deshmukh will appear before the commission on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-warrant-cancelled-by-panel-singh-fined/articleshow/87993218.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

---||India||SKM refuses to end stir, flags 6 other demands||NEW DELHI: If their passage was contentious and unleashed a trail of tumultuous events, the burial of the three farm sector reform laws was not a quiet affair either. On the opening day of the winter session of Parliament on Monday, the government secured the approval of the two Houses for the repeal of the laws amid protests by the opposition parties which insisted on a debate. The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, which sought to rescind the three laws passed last year, was passed by Lok Sabha within minutes. The exercise was replicated in the afternoon in Rajya Sabha. The passage of the legislation for revocation, promised by Prime Minister on Guru Nanak’s birthday on November 19, brings the curtains down on an intensely contested episode which saw sustained protests by farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western UP, their tenacity eventually forcing a rethink. The bill will now be sent to the President for his assent to meet the procedural requirement for the extinction of the three laws. While the demise of the bills addresses their principal pitch, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the joint body of the protesting farmer unions leading the current protests — has refused to end the agitation and has been pressing the government to concede six other demands they have raised, including a legal guarantee for procurement of crops at MSP, sacking and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and withdrawal of cases against farmers. As the government moved swiftly to meet the PM’s public pledge for the recall of the farm laws and cast off what had become a millstone around its neck, opposition parties led by Congess demanded a discussion, but in vain. In Lok Sabha, just as agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar introduced the bill, some opposition MPs trooped into the well of the House, raising slogans and holding banners, demanding a debate. Speaker Om Birla said he was ready to allow discussion on the bill provided there was order in the House. “You want a debate, I am ready to allow debate when there is order in the House. But if you come to the Well, how can there be a debate,” he said asking the members to take their seats. Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asked why there is no discussion since the bill is listed for consideration and passage. As opposition MPs continued to shout slogans, the Speaker put the bill to voice vote and declared it as passed. Tomar introduced the bill in Rajya Sabha after the House assembled in the afternoon. He said there was no need for any discussion as both government and opposition wanted the laws repealed. Importantly, Rajya Sabha had also cleared the three reform laws by voice vote. On Monday, before the motion was adopted for passage of the bill, deputy chairman Harivansh allowed leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge to speak for two minutes. Kharge said the government had taken back the three farm laws because of the upcoming elections in states. He also mentioned the alleged deaths of over 700 farmers in more than a year during the agitation against these laws. When Kharge took more than the allocated time, the deputy chairman called Tomar to move the motion. The minister regretted that the government could not convince the agitating farmers about the benefits of the laws. He also attacked Congress for adopting “double standard” on the laws, as its own election manifesto talked about the need for reforms in the farm sector. He said PM Modi showed a large heart by announcing the repeal of the laws on Gurupurab. The House passed the bill with voice vote amid protests by the Congress and TMC members. Dola Sen (TMC) and Nadimul Haque (TMC) were in the well to protest against the passage of the repeal bill without debate.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/skm-refuses-to-end-stir-flags-6-other-demands/articleshow/87993216.cms||---
---||Thane||Thane: Dombivli family of South Africa returnee tests negative for Covid||KALYAN: Even as samples of the Covid-positive marine navy engineer, who recently returned from South Africa, was submitted for genome sequencing to check for the Omicron variant, eight of his family members and close relatives tested negative for the viral infection, said officials from the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) on Monday. The Dombivli engineer, who returned home from Cape Town via Dubai and Delhi on November 24, was placed in institutional quarantine at the Art Gallery in Kalyan on Sunday. He is asymptomatic and stable, said officials. KDMC health officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil said, “The patient’s sample will be checked for the new Omicron variant at BMC-run Kasturba Hospital and the report will take at least one week.” Another health official said though the patient’s report will take time, they are making all possible efforts to trace all those who came in contact with him in the last four days. The health team is also looking for the cab driver who had ferried the patient from Mumbai airport to his residence in Dombivli. The eight relatives include his parents, brother and sister-in-law. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryawanshi has appealed to citizens to not panic over the Omicron variant as all precautionary measures are being taken in the municipal limits. He said people need to take three safety precautions: follow social distancing, wear masks and frequently wash their hands to reduce the risk of getting Covid. Suryawanshi also urged those who hadn't got vaccinated to take the shots as a preventive measure. Kalyan-Dombivli city, which is second-worst affected in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region after Mumbai, has so far recorded nearly 1.5 lakh cases and 2,835 deaths. At present, the daily patient count is between 10 and 20; it had once reached over 2,000.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/maharashtra-dombivli-family-of-south-africa-returnee-tests-negative-for-covid/articleshow/87991463.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Chandigarh||Senate membership cancelled, Dr Ghai stages dharna||Poviet Kaur Chandigarh: Formation of the new PU senate has been stalled again. On Friday, vice-chancellor Prof Raj Kumar cancelled membership of assistant professor Dr Tarun Ghai, who won from the Arts College constituency. Dr Ghai has registered sharp opposition to this decision. On Monday morning, he sat on a dharna in front of the vice-chancellor's office. He said that while he was currently sitting on a dharna peacefully, he would prepare a future strategy if the VC failed to take action on his demand. Formation of the PU Senate has been mired in controversy for the last one year. First, an attempt was made to reform the existing PU Senate on a large scale, but on the instructions of Punjab and Haryana High Court, the PU administration had to hold Senate elections. Later, the election was postponed four to five times. Dr Tarun Ghai contested on eight seats from the college constituency in the teachers’ category. He secured a place in the PU Senate by securing the sixth position out of 15 candidates. However, Dr Manoj Kumar, associate professor at the Post Graduate Government College for Girls, Sector 11, who lost the election, challenged his selection in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Dr Manoj alleged that when Dr Tarun Ghai contested and won the election, he was not a professor in any college. Dr Ghai was sacked by his college management in Punjab a few months before the Senate elections. On November 26, on the orders of the high court, the PU vice-chancellor heard all the parties and gave a decision against Dr Ghai. With this, Dr Ghai’s Senate membership was cancelled. Dr Manoj Kumar, who was on the waiting list, was not declared the winner either and the issue is expected to go to court again. Talking to TOI Dr Ghai said, “I am going to sit here for the next 24 hours and see if my demand is heard. If not, I will reach out to the high court for justice.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/senate-membership-cancelled-dr-ghai-stages-dharna/articleshow/87990822.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Bauxite mine in Jharkhand is nursing mined wasteland back to cultivation||Bagru (Lohardaga): Mumbai-based Hindalco Industries Limited, which is a subsidiary of the Aditya Birla Group and a leading aluminium rolling company in India, has tasted success in reducing the environmental damage caused by mining by reclaiming the mined land and nursing it back for cultivation. As a part of its sustainable mining development efforts, the company has reclaimed five hectares (Ha) of land in its bauxite mine in Bagru Hills in Lohardaga in Jharkhand and has built a biodiversity park. The park houses a butterfly garden and has seasonal fruits, vegetables, medicinal plants, herbs, tea and flowers. Bagru mines, roughly 76km from Ranchi, is one of India’s oldest bauxite mines whose operations began in 1933. As much as 3.5 lakh ton of bauxite is mined from here annually for its Alumina Plant in Muri, roughly 65km from the state capital. “In March 2019, a plan was drawn up to reclaim nearly 5 Ha (12.35 acres) land in Bagru Hills for this pilot project. One of the key features for reclaiming the land was to preserve the topsoil of the land and store it away carefully,” Sushant Guru, the head of the company’s sustainable mining development wing, told TOI. Once mining from a patch of land is complete, the top soil is put back after backfilling of the overburden (earth dug out from a spot for mining). A symbiotic fungus named VAM, which has been developed by Hindalco in association with the Coimbatore-based Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, is used to curate the topsoil to nurse its health and fertility back. In Bagru, a little over Rs 1 crore was gone into this project. Besides backfilling the land and dressing them for cultivation, other ways of livelihood promotion are also being explored. “We also deliberately left voids during the landfill and created a pond through rainwater harvesting. Two years on, the locals here have taken up pisciculture and duck farming to add to their household incomes,” Guru said. Chaiti Oraon, a resident of Bagru, has gained from duck farming. She said, “Last year, we were trained in duck farming by experts in Ranchi as there is an ever growing demand for duck meat and eggs. We now sell ducks at Rs 350 a piece.” Even rainwater stored in these ponds is also being diverted to villages on the foothills of Bagru for agriculture and consumption. As a part of the landscaping, the reclaimed land has been topped with an environment friendly conference room, auditorium and rest rooms made out of bamboo. Mining operations in Bagru are spread over 163.5 hectares of land, of which 74 hectare land will be taken up for the second phase of the project, which has been pegged at a little over Rs 10 crore. Hindalco was named the world’s most sustainable aluminum company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices this year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/bauxite-mine-in-jharkhand-is-nursing-mined-wasteland-back-to-cultivation/articleshow/87990755.cms||Dhritiman Ray
