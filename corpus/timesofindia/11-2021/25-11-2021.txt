Ashok Kumar was upset as the woman’s family had fixed her marriage elsewhere. The woman’s younger sister was grievously injured and doctors at the district hospital in Gonda referred her to KGMU Trauma Centre in Lucknow. Police announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for information on the accused, who fled the scene after the alleged crime. Five teams have been formed to arrest him. Senior police officials said Ashok Kumar entered the house of Devi Prasad, 67, a retired railway employee, at Imliya Gurdayal on Bahraich road under Kotwali police station area at around 6.30pm. He locked the channel gate from inside and barged in wielding a sharp-edged weapon. “Ashok first slashed Devi Prasad and then the latter’s wife Parvati, 50, who had rushed on hearing his cries. Thereafter, Ashok hit Shimpa, 26, whose marriage had been fixed recently, and her younger sister Sapna, 24,” said police. He locked the door of the terrace so that Devi Prasad’s daughter-in-law Laxmi could not come and identify him. “Laxmi started shrieking and drew the attention of neighbours who rushed to rescue, following which the attacker scaled down the terrace using a rope and fled from the spot,” said a senior police officer privy to the probe. The neighbours immediately informed the police and called an ambulance to take the injured to the hospital. Superintendent of police, Gonda, Santosh Mishra, who reached the spot after getting the information, said Devi Prasad, his wife Parvati and their daughter Shimpa were declared brought dead by doctors at the district hospital while Sapna was referred to KGMU Trauma Centre, Lucknow. Mishra said, “Devi Prasad’s daughter-in-law Laxmi has said in her statement that the attacker Ashok Kumar wanted to marry Shimpa but her marriage was fixed elsewhere recently and he was enraged over this. He had been constantly calling Shimpa since morning and was requesting her to elope with him.” Police said Ashok was wearing a black jacket and helmet to conceal his identity. DIG Devipatan Range, Upendra Agarwal, also reached the spot to supervise the probe. Agarwal told TOI, “Prima facie, it has come to the fore that the accused wanted to marry Shimpa whose marriage was fixed elsewhere by the family, following which he attacked the woman and her family brutally, killing three and grievously injuring one.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/triple-murder-in-uttar-pradesh-jilted-lover-kills-woman-her-parents/articleshow/87897989.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||India||Protesting farmers' body releases note on MSP, says call on next steps of movement to be taken on November 27||NEW DELHI: On a day the Union cabinet approved a bill to repeal the three controversial farm laws passed last year, before they are tabled in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), a constituent of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), released a ‘Note on Minimum Support Price’ explaining why the farmers’ agitation will continue.  The farmers’ leaders said their movement that has been continuing since November 26, 2020, mostly at the Delhi borders is unlikely to end with the Centre’s move to repeal the three farm laws, unless there are clear signs of the government being serious about talking to them on the issues raised by the SKM. “We have written a letter to the prime minister. We are waiting for a response from the government by November 26, when we will partially celebrate a victory (for the withdrawal of the farm laws) and partially take our movement ahead for the MSP,” said AIKS secretary and former CPM MP Hannan Mollah.  “The SKM has called a meeting on November 27, where we will take a call on which way the movement will go… that will depend on whether the government invites us for serious talks,” said Mollah.  He added the MSP has to do with the present crisis, while the farm laws were a problem for the future, which has been resolved by repealing them.  Mollah mentioned how despite the Union Cabinet’s decision to pass the bill repealing the farm laws, there was no visible “change of heart” in the government. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised in at least 200 public meetings during his election campaign in 2014 that he would pass legislation guaranteeing MSP for the farmers. It is hard to believe this man,” he said.  AIKS president Ashok Dhawale highlighted how “from day one of the struggle of farmers against the farm laws, the demand for a law guaranteeing the MSP had been repeatedly asserted”. “This struggle was never just about the repeal of the black laws. The main problem (MSP) is yet to be solved,” he said.  Dhawale stressed that the SKM’s ‘Mission UP’ and ‘Mission Uttrakhand’ would proceed as planned. The note, itself subtitled “Mission UP - Defeat Anti-farmer BJP”, points out the trends of prices, at which most farmers sell their produce.  “The CACP (The Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices) takes into account A2+FL (cost of inputs + family labour costs) as the cost of production, which is much lesser than C2 (cost calculation that also includes interests on capital and rent of land) costs. Further, there is a significant difference between the CACP’s projection of C2 and the projection of the same by different states,” the note explained.  Citing an example, it mentions that for paddy, while a state government projects a C2 cost of Rs 2,114 per quintal, the CACP only calculates Rs 1,559 per quintal. “It is no wonder then, that CACP thinks that the paddy MSP for Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22, Rs 1,940, is remunerative,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/protesting-farmers-body-releases-note-on-msp-says-call-on-next-steps-of-movement-to-be-taken-on-november-27/articleshow/87897072.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||World||Ahmaud Arbery killing in Georgia: Three white men found guilty of murder||WASHINGTON: Three white men were found guilty of murder Wednesday for shooting dead an African American man after chasing him in their pickup trucks, following a racially-charged trial in the southern US state of Georgia that gripped the nation. Travis McMichael, who shot Ahmaud Arbery, his father Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor, William "Roddie" Bryan, who took part in the chase, were all found guilty of murder. A jury in Brunswick, Georgia, deliberated for less than 12 hours before convicting the three men on multiple counts of murder and other charges. Travis, 35, Gregory, 65, a retired police officer, and Bryan, 52, face potential life in prison for shooting the 25-year-old dead in February 2020. A crowd gathered outside the Glynn County courthouse erupted in cheers and chanted as the verdict was delivered at the end of the high-profile trial. "Say his name. Ahmaud Arbery. Say his name. Ahmaud Arbery," the crowd chanted. A graphic video of the shooting of the unarmed Arbery went viral on social media and added fuel to last year's protests against racial injustice sparked by the murder of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, by a white police officer in Minnesota. The defendants said they suspected Arbery was a burglar who had been active in their neighborhood and invoked a since-repealed state law that allowed ordinary citizens to make arrests. But prosecutors said they had no justification for attempting to detain Arbery and never told him they were trying to arrest him as he jogged through their Satilla Shores neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon. Chief prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said the McMichaels, who were armed with a shotgun and a handgun, and Bryan didn't see Arbery commit any crime that day but "chose to confront him". "He was trying to get away from these strangers who were yelling at him, threatening to kill him," Dunikoski said. "And then they killed him." The jury was shown video during the trial of the McMichaels pursuing Arbery in their truck, and Bryan chasing him in his own vehicle while filming the scene on his cell phone. At one point, Arbery attempts to run around the front of the McMichaels' stopped truck. Travis, who had gotten out of the vehicle, opens fire with a 12-gauge shotgun. A wounded Arbery is seen struggling with McMichael before being killed by another shot. The guilty verdicts in the Georgia trial came just days after the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse in another closely watched case in the United States. Rittenhouse, 18, shot dead two men and wounded another during protests and riots against police brutality in Wisconsin last year that followed the police shooting of a Black man. The teen claimed self-defence and was acquitted of all charges on Friday. The McMichaels and Bryan are also facing federal hate crimes charges in a case that will go to trial next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ahmaud-arbery-killing-in-georgia-three-white-men-found-guilty-of-murder/articleshow/87898515.cms||---
---||World||Georgia: Trio guilty of killing Ahmaud Arbery. What now?||ATLANTA: The killing was captured on video and shared around the world: Ahmaud Arbery running toward and then around an idling pickup truck before its driver blasted him at close range with a shotgun.  Soon after Travis McMichael shot Arbery on February 23, 2020, his father Greg told police how the pair had armed themselves, chased the young Black man and trapped him "like a rat". Neighbor William "Roddie" Bryan told officers he joined the pursuit and helped cut off Arbery's escape.  After a 13-day trial at the Glynn County Courthouse in coastal Georgia, a disproportionately white jury found the three white men guilty of murder. Each man was also convicted on lesser charges. On what charges the men were convicted? A nine-count indictment charged all three men with one count of malice murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal attempt to commit a felony, in this case false imprisonment. Travis was convicted of all nine charges. Greg was convicted of all charges except malice murder. Bryan was convicted of two counts of felony murder, one count of aggravated assault, one count of false imprisonment and one count of criminal attempt to commit a felony. Prison time Malice and felony murder convictions both carry a minimum penalty of life in prison. The judge decides whether that comes with or without the possibility of parole. Even if the possibility of parole is granted, a person convicted of murder must serve 30 years before becoming eligible. Multiple murder convictions are merged for the purposes of sentencing.  Murder can also be punishable by death in Georgia if the killing meets certain criteria and the prosecutor chooses to seek the death penalty. Prosecutors in this case did not.  Each count of aggravated assault carries a prison term of at least one year but not more than 20 years. False imprisonment is punishable by a sentence of one to 10 years in prison. When will they be sentenced? That's not clear yet. Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley will set a sentencing date. Will there be appeals? Appeals are almost certain in this case, said University of Georgia law professor emeritus Ron Carlson.  One likely basis for appeal could be the exclusion of certain evidence from the trial, he said. Defence attorneys had sought to introduce evidence of Arbery's criminal record, records on his mental health and the fact that he was on probation. They also wanted to have a use-of-force expert testify. But the judge ruled against admitting any of that evidence.  "They'll argue that relevant evidence helpful to the defence was excluded by the trial judge and that was an error," Carlson said.  It's also possible that appellate attorneys could find other grounds for appeal after scouring transcripts and jury instructions, and speaking with jurors. Aren't there still federal charges pending? Yes. The McMichaels and Bryan still face federal charges.  Months before the three stood trial on state murder charges, a federal grand jury in April indicted them on hate crimes charges. It's an entirely separate case that's not affected by the state trial's outcome.  US District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood has scheduled jury selection in the federal trial to start February 7. All three men are charged with one count of interference with civil rights and attempted kidnapping. The McMichaels were also charged with using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.  The federal indictment says the men targeted Arbery because he was Black.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/georgia-trio-guilty-of-killing-ahmaud-arbery-what-now/articleshow/87898802.cms||---

The lawsuits filed by the Naperville families of Jacob "Jake" Jurinek, 20, and Franco Patino, 21, are part of a flood of dozens of suits against Scott and the companies behind the November 5 event, in which 10 people were killed and hundreds were injured when a crowd surge pushed concert-goers forward, crushing and trampling many of them.  As with many of the other lawsuits, this one puts the blame on the companies and Scott, an organiser of the concert who was on stage when the deadly scene unfolded, for failing to take even the most basic safety precautions.  "Defendants egregiously failed in their duty to protect the health, safety, and lives of those in attendance at the concert, including but not limited to the failure to provide adequate security personnel to implement crowd control measures, proper barricades, and the failure to provide a sufficient amount of emergency medical support," the suits contends.  Patino and Jurinek were both college students, Patino at the University of Dayton in Ohio and Jurinek at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale. They had been football teammates at Neuqua Valley High School in Naperville.  Like the loved ones of the other victims, a partner in the Chicago law firm Corboy & Demetrio, which filed the lawsuits this week in Harris County courts in Houston, said the families are trying to make sense of something that makes no sense.  "A healthy, strong 20- or 21-year-old child goes off to a concert thinking he's going to have some fun, and they're going to be celebrating, in this case, Jake's 21st birthday," Corboy said, according to the Naperville Sun. "Nobody expects to go to something as happy and joyous as concert where they end up dying. Nobody anticipates when they pay these high prices for these concert tickets that they have to worry about things like that."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/families-of-2-friends-killed-at-travis-scott-concert-file-lawsuits/articleshow/87898824.cms||---
---||India||Cabinet clears repeal of farm laws, but unions plan show of strength||NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved PM Modi’s announcement and relevant draft bills to repeal the three central farm laws even as the agri unions are planning a big mobilisation along the capital’s borders to mark one year of their protests against the bills on Friday that coincides with India's Constitution Day. The Centre is expected to introduce the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 on the first day of the upcoming winter session of Parliament, beginning November 29. If Parliament functions smoothly, the process of repeal from both the Houses will be completed during the first week. “It will be our priority to take back these three laws in the upcoming session,” Union minister Anurag Thakur said. These laws are related to giving farmers freedom to sell their produce outside state-regulated ‘mandis’ (agriculture markets), strengthening the mechanism of contract farming and liberalising stock-holding limits of agricultural produce. Though Modi had last Friday announced his decision to repeal these laws, Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the joint platform of the farmers’ unions, decided not to end the protests, saying its other demands are still pending. In order to forge a larger alliance of farmers and workers, SKM will on Thursday discuss the modalities to take forward the ongoing movement to different states with the joint platform of central trade unions. It will on Saturday take a call on the format of protests in coming months. “Farmers’ unions and trade unions will take this movement forward while focusing on their demand of legal guarantee to MSP,” said a farmer leader of SKM. Different farmers’ unions have been demanding legal guarantees to MSP for a long time. Even a private members’ bill on the issue has been pending in Rajya Sabha. SKM on Wednesday noted that the list of legislative business for the upcoming Parliament session, released by Lok Sabha secretariat, continues to keep the Electricity (Amendment) Bill on its agenda. It also flagged Indian Maritime Fisheries Bill 2021 in the list, saying fishermen are also farmers according to India’s National Policy for Farmers, 2007 and fish workers’ unions have been voicing their apprehensions about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cabinet-clears-repeal-of-farm-laws-but-unions-plan-show-of-strength/articleshow/87898931.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||I am in Chandigarh, will visit Mumbai soon: Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI/ CHANDIGARH: Two days after the Supreme Court granted former city police chief Param Bir Singh protection from arrest, he said he was in Chandigarh and would visit Mumbai soon. The IPS officer, who is facing four extortion cases in Maharashtra and has been declared an absconder by a court, told news channels that he was in Chandigarh and would soon decide his next course of action. Singh on Wednesday evening also appeared on Telegram, but later deleted his account from the social messaging app. He also told TV channels that he would be visiting Mumbai soon. Singh has not reported to work since May this year, after his transfer in March from the post of Mumbai police commissioner and his subsequent allegations of corruption against then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. Meanwhile, the state law-enforcing agencies are not in a hurry to record his statement in the extortion cases registered against him in Mumbai and Thane in view of the Supreme Court order. "The Supreme Court has asked Parambir Singh to join the probe and has posted the hearing to December 6. We had a preliminary discussion on the SC order with legal experts. We are not in a hurry, we will not take any decision in haste. We do not want to invite the SC's ire. Instead, we will wait till December 6 to seek clarification on the order,'' a senior IPS officer told TOI.  The IPS officer said so far, four cases of extortion have been registered against Singh. In certain cases a non-bailable warrant too has been issued, while a court has declared him a proclaimed offender. "The Supreme Court has given a blanket order not to arrest him, therefore we will seek clarification from the apex court on December 6,'' he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-am-in-chandigarh-will-visit-mumbai-soon-param-bir-singh/articleshow/87899080.cms||---
---||India||For first time, India’s fertility rate below replacement level||India’s population is set to fall as its total fertility rate (TFR) or the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime has dropped below replacement level for the first time and is now 2. This was revealed in the National Family Health Survey data for 2019-21, released on Wednesday for phase-2 states along with all-India data. The replacement level TFR, at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next, is estimated to be 2.1. Among larger states, there are now just three states — Bihar (3.0), Uttar Pradesh (2.4) and Jharkhand (2.3) — with a TFR above replacement level. From NFHS-3 in 2005-06, when India’s TFR was 2.7, it dropped to 2.2 by 2015-16. Between NFHS-3 and the latest NFHS-5 in 2019-21, some of the most populous states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar in that order, showed significant decline in TFR, which has helped India’s overall rate fall below the replacement level. Phase-1 of NFHS-5 was conducted from June 17, 2019-January 30, 2020 and phase-2 from January 2, 2020 to April 30, 2021. Phase 1 targeted 22 states and UTs, and the second, 14 states and UTs. Barring Bihar, urban TFR in all states is below replacement level. Even rural TFR is above replacement level only in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand among the larger states and in Meghalaya, Manipur and Mizoram among the smaller states. The lowest fertility rate among larger states is in J&K at 1.4. It is also the state that recorded the highest decline of 0.6 in fertility rate between the last NFHS survey in 2015-16 and the latest one. Among larger states, Kerala and Punjab had the lowest fertility rate of 1.6 in NFHS-4, followed by Tamil Nadu with 1.7. However, while Punjab’s fertility rate has remained the same, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are the only states in India where fertility rate went up, though marginally, to 1.8 in the 2019-21 survey. Sikkim has the lowest fertility rate of 1.1. This is equivalent to the lowest fertility rate in the world of 1.1 in South Korea. According to UN Population data, the highest fertility rate is in Niger (6.9) and Somalia (6.1). Among the neighbouring countries, Nepal has the lowest fertility of 1.9 followed by India and Bangladesh (2). Barring Africa (4.4) and Oceania (2.4), all geographic regions have achieved replacement level fertility rate of 2.1 or less. Asia’s TFR is 2.15, just a touch above replacement level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-first-time-indias-fertility-rate-below-replacement-level/articleshow/87899133.cms||---

After the meeting, the Trinamool chief said that she asked the PM to withdraw the order on extending the jurisdiction of BSF in border states since “it would disturb the local law and order situation within the state due to confrontations between central and state law and order agencies”. She said, “We are not against BSF or central agencies, but it is a question of federalism.” The state’s interest must be kept in mind. If you have to secure the border, state will help the Centre with additional forces… There should be a meeting and the order should be revoked,” she said. Banerjee said she raised the issue of violence in Tripura with the PM and urged him to “see to it” that such inci- dents do not happen. When asked about the farmers’ pro- tests, the TMC chief said she was with them on the MSP (minimum support price) issue. “I want a legislation on MSP to be passed,” she said. Banerjee said she would be working with regional parties to take on BJP in the upcoming state elections and would be happy to help as a campaigner for “friendly parties like Samajawadi Party” in Uttar Pradesh. “In Goa, our party is al- ready there, in other states I will be going whenever my party decides,” she added. Banerjee said that she would be in Mumbai to attend an industry summit on De- cember 1, during which she “will meet Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackaray- ji and Sharad Pawar-ji”. She also raised the issue of the Centre’s dues to her state, which stands at Rs 96,655 crore. The PM has assured he will look into this, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-banerjee-meets-pm-modi-raises-bsf-jurisdiction/articleshow/87899233.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

A formal announcement on Sangma's move, which had been on the cards since September, is likely on Thursday. Congress has 18 MLAs in the 60-member assembly and Sangma, a five-time MLA, is currently the leader of the opposition there. Sangma's possible exit has been the subject of speculation ever since Congress appointed Shillong MP Vincent H Pala as the party's state president. Sangma didn't give away much but his meetings with TMC strategist Prashant Kishor, general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and TMC Rajya Sabha member Sushmita Dev fuelled talk of the defection being just a formality. Meanwhile, Congress said its leaders crossing over to TMC was "drama" and that the party can't be weakened. Organisation general secretary K C Venugopal said attempts to weaken Congress had been launched earlier too but didn't succeed. Former MP Kirti Azad and Haryana leader Ashok Tanwar were among the few to join TMC on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/12-of-18-meghalaya-congress-mlas-set-to-cross-over-to-tmc/articleshow/87899290.cms||---

After meeting BBMP officials and senior officials, he said 87km of primary and secondary storm water drains will be completed in north Bengaluru. Flooding in many parts of Yelahanka and Byatarayanapura assembly constituencies was due to unprecedented rain over a couple of hours and narrow storm water drain network. "The BBMP officials explained the need for constructing a 51-km primary SWD and a 36-km secondary SWD in north Bengaluru to tackle flooding in low-lying areas. I asked the BBMP chief commissioner to prepare a detailed project report. Preliminary estimates suggest it may cost Rs 900 crore which I'll release once the DPR is ready," said Bommai. The CM has instructed the Palike to ensure the SWD masterplan is prepared simultaneously and all possible measures are taken to prevent flooding from next year. "The work should be completed before the next monsoon and I've ordered immediate desilting of all SWDs, including tertiary drains, to ensure free flow of water," he said. BBMP directed to clear 714 illegal constructions on SWDsBommai has been informed of 94 critical points in Bengaluru and he said these will be freed of all obstacles. BBMP has been directed to clear 714 illegal constructions on SWDs in the city at the earliest. "While I told BBMP to give the poor adequate time to relocate with notices served in advance, structures constructed by real estate developers need to be demolished immediately," he said. The BWSSB has been asked to complete existing drain works as incomplete drains are adding to the flooding. BBMP has been directed to fill up potholes more than 1 foot in depth and relay stretches of damaged roads more than half a kilometre. "The works are being taken up on priority as soon as rain recedes," the CM said. Ashoka's absenceRevenue minister R Ashoka's absence at the meeting triggered much speculation. There were reports that he didn't attend the meet since he is miffed at not being given the Bengaluru development portfolio following resentment of city BJP MLAs. At the meeting, Bommai was flanked by IT-BT minister CN Ashwath Narayan, also an aspirant for the portfolio ahead of BBMP polls. Bommai dismissed the speculation: "Ashoka is the revenue minister and has a vast area to cover, considering the rain has hurt several districts. He informed me before the meeting about a scheduled tour of Hassan and Kodagu districts. There's nothing more to it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/900-cr-plan-to-preventflooding-in-north-bluru/articleshow/87899417.cms||---

As per Karnataka data released on Tuesday, just 40% of children in the 2-4 years age group attend preschool. At 56%, it’s the highest in Mandya and Udupi districts, and lowest in Bengaluru with 31% attendance. In India, many children attend Anganwadi Centres that provide spaces for them to learn, play, eat nutritious food, and develop skills needed for a lifetime of learning. Pre-primary education, like the one provided at an Anganwadi Centre, improves children’s school readiness by providing quality learning through interactive, play methods with qualified instructors, says the study. It also points to how parents or guardians can go to work at ease if children are enrolled in pre-primary education. It further says that preschool attendance is moderately low among children in nuclear households (39%) than in non-nuclear ones (41%). The study adds that preschool attendance among children is highest in households headed by Christians (44%) and is the same (40% each) in households headed by Hindus and Muslims. It is lowest among scheduled caste households (38%) and highest in households not belonging to a scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or other backward class (43%). Interestingly, urban households show preschool attendance of 38%, slightly lower than rural households (41%). However, there is no clarity on whether the data is only pertaining to children attending Anganwadis or all preschools, including those run by the private sector. ‘Packed with kids’Pruthvi Banwasi, secretary, Karnataka Council of Preschools, however finds the data hard to believe. According to him, the 40% (state figure) and 31% (Bengaluru figure) are an underestimation. “There are 2,500 preschools registered with the Karnataka Council of Preschools and nearly 85% of them are in Bengaluru. In total, there are over 20,000 preschools in Bengaluru, including the small sized ones,” he said, adding that all preschools were packed with kids during the survey period (2019-20).

At 56%, it’s the highest in Mandya and Udupi districts, and lowest in Bengaluru with 31% attendance. In India, many children attend Anganwadi Centres that provide spaces for them to learn, play, eat nutritious food, and develop skills needed for a lifetime of learning. Pre-primary education, like the one provided at an Anganwadi Centre, improves children’s school readiness by providing quality learning through interactive, play methods with qualified instructors, says the study. It also points to how parents or guardians can go to work at ease if children are enrolled in pre-primary education. It further says that preschool attendance is moderately low among children in nuclear households (39%) than in non-nuclear ones (41%). The study adds that preschool attendance among children is highest in households headed by Christians (44%) and is the same (40% each) in households headed by Hindus and Muslims. It is lowest among scheduled caste households (38%) and highest in households not belonging to a scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or other backward class (43%). Interestingly, urban households show preschool attendance of 38%, slightly lower than rural households (41%). However, there is no clarity on whether the data is only pertaining to children attending Anganwadis or all preschools, including those run by the private sector. ‘Packed with kids’Pruthvi Banwasi, secretary, Karnataka Council of Preschools, however finds the data hard to believe. According to him, the 40% (state figure) and 31% (Bengaluru figure) are an underestimation. “There are 2,500 preschools registered with the Karnataka Council of Preschools and nearly 85% of them are in Bengaluru. In total, there are over 20,000 preschools in Bengaluru, including the small sized ones,” he said, adding that all preschools were packed with kids during the survey period (2019-20). Authorities from the women and child welfare department were unavailable for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/40-of-2-to-4-year-olds-in-karnataka-attend-preschool-31-in-bengaluru/articleshow/87904064.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||KSLU permitted to conduct intermediary semester exam||Bengaluru: In a relief for Karnataka State Law University (KSLU), the high court on Wednesday allowed it to go ahead with an intermediary semester examination for LLB students.A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi passed this order while admitting a writ appeal filed by KSLU. The university had challenged the November 12, 2021 order of a single bench, staying the exam which was scheduled to commence from November 15.“We find students of the colleges governed by the appellant university (KSLU) are altogether on different footing than students of the colleges governed by other state universities. The discrimination can be only among equals. We also find some force in the argument that sections 9 and 10 of the Karnataka Law University Act-2009 would not have any application in the present controversy as it would be within the powers of the appellant university to conduct annual exams,” the bench stated. The bench also ordered notice to Bar Council of India as well as the petitioner-students before the single bench, opining that the matter requires consideration. However, results of the exam will be subject to further orders in the writ appeal which will be taken up in March next year. Appearing for KSLU, senior advocate Udaya Holla argued the appellant university is bound by Bar Council of India rules and added that if no examination is conducted by this year-end, BCI will not recognise the degrees and the same will affect the prospects of students.The court was told that the single bench grossly erred in passing the interim order, on the premise that there was discrimination between students of the law colleges governed by the appellant university and students of the colleges run under the other state universities. Holla claimed that the July 23, 2021 notification issued by the state was not at all applicable to KSLU and the interim order has affected 108 colleges having 26,000 students as the exam could not be conducted.Full report: toi.in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kslu-permitted-to-conduct-intermediary-semester-exam/articleshow/87899435.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Odu Karnataka to help bridge learning gaps||BENGALURU: Given how the pandemic pulled down learning levels of children following closure of schools, the government is now planning to reintroduce the Odu Karnataka programme for students of classes 4 and 5. Odu Karnataka (Read Karnataka) was launched in 2016 in three districts of Mysuru, Ramanagara and Mandya and was gradually extended to 20 others in 2019-20 before Covid-19 hit the country. The programme in partnership with Pratham, an NGO, taught children basic numeracy and reading skills. “There is no denying that the learning gaps are huge. We will restart Odu Karnataka across the state from next month. Students will be given an assessment in the beginning of the programme, divided into groups based on their learning levels and trained accordingly,” said a senior official from Samagra Shikshana Karnataka. The Annual Status of Education Report (Aser) 2021 for Karnataka released in September pointed to a huge drop in learning levels among children. In 2020, only 34% of class 5 students could read class 2 textbooks, while it was 46% in 2018. The drop was around 16 percentage points in government schools where only 33% students were able to do so, whereas it was 6% in private schools. This is the worst drop since 2014, the year from when Aser made the comparison. “Teachers are currently looking at bridging the gap. But Odu Karnataka will make it more intensive. Special learning kits have been tendered and supplied. Children will be trained one hour daily for 60 days,” the official added. As per the programme, a simple one-on-one assessment is conducted and children are grouped according to the result. The NGO trains cluster resource persons, who in turn train teachers to guide children’s activities and work. For each group, there are activities and materials ready and appropriate for their levels. As students progress, they are moved to the next group. “The programme is meant to fill the gaps. If the gaps are larger than usual, we will probably extend it for over 60 days. Otherwise the same module will continue,” explained Ashvini Ranjan, managing trustee of Pratham Mysore. The programme will enable children, especially those who aren’t yet at the level of reading basic text fluently (at least with text up to class 2 level of difficulty) with comprehension and performing basic operations in maths. For classes 1 and 2, the Nali Kali programme too has been revamped to ensure children are taught matter from previous grades which they missed out on due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/odu-karnataka-to-help-bridge-learning-gaps/articleshow/87899436.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Bengaluru||Fraudsters within pose big threat to banks: HC||Bengaluru: Pointing out that frauds perpetrated by bank employees are now a global problem, the high court advocated zero tolerance towards such acts and dealing with such instances with an iron hand.Upholding the dismissal of an employee of Union Bank of India for fraudulently withdrawing money from a customer’s account, a division bench comprising chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and justice Sachin Shankar Magadum noted that theft such as skimming customers’ cash deposit has become rampant and employee or occupational fraud is likely to be the largest and most prevalent threat faced by financial institutions.The bench said there has to be zero tolerance as a fraudulent employee constitutes an attack against the organisation from within, by the very people who are entrusted to protect its assets and resources.“It is no exaggeration to say the greatest fraud risk that a bank faces walks through their doors every morning and sits down to work. Therefore, any fraud, however negligible, associated with a financial institution has to be viewed very seriously and dealt with an iron hand,” the bench observed while dismissing the writ appeal filed by K Satish Chandra Shetty.On the ground of voluntary admission vis-a-vis charges that he fraudulently withdrew cash from the savings account of Mumtaz Yuna Kunhi Monu and also gave him forged FD receipts, Shetty was dismissed from service on April 4, 1999. The order was upheld by the appellate authority on November 12, 1999. Four years later, when the bank wrote to Shetty to settle his terminal benefits, he raised a dispute before the labour court, which on January 19, 2007 ordered his reinstatement with backwages. However, UBI challenged this order, citing that the labour court failed to consider the fact that Shetty himself admitted his guilt of misusing customer’s trust and money.On January 20, 2021, a single bench of the high court upheld UBI’s plea and reversed the labour court order. Shetty challenged this, claiming he was under financial distress and, therefore, compelled to do withdraw money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fraudsters-within-pose-big-threat-to-banks-hc/articleshow/87899446.cms||Vasantha Kumar

From pre-Independence era, these farmers have the right to use fodder, wood, agriculture and forestry produce grown or available on such (kumki) lands.“The appellants by seeking kumki rights are intending to enlarge their extent of land-holding. Therefore, the said right is not absolute and is rightly declined in the present case, considering public interest at large. The state (government) with a noble cause resolved to provide housing sites to weaker sections of society and when a public interest at large is pitted against an individual’s cause, public interest has to prevail,” the division bench observed while upholding the February 6, 2021 order passed by the single bench.Appellants Chandrahasa Bhandary and Abdul Kareem, both residents of Belma village, Mangaluru taluk, had claimed when their application seeking regularisation of kumki rights was pending, the deputy commissioner had issued a notice, saying their rights no longer exist there as the government had resolved to form housing sites on government lands to allot them under Ashraya Scheme to weaker sections of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kumki-rights-can-be-curtailed-court/articleshow/87899447.cms||---

However, sales at the bakery continued with only one staffer.The agitating employees claimed the owner had failed to remit employees’ provident fund for the last eight years despite deducting the sum from their irregularly paid salaries. This despite the bakery doing roaring business even during the lockdown, they said, and added the strike will continue.The 68-year-old bakery, located at Sajjan Rao Circle, was named after the area as Visvesvarapuram Brahmin Bakery. Started in 1953 by Thirumalachar from Hassan, the bakery turned into a landmark establishment in Bengaluru and its products are most sought-after even to this day. Trouble is said to have been brewing among staff for a few years now. “We finally decided to boycott work today (Wednesday) as we didn’t get regular pay and benefits, including bonus promised by the management for the last few years despite the bakery doing no less than Rs 1 lakh business in four hours on a working day,” said a staffar agitating outside the establishment, who did not want to be identified. “Close to 35 employees have retired from the bakery in the recent years and the management is yet to settle their dues. The retirees are now struggling to make ends meet after toiling for years at the establishment,” he lamented.Vijay Bhaskar, a trade union leader guiding the staffers, said there are 43 workers in the bakery. “The workers have gone on strike demanding pending wages and regular pay in future, apart from setting right the PF contribution,” he added.Srinivas, the bakery owner, did not respond to calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vb-bakery-staffers-want-regular-pay-strike-work/articleshow/87899448.cms||Petlee Peter

The store, branded Fresho, sells fresh fruits and vegetables. BigBasket co-founder & CEO Hari Menon said the plan is to clock Rs 12,000 crore in sales from 800 Fresho stores across 10 tier-1 cities by the 2026 fiscal. “The penetration of fruits and vegetables in an organised format just doesn’t exist in the country other than in Chennai. We thought there was an opportunity for us,” he said. The company, in which the Tatas acquired a 64% stake earlier this year, has tie-ups with 20,000 farmers and operates 60 collection centres. “About 85% of what we sell comes directly from farmers and that piece has scaled up very well for us. We will give access to some 50,000 products through a click-and-pick model, where customers can order online and then pick up the order from Fresho outlets,” Menon said. The stores are expected to cater mostly to the millions who haven’t tested waters with buying grocery online. “Even at Rs 400 average order value, we will generate money as the gross margins are higher in fruits and vegetables,” Menon said. The collection centres double up as sorting centres and house an agronomist to guide farmers on increasing the quality and production of crops. The Fresho stores are equipped with assisted check-out and self-billing counters. Customers can pick items of their choice, and weigh them at the counter. A computer vision system identifies items in the cart and generates bills accordingly. Menon said that in about a month, BigBasket will roll out an express grocery delivery service that will deliver orders within 10-20 mins. This will be under the brand name BBNow. “We will leverage a three-tier warehousing structure to move goods fast. There are 3,500 SKUs in the fast-moving category largely meant for top-ups,” Menon said. Asked about business momentum following the acquisition by the Tatas, Menon said it has given them access to Tata Group companies. “We are in the B2B kirana trader business where we supply to about 75,000 kiranas, and we plan to scale that to 6 lakh with Tata Consumer Products. There are a lot of synergies on that front,” Menon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bigbasket-opens-1st-physical-store-targets-800-in-5-years/articleshow/87899495.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

According to Bescom officials, the government advised them to proceed with caution before disconnecting power supply. “We have issued notices to the departments to make payments early. Before disconnecting, we will advertise and give the defaulters another notice. If we cut power supply, it is the people at large who will face issues,” a senior official said. State entities owe Bescom Rs 3,752 crore, while dues from central entities run up to nearly Rs 42 crore, according to data accessed by TOI.

The centre will pave way for advanced research in future technology of the Indian space programme. The NIT-Patna and the ISRO signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard here on Wednesday. NIT-P’s director PK Jain, director of CBPO (Capacity Building Programme Office) Sudheer Kumar N and associate director (response and academic interface-CBPO) MA Paul from the ISRO headquarters were present on the occasion. The centre will act as a major facilitator to promote advanced research in the area of space technology, space science and space applications relevant to space programme activities in the eastern India (including Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Sikkim). NIT-Patna will be the nodal centre for research and development activities of the ISRO in the region. Addressing the event, PK Jain said with the establishment of the Regional Academic Centre for Space (RAC-S), the NIT-P will become the mentor institute for space research in the eastern region. “It will promote the research activities in various fields, including electronics, communication, material science, information technology and remote sensing, as per the need of the ISRO. The experts will give us the topic and ideas from the interaction and we will submit the joint research work with the ISRO’s support. The project will reviewed, monitored and guided by the scientists,” he said. “If any institute in the eastern India requires any support of experimental nature, their facility will be open. The ISRO will also give the financial support to the tune of Rs2 crore annually. This support is not only for research projects but also for undergraduate, postgraduate, PhD and teaching faculties. The short-term projects will be for BTech/MTech students of the NIT-P and other institutes,” Jain said. “The centre will also offer long-term research and development projects for PhD scholars and faculty members. It can be individual project or project with another institute. The projects will be scrutinized at two levels, by the NIT-P and then by the ISRO,” he added. Sudheer said the RAC-S centre will act as a facilitator for the space technology activities in the region to become an ambassador for the capacity building, awareness creation and research and development activities of ISRO. He also talked about the fields of research and ways to participate in the project. Total five RAC-Ss have been set up by the ISRO across the country, including at IIT-BHU (Varanasi), NIT-Kurukshetra, MNIT-Jaipur, NITK-Surathkal and Gauhati University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/isro-signs-mou-with-nit-p-to-set-up-academic-centre-for-space-research/articleshow/87896622.cms||Faryal Rumi

In an interview with B K Mishra, he claimed that the government was not responsible for any of the misdeeds of the university authorities. Excerpts: Why were you absent from the chancellor’s award ceremony at the Raj Bhavan on Tuesday? No official of the education department was present either. The state education department was never consulted on these awards by the chancellor’s secretariat. The department knows nothing about the purpose of these awards, the selection criteria or the credentials of the awardees. Hence, attending such a function was not justified. Do you feel that the vice-chancellors (VCs), pro-VCs and other officials of the universities are not being appointed in a fair and transparent manner? If yes, what should be done to ensure the recruitment of honest and competent academics? The recent developments in the field of higher education clearly indicate that things are not moving in the right direction. The government has taken a serious note of the shady developments in universities at the behest of the top officials. The people and the institutions involved in the appointment of the top officials should ensure that the academics with doubtful credentials do not get entry into the university governance system. Although the government is not involved in such appointments, it is held responsible for all the ugly developments in the universities. What about the continuance of MU VC Rajendra Prasad in office despite disclosure of huge money and official documents from his residence in a recent SVU raid? The chancellor should take note of all the developments taking place in the field of higher education and initiate proper action against the accused. In fact, he should take whatever steps are required to restore the credibility of higher education in the state. The recent acts of omissions and commissions manifested in the working of VCs have tarnished the image of the universities greatly. The Nitish government’s zero tolerance for corruption needs to be applied to the universities and all other higher education institutions of the state. The additional chief secretary of the education department had recently said that although the state government meets all the financial requirements of the universities and colleges, it has little say in their administration? What is your comment? The dual control over the university does complicate things. But if all the works are transacted in a fair and transparent manner, there should not be any difficulty in ensuring good governance. Is there any proposal to divest the governor of his responsibility as chancellor as done in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu? There is no such proposal at any level in the state as of now. But if both the Centre and the state decide to do away with the dual role of the governor acting as chancellor, an independent office of the chancellor may come into existence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/recent-developments-in-universities-have-tarnished-image-of-government/articleshow/87896742.cms||B K Mishra

The accused and his aides were held by the police on Wednesday. The incident had come to light on Tuesday afternoon when the body of the girl was found in the Bhanpur forests on the Sanjeli Road in the district. The girl, Krutika Baranda, had left for tuition classes on Monday morning, but did not return till late night. Her scooter was also missing. The deceased’s father, Mahesh, identified the girl from the photographs. Mahesh suspected Mehul Parmar, a resident of Vandariya village, of killing his daughter. Investigations led the police to the garage where the scooter used by the girl was kept. The police had received information that Parmar had left the scooter there. The scooter had been dismantled. Parmar was held by the police and questioned. It came to light that angry over the girl for breaking-up with him, Parmar killed her. They have been having an affair for one year. Parmar decided to kill her and roped in two minor accomplices to carry out the crime. The girl was called to the Saat Bangla forests by Parmar. When she came there, Parmar first stabbed her and then strangled her to death. Later, he threw away the knife in a pond and took the body to Bhanpur forests where it was charred. The girl’s belongings and jacket were also thrown in a pond. Parmar and the two minors were detained by the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jilted-lover-kills-girl-chars-her-body/articleshow/87897027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The NGT’s southern bench asked collector A Mallikharjuna to send a full-fledged report, or at least an interim report, before the next hearing scheduled on January 7 next year. Battu Satish Reddy, a resident of Pittalavanipalem, lodged a complaint on Nov 17 against NTPC Simhadri, Union of India, chief secretary of AP, Central Pollution Control Board, APPCB, and also the district collector of Vizag. The complainant, whose house is situated 50 metres away from the ash pond of the plant, alleged that the plant was continuously violating the conditions specified in the environment clearance guaranteed by the ministry of environment & forests. He further stated that severe dust and water pollution is caused by the plant, and though local authorities provided tap water to the houses after they lodged a complaint, the dust pollution is continuing. The complainant’s lawyer, Sravan Kumar, said NGT has asked the district collector to inspect the plant personally and file at least an interim report by the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-collector-gets-notice-over-ntpc-pollution/articleshow/87897249.cms||Siva G

---||Vijayawada||Welfare pensioners to draw Rs 2.5k from Jan after govt hike||Amaravati: The state government has decided to increase welfare pension to Rs 2,500 per month from January 2022, up from Rs 2,250 per month. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to increase pension by Rs 250 per year and make it Rs 3,000 per month in a phased manner during the last election campaign. The government increased the first installment soon after coming into power in 2019. However, the government could not enhance pension in the last two years due to the financial crisis induced by Covid-19. The state government made an attempt to revise the pension in July 2021 but could not do so as the state’s revenues had not improved as expected. “The government has proposed to increase pension from January 2022,” panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy told the assembly on Wednesday. In a written response to a question by TDP members N Rama Naidu, Adireddy Bhavani, Bendalam Ashok and Dola Sri Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy, the minister said the government would initiate appropriate measures to enhance the pension from January. The minister said government spending on welfare pensions, including for the elderly, widowers, physically challenged and people with chronic diseases has seen a steep jump in the last two years. In a written response to YSRC legislators RK Roja, V Kalavathi, Reddy Santhi, Vidadala Rajani, J Padmavathi and N Dhana Lakshmi, the minister said the government has been spending close to Rs 1,450 crore per month to disburse welfare pensions. “The budget granted for welfare pensions was just around Rs 281 crore per month in 2014. It was Rs 501 crore till October 2018. However, the amount jumped to Rs 962 crore by November 2018,” said Peddireddy. The total allocation increased after the former TDP government enhanced the pension amount from Rs 1,000 per month to Rs 2,000 per month, following a promise made by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who was an Opposition leader at the time. After Naidu increased the pension, Jagan promised making it Rs 3,000 per month in a phased manner. The budget for pension has gone up to Rs 1,472 crore per month in the 2020-21 financial year and was brought down to Rs 1,448.97 crore per month after introducing reforms in the grant of pensions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/welfare-pensioners-to-draw-rs-2-5k-from-jan-after-govt-hike/articleshow/87897180.cms||Samdani MN

The court also directed additional solicitor general KN Singh to get the photography done and submit colour photographs of the entire area so that its actual situation could be known. The court fixed December 8 for hearing the matter again and did not vacate the stay on mining activities done by two firms after getting permission from the mines and geology department. The division bench of Justices Rajan Gupta and Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing a PIL filed by one Vinay Kumar Singh for preserving the two hills which have religious, cultural and historical importance with caves having ancient paintings and temples therein. The court orally observed that when an important matter like Ayodhya was decided on beliefs then why it should not go by religious beliefs for the two hills. It also observed that both the hills should not be quarried when people still perform worship there. The central government, in its counter affidavit , had apprised the court about the religious and cultural beliefs for the hills since ages. As per the petitioner, both hills are believed to be the residing places of the Ramayan era sages Lomas, Yagyavalkya and others and also considered the place where Lord Ram’s wife Sita had given birth to two sons during her exile. The petitioner also apprised the court about the Nawada DM and SDO’s letter to the Centre for preserving these Ramayan era hills and connecting it to the Ramayan Circuit. The petitioner has urged for permanently stopping quarrying activity on the two hills. He has also prayed for protecting environment and ecosystem of both the hills. Counsels Chakrapani and Gautam Kejriwal appeared for the two private two mining firms and submitted that the stay order was given without hearing them and they were suffering huge losses each day. Mines and geology department special public prosecutor Naresh Dixit submitted that quarrying on both hills had started after taking due permission. However, the court didn’t accept his submissions. The petitioner’s lawyer, Brishektu Sharan Pandey, through a rejoinder, had apprised the court that quarrying on both hills were done without taking necessary permission from the standing committee of the National Board For Wildlife. Pandey also submitted that the hills are of religious, historical, ancient and ecological importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-tells-govt-not-to-touch-lomas-yagyavalkya-hillocks/articleshow/87897801.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Kolkata||A son’s tribute to ‘an unknown Indian’ on scholar’s 125th birth anniversary||Kolkata: The audience watched in rapt attention as Prithvi Narayan Chaudhuri presented an audio-visual tribute to father Nirad C Chaudhuri on his 125th birth anniversary at Tollygunge Club’s event, ‘An Author Extraordinary: Dr Nirad C Chaudhuri’, on Tuesday evening. The gathering, which included Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy, his wife Roxna, former chief secretary of Uttarakhand S K Das, club CEO and managing member Anil Mukerji, present club president B B Chatterjee and past president Aniruddha Lahiri, was also regaled by the personal recollections and analysis of his prose by author Amit Chaudhuri. Reading out passages from ‘The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian’, Amit illustrated Nirad C’s ability to “tap into the poetic reserves of the English language” and express how writing can give “a space” to something “over and above” what we are told in everyday life “important”. After sharing how he had paid a homage to a ‘luminous passage’ from ‘Thy Hand, Great Anarch!’ in his ‘A Strange and Sublime Address’, Amit recalled an event from Oxford in 1987. Due to their similar surnames, Amit said, he had received an envelope, addressed to ‘Nirad C Chaudhuri, C/O Dean of Oxford University’. When Amit later told Nirad C about the envelope during an accidental meeting, the 90-year-old invited him to his 20, Lathbury Road home but Amit forwarded the envelope instead. “I had heard he quizzed people and would play a piece of classical music and ask them to identify it. I wanted to know him through his writings but didn’t want to be quizzed,” he said. In 2008, he finally went to 20 Lathbury Road when Oxford City Council asked him to unveil the blue plaque to honour the author. Prithvi’s 30-minute presentation traced the journey of his father from Kolkata’s Mirzapur Street to Oxford. “There already exist four documentaries on my father. On his 125th birth anniversary, I wanted to make a presentation that would show how he had contributed not only in the field of literature but he was also an analyst of political and neo-political global scene,” he said. His father, Prithvi said, was one of the most difficult persons to live with because of his “eccentricities”. “He never sent us to school and insisted I first learnt Persian, Urdu and Sanskrit before I could write A-B-C-D. Between 1942 and late 50s, he did not allow us to have a fan in the house even in Delhi heat as he thought his manuscripts would fly away,” Prithvi said. Asked if Nirad C had regretted being “eccentric”, Prithvi said, “He never accepted he was eccentric.” Photos and video footage played on screen while Abhishek Ganguli’s voiceover narrated how Nirad C tore up his manuscript if his coffee was cold and even insisted on serving his guests only 10-year-old malt out of a wooden cask. The video had rare clippings of his writings for ‘Sanibarer Chithi’, ‘Natun Patrika’, ‘Prabasi’ and a photo of a Claude Monet painting Queen Elizabeth had gifted him on his 100th birthday among other things. . Swamy, distantly related to the family, said the presentation was a “devotion of a son to a father with such meticulous details and relevance which completely describes what Nirad C Chaudhuri was”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-sons-tribute-to-an-unknown-indian-on-scholars-125th-birth-anniversary/articleshow/87898117.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The project that took off in 2016, was delayed due to a shortage of funds, the Covid-19 pandemic and other reasons, for more than three years. The college was announced by chief minister D V Sadananda Gowda in his 2012-13 budget. The foundation stone for the state-of-the-art facility on 247 acres, was laid in October 2016, and the work was expected to be completed by 2018. This would be Karnataka’s seventh veterinary college. Dr C S Nagaraj, dean, Veterinary College, Bengaluru, and official on special duty (OSD), Veterinary College, Koila, told TOI that Rs 110 crore was earmarked for the first phase of the project. However, till date, they have received only about Rs 81.7 crore from the state government. Currently 80% of the first phase work has been completed. Despite the fund crunch, work is in progress at the site. The project was also delayed due to the monsoon, shortage of sand and the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are hopeful to complete the first phase of work by December, and hand it over to the department,” Nagaraj said, adding there is also a second phase of work. The first phase of the project consists of the college building, hospital, guest house and two hostels. The hostels can accommodate 144 inmates each. In the second phase of the project, Dr Nagaraj said that it will have an animal farm, laboratory, roads, boundary wall, staff quarters and many other facilities. “We are finalising the second phase project details,” he said. Officials from the Karnataka Housing Board said the entire campus and facilities are designed according to stipulated norms of the Veterinary Council of India (VCI). Currently, the state has five veterinary colleges functioning in Bengaluru, Hassan, Shivamogga, Gadag and Bidar. Two more colleges are coming up in Athani and Koila.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/phase-i-of-dks-veterinary-college-to-be-completed-in-december/articleshow/87897436.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The sale of IPTF has resulted in resolution of Rs 757 crore of group debt and will reduce non-performing assets for lenders. The IL&FS stake in Prime Terminals was held through IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure (IMICL). VTTI has acquired the state-of-the art energy storage terminal situated in Fujairah, UAE from IMICL and other shareholders. VTTI specialises in energy storage operations and has set up greenfield terminals as well as acquired and upgraded facilities across the world. VTTI will now own 90% of the terminal, while the other 10% will remain with the Fujairah government. This acquisition of the 333,484 cubic mtr terminal will help the firm expand its position in Fujairah. Earlier this month, IL&FS said that it has addressed Rs 52,200 crore of the group’s outstanding debt of Rs 99,000 crore and would achieve an aggregate resolution of Rs 61,000 crore. The sale has also enabled release of a corporate guarantee of $110 million issued by IMICL for IPTF. Key lenders to the company were First Abu Dhabi Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, and State Bank of India that had debt outstanding of over $80 million, which has been fully repaid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-resolves-rs-757cr-debt-exits-terminal/articleshow/87898185.cms||---

But he showed exemplary patience and began making drastic improvements in every field, one by one. Even a blind man can feel the improvements done by Nitish during his 15-year-long tenure as CM, he said. Singh was addressing his party’s ‘15 saal-bemisaal’, organized at the JD(U) state headquarters to commemorate the completion of 15 years of Nitish as the CM. JD(U) had organized a similar programme at each district headquarters where the party’s senior leaders recalled the major development works executed by Nitish during his 15 years in power. Singh further said CM Nitish made such a gigantic turnaround in education, health, law and order and agriculture fields as Bihar today is counted as one of the front-ranking states. Enumerating different works done by CM Nitish, Lalan said people must recall the law and order scenario during the regime of former CM Lalu Prasad and also compare the difference with that of Nitish. Attacking the leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, for making unemployment among youths as a major political issue, Lalan said Tejashwi had been shouting “rozgaar-rozgaar”, but he must explain to people how much youths were given jobs during the regime of his father Lalu and mother Rabri Devi. JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha and other senior leaders also addressed the event. Workers of the ruling party celebrated the day by organizing different kinds of events at its offices across the state. At Kalyan Bigha, the native village of Nitish, the JD(U) workers observed the day as Diwali by lighting lamps at major places in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-celebrates-15-years-of-nitish-as-cm/articleshow/87896664.cms||Madan Kumar

The MBBS student was arrested along with her husband and another person from Hajipur with a consignment of smuggled liquor. They were forwarded to jail on Monday evening. The accused have been identified as third-year medical student Nutan Devi (22), her husband Vikash Singh (25) and their tenant Abhishek Kumar (24). The trio was arrested from Chiknauta village under the Town police station on Saturday midnight. Police seized two luxury cars and two bikes from the couple’s residence at Chiknauta, besides recovering more than 300 liquor bottles from the cars and from under the bed on which the couple slept. Cops suspect the vehicles were purchased with money earned from liquor smuggling. Town police station SHO Subodh Kumar said: “Police are verifying the information provided by Nutan. Her husband Vikash was already wanted in a liquor-smuggling case and a cheating case. The raid at their residence was actually conducted to arrest Vikash in the two cases.” The SHO added, “Nutan initially tried to obstruct the search in the bedroom. She threw several tantrums. But as soon as liquor was recovered and police arrested her, she started begging for mercy, pleading that her medical career would be spoiled.” SHO Kumar said it was then that the police came to know that she was a medical student and running a liquor smuggling racket with her husband. “They used to smuggle IMFL from outside Bihar and then supply it to several areas in Vaishali and neighbouring districts,” he said, adding that Abhishek was arrested for his complicity in the crime. The SHO said Vikash hid himself on the premises following the raid. “Police started looking for Vikash when it found liquor hidden in the two costly cars,” he said. He said further search was carried out and police recovered more liquor bottles hidden in the couple’s bedroom. “Vikash’s father has retired from state police. It is being verified that if the three-storey building where raid was conducted had actually been built by Vikash’s father or by him,” he said. Kumar said police are trying to gather the bank account details of Nutan and Vikash to know how much money they have earned. “Vikash is accused in at least six criminal cases, including duping people for clearing competitive examinations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mbbs-student-hubby-held-in-vaishali-with-300-liquor-bottles/articleshow/87897828.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Lalu, who had visited his party office after four years, lit up a six-tonne stone lantern which he referred to as a lamp whose light would never diminish even if it got windy. “This lantern will continue to spread light,” he said. Lantern is the poll symbol of the RJD. The RJD chief lashed out at chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar and claimed that the latter had formed the government through wrong means. He, however, praised his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who is the leader of opposition in the state assembly, for working hard and asked the party workers to be united. He also appreciated the way the party office was being run under the leadership of state RJD president Jagdanand Singh. Lalu went on to praise the farmers who forced the Centre to repeal the three farm laws. “I congratulate the farmers of the country who struggled for so long. Today they have won and crushed the arrogance of the Union government,” he said, adding that the protests would not stop until the government declared a guarantee on MSP. Tejashwi, who was also present on the occasion, criticised the CM and his party for celebrating 15 years of their rule. “Why are they calling these 15 years unprecedented? There are no jobs and crime has increased. As many as 75 scams have taken place and Bihar is lagging behind other states on all parameters,” he said. Jagdanand recalled how Lalu always stressed on providing quality education to students. “He inspired everyone to study, but now schools have become orphanages,” he claimed. Lalu’s elder son and Hasanpur MLA Tej Pratap was missing from the gala event organised by the RJD. Sources said no special invitation had been given to any MLA, including Tej.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rollback-of-farm-laws-centres-defeat-lalu/articleshow/87896700.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Talking to this reporter on Wednesday, Agarwal said, “The number of small vehicles plying on different routes will be fixed so that the problem of traffic congestion does not occur. All the dysfunctional electric poles will also be removed to decongest the roads.” The divisional commissioner instructed the officials concerned to prepare an action plan to tackle the problem of traffic snarls. He also asked them to interact with the public to know where the problem lies and come up with area-wise solutions. “Encroachments on roads lead to traffic congestion. Hence, a special eviction drive will be carried out by the Patna Municipal Corporation, the district administration and the local police with a view to ensuring smooth flow of vehicles on different routes,” Agarwal said, adding that zone-wise teams would be constituted for the purpose. The divisional commissioner also asked the district magistrate to install closed-circuit television cameras at all chowks and intersections so that the movement of vehicles on roads is monitored effectively. “The nearby police stations have been told to keep tabs on the problem of traffic congestion and take prompt action,” he said. Traffic SP Amarkesh D, on the other hand, was asked to conduct an intensive vehicle-checking drive and take strict action against the violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/spl-eviction-drive-to-be-launched-soon-to-decongest-roads-in-patna/articleshow/87897789.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Crypto bill leads to panic sale, 20% crash||NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Indian crypto investors resorted to panic selling after the government listed a bill on Tuesday night seeking to ban private cryptocurrencies, while allowing an official digital currency by the RBI. Cryptocurrency prices in the Indian — linked to rupee — market crashed by up to 20% before recovering on Wednesday after exchanges allayed investors’ fears. “On Tuesday night, we saw huge selling in the rupee (INR-crypto) market on WazirX. We saw a 15-20% crash in prices once investors engaged in panic selling. However, the market is showing recovery and is at a 3-4% discount currently. A similar knee-jerk reaction was seen in January, when the contents of the bill were disclosed. So, we need to wait and watch how this evolves,” said WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty. CryptocurrencyLiveHe added that earlier, due to increasing demand, the Indian crypto market had been trading at a premium of 5-8% above the global markets. Users of WazirX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, faced delays on the platform’s app and website on Tuesday night. WazirX said the issue had been resolved on Wednesday. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was down 10% against the rupee at Rs 40 lakh on Wednesday evening (the crypto market is open 24/7). “A lot of fear is being seen among Indian crypto investors, especially the ones who entered recently. However, we advise people to pay attention to (Parliament’s) winter session and derive conclusions based on it. The ban reports could turn out to be speculative,” crypto exchange BuyUcoin’s CEO Shivam Thakral said. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was down 10% against the rupee at Rs 40 lakh on Wednesday evening (the crypto market is open 24/7). Cryptocurrency exchange founders on Wednesday assured nervous investors that their digital assets are secure even as they welcomed the proposed bill to regulate virtual currencies. They said the government’s announcement is a positive step since a well-defined framework will not just help in structured adoption but will also put a tight check on unregulated crypto markets, a concern for the regulators. “First, we need to understand that there is a lot of speculation around the term ‘private cryptocurrencies’, which will be put to rest once the fine print of the bill is out,” said Gaurav Dahake, CEO & founder of cryptocurrency platform Bitbns. The bill, which reportedly seeks to safeguard small investors by treating cryptocurrency as a financial asset, has major ramifications for the industry that has remained unregulated so far. It is set to be introduced by the government in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. A description of the bill showed that it aims to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies except “certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and uses”. On Wednesday, a Bloomberg report said the government may not have a complete ban, while safeguarding small investors. The legislation may stipulate a minimum amount for investments in digital currencies, while banning their use as legal tender, the report said. “There’s no such definition laid out around public and private crypto. But the context here seems to suggest that public crypto resembles CBDCs (central bank digital currencies, also known as sovereign digital currencies) and private crypto refers to assets like Ripple and Tron,” BuyUcoin’s Thakral said. Earlier this year, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said the central bank may pilot a digital currency by December. While there is widespread fear about a blanket ban, founders at crypto exchanges that TOI spoke to remained positive about the outcome. “There have been many positive steps taken by the government to learn and understand crypto and its impact on all stakeholders — investors, exchanges, policymakers,” said Avinash Shekhar, co-CEO at crypto exchange ZebPay. “So, we’re looking forward to a crypto bill that takes into consideration all the inputs from those discussions.” Industry experts said cryptocurrencies have already been regulated across leading economies such as the US, the UK, Singapore and Japan. “With India now hosting the largest number of cryptocurrency investors in the world, it is just a matter of time for the government to adopt smart regulations for the sector,” said Dahake. Regulation may also lead to earnings from crypto attracting both direct and indirect taxes. “Crypto assets may be taxed according to capital gains rules and may attract GST too,” said ProAssetz Exchange CEO Manoj Dalmia. Industry body Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council’s co-chair Ashish Singhal said, “The crypto industry is hoping the government will involve industry stakeholders while drafting the bill.” Unocoin co-founder & CEO Sathvik Vishwanath said, “A more descriptive title of the bill would have allowed us to decode it before it was tabled. However, that has not happened. So, we will have to wait and watch.” (With inputs from Mamtha A in Chennai)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/crypto-bill-leads-to-panic-sale-20-crash/articleshow/87898632.cms||John Sarkar

Animal activist Aarti Chauhan of Navi Mumbai Animal Protection Cell, who had been pursuing the cruelty case, welcomed the court’s verdict Teddy had been killed with a rod. “Teddy has finally got justice. On September 11, 2015, the lovable female dog was brutally hit with a rod outside Safal Complex in Nerul. She died after being in coma for 20 days. The Nerul police were informed about the cruelty, and CCTV footage was submitted as evidence at the time,'' said activist Chauhan. Chauhan said that the authorities must properly monitor to ensure that full community service is performed by the convicts without skipping any days. “This is a rare order in favour of animal rights” Several animal lovers had taken out a rally to demand ‘Justice For Teddy’ in 2015 and had also held a candlelight vigil for the mute victims. The civil judge (junior division & JMFC) T M Deshmukh-Naik has stated in her recent final order that the convicted men — Ram Kujbihari and Akhilesh Asthana — must devote one month of free service at an animal welfare institution, while also pay Rs 20,000 each as punishment. The criminal offence against them was registered under section 11(1) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and section 428 of the Indian Penal Code for killing the stray canine. Veteran animal activist of People for Animals (PFA), Maneka Gandhi, had a different take on this issue. “If a human child had been cruelly killed with a rod, do you think the convicts would have undergone community service as punishment? I feel that there should be a sterner legal deterrent and punishment for those who commit animal cruelty,” said Gandhi. An official from Navi Mumbai police, Bhaskar Thakur, who is in charge of court duty, told TOI: “Since the final order was recently passed, the convicts will be given some time before starting community service, in case they want to appeal to a higher court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/dog-killers-ordered-to-serve-at-animal-ngo-for-a-month-in-mumbai/articleshow/87899283.cms||Vijay Singh

Meanwhile, Paytm shares continued on their road to recovery, gaining 17% on Wednesday to end at Rs 1,753, but still remain 18% below their issue price of Rs 2,150. This was despite the broader sensex falling 323 points to 58,341. The government on Tuesday released the list of bills that it will seek to pass in the winter session of Parliament. Among them is the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021. This bill describes the need for amendments in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 and 1980. In addition to this, there are some amendments needed in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The privatisation of two public sector banks was announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The banks’ disinvestment, along with that of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, was expected to fetch Rs 1.75 lakh crore for the government. Shares of Indian Overseas Bank opened at Rs 22 and touched the day’s high of Rs 23.8 before closing 13% higher at Rs 22.5. At the current price, the bank’s market capitalisation (m-cap) is Rs 42,436 crore. Shares of Central Bank opened at just under Rs 23 and touched a high of Rs 23.7 before closing over 10% up at Rs 22.7. The bank currently has an m-cap of Rs 19,706 crore. Paytm shares saw reduced volatility on Wednesday on the back of what appeared to be buying interest from institutional investors. Shares had fallen 35% in the first two days of trade, but found support at lower levels later. At the current price, the payment giant is valued at nearly Rs 1.14 lakh crore — more than Nykaa (Rs 1.06 lakh crore) but still behind Zomato (Rs 1.22 lakh crore).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-up-17-central-bank-iob-gain-from-selloff-hopes/articleshow/87898201.cms||---

It will transfer the gasification undertaking on a slump sale basis.  Slump sale means transfer of a business of a company for a lump sum without assigning any values to individual assets and liabilities of the entity. The move, said RIL, will help in unlocking value in the gasifier business, which could include induction of external investors and partners. The separation scheme would be effective from March 31, 2022 and requires the approval of shareholders, NCLT and other regulatory authorities. The gasification project in Jamnagar was set up to produce syngas (synthesis gas) to meet the energy requirements as refinery off-gases, which earlier served as fuel, were repurposed into feedstock for the Refinery Off Gas Cracker (ROGC). Syngas as a fuel ensures reliability of supply and helps reduce volatility in the energy costs. It is also used to produce hydrogen for consumption in the Jamnagar refinery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-to-hive-off-gasifier-biz-to-100-arm/articleshow/87898178.cms||---

Some passersby could be seen capturing Lalu on their mobile phones, while those with him could be heard telling not to go far. Lalu, through a tweet, stated that he drove his first vehicle after many years. “All born in this world are drivers in different form. May the vehicle of love, humanity, parity, prosperity, justice, patience and happiness run with enjoyment for everyone,” read a part of his tweet. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagn said Lalu had bought this jeep in 1977 when he was elected to Parliament for the first time. “This was a military jeep and he got it in auction at Panagarh in West Bengal,” said Gagan. Lalu’s nostalgia could be seen from the fact that he shared an anecdote with party workers in the afternoon that how he used to drive this jeep with full speed with socialist leader Karpoori Thakur sitting by his side. Lalu said Karpoori Thakur, instead of stopping him, used to say he drives well. “I then used to slow down,” he said, adding he had bought the jeep for Rs5,000. Lalu also expressed his desire to travel throughout Bihar, but added, “My medical treatment is going on. I don’t like sitting at home.” Lalu will leave for Delhi on Thursday, where he is undergoing treatment. Lalu had come to Patna on Monday evening to appear before a special CBI court on Tuesday in a fodder scam case. ‘Lalu violates Motor Vehicles Act’: JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar on Wednesday said RJD chief Lalu Prasad has the habit of flouting rules and law and he again violated the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act by driving his jeep on the road without fastening seat-belt. Neeraj was speaking at an event organized by JD(U) to celebrate ‘15 saal bemisaal’ of chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Over 50 families in three wards - Vizhinjam, Harbour and Kottapuram are unable to return to their homes mainly due to issues pertaining to structural stability, overflowing septic tanks and erosion of soil around the wells. The spike in rental rates in these areas has emerged as another concern with many families finding the rates barely affordable. “Earlier, fishermen families were able to pool some money on a monthly basis to move to rented houses. Now the minimum rent is from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month. The additional expenses of electricity bills and household expenditure make it difficult for the families to sustain in rented houses. Constant weather warnings have deprived them of their means of livelihood as well,” said Paniyadima, ward councillor of Kottapuram. The city corporation has sought the services of experts from the department of Geology to assess the structural stability of houses. Around seven houses in Kottapuram area are perched precariously on the slope and one of the houses had partially caved in forcing immediate evacuation of a 12 member family. “We are dealing with multiple challenges here. Either, the houses are uninhabitable due to the nature of terrain and cracks or the drinking water sources have become contaminated due to overflowing of septic tanks. Loose soil around the well has washed off in many areas and they cannot use well water. Due to nil income, people cannot afford to move to rented homes also,” said Mayor Arya Rajendran. As regarding the issue of septage collection, the corporation plans to make use of its septage tankers to schedule weekly collection in these areas. The people have complained that despite their meagre income, they are forced to depend on private tankers at high rates to collect septage so that toilets can be used. Mayor said that this can be solved by deploying collection tankers free of cost. There are, however, far more serious issues especially with regard to structural stability. “People cannot live in relief camps for long. They try to move out seeking some rented houses, however, the huge rates being asked as rent worries them,” said Paniyadima. The corporation is mulling ways to provide rented accommodation at civic body’s cost, but this will require council’s approval and has to be sanctioned by the state government. The duration for which the corporation can arrange rented houses for these families is another concern. “One key factor is that the issue is not confined to these wards alone. There are many families who would prefer rented houses to camps and if the corporation is to take up the expense for that, it would require the state government’s approval. We will go to the next level by first bringing it to the council,” said Arya Rajendran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/coastal-wards-of-district-still-bearing-brunt-of-heavy-rains/articleshow/87897788.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Due to the unseasonal rainfall, sugar cane cutting activity in the district was affected as tractor trollies got stuck in the mud collected in the farms. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), Kolhapur district received 3.9mm rainfall between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. With 9.9mm Gadhinglaj received the highest rainfall while Gaganbawda received the least (0.1mm) showers on Wednesday. Parts of Satara and Sangli districts also received few spells of heavy showers. Satara district received 2.4mm rainfall while the latter received 2.2mm rainfall on Wednesday. Vishwas Salokhe, a sugar cane farmer, said, “Sugar cane cutting activity has been delayed owing to collection of mud in the farms that are result of unseasonal rainfall battering the region for the past five-six days. The cane crushing season is at its peak and the rain is delaying the process. The tractor trollies are getting stuck in the farms once they are loaded with sugarcanes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-cane-cutting-affected-as-heavy-showers-lash-kolhapur/articleshow/87896078.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Bambhania is one of six police officials accused of killing 62-year-old from Ahmedabad, Sheikh Babu Nisar, who had gone missing on December 20, 2019 after he was taken to Fatehgunj police station. His son approached the high court, which ordered an inquiry into the mysterious disappearance of the man.

A death sentence given by a trial court needs to first be confirmed by the high court to become effective. A 19-year-old telephone operator, too, had registered a case alleging gangrape at the same mill compound. The accused were mostly the same. On March 20, 2014, the sessions judge had first held three common accused guilty for the gangrape of the telephone operator, and minutes later, pronounced them guilty for the gangrape of the photojournalist. The death sentence was awarded incorrectly by wrong application of law, said Yug Chaudhry, counsel for the accused, before a bench of Justices S S Jadhav and P K Chavan. The state through special public prosecutor Deepak Salvi, however, said the law amended permits noose for a ‘second conviction’ and that “sequence and time of the offence is immaterial”.

The forest officials had set up a cage a week back after the leopards were spotted in the area. This is a rare incident where two male leopards have been trapped in the same cage. The forest officials said that a veterinary doctor conducted a medical examination of the leopards. They are both healthy and medically fit. They are to be released in their natural habitat in a day or two following the official procedures, the officials added. There have been several incidents of leopards being spotted in the area and their attacks on humans. Recently, a 12-year-old boy sustained injuries on his neck and shoulder following a leopard attack near Dugarwadi village in Trimbakeshwar taluka of the district when the boy was walking with his friend near the village. Around three weeks back, a 3-year-old male leopard was trapped in a cage at Kaluste-Darewadi in Igatpuri taluka. So far, three persons have succumbed to the leopard attacks in the past two months in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-male-leopards-trapped-in-same-cage-in-igatpuri/articleshow/87896086.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Thane||Amid standoff, Maharashtra govt announces salary hike for MSRTC staffers||MUMBAI: The state government has announced a salary hike for nearly one lakh state transport employees who have been on a strike for the last 28 days. However, employees were not happy with the announcement and demanded that a decision be taken on their primary demand of merger of the corporation with the state government. They are likely to continue with the strike. The decision to increase the salary was announced by transport minister Anil Parab after multiple rounds of meeting with the employee delegation, which included BJP MLAs Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot. However, despite holding that the government has taken a positive step, Padalkar and Khot said they will hold detailed talks with all protesters till late night and then announce any decision that may be taken on the strike on Thursday morning. A hike in the range of Rs 2,500-Rs 5,000 has been announced in the basic component of the salary based on the seniority of employees. Employees who have an experience of less than 10 years and are paid the least will get a hike of Rs 5,000 in their basic component, and their total salary will go up by Rs 7,200 due to the increase in other components. Similarly, a hike of Rs 4,000 will be given to employees who have experience between 10-20 years, and Rs 2,500 has been proposed for employees with over 20 years of experience. “The issue of merger is being handled by a committee appointed based on the Bonmbay high court’s directive. The state will not be able to do anything until the committee submits its report. We did not want the strike to go on till then, and so we decide to address the demand of low salaries by giving a significant hike,” said Parab. He said this will cost the state government an additional Rs 750 crore every year. “We have also given a guarantee that the salaries will be paid not later than the 10th of every month. We now appeal to all the employees to report to work on Thursday,” said Parab. He said suspension of all the employees will be revoked if they report to work, however, strict action will be taken if they fail to report to work. “We are also working out an incentive scheme which will provide additional benefits to the employees who help generate revenue,” said Parab. Unions were not happy with the state government’s decision and are likely to continue the indefinite protest, said union leader Shrirang Barge from the Maharashtra ST Karmachari Congress. “We never demanded for a pay hike, so the question of government announcing hikes in basic pay and asking us to resume duties does not arise,” he said. “We want corporation employees to be deemed as state government employees. This is our only demand and government should refrain from diverting from the issue,” said Shashank Rao of Sangharsh ST Kamgar Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-amid-standoff-govt-announces-salary-hike-for-msrtc-staffers/articleshow/87901550.cms||Bhavika Jain

Known for coming up with innovative solutions when faced with engineering challenges, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is going to use the train depot of one corridor for ‘stabling’ the trains of another with a tunnel connecting the two. DMRC had initially planned to construct a train depot over nearly 77 acres at Rangpuri Pahadi near Vasant Kunj for the trains running on the 23.6-km Tughlaqabad-Aerocity corridor, named Silver Line. However, since the corridor passes through the Ridge in Delhi, DMRC started working on reducing the impact of constructing the new corridor through the city’s green lungs. As the construction of the depot might have required the felling of around 8,000 trees, DMRC dropped the plan to build a depot altogether. The new plan is to extend the Silver Line beyond the terminal station at Tughlaqabad and take it to the Sarita Vihar depot, which caters to the Violet Line. The depot will be the first of its kind to cater to two different corridors with separate requirements in terms of train specifications, DMRC said on Wednesday. The Sarita Vihar depot is being modified and augmented to cater to the requirements of the new Phase IV corridor. DMRC will dig a tunnel to facilitate the movement of trains from the Silver Line’s Tughlaqabad station to the Sarita Vihar depot. A tunnel boring machine will be used to create the 1.5km tunnel, DMRC’s statement said. The train company described the project as extremely challenging because the depot had to remain functional for the Violet Line while developing amenities for the Phase IV project. ‘The work is being carried out in a phased manner to prevent any disruption to the working of the existing depot,’ DMRC said. A new ‘P-Way’ building, which will have tracks and will be used for stabling and maintenance of trains is also being constructed. DMRC said that commissioning of the new signalling system to suit driverless trains will also be undertaken. There will be 14 stabling lines, four inspection bay lines, four workshop lines and one internal heavy cleaning shed coming up to augment the capacity of the Sarita Vihar depot. The Silver Line corridor, a total of 5.2km of which will fall in the Ridge area, received the approval of the Ridge Management Board earlier this year. A total of 1,072 trees will be affected in the construction of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-goes-underground-to-connect-corridor-with-depot/articleshow/87898486.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The AMC-governed Ahmedabad World Heritage Conservation Trust that spearheads the project claimed that artisans, craftsmen and manufacturers who had created unique souvenirs xprovided their artwork for the catalogue. Till now, a handful of voluntary organizations were supplying these souvenirs, but they were without any heritage tag. On Wednesday, mayor Kirit Parmar released the catalogue which can be accessed on AMC’s official website under the section ‘downloads’. Those interested can choose from 70 products and place an order online. “The advantage of an online catalogue is that those visiting the city can directly contact artisans and purchase their works,” said an official. A senior AMC official said, “In Europe and south east Asia, souvenir shops reflect identities of the country and the city. However, the same is missing not just in Ahmedabad but Gujarat too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gets-1st-heritage-web-catalogue/articleshow/87897809.cms||---

The police said that they got several complaints and applications against the institute regarding its activities. “Trustees and other employees of this institute were aware that the girl was sexually assaulted but they didn’t report it to the police or her parents. Instead, they tried to cover up the incident. We will inquire about it,” said a senior crime branch official. The cops will go through the institute’s activities, check its registration papers and gather detailed background of the trustees. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh asked ACP (crime) D S Chauhan to conduct the inquiry after it came to light that images of girl’s diary pages were sent to the trustees after she was allegedly raped. The cops said that the institute is into spiritual activities and the volunteers are given self-help lessons. The 18-year-old girl was found hanging in the coach of a train in Valsad on November 4. During investigations, the cops found her diary wherein she mentioned that she was raped by an auto-driver and his aide in Vaccine Institute Ground in Vadodara. The cops have been looking for the autorickshaw drivers and trying to gather more evidence in the case but they haven’t got any concrete clues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-begin-probe-on-institute-where-the-girl-worked/articleshow/87897257.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The overall AQI was 361 against 290 in the “poor” category on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the city recorded the lowest night temperature of the season at 9.2 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, at Safdarjung. The temperature dipped to 8.7 degrees Celsius at Mungeshpur and 8.8 degrees Celsius at Ayanagar. A layer of smog reduced visibility during morning hours. Local sources of pollution along with meteorological factors, including calm or light wind, low temperature and low mixing layer height, affected the air quality. Experts said the layer of the atmosphere, which comes closer to the surface when temperatures drop, trapped the pollutants. With low temperatures persisting in the region for the past few days, the mixing layer height was low. While low temperature slows down the dispersal of pollutants, calm or light winds cause pollutants to accumulate. The share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was only 2% on Wednesday. Track the pollution level in your cityRK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “The wind blew at a speed of 5-10 kmph in the afternoon, but it became calm in the evening. The wind speed is predicted to remain low for the next two days. The visibility was 800-1,200 metres during morning hours, but it improved to 1,500-3,000 meters during daytime.” Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory, said, “Mixing layer height is 700 metres, not enough for dispersion.” On Wednesday, TOI had reported that though the overall AQI had improved to 290 on Tuesday due to moderate winds, it deteriorated at night and touched the “very poor” category as wind speed dropped to nil. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research said, “Local surface winds are relatively low for the next three days. Air quality is likely to be in the higher end of the very poor category for the next two days. On November 27, local surface winds are likely to increase resulting in improvement in air quality, but expected to stay within the very poor category. The effective fire count is 432. With the onset of winter, local weather is likely to dominate in determining air quality.” According to air quality early warning system for Delhi, the air quality was likely to remain in the “very poor” category for the next five days and PM2.5 would be the prominent pollutant. Gradual improvement in air quality was likely from November 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-dips-to-very-poor-minimum-temp-touches-seasons-low-of-9-2c/articleshow/87898490.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The police identified the accused as Kishore, 37, of Kodunganoor, Santhosh Kumar, 29, of Thirumala and Vinu, 33, of Vettamukku. The police have charged them for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The incident related to the case took place on Tuesday. Two groups of men belonging to RSS and PFI clashed at Thirumala junction. The clash started when the RSS men opposed PFI worker's attempt to raise their party flag at the junction ahead of the inauguration of a mass run they had organised as part of a nation-wide health campaign. The police registered a case against around 50 persons who could be identified on sight following the violence. The three accused, whose arrests were recorded on Wednesday were in fact taken into custody on Tuesday night from their hideout.

---||Kolhapur||Satej Patil & Mahadik trade barbs ahead of MLC polls||Kolhapur: BJP functionary Dhananjay Mahadik on Wednesday alleged that district guardian minister Satej Patil has hidden facts related to his properties in the nomination papers filed for the MLC election. Patil, however, refuted the allegations. On Wednesday, Kolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar said the nomination papers filed by Satej Patil and BJP candidate Amal Mahadik were valid. Dhananjay Mahadik, former MP and Amal Mahadik’s cousin, said he met Rekhawar before the nomination papers were scrutinised. “We provided documentary proof of information hidden by the guardian minister. This, according to the Election Commission rules, invites action. We wanted the collector to term the nomination invalid, but he said he had no jurisdiction over the matter. We will approach court to prove our point.” Patil, however, said the Mahadiks bring up false issues ahead of every election. “The Mahadiks have lost credibility. While they were busy getting papers on me, I was addressing the voters’ concerns. Mahadik’s defeat is a given. That is why they are making allegations.” The allegations and counter allegations show that while the senior leaders from both camps want their candidates to get elected unopposed, the candidates themselves are not in a mood to relent and want to contest the polls irrespective of their seniors’ expectations. A day earlier, BJP state president Chandrakant Patil had said that he will think about it if the MVA leaders approached him with a proposal to get candidates elected unopposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-patil-mahadik-trade-barbs-ahead-of-mlc-polls/articleshow/87896117.cms||---

The urban development department of the state government has given its approval to the proposal of the NMC to donate Rs 25 lakh to the Marathi literary fest. The organisers had sought financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh from the civic body. But considering the drop in the revenue of the civic body through various taxes, the NMC administration had decided to donate Rs 25 lakh for the literary festival. As per norms, the civic body must obtain government permission to donate over Rs 3 lakh. Accordingly, the proposal in this connection was sent to the state. The 94th Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan will be held in Bhujbal Knowledge City in Nashik city between December 3 and 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-govt-approves-proposal-to-donate-rs-25l/articleshow/87896127.cms||Tushar Pawar

The Allahabad high court has, meanwhile, fixed December 10 as the next date of hearing into the students’ petition, seeking transfer of the case from Agra to Mathura. The petition seeking transfer of the case was filed by Mathura-based lawyer Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi raising concerns over the “security” of his clients who were attacked on the court premises, earlier. Chaturvedi — also fighting the case of PhD scholar Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood Ahmad and Mohammad Alam, all booked under UAPA Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) after they were arrested alongside journalist Siddique Kappan on their way to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras, who was allegedly gangraped and killed — is defending the Kashmiri students after lawyers in Agra refused to provide legal assistance to them. The trio, students at Raja Balwant Singh (RBS) Engineering Technical College under the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme for J&K students, was arrested last month. On October 26, they were booked under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 505 (1)(B) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public), and 66-F (cyber terrorism, an offence that could lead to a life sentence) of the Information Technology Act for allegedly sending WhatsApp messages against the country. The next day, the sedition charge was added to the FIR lodged against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sedition-case-kashmiri-students-judicial-remand-extended-till-dec-7/articleshow/87896908.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Why colleges may continue with online classes for now||New Delhi: While colleges and other educational institutions have been allowed to reopen, they are likely to continue holding classes in the online mode for now. Ensuring 50% capacity may be difficult for them, said officials. Yogesh Singh, vice-chancellor of Delhi University, said, “Our concern is with the DDMA guidelines that allow 50% capacity. It is difficult to ensure that, so we are working on something concrete. However, that will take some time. For the final year students' practicals, the project work is already ongoing offline. We will soon have a meeting with the principals and decide for the first-and second-year students as well”. For first-year students, the online classes at DU began on November 22. At Delhi Technological University (DTU), the concern is about providing the students with hostel facilities. An official said, “First-year classes will begin from December 27 in the online mode. If offline classes are to be done in 50% attendance, the issue becomes that many of our students are outstation ones and there aren’t sufficient hostels. We may start with offline practical classes and continue theory classes online.” BR Ambedkar University Delhi will take a decision on reopening in a few days’ time. Anu Lather, vice-chancellor of the university, said, “We will have a consultation with the deans and take a call. Reopening is long-awaited and a welcome step. In between also, we tried to open 50% of the capacity of classrooms.” Some universities are still awaiting a notification from the government regarding the reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-colleges-may-continue-with-online-classes-for-now/articleshow/87898514.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||NKDA starts drive against stubble burning||Kolkata: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has started its campaign against stubble and biomass burning in New Town. Resistance groups are being reintroduced like last year and the authorities have allotted an improvised water tanker with a pump to douse stubble burning fire whenever it is spotted. With the onset of winter, incidents of stubble and biomass burning increase and locals have already started coming across a few such incidents on the vacant land in New Town in the past few weeks. NKDA officials said volunteers are being asked to keep a watch and inform the authorities immediately whenever they spot any biomass burning across New Town. “We are also asking locals to keep a watch and inform us or police whenever stubble burning is noticed,” said an official. Officials said they have improvised a water tanker with a pump and hosepipe that would act as a fire tender to spray water till some distance. Residents are advised to call up the the NKDA’s helpline number (1800-103-7652) mentioned on the tanker for the water tanker to reach the spot. As part of their awareness campaign not to torch stubble and biomass, the NKDA organised a cycle rally on Monday where cyclists carried placards to generate awareness on the issue. On Wednesday, locals spotted some people cutting long grass and weeds from the vacant plot where stubble burning had taken place. Locals said the large vacant area surrounding the Silicon Valley plot and in places of Action Area II and III is where biomass burning has occurred most frequently. Residents said a coordinated approach along with NKDA, police and local NGOs is needed to prevent the recurrence of this nuisance. “Many birds were killed last year due to stubble burning which was rampant during winter. It also creates a lot of air pollution. We cannot let this happen again,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of resident forums in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nkda-starts-drive-against-stubble-burning/articleshow/87897855.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Kejriwal said there was no crisis of funds to provide these facilities and hit out at the opposition for calling the scheme a ‘freebie’. At Advocates Conference organised by AAP legal cell in Civil Lines, the CM highlighted that under the government’s life insurance scheme for lawyers, Rs 12.25 crore rupees have been given to the families of 122 lawyers who lost their lives to Covid. He added that 1,220 lawyers had taken advantage of the medical insurance during the pandemic, for which the government released Rs 7.25 crore. Delhi government approved the scheme in December 2019 and the CM stressed that the scheme will continue as long as Aam Aadmi Party was running the government. “I hope in the near future, more and more states will introduce a similar welfare scheme for lawyers as well,” Kejriwal said. The CM said a lawyer needs to face a long struggle before they become well-off. “Thousands of common and struggling lawyers helping the common man can benefit from these schemes,” Kejriwal said. “The funds for the scheme is coming from the same funds that ministers and officers used to loot earlier. We stopped that loot.” Kejriwal stated that the AAP government would do everything possible for Advocate Protection Act demanded by lawyers. “It comes under the jurisdiction of the central government, but I will try my best,” he said. Law minister Kailash Gahlot said that various governments had made promises to lawyers, but none implemented them. “Till date, anyone that has the support of the lawyer community has not been defeated. Whether it is the fight for freedom or to save the constitution, no one can defeat the lawyers,” said Gahlot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/minister-like-benefits-to-all-people-promises-cm/articleshow/87898504.cms||---

He said that the scheme would be expanded in collaboration with the cooperative sector to help more women. The scheme which involves the disbursement of loans at low rates of interest to rural households was launched as a pilot project in Palakkad in 2018. Kudumbasree district mission and various co-operative banks in the district collaborated with the project. It was later extended to the state widely. During the current financial year, loans worth Rs 535.65 crore were disbursed to neighbourhood groups through co-operative banks. This helped 39,195 families. According to the minister, the Muttathe Mulla project is being carried out by 2,386 neighbourhood groups through 456 CDSs in collaboration with 586 co-operative banks. The project started with the moneylenders’ survey to identify debt-ridden families. While private microfinance institutions charge more than 35% interest, Kudumbasree offers low interest rate loans of Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000 per person for a period of 52 weeks, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kudumbasree-loan-scheme-will-be-strengthened-min/articleshow/87897852.cms||---

The three accused identified as Hasam Mowar, Mukesh alias Lalo Ranva and Imtiyaz Ajmeri, all of whom are residents of Morbi, were arrested from Maliya Miyana taluka with Rs 4.5 lakh cash, an SUV, some US dollars bills and duplicate gold biscuits. During interrogation, the trio said that there are five more members in their gang. They cheat people by luring them into buying duplicate gold and US dollars at cheaper rates. On November 17 too, they had cheated Bipin Parmar, a resident Maliya Miyana, by offering him US dollars at half rates. Police said that the trio had called Parmar to a secluded place with Rs 4.5 lakh cash. They took the cash from Parmar and showed him a wad of US dollars, but soon other members of the gang raided the place posing as cops. Fearing that he might be arrested, Parmar returned the wad of US dollars and did not take back his money before they all dispersed. “We have so far registered one offence based on the complaint given by the victim conned this month. But as the three accused have admitted to having cheated more people, we have appealed to citizens to come forward with complaints against them,” said a police official.

---||Delhi||Govt to launch EV infra guide for corporates||New Delhi: To encourage corporates in the national capital in promoting electric vehicles (EV), the Delhi government is going to launch a step-by-step guide to install workplace charging facilities. Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) and World Resources Institute (WRI), India will launch Workplace Electric Vehicle Charging Guidebook for Corporates in Delhi on November 29, which aims to help employers in their journey of adopting EV charging, DDC stated. The launch will be attended by DDC vice-chairperson Jasmine Shah, WRI India CEO O P Agrawal, and its executive director (integrated transport), Amit Bhatt, among others. Senior industry leaders will discuss the role of corporates in scaling up EV adoption in Delhi and ways to plan, install and manage EV charging at workplaces. Shah said that with the vision of making Delhi the EV capital of India, the Delhi government had taken many pioneering steps to promote adoption of EVs and build charging infrastructure at a mass scale. “Research shows that 90% of EVs are charged at home or workplace. By launching this step-by-step guide, the Delhi government aims to become the first state government to make corporates an integral part of the EV movement,” he added. “Workplace charging will become a necessity in the future and employees will expect charging solutions,” said Bhatt. “It can help reduce the issue of range anxiety as it can provide charging solution to employees who may not have residential charging access. It will help in the greater adoption of EVs and benefit Delhi by contributing to cleaner air,” he added. In August 2020, the government announced Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy, which aims to improve the city’s air quality by driving the transition to electric vehicles, so that they can account for 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-launch-ev-infra-guide-for-corporates/articleshow/87898564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The program was held in the museum auditorium. The awareness session was organised as part of the circular released by the government for ensuring the safety of women in the workplace. Out of the 325 employees, around 150 employees attended the one-hour session which was led by resource person advocate Mini Sukumaran. The awareness session was attended by both men and women employees of the museum and zoo. The session provided information about what is harassment, how to recognize a harassment, which all acts/words come under sexual harassment, how to respond to harassments and legal procedures. The participants were also given a booklet with cariicatures to help them understand the ways of sexual harassment quickly. The employees were also informed that those who underwent any kind of harassment can approach the internal complaints committee set at the museum. The internal committee was formed in the year 2013 after the amendment of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The act provides protection against sexual harassment of women at workplace. The women can approach the committee if any “unwelcoming” incidents occur to them. “We included men and women employees for the session to ensure that the knowledge is spread among both and also to keep them not to get involved in such behaviour,” said Manjula P S, the superintendent of the art museum and art gallery. “The participants have given me good feedback. Following the awareness session, we had an interactive session in which both men and women expressed their concerns and questions about the topic. I am confident that the employees are well-informed on the subject and that they will boldly come forward and take an uncompromising stand against sexual harassment of any kind,” said Mini Sukumaran, the resource person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/awareness-session-on-work-place-harassment/articleshow/87897875.cms||---

NMC officials said a substantial loss is due to the defunct water meters forcing the civic body to provide average bills to such consumers. There are at least 10,000 water consumers, whose meters have been non-functioning for a long time. The civic administration, which is desperately trying to mop up revenue, has now decided to undertake physical verification of all defunct water meters and serve them notices to set them right within 15 days. Then the NMC will start penalising such erring consumers. Around a few years ago, the civic administration had conducted an audit of the water distribution from source to end customer. The survey found 42% of the Non-Revenue Water (NRW), said NMC officials. The NMC is losing Rs 37 crore due to leakage in water distribution due to water theft, defunct water meters and unmetered water connections. NMC has lost revenue of Rs 185 crore in the last five years. “We are already in the process to start spot water meter reading and provide water bills to consumers on the spot. We will immediately serve notice to the consumers, whose water meters are defunct. A 15-day ultimatum will be given to the consumers concerned to repair the defunct water meter,” said NMC officials. NMC is spending around Rs 100 crore on the staff of water supply, pipeline repairs etc. It also includes electricity charges of Rs 55 crore and Rs 15 crore bills paid to the water resource department annually to lift water from three dams.  NMC charges Rs 5 per 1,000 litre of water for residential consumers, while it charges Rs 27 per 1,000 litre for commercial consumers. There are 2.08 lakh water consumers in the city, including 95% residential water connections||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/10000-nashik-city-consumers-have-defunct-water-meters/articleshow/87896173.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Kolkata||ISC server glitch fixed, examiners upload marks||Kolkata: Examiners were asked to upload marks of the ISC candidates of English-1 examination on Wednesday morning by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations. The exam was held on Tuesday but examiners could not upload the marks post evaluation because of a technical glitch that made the Online Marks Capture System unresponsive. The Council finally asked the exam centres to “close” evaluation for the day. On Wednesday, however, the Council sent a circular to school heads saying the problem had been resolved and marks uploading should be completed on Wednesday. Examiners, who are otherwise school teachers, were not sure whether they would have to visit exam centres after Tuesday’s glitch. There was no ISC exam scheduled on Wednesday. The examiners had already gone to their own schools to take classes when their respective principals told them that they would have to rush to their exam centres to complete the uploading of marks that got held up on Tuesday. From The Heritage School eight teachers had to rush to other schools where they were functioning as examiners. Ten examiners rushed in to The Heritage from other schools to complete the uploading of marks. It was the same scene at all CISCE-affiliated schools in the city. South City International saw three teachers leaving in the middle of a teaching session even as two examiners came in. La Martiniere for Boys had six teachers leaving and 10 examiners coming in. The CISCE circular said examiners had to complete the process of uploading and submitting marks by Wednesday. The circular also instructed them that after successfully completing this task, the answer scripts packets should be despatched to the Council’s office. On Monday, the first day of the ISC exam, the evaluation of English literature paper could not be completed by most examiners before 11 pm and so the Council had augmented the number of examiners by allowing invigilators to double up as examiners wherever required. The number of scripts an examiner was supposed to correct was reduced from 35 to 20. Though these measures helped to quicken the process on Tuesday evening, marks could not be submitted till late because of the technical glitch that forced the Council to suspend uploading of marks till further notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isc-server-glitch-fixed-examiners-upload-marks/articleshow/87897896.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The chain snatcher even slashed the girl’s wrist with a blade when she resisted him. The suspect has now been arrested. Avni is being treated for the wound she sustained on her wrist and is recuperating at her home. The injury did not require hospital admission. A police complaint was registered on Tuesday by the child’s father, Raju Pagare — an employee with Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) who was in Mumbai at the time of incident — after he returned home. “My daughter was playing outside our home at 12.30 pm on Saturday. Suddenly, she came back the home screaming. Her hand was bleeding. She was crying and said that a man had stolen her gold pendant,” said Avni’s mother Amruta Pagare, 26, a resident of Rana Pratap Chowk, CIDCO. Shocked, Amruta ran outside the house to see who had harmed the little girl and raised an alarm. According to Amruta, the suspect initially tried to befriend the girl as he asked her about who all were present at home. Then, the man tried to snatch the gold pendant but failed. As the girl resisted and shouted for help, he fled. The pendant was found on the ground outside the house. On Tuesday, the police immediately swung into action and arrested the suspect, a local of that area. “After getting the information about the incident, we started intelligence gathering to track down the suspect.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is working overtime to give citizens oxygen parks, biodiversity parks and ecology parks. While a few of these have already been set up — at Sindhu Bhavan Road, Science City, Bopal, the riverfront and other places, more such green lungs are being planned. Jignesh Patel, director of the AMC parks and gardens department, said, that the Miyawaki method of plantation has been adopted for new oxygen parks and biodiversity parks being set up in the city. “We have been planting only indigenous plants about 1.5 feet from each other. Because of this technique, saplings grow ten times faster than normal plants and absorb 30 times more carbon than normal planting methods,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-lungs-get-denser-with-new-forestry-technique/articleshow/87897893.cms||---
---||Nashik||No compulsive measures to up vax coverage: Nashik collector||Nashik: The Nashik administration has decided against replicating the “Aurangabad model” to improve vaccination coverage. When asked, Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare said he would rather stress on increasing the awareness among the people, instead of using any compulsive measure as of now. “Our situation is far better as far as active Covid ceases, deaths and vaccination are concerned. Though we do not rule out taking harsh measures in future, at present, we are stressing on information, education and communication campaign,” Mandhare said. The authorities in several parts of the state have launched special drives to increase vaccination. They are taking measures like denying foodgrain through the fair price shops or refill of LPG cylinders, petrol from petrol pumps, and other benefits etc to the beneficiaries not taking the vaccination. According to a senior district administration official, such coercive measures could prove detrimental at a time when the Union government has already stated that getting vaccinated is ‘voluntary’ and not compulsory. At this point, by making vaccination compulsory for things that fall in the essential category, there are chances that matter could end up in litigation, which the administration does not want right now. “All those who were keen on getting vaccinated, stood in the queue all-night and got the jabs. They even went to private hospitals and took the jabs by paying from their pockets,” the collector remarked. Currently, a large number of vaccines are available, but people are not coming forth which means they have made up their minds accordingly. “We are, however, taking all the measures to increase the vaccination percentage,” the officer added. It may be noted that district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal had recently stated that strict measures would be taken to increase vaccination coverage in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-compulsive-measures-to-up-vax-coverage-nashik-collector/articleshow/87896195.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The convict Alpesh Thakor and his girlfriend Sumitra Chavada had boarded a Mumbai-bound train from Adaas railway station in Anand. They had planned to alight at Miyagam-Karjan Junction railway station, but as Thakor did not get down the couple had heated arguments and a brawl. In a fit of anger, Thakor pushed Chavada out of the running train when it was passing by railway crossing at Valan. Chavada had suffered serious injuries on her head due to which she was unconscious. An NGO rescued Chavada and admitted her to a hospital in Bharuch from where she was referred to SSG Hospital. Later, with the NGO’s help Chavada lodged a complaint of attempt to murder at GRP police station in Vadodara. Later Thakor was arrested and was tried in Vadodara. During the hearing of the case, additional public prosecutor Smruti Trivedi submitted evidence against Thakor and also examined witnesses and material witnesses supporting the case. The court of additional sessions judge Y A Bhavsar upheld the evidence and testimonies for convicting Thakor. “The major argument was that the man had pushed the woman out of the running train with an intention to kill her despite knowing that she was pregnant with their child. The court considered our argument for giving maximum punishment in an offence of attempt to murder,” Trivedi said. The court also fined Thakor of Rs 25,000 of which Rs 15,000 will be awarded to Chavada as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/10-yrs-in-jail-for-man-who-pushed-girlfriend-out-of-moving-train/articleshow/87897047.cms||---

The police have also advised the group admins to make necessary technical changes so that only they can send messages in the group. “The situation in Malegaon is absolutely peaceful although we are continuing to keep a close vigil. One of our focus areas is to keep constant track of messages that are circulating on various WhatsApp groups in Malegaon to prevent fake and communal messages from spreading,” Nashik rural SP Sachin Patil said. According to him, recently local police booked two members of a WhatsApp group for forwarding communal messages that they had received. “We have requested the admins of all WhatsApp groups in Malegaon to make technical changes so that only admins can forward messages. This will help in curbing the spread of fake and communal messages,” added Patil. According to an estimate, there are over 70-80 WhatsApp groups that are active in Malegaon. Police sources claimed that special teams have been set up to keep an eye on the messages being circulated. “Moreover, we have informers within these groups who inform us if any sensitive messages are in circulation so that local police can take immediate steps,” a police officer said.

In November, the number of fully vaccinated persons has increased by around 3.40%.As per the health department report till November 24, of the 26,32,000 target, 25,55,512 persons (97.09%) in the district have received the first dose and 10,52,716 (41.19%) the second.The percentage of fully vaccinated persons till November 1 was 37.80%. This indicates that from November 1 to November 24, just 3.39% more persons have received the second doses. The number of persons who received the first dose increased by 2.01% this month.Meanwhile, 49.61% of the healthcare workers and 29.94% of the frontline workers have received both the doses. In 18-44-year age group, 36.25% have received both the doses; 46.1% in 45-60-year group; 57.34% in 60-plus age group.District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said the vaccination has slowed down significantly during the last 10 days due to strike by NRHM staff who comprise 70% of the employees and before that festival season hit the drive. “The session sites have also decreased. We are running around one third of session sites. People are turning up for vaccination, but perhaps there is lethargy on the part of some. Seventy per cent to 80% of vaccinations that are being done are of second dose as majority of the eligible persons have already received the first shot,” he added.While the DIO ruled out hesitancy for vaccination on the part of eligible persons, the health department officials said a sizeable number that has received the first dose has not got the second jab long after the necessary gap between the two doses. They added that the department is trying to motivate such persons to come forward for vaccination and they include healthcare and frontline workers too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/only-3-4-received-second-dose-this-month/articleshow/87897018.cms||Shariq Majeed

They said that the stairs made sure the road would be used only by pedestrians and now even vehicles can take the route, blocking the route and choking the Mussoorie Mall Road, where it ends. “These stairs had been constructed several years ago by the Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC), at my behest, with the purpose of preventing vehicles from reaching up to the Mall road using this route,” Hugh Gantzer, a member of the Supreme Court panel constituted to monitor environment issues of Mussoorie and the Doon valley, told TOI. He explained that with the stairs gone now, vehicles would easily take the route to reach the Mall Road and add to the traffic congestion there. "Taking this route would also be a violation of the traffic rules of the town," Gantzer said. Chairman of the Mussoorie Municipal Council, Anuj Gupta, said that the stairs had only been temporarily removed as the road was being repaired. He said that construction workers would need to carry construction material and the stairs would come in the way. “The stairs would be remade once the road repair work is completed,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/removing-stairs-from-shawfield-rd-will-choke-mall-rd-say-residents/articleshow/87897036.cms||Anmol Jain

The law student had sought action against him in her suicide note. On Wednesday, another woman alleged misbehaviour by the police officer. According to the woman who raised the allegation on Wednesday, she was at the police station along with Mofiya. “When she came, I was there. The CI talked to her in a threatening tone. When she returned, she was visibly sad and upset. Had inspector Sudheer taken any legal action to assist her, she wouldn’t have been forced to take this extreme step. His stand towards me was also similar. He had a threatening tone and he addressed me as ‘edi’,” said the woman. The officer seems to be biased as he behaved well with a couple of other women, who looked financially well-off, at the station, she added. The woman refused to reveal the nature of her complaint, citing that she was called for a discussion at the DSP’s office. Meanwhile, opposition parties staged protests outside Aluva police station seeking action against Sudheer, who ironically was at the station where the accused were held, even on Wednesday. Leader of opposition V D Satheeshan said that the officer had CPM connections. The incident was an illustration of the state government’s approach towards women’s security, he alleged. “The officer was protected by CPM leaders even when he was accused of mishandling the Uthra murder case. It is a sad plight that the local MP and MLA have to protest in front of the station to trigger an action against the officer,” he said, adding that harassment of women who go to police stations with complaints has become common in Kerala. Meanwhile, Aluva MLA Anwar Sadat who staged a sit-in in front of the police station throughout the day said that they would not accept anything less than the officer’s suspension. He said that the demand has been informed to Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Ernakulam range DIG. The protest outside Aluva police station had gone out of control. The police and protesting activists clashed and a few activists were arrested and removed from the spot. MP Benny Behanan and MLAs from neighbouring constituencies, Roji M John and Eldhose Kunnappillil had also joined the protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/protests-mount-against-cop-cong-demands-suspension/articleshow/87897951.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The matter is still pending in the court.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had recently asked the officials to update the list. In September, the officials identified 102 more hotels, besides the earlier 109, but no status report was submitted about the nature of violations there and action taken against the violators.

---||Delhi||Circus back in town: After tightrope walk against Covid, life’s flip-flops to deal with||New Delhi: The “Big Top” was not there, neither performing animals. But there was candle balancing, sword play, juggling, unicycling and stick dancing to keep the audience regaled. And, of course, the big nosed clown, who kept the people chuckling. The Rambo Circus was in town on Wednesday, specifically at the India International Trade Fair at Pragati Maidan, playing to a packed amphitheatre. While the show, even if not under the tent but in an amphitheatre, represented a sense of normalcy for the people after the pandemic isolation, it was more than a relief for the circus performers themselves. The months of uncertainty seemed to have ended and it was as if they had finally negotiated the tightrope walk to the other side. Once the veil of Bobo the clown came off, there emerged Prem Mandal, a circus veteran of 15 years. The story he narrated wouldn’t leave you laughing. The Maharashtra resident, who is also the sole breadwinner in a family of four, said, “The past year has been a big struggle. Even though the management supported us right through the Covid lockdown, things were getting increasingly difficult. Our focus was on somehow surviving and getting two meals each day. We hardly received any help from outside the circus.” Prior to the pandemic, the circus troupe toured Maharashtra, performing on the weekends. The coronavirus changed all that. “When the lockdown was first relaxed, we began doing online shows,” disclosed Mandal. The situation has improved, but isn’t stable. Even now we are constantly thinking of how the circus can return to its glory days. What we need is support from the government and the people to be able to continue.” Surjeet Meitei, an acrobat who has also performed at international events, had his own story. “I had wanted to become a gymnast but the need of a regular income made me join the circus in 2009. I was doing okay for my family of nine until the pandemic struck.” The native of Manipur’s Heirok town continued, “Even though we are trying to recover, the audience interest has dipped due to the absence of animals.” Continuing to hope for better days and practising every day kept Babu Das, earlier a trapeze artist and now the “German Wheel” performer, going during the 20-month Covid closure. “My parents and siblings too were with a circus, but the lockdown robbed them of their jobs,” said Das. With the lockdown hitting finances and interest in circuses as entertainment declining, Sujit P. Dilip, owner of Rambo Circus, venturing into online shows was the only way to stay afloat. “We had to keep the tents running to prevent my performers from becoming depressed. We lost huge sums of money as our equipment and lights got damaged by rain in Mumbai,” said Dilip. “In several other circuses, people even lost their jobs. In other countries, there are permanent buildings for circuses, something which I wish he too had in India. We can now only hope that things will improve with time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/circus-back-in-town-after-tightrope-walk-against-covid-lifes-flip-flops-to-deal-with/articleshow/87898677.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata-Bangkok services set to resume after Covid break||KOLKATA: Air India and Thai Airways’ subsidiary airlines Thai Smile are set to resume services between Kolkata and Bangkok, a key international sector for business and tourism. Coming a day after Singapore Airlines announced daily services between Kolkata and Singapore from November 29, it marks the gradual return of international flights to Kolkata airport after a 20-month hiatus. Sources said IndiGo Airlines is also working on a daily flight schedule between Kolkata and the Thai capital. Air India will start its services to Bangkok from December 8, initially operating two times-a-week on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons. Prior to the pandemic, the airline had three day-a-week services between Kolkata and Bangkok. Flyers travelling to Thailand require to be fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to the travel date. On reaching Bangkok, tourists and visitors have to undergo an RT-PCR test and will have to check into one of the listed hotels till the arrival of the report. Thai tourism authorities have assured travel agents that the report will be available within 24 hours, necessitating a day’s hotel stay in Bangkok before being allowed to check into other hotels of choice or travel to other cities and seaside resorts. Thai Smile has also introduced flights between Kolkata and Bangkok from January 1 on the ticket reservation platforms. Sources said the airline would initially operate a three day-a-week late-night schedule, arriving in the city on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and departing post midnight on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. The carrier could thereafter increase the frequency if loads are encouraging. In fact, Thai Airways officials have indicated that it could also return to Kolkata if the loads are good. Sources in the travel trade industry said Thai Airways’ decision to withdraw its services and shut down its Kolkata office followed lack of business during the pandemic. “The airline operated cargo flights from other Indian cities. But there was not much from Kolkata,” a source said. Prior to the pandemic though, there was huge carrier traffic between the two cities with a booming business in apparel. At one time, there were more seats on the sector than there were on many domestic routes with Thai Airways, Thai AirAsia, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Air India, Jet Airways, Bhutan Airlines and Druk Air operating flights on the sector. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi felt the return of international flights would boost passenger confidence and lead to the revival of international travel. Manav Soni, the eastern region chairman of Travel Agents Association of India, also welcomed the developments and said it would send a positive signal to other carriers who are waiting in the wings to resume flights to Kolkata, an under-served market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-bangkok-services-set-to-resume-after-cov-break/articleshow/87897954.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Pune||All eyes on cabinet meet for reopening primary classes in Maharashtra||PUNE: Hours after the paediatric Covid-19 task force on Wednesday made it clear that vaccination is not a prerequisite for reopening of schools for primary classes in the state, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI that she was hoping to get chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s consent on Thursday to start them. Primary classes for standards I to IV in rural areas and stds I to VII in urban areas are not open in the state. Gaikwad said a file has already been moved to the CM’s office 15-20 days ago with inputs from the task force, the health department and the chief secretary. “The CM told me four days ago that he will discuss the matter with me and then take a decision. If the CM attends the cabinet meeting on Thursday, we will speak to him. We have formulated the SoPs. We have recommended the reopening of Stds I to IV in rural areas and Stds I to VII in urban areas. We will incorporate the suggestions from the task force concerning the health and safety of the students that need to be adhered to for the reopening,” Gaikwad said. Health minister Rajesh Tope in a media interaction on Wednesday said that the paediatric task force had recommended physical classes for Stds I to IV amid a decline in Covid-19 cases in the state. “The state health department has no objection as they have suggested resuming classes with social distancing and other norms in place for these classes. However, the final decision will be taken in the cabinet meeting on Thursday,'' he said. The state’s adult Covid task force has said that the vaccination of students can be carried out only after schools reopen. Some sections of the media had reported that primary schools would resume physical classes only after the students complete their vaccination, creating confusion among parents, students and teachers. Activists want the immediate reopening of primary classes to compensate for the learning loss in the last 18 months, especially in rural areas where access to online learning is limited. “We want the Union government to allow vaccination of children so that we can start prioritising them for inoculation immediately. It is the paediatric task force's responsibility to guide the state government,” said Sanjay Oak, head of the state Covid task force. Senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, a member of the paediatric task force, said, “I have received many calls inquiring about primary schools beginning physical classes only after vaccination based on news reports that appeared two days ago. We want primary classes to resume immediately. We have also stated this in our guidelines to the state government time and again.” Covid immunisation of 472 million children under 18 years in India involves logistic issues like a supply of vaccines. “About eight months may be required for immunisation of all children, and their schooling cannot be withheld for such a long period,” Jog said. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson for State Headmasters’ Forum, said that the education department must soon release clear-cut instructions on reopening of primary classes along with the SoPs. “These students have been away from mainstream education for 18 months. Rural schools must reopen to compensate for the learning loss,” Ganpule said. Vidyadhar Shukla, a retired deputy director from the education department, said vaccination drives for eligible children will be effective if schools reopen. “Whenever young children are eligible to be inoculated, the best way to do it and also keep the record up-to-date will be to vaccinate them in schools. Teachers can create awareness among parents,” Shukla said. Tope points at rising cases in Germany, AustriaTope said he has sought vaccination for children between 12-18 years of age on priority and said that he would approach the Centre again for them as well as for booster doses for healthcare and frontline workers. “I met central government officials who are now studying the matter. We have to wait for a go-ahead,” he said. He told the local administration to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed as there was a rise in cases in Germany, Austria and the US. “Even as studies show vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant, it is crucial to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said.

Cryptocurrency prices in the Indian - linked to rupee - market crashed by up to 20% before recovering on Wednesday after exchanges allayed investors' fears. "On Tuesday night, we saw huge selling in the rupee (Rupee-crypto) market on WazirX. We saw a 15-20% crash in prices once investors engaged in panic selling. However, the market is showing recovery and is at a 3-4% discount currently. A similar knee-jerk reaction was seen in January, when the contents of the bill were disclosed," said WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty. "A lot of fear is being seen among Indian crypto investors, especially the ones who entered recently. However, we advise people to pay attention to (Parliament's) winter session and derive conclusions based on it. The ban reports could turn out to be speculative," crypto exchange BuyUcoin's CEO Shivam Thakral said. The price of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was down 10% against the rupee at Rs 40 lakh on Wednesday evening (the crypto market is open 24/7). Cryptocurrency exchange founders on Wednesday assured nervous investors that their digital assets are secure even as they welcomed the proposed bill to regulate virtual currencies. They said the government's announcement is a positive step since a well-defined framework will not just help in structured adoption but will also put a tight check on unregulated crypto markets, a concern for the regulators. "First, we need to understand that there is a lot of speculation around the term 'private cryptocurrencies', which will be put to rest once the fine print of the bill is out," said Gaurav Dahake, CEO & founder of cryptocurrency platform Bitbns. The bill, which reportedly seeks to safeguard small investors by treating cryptocurrency as a financial asset, has major ramifications for the industry that has remained unregulated so far. It is set to be introduced by the government in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. A description of the bill showed that it aims to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies except "certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and uses". On Wednesday, a Bloomberg report said the government may not have a complete ban. The legislation may stipulate a minimum amount for investments in digital currencies, while banning their use as legal tender, the report said. "There's no such definition laid out around public and private crypto. But the context here seems to suggest that public crypto resembles CBDCs (central bank digital currencies, also known as sovereign digital currencies) and private crypto refers to assets like Ripple and Tron," BuyUcoin's Thakral said. Earlier this year, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said the central bank may pilot a digital currency by December. While there is widespread fear about a blanket ban, founders at crypto exchanges that TOI spoke to remained positive about the outcome. "There have been many positive steps taken by the government to learn and understand crypto and its impact on all stakeholders - investors, exchanges, policymakers," said Avinash Shekhar, co-CEO at crypto exchange ZebPay. "So, we're looking forward to a crypto bill that takes into consideration all the inputs from those discussions." Industry experts said cryptocurrencies have already been regulated across leading economies such as the US, the UK, Singapore and Japan. "With India now hosting the largest number of cryptocurrency investors in the world, it is just a matter of time for the government to adopt smart regulations for the sector," said Dahake. Regulation may also lead to earnings from crypto attracting both direct and indirect taxes. "Crypto assets may be taxed according to capital gains rules and may attract GST too," said ProAssetz Exchange CEO Manoj Dalmia.

BJP leader and son of a councillor Deepak Sharma, on Wednesday, raised objection to the ongoing work. He argued with the officials, who had to stop the work in Shivpuri. Deepak claimed that some people have been claiming ownership of the land around the drain while the MC has shown it as government property. He alleged that MC officials, in order to benefit some people, changed the course of the fence and he had brought this matter in the knowledge of mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal. He claimed that it was with great difficulty that demarcation around the drain was done earlier and to keep it free of solid waste, fence work was started. “But now the demarcation has changed. If officials will support the encroachers, then the entire purpose will fail,” he said. The bridges and roads department officials have now sought a report from the building branch and the revenue department. Superintending engineer of bridges and roads branch Harkiran Singh said they were installing the fence according to the action plan given by the authorities, but the BJP leader raised objections, so they have stopped the work. He said work would resume after they get the records.The fence will be installed on 14 kms on both sides of the drain within MC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fence-around-buddha-nullah-bjp-leader-objects-work-stops/articleshow/87897087.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Online fraud probes hit ‘crypto’ wall, cops to seek legal opinion||Kolkata: Probes into a number of phishing and similar online fraud-related complaints have recently run into a dead end, with cops and investigators meeting a hitherto ‘unknown’ wall: cryptocurrency. In at least three cases reported from Bengal, the investigation has stalled because the owners of the investigated accounts claimed that they use the accounts to “trade in cryptocurrency”. In cases of fraud, one of the first steps that banks take, after receiving police alerts, is freeze the suspect accounts. In these three cases — responding to complaints from Kolkata, Siliguri and Arambag — neither the banks nor the police are clear on what to do, in the absence of a regulatory framework, the moment the account-holders mention they use it for cryptocurrency. The cops are saying that while they strongly suspect that cryptocurrency is being used in these cases as a smokescreen, they are finding it difficult to establish such cases as fraudulent transactions. They are mulling seeking legal opinion about how to proceed. While investigators are as yet unwilling to say how many of these complaints are being probed, they did say that anything between Rs 20,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh was lost in these three specific cases. Preliminary investigations into these complaints indicate a complex, multi-layer web of online transactions, police and bank sources told TOI. All of the victims had fallen prey to quick-earning options from home. They had clicked on links, in search engines and social media, to invest in these “easy-earning” schemes, only to realize later that the entire site, and the wallet, were fake. In such cases, the first level of transactions were made through UPI. Since these have a cap on money transactions, the money then went to several bank accounts. Some of these accounts are littered across some north Bengal districts, most others in south Indian states, said an officer. The transactions are then diverted to “master accounts”. The moment investigators are asking the holders of such accounts to explain so many transactions, they are claiming that they use these accounts to trade in cryptocurrency. The investigators said that in many cases, the account-holders are even producing valid cryptocurrency transaction receipts. “All they say is that dealing in cryptocurrency is not illegal in India, so why are their accounts being put under a debit freeze? While talking to them, it became obvious that most of them do not know a thing about cryptocurrency,” said a source. “They have been promised Rs 15,000 in cash to open and maintain such accounts. All they had done was give their Aadhar details and put a signature. Their accounts are under control of certain agents, who in two cases appear based out of bordering states,” he added. It is here that the money trail is getting cold. “The initial leads had come from the home ministry,” said an investigator. “Several accounts have been put under debit freeze. Some state police, including Hyderabad cops and Jharkhand CID, have questioned people who claim they deal in cryptocurrency and have links to some cases in Bengal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-fraud-probes-hit-crypto-wall-cops-to-seek-legal-opinion/articleshow/87897976.cms||Saibal Sen
---||Pune||Covid tests in 9 Maharashtra districts less than WHO norms, says Centre||PUNE: The Union Health ministry has directed nine districts in Maharashtra to scale up the daily average Covid testing that has gone below the WHO norms of 140 tests a day per million population. For the week ending November 22, Akola, Amravati, Buldhana, Dhule, Gondia, Hingoli, Nandurbar, Washim and Yavatmal have been listed as conducting average tests per million below the norms set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Citing the trend as a cause for concern, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday wrote a letter to Maharashtra additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas and told him to ensure scaled-up testing in the state. When contacted, Dr Vyas told TOI that the situation in Maharashtra was under control. “We are vigilant. As many as 14 districts in Maharashtra have a weekly positivity rate (WPR) less than 0.5%. The state’s WPR is 1%. Maharashtra has always been conducting the maximum tests in the country. I have told all districts to ramp up the tests,” he said. Health officials were of the view that though the nine districts did not have adequate facilities. “The districts need to improve the testing facilities and test and track the ‘superspreaders’,” an official said. The Centre in its letter stated that Maharashtra reported 97,502 average tests on a daily basis as of the week ending November 22 — a stark contrast to a high of 2.68 lakh average daily tests in the May 17-23 week. “A decrease in testing will undermine the actual infection spread,” Bhushan said in the letter. Though the Centre has taken note of the decline in new cases on a daily basis to about 10,000, it also observed a decline in weekly testing rates. The letter stated, “In the absence of sustained levels of testing, it is difficult to determine the actual level of infection spread in a geography. A majority of the countries are witnessing multiple surges in Covid cases in recent times. A few developed countries are facing the fourth and fifth waves of the pandemic despite the high levels of vaccination. There is a need for continuous vigil.” Bhushan has directed Maharashtra to maintain high testing given the recent increase in travel due to events such as weddings, festivals and vacations. The Centre has also cited the onset of winter and increased pollution in some states, prevalence of influenza like illness/severe acute respiratory infection and respiratory distress symptoms as a reason for close monitoring with tests and early hotspot identification State health minister Rajesh Tope had earlier told TOI that all districts were directed to scale up testing. A health official said during the week of Diwali festivities, the tests had halved to about 5.5 lakh tests as against 10 lakh tests conducted in the week. “As of now cases are under control. We should be very vigilant to ensure that there is no laxity in testing and followup to ensure that the cases do not increase,” a public health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tests-in-9-maha-dists-less-than-who-norms-centre/articleshow/87897977.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The club will offer a range of private aircraft suited for various requirements, including jet, turbo props, helicopters and air ambulance. The private jets, said luxury consultant Sabeer Ahluwalia, will provide air strips in exotic locations that are usually not covered by regular airlines. “The luxurious aircraft will allow customers to plan their trips as per flexibility, in addition to giving the benefits of privacy and accommodation to unwind or hold an important meeting,” he explained. “Given the post-pandemic scenario, people with remunerative income are preferring to fly on private jets as it is a safe, convenient and secure way to fly as only you and your associates are on board, avoiding large crowd, long delays and queues at commercial flights. We will provide the next level of luxury and convenience to plan one’s air trips," said Neil Shaw, former director of the aviation wing of a city-based firm. While leisure travel is essentially the driver for the increase in private jets, rise in corporate, personal urgency or election-related flying are playing significant roles to boost the sector. Sales of luxury goods are soaring in the eastern region, indicating a booming luxury appetite in Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Patna along with some cities in the Northeast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/private-jet-club-brings-the-option-of-luxury-flying/articleshow/87897963.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctors worried over late-Nov dengue cases, pin hopes on mercury to slide below 15°C||KOLKATA: Dengue and malaria continue to sting Kolkata and the suburbs even at the fag end of November with hospitals still receiving a good number of patients with the vector-borne diseases. Health experts said cases will continue till the mercury settles down to around 15°C and below. Health officials said vector-control measures are being conducted by local civic bodies. “The number of patients admitted for dengue and malaria treatment in our hospital is higher than what was in early-November. Right now, we have 13 such patients, including a one-year-old child. We had only about five-six patients at the beginning of November,” said Subhashis Datta, chief general manager (operations) at Ruby Hospitals. While some hospitals have more dengue patients, others have a higher malaria patient count. TOI had on November 7 reported on how the dengue patient count was fast catching up with the Covid-19 patient count in many city hospitals. “We have seen a sharp increase in the number of malaria patients recently. Ten days ago, we had just two patients admitted with malaria but the figure went up to eight for the last three days. Currently, there are five patients admitted. In the same period, the number of dengue patients have fallen from 14 to 10. There has been a dip in the number of Covid patients too, from 18 to 13,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital. “Water accumulation from untimely rain/prolonged monsoon must have provided good breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Once the temperature slides below 15°C, we should get a respite from these vector-borne diseases,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray. Apart from Kolkata, city hospitals are also getting patients from neighbouring South and North 24 Parganas. Several localities under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation and South Dum Dum Municipality areas like Lake Town, Bangur Avenue and Baguiati have reported numerous cases over the last fortnight. “Last year, the number of dengue and malaria cases was low. We are getting a higher number of cases this year. We now have six dengue and one malaria patient. Now that the monsoon is over and winter is about to set in, the number of patients affected by vector-borne diseases should go down,” said Sudipta Mitra, CEO of Peerless Hospital. Even as civic bodies have activated vector-control measures, health experts said we should take protective measures on a personal level. “With mosquito-borne diseases on the rise, we should use guard against mosquito bites by using mosquito nets, repellents and wearing clothes that cover our arms and legs,” Basu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-worried-over-late-nov-dengue-cases-pin-hopes-on-mercury-to-slide-below-15c/articleshow/87897972.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Even though they continued treatment, finally he was declared brain dead.” The doctors at Synergy Hospital explained the importance of organ donation to the family and they were convinced. Bhavna Mandli, a social worker working for organ donation cause, said “We did not have to take much pains to convince the family as they were aware about the importance of organ donation. Deepak’s mother Jyotiben was kind and mentally strong but they all broke down after taking the decision.” Deepak’s father Kishorbhai told reporters, “The meaning of Deepak is light and he will enlighten lives of others, true to his name. We believe that our son is alive in the bodies of people.” His eyes were donated to Rajkot’s eye bank, kidneys were sent to Institute of Kidney Diseases & Research (IKDRC) while the heart and liver were sent to private hospitals in Ahmedabad.

This is one of the reasons that have prevented a further dip in the number of Covid admissions, say hospital authorities. An acute bed scarcity during the second wave in April-May had forced many hospitals to refuse even severe patients and arrange for home supervision for them. Peerless Hospital, which now has 31 Covid patients, has seen the number hovering between 25 and 35 since mid-October. The authorities said that it could have dropped below 15 had they refused the mild patients. “Till late-October, we had been preferring the severe patients over those with moderate symptoms since we wanted to keep beds available for the former, expecting a spurt in numbers. Fortunately, it didn’t happen and now we have stopped refusing Covid positives with mild symptoms in case they insist on getting admitted, or if there is a reason to suspect that the condition of the patient may deteriorate,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Belle Vue Clinic, too, has been giving mildly symptomatic patients an option between getting treated at home, at the outpatient department (OPD) and admission. “There is a psychological aspect of Covid and it leaves many, especially the elderly and their families, very scared. So, some don’t want to take chances and prefer hospitalization. We are taking them in since there is no bed scarcity now. The rest with mild symptoms prefer home treatment and we offer supervision,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. The hospital now has 38 Covid beds, including 20 critical care ones, out of which 17 are now occupied. “We are not going to scale down the number of beds now,” added Tondon. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has been advising mild Covid patients to get admitted in case they don’t have proper isolation facilities at home. “Till the post-second wave period, an acute bed crisis had often led us to advise such patients to stay at home. Even now, there is a section of patients who prefer to stay at home with mild symptoms. If the consultant is convinced about a proper isolation facility at their homes for necessary homecare, they are advised the stay at home. Else, they are asked to get admitted at the hospital as lack of proper isolation at home may result in wider spread of the virus,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. RTIICS has 22 Covid patients, including seven in critical care. AMRI Hospitals have been admitting patients with moderate symptoms and comorbidities, many of whom would be refused till October. “In case a patient has even a mild respiratory complaint, we are advising admission. Those with comorbidities like a cardiac ailment, diabetes, or a history of lung diseases, too, are being taken in. A majority of those seeking admission, however, have a severe disease, though their number has dropped sharply,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. AMRI has around 45-50 Covid patients across its three units. Woodlands Hospital has been asking those with mild Covid symptoms to stay at home. “We offer home care services to them. For patients who are advised monoclonal antibody therapy, visit the hospital, get the infusion and leave within two-and-a-half hours, only when someone does not have necessary isolation facilities at home, we are admitting them,” said Rupali Basu, managing director & CEO, Woodlands Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hospitals-start-admitting-cov-patients-with-mild-symptoms/articleshow/87897982.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

According to police, the woman had met the accused on a social media platform about three months ago. On Tuesday, the accused, along with his driver, had come to Mathura to pick up the woman from her hometown. He told her he will take her to the exam centre and drop her back home. The woman alleged that the man got her to sniff a drug a few moments after she sat in his car. Following this, she lost consciousness. When she regained her senses, she said she found herself at a spot on the Delhi-Agra national highway (NH-2) near Kosikala. Somehow, she managed to reach home. Subsequently, she narrated her ordeal to her family. Superintendent of police (rural), Shirish Chandra, said that an FIR has been registered against the man under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code on the basis of a complaint made by the survivor’s family members at the Kosikala police station and the woman was sent for medical examination. He added that the woman is not aware of the accused’s exact address. Police have launched an investigation into the case. The woman’s statement will be recorded before the magistrate under section 164 of CrPC on Thursday when she is in a state to narrate the incident, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/social-media-friend-rapes-woman-21-in-moving-car-on-delhi-agra-nh-probe-on/articleshow/87897118.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

However, the court didn’t issue any order in the case as the Union aviation secretary -- who was to appear in the court in the matter -- could not make it due to a cabinet meeting. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik has now summoned him through video conferencing on December 8. The PIL has been filed by Pantnagar resident Keshav Kumar Pasi who alleges that the proposed airport, which will serve the Kumaon region, is to be built in the middle of GB Pant University of Agriculture & Technology, also referred to as Pantnagar University. By definition, a greenfield airport is an aviation facility that is set up on unused land but the petitioner in this case has highlighted that the university land earmarked for the proposed airport has human settlements. He adds that if the airport is set up on the identified land, the people living there would have to move at least 14 kilometres away from the location. The petitioner has thus proposed that instead of having the airport in the university area, it can be built in about several acres of barren land lying vacant in the foothills of Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-against-new-greenfield-airport-on-pantnagar-university-land-secy-aviation-skips-hearing-for-cabinet-meeting-case-next-to-be-heard-on-dec-8/articleshow/87897140.cms||---

The 46-acre campus also includes R&D plots for the testing and development of new machines. The company has invested about Rs 75 crore in setting up the facility so far which will have a capacity to manufacture around 75,000 pieces of inter-cultivators per year. In the future, the investment may go up to Rs 100 crore, KisanKraft CEO Ankit Chitalia said. The plant has already hired around 175 people and the number is slated to go up to 500 people over the next few years, he added. Inter-cultivators are multi-utility equipment for weeding, soil turning, soil mulching, and have attachments for trenching, seeding, irrigating, harvesting. These items are primarily being imported from China currently and KisanKraft aims to manufacture significantly higher quality products to supply them at affordable prices to the farmers, the company said. “Over the last 15 years, KisanKraft has been focused on mechanization of the small farmer to help them increase their productivity and income. We have continuously innovated to create equipment that is suited for the unique requirements of our small farmers. We have received 12 patents so far. At our Nellore facility, we have started making BIS-ISI-certified engines, water pumps, and intercultivators,” KisanKraft managing director Ravindra Agrawal said. “We make a lot of components ourselves in this facility which includes a ROHC compliant, ZLD, automated powder coating line, designed using the latest technologies. We will not only reduce imports but also increase exports of farm equipment,” Agrawal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kisankraft-sets-up-46-acre-factory-campus-in-ap/articleshow/87898003.cms||---

It was later transported safely to Etawah Safari for treatment with the help of Wildlife SOS. According to the NGO officials, the sight of a leopard lying in a sugarcane field spread panic amongst residents of a village in Parikshitgarh on Tuesday. While examining the feline, the forest department officials found several critical injuries on its body and it was also unable to move its hind limbs. The leopard was sedated by Dr RK Singh from Kanpur Zoo and shifted to the forest division headquarters for medical examination. Based on the leopard’s injuries, it was suspected that the animal was a victim of human-wildlife conflict. Chief conservator of forests (Meerut), NK Janoo decided to transfer the leopard to Etawah Safari for further treatment and care. Wildlife SOS, a wildlife conservation NGO, assisted the forest department in transferring the leopard from Meerut to Etawah Safari in a specialized Mobile Veterinary Unit. Janoo said, “We are glad that the leopard is safe and under treatment at Etawah. We have worked with the Wildlife SOS many times in the past to conduct rescue operations and mitigate human-wildlife conflict situations.” Veterinary doctor at Kanpur Zoological Park Dr RK Singh said, “The leopard is a male, estimated to be 8-years-old. It has sustained injuries in the neck, ear and shoulder and is unable to move the hind limbs. An in-depth examination is yet to be conducted to determine the extent of injuries.” DFO Meerut, Rakesh Kumar said, “We suspect that the leopard is a victim of human-wildlife conflict.” CEO of Wildlife SOS, Kartick Satyanarayan said that their mobile veterinary unit is equipped to transport wild animals that need medical aid and monitoring during the journey. During the Covid lockdown last year, Wildlife SOS assisted the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department in rescuing and relocating a leopard that had entered Govardhan city. They also rescued a leopard that had fallen into an open well in Amroha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/injured-leopard-rescued-in-meerut-shifted-to-etawah-safari-for-treatment/articleshow/87897123.cms||---
---||Agra||Over 300 medicines and surgical items 'unavailable at PM Jan Aushadhi stores'||Agra: The Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi medical stores at government hospitals in Agra district are purportedly facing a huge shortage of medicines and surgical items, and patients are being forced to purchase them from private medical stores at a "higher price". According to the health department records, 600 types of medicines and 145 types of surgical items are offered at the four PM Jan Aushadhi medical stores in the district. However, on Wednesday, only 300 medicines were available, and "surgical items were out of stock at all the centres", officials said. Skin, neurology, ENT, antibiotics drugs and syrups for children which are usually in high demand remained off the shelves. The PM Jan Aushadhi scheme was launched in 2015. It is a campaign by the department of pharmaceuticals to provide quality medicines at affordable prices to the masses. Jan Aushadhi stores have been set up to provide generic drugs, which are available at lesser prices but are equivalent in quality and efficacy as expensive branded drugs. The four Jan Aushadhi stores in Agra are located at district hospital, Lady Lyall (district women hospital), Sarojini Naidu Medical College and Institute of Mental Health. As per the official estimate, over 1,500 patients visit these health centres a day. A senior doctor of district hospital, who wished not to be named, said, “Jan Aushadhi stores are aimed to bring down the healthcare budget of common people by providing quality generic medicines at affordable prices. The cost of medicines and surgical items at the centre are provided to the patients at a cost of up to 90% less as compared to the market prices. However, lack of required medicines and surgical items remain a major issue at the centre and patients often complain that they have to make purchases from private stores.” An auto-rickshaw driver who is a resident of Namner locality, Mukesh Kumar, 38, said, “I am suffering from an allergy in my throat and nose. A doctor at the district hospital recommended three medicines none of which were available at the Jan Aushadhi store. I was asked to come after 2-3 days.” Unable to get medicines prescribed by the doctor at Lady Lyall hospital, Jagdishpura locality resident, Munni Devi said, “I am suffering with painful rashes for the past one month. A doctor had suggested two medicines and an ointment. I have been asked to come after two days as the stock is not available. Earlier, too, I was not able to get them here.” Another local resident who lives in Wazirpura, Mohammad Shafiq said, “I've nerve pain near my left ear. A doctor at SN Medical has recommended two medicines. Both of them are not available here. They are offering pain relief ointment which I don't want.” When contacted, district in-charge of the Jan Aushadhi stores, Ravindra Singh said, “The issue of the medicines and surgical items not available at the stores has been sent to the state government. There is a high demand due to the spread of vector-borne diseases and changing weather conditions which has resulted in the shortage of medicines and surgical items. We are expecting the required stock to be available by the end of this week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-300-medicines-and-surgical-items-unavailable-at-pm-jan-aushadhi-stores/articleshow/87897134.cms||---
---||Pune||With immunized relatives, destination weddings make a sparkly comeback||PUNE: Destination weddings are back in vogue, with largescale Covid vaccination making planners and families more open to the idea. “We wanted to have a destination wedding, but not at any of the popular cities like Goa or Udaipur. After much contemplation, we decided to have the wedding at Mirrik in West Bengal, where my husband and I first met. Though there is a lot of travel involved, we have kept our guest list short with only family and close friends,” Shreya Ojha said, adding that the guests have received their first and second doses of the vaccine. While some couples are playing it safe, keeping the possibility of a third wave at the back of their minds, and arranging their celebrations at domestic venues, others are travelling abroad. Business owner Rackesh Verma said the initial plan was to visit Maldives for the honeymoon, but when the pandemic hit, everything changed. “We kept cutting down the number of guests according to the Covid regulations, and decided to postponed the wedding. This gave us time to rethink and re-plan with our wedding planner. We decided to have the wedding itself in Maldives in January 2022 with a guest list of 30 fully vaccinated close friends and family.” Wedding planner Namrata Gandhi said, “Mexico is becoming a hot destination for Indian weddings abroad, Switzerland is a close second. It is an on-going trend that many favourite honeymoon destinations are now becoming popular choices for wedding venues.” Many people are exploring new venues to host their weddings, apart from hotels, marriage halls and lawns. “A few of my clients who could not get their wedding rescheduled on the desired date this year at the same venue they had booked last year, are exploring other options such as farm houses and picnic spots and so on around Pune to have an intimate ceremony,” said Akash Bhagat, event manager. Cutting down on the guest list not only allows for offbeat ceremonies, but also increases one’s budget that can be spent on other aspects. City-based DJ Garry Kumtekar said, “I am almost entirely booked from December to February for weddings out of the state. A good change from the last year is that people are somehow not negotiating fees and are ready to pay 100% of pre-Covid rates. They are going all out on expenses”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-immunized-relatives-destination-weddings-make-a-sparkly-comeback/articleshow/87897997.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Traffic cops suspend licence for up to three months for dangerous driving||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Traffic Police has started suspending temporarily the driving licence of motorists and bikers who will be prosecuted for dangerous driving under Section 184. The decision to suspend the licence will be taken by the ACPs of the traffic guards. The suspension can continue up to a maximum of three months. A decision in this regard has been communicated by Lalbazar to all the 25 guards. The move came after the city witnessed 11 accidents between 11.30pm on Monday and 6am on Wednesday, which left two persons dead and 17 others seriously injured. On Wednesday morning, cops had already a list of 184 cases that were all prosecuted on a single day. The Sealdah and East Traffic guards reported 21 cases each. The decision to suspend the licence was taken a week ago by the senior officers at Lalbazar. With the spate of accidents keeping cops on their toes, they decided to implement it from Wednesday. Cops have blamed speeding, dangerous and drink-driving for the accidents that took place in the wee hours of Wednesday morning. A private bus hit a cyclist, Biplab Roy (42), on Dum Dum Road around 4.58am on Wednesday. He was declared dead at RG Kar Hospital. The second accident was reported from the crossing of Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road around 3.15am on Wednesday when two trucks collided with each other. Two persons, Nagendra Nath Halder and Ashit Halder, were injured and hospitalised. In the third accident, a biker, Anuj Shaw, lost his life after his two-wheeler hit a street light post on Ballygunge Circular Road around 12.40am. He succumbed to his injuries at a private hospital. The fourth accident happened on AJC Bose Road when a biker, Rashan Kumar Jha, sustained serious head injuries after his two-wheeler rammed into a tree. The accident happened around 11.36pm on Tuesday. “Speeding, drink-driving and reckless driving are the reasons behind accidents in the city. We hope that the transport department will agree to our proposal to link the renewal of fitness certificates with the clearing of fines for public vehicles,” said Arijit Sinha, DC (Traffic). Total 3,299 motorists were prosecuted — the highest around Dalhousie- Dharmatala belt with headquarter traffic guards booking 266 vehicles and the south guard 282 vehicles. Jorabagan, east, southeast and Bhowanipore traffic guards also saw a large number of prosecutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-cops-suspend-licence-for-up-to-three-months-for-dangerous-driving/articleshow/87898001.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Andhra Pradesh water resources department secretary J Syamala Rao, in the affidavit filed in National Green Tribunal, said that there was no prior environmental clearance (EC) for the project. Also, there was no water allocation for the project, he added. “Telangana is unauthorisedly constructing Dindi lift irrigation scheme without obtaining prior environmental clearance as mandated by the Environmental Impact Assessment notification of 2006,” the affidavit added. Andhra Pradesh said Telangana was constructing a common pump house for Palamuru-Rangareddy and Dindi at Yelluru village, proposing to lift two TMC (thousand million cubic) feet per day for 60 days and utilise 1.5 thousand million cubic for Palumuru-Rangareddy lift irrigation scheme and 05 thousand million cubic for Dindi lift irrigation scheme by diverting water from Anjanagiri reservoir. “Dindi lift irrigation scheme though undertaken as an independent project, some of its components are common for both the projects. The age-old irrigation systems of Andhra Pradesh are being affected besides depriving drinking water needs due to the unauthorised construction of Dindi lift irrigation scheme. The need in any area of the state is not the sole basis to undertake a project when there is no allocation and entitlement for a riparian state to utilise the proposed water from an interstate river,” alleged the Andhra Pradesh water resources department. “Without any allocation for the project, it has a catastrophic impact on the age-old irrigation systems KDS, KC Canal, Nagarjunsagar, SRBC and Chennai drinking water supply and other drinking water requirements,” Andhra Pradesh water resources department secretary J Syamala Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-prior-green-nod-for-tdindi-plan-ap-tells-ngt/articleshow/87897994.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Godhra police has started an investigation to ascertain what was transpiring in the house. The controversy began around two to three months back when word spread regarding a man from the town converting to a minority. Members of the majority community to which the man belonged objected to this, but he assured them that he had not converted. But community members were keeping an eye on his house. On Tuesday night, a woman activist Divya Luhana, residing in the same area where the man lived, saw some activity inside the house. Luhana said that those present at the house were keeping their hand on the forehead of the family members of the man. “An entire group had come to the house for the activity,” said Luhana. Luhana raised an alarm and tried to enter the house, but she said that the doors were locked from inside. A crowd gathered at the place and the police was also informed. The police rushed the spot and dispersed the mob. Deputy superintendent of police Himala Joshi said that Thursday was the birthday of the daughter of the man who is accused of conversion. The man has claimed that the group from Nadiad was at his residence to celebrate the birthday. Joshi said that the police brought the man’s family as well as those who had come from Nadiad to the police station. “This was needed to ensure that the group was brought to a safe place. We recorded the statements of the man and others and let them go. The process of recording the statements of some others is still on,” Joshi said. She added that Luhana’s application had been taken and was being probed. No offence was registered till Wednesday evening. Luhana claimed that some time back, the brother-in-law of the man had also converted to christianity. “He had openly said so. Man of our community members have converted in Ulhasnagar in Mumbai too. We want to stop this,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/alleged-conversion-bid-sparks-row-in-godhra/articleshow/87897129.cms||---

While officials at other zones said that some Asha workers did report to work, the Unions claimed none of their members joined duties on Wednesday.NMC officials said the Asha workers were engaged in door-to-door survey, informing people about measures taken by the administration, preparing list of unvaccinated people and explaining benefits of vaccination.The officials claimed that an additional 1,000 doses were given on Wednesday. “The only issue arising from the protest is our health teams may not have the time to convince unvaccinated people,” they said. The health teams comprise a nurse who administers the jab. The nurses were joined by staff from malaria department. The Asha workers were promised Rs200 as mobility allowance. Rajendra Sathe, CITU district president, said the NMC’s mobilization work has come to an end. “Hence vaccination won’t be affected but Asha workers have stopped doing all Covid duties. The NMC has refused to pay the allowance as promised,” he saidShyam Kale, general secretary of Maharashtra AITUC, said they were assured of an additional Rs1,000 per month for Covid work. “The state government has stopped the money.

The state counsel claimed that the only possibility was that apart from the two accused firing from guns allegedly snatched from cops, the other two were also facing policemen during exchange of fire and hence got shot in the front. Elaborating on their deaths, the state counsel said the two accused could have shot the other two unarmed men as well as themselves accidentally, shot themselves or shot dead in firing by cops. As per the postmortem examination reports, there were 10 ante-mortem bullet injuries on the bodies of the four accused, but it was not possible to ascertain the type of firearm that caused the injuries, the state counsel said. Explaining the ballistics report, the state counsel said 26 rounds were fired by police at Chattanpally on December 6. Of these, 10 were fired in air by SI Lal Madhar from the AK-47 and 16 were fired in the direction of sound of shooting. As no bullets were recovered from the four bodies, the commission sought to know the distance needed for the bullet to pass through the body. But it was brought to the notice of the commission that in the evidence on record there was no detail pertaining to 9 mm pistols. Subsequently, the commission pointed from the ballistics reports that traces of copper were detected on the edges of the holes on shirts of the accused, which could have been caused only by high-velocity copper-jacketed bullets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/how-did-bullets-hit-2unarmed-men-in-front/articleshow/87898010.cms||Mahesh Buddi

She is the wife of KK Ragesh who is the private secretary of the chief minister Addressing the media, Ravindran–who was reappointed as the vice-chancellor for four more years on Tuesday – said there was lack of clarity on the period – which Priya Varghese conducted research for her PhD under the Faculty Development Programme (FDP) – could be counted as duty or leave. “When there is a lack of clarity, we give the benefit of doubt to the candidate. The issue – whether the period under FDP will be counted as duty or considered as leave – is not an academic one but a technical matter. However, we will take a final decision only after examining the matter,” he said. The varsity has prepared a rank list after interviewing six shortlisted candidates, including Priya Varghese. The Save University Campaign Committee had alleged that Varghese lacked the minimum eligibility for the post of associate professor that requires a research degree with eight years’ experience at the assistant professor level. The committee claimed that Varghese joined as an assistant professor in Sri Kerala Varma College in 2012 and while working there she had availed three years’ leave under FDP programme for completing her PhD. The committee cited Clause 3.9 of UGC Regulations 2018 to claim that the time taken by candidates to acquire MPhil/PhD degree shall not be considered as teaching/research experience for appointment to teaching position. When asked why the university didn’t try to bring clarity on the issue before holding the interview for the post, he said that it would have led to delays in the interview process. Meanwhile KPCC chief, K Sudhakaran slammed the reappointment of Ravindran as vice-chancellor saying that it has been made in violation of the University Act which has fixed 60 years as maximum age for appointment as vice-chancellor. Ravindran’s age is 61. Sudhakaran said that the reappointment was a ‘reward for showing the courage to place the wife of a CPM leader as topper in the selection rank list’ when there were many others who surpassed her qualifications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kannur-university-will-examine-eligibility-of-priya-varghese-vc/articleshow/87898019.cms||---

The department has received complaints from parents and education activists across Maharashtra regarding some college managements holding back students’ results after they failed to pay the amount of scholarship as demanded by the colleges. The scholarships are awarded to socially backward students by the social welfare department. A student from Pune, who has filed a complaint with the social welfare department on condition of anonymity, told TOI, “I was not given my mid-term result after I refused to pay the demanded scholarship amount. I have taken all the efforts to file the forms and take benefit of the scheme because I am a legitimate beneficiary. The college has told many beneficiaries to pay the amount to the college in cash. I have not paid after repeated reminders now the college has restricted access to my result.” Many students from Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Ratnagiri and some other districts have complained to their respective social welfare department offices regarding the demands made by the college in various ways. The complainants have stated that some colleges decided to hold the documents like leaving or transfer certificates of those students who refused to refund the scholarship amount. Many students stated in their complaints that some colleges also granted admission to the beneficiary students and told them to pay up the fee first and later apply for the scholarship and refund the received amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stern-warning-to-colleges-about-scholarship-plaints/articleshow/87898012.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot seeks Rs 4 lakh relief from Centre for kin of Covid victims||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding the Centre to implement its commitment to disburse ex gratia payment of Rs 4 lakh for kin of deceased due to Covid. Gehlot said on September 11, the Centre had submitted a detailed affidavit in the Supreme Court that it would pay Rs 50,000 as ex gratia to the families of those affected by Covid-19 through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Under the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the compensation amount is shared by the Centre and state in 75:25 percentage, respectively. He said the modest amount of Rs 50,000 as ex gratia compensation is insufficient. The Centre in the Supreme Court had argued that giving Rs 4 lakh compensation would leave the state with insufficient funds to deal with Covid. He said, “As a welfare state, it is the shared responsibility to look after our citizens during times of need. Our state has started many welfare schemes to help people tide through these difficult times. We expect that the Centre will also share this responsibility.” He said, “The Covid-19 has badly affected the majority of the population of our country. People have died untimely deaths and have been forced to migrate and businesses have shut down. Families have lost their earning members and the out-of-pocket expenses incurred for treatment in private hospitals during the pandemic have robbed them of their live-long earnings and pushed them into huge debts.” Hence, he said, the Centre should implement its earlier order notified on March 14, 2020 issued by the ministry of home affairs, where the Centre made a commitment to disburse ex gratia payment of Rs 4 lakh for the deceased person due to Covid. The Centre later revised this notification and reduced the ex gratia payment to Rs 50,000. He pointed out that as per the SDRF norms, 75% of Rs 4 lakh, which is Rs 3 lakh to be paid by the Centre and remaining 25 %, which is Rs 1 lakh, to be paid by the state Government and commit to pay the state share. “I look forward to your co-operation in this matter, so that we can stand beside our citizens in these times of distress, alleviate their sufferings, provide them support and help them live with dignity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-seeks-rs-4l-relief-from-centre-for-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/87898675.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Metro tokens back from today, sanitised for safety||KOLKATA: Manual washing of smart tokens will be discontinued as Metro Railway brings back old ticketing system from Thursday. Instead, the plastic discs are going to be sanitized in the smartest and safest way for reuse. Metro Railway will be adding 75,000 new tokens from Thursday to its existing stock of 1.3 lakh tokens. Before the lockdown on March 24, 2020, the handheld tokens used be washed with water, disinfectants and detergents after use. So, the “smart” tokens, which have chips installed inside, were damaged. Besides, the cumbersome exercise wasn't foolproof in killing the virus. This time, Metro Railway has bought 40 hi-tech ultraviolet sterilizers. The dry method is fast and most effective in killing the germs. It also does not affect the tokens, officials said. The carrier on Monday announced the reintroduction of tokens after 21 months. Even as Metro had resumed services twice during the pandemic — first from September last year after a six-month hiatus and again after a two-month suspension because of the second wave — only smartcard holders were allowed to board the trains. In March, this year, Metro Railway had decided to bring back the tokens, but the second wave forced the authorities to defer the plan. The contactless smartcard continued to be the sole ticketing system. But a section of commuters kept on asking for the single journey tokens that could be procured for Rs 5 for the shortest 2km distance. Reluctant to lock their money in smartcards, which cost Rs 120, with Rs 80 kept as security deposit, many commuters returned smartcards at the end of the day. That is why, Metro Railway will be issuing tokens from Thursday for both North-South and East-West corridors. The utility has sanitizer machines that can sterilize more than 300 tokens in four minutes, so they are returned to the cash counters for immediate re-use. Big stations have two such devices while smaller ones have one each. “The UV machines have undergone successful trials. We feel much more confident to reintroduce tokens that have been in demand now,” said Metro DGM Protyush Ghosh. Around 6.2 lakh people availed of the North-South Metro beforethe pandemic. Of them, 50% were smartcard holders. Currently, Metro clocks less than 3.5 lakh daily footfall. Now that the tokers are being brought back, the number of commuters is likely to go up and Metro may add more trips. The carrier is now 16 short of its pre pandemic 288 services. The authorities will go on stressing on the multiple journey smartcard as the most user-friendly means of ticketing. “It is safe and easily rechargeable. One does not need to stand in queues to buy a smartcard,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-tokens-back-from-today-sanitised-for-safety/articleshow/87898016.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The panel has also recommended that online classes should be started immediately in the schools along with offline ones. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) chairperson, Sangeeta Beniwal has expressed concern about the increasing cases of Covid among children in schools. “After the second wave of covid, schools have started operating again and recently cases of children being corona positive are coming to the fore. We have taken cognisance of the Covid cases in Jayshree Periwal International School. The complete report has been asked of the same to the district education officer (headquarters) secondary, Jaipur.” Beniwal also said that there is a need to start online classes keeping in view the increasing number of cases of Covid in schools. In this regard, a recommendation has been made by the child panel to the education department to start online classes without delay along with offline classes in schools so that the increasing cases of Covid in children can be curbed. Recently in anticipation of the third wave of covid, the child commission along with Bachpan Bachao Andolan had given Covid aid kit to all the children shelters in the state. The kit contains 13 essentials like sanitisers, masks, oximeters, thermometers etc. Officials claimed that while similar kits had been distributed previously at some locations, now they were given to each shelter in order to curb the third wave of covid which might affect the children. A total of 170 kits have been distributed to the child care institutions in the state.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Post-bypoll win, BJP tries out caste math for 2023||HYDERABAD: As a result of its success in Huzurabad, BJP has started working out caste equations for the 2023 assembly elections. The saffron party is likely to bank upon Munnuru Kapu, Mudiraj, Reddy and ST communities.  BJP believes since these castes account for around half of the vote-bank in the state, it will be in a good position to walk away with a win and upstage the ruling TRS. Ever since it broke ties with the TDP and decided to go it alone in the 2018 assembly elections, the saffron party has been steadily improving its election record in Telangana, including scoring emphatic wins in the recent by-elections. Following the super success in the parliamentary elections where it bagged four Lok Sabha seats, the party concentrated on attracting leaders from other parties but not on the caste equations. As per party sources, the BJP’s main goal is to target BC communities with emphasis on Munnuru Kapu community. BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar and Nizamabad MP Dharmapuri Arvind belong to the community, which has 12% vote share in the state. “Munnuru Kapu community has always stood by the BJP. Now that Eatala has won Huzurabad seat, party wants to lure members from Mudiraj group, another major BC community with a large number of votes, to vote for party,” sources said. Eatala belongs to the Mudiraj community.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana counsel questions relevance of panel’s queries on encounter day||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court lawyer appearing for Telangana before the SC-appointed inquiry commission referred to certain details sought by the panel as irrelevant to the inquiry. According to the state’s counsel Lata Krishnamurti , details such as time of arrival of police at Chattanpally, mention of the word ‘scene reconstruction’ by the state in GO referring to formation of SIT, number of cops affected by soil allegedly thrown by the accused and if the injured cop was attacked with an iron rod or a stick were irrelevant as the purpose of the commission was to find if the death of the four accused was due to deliberate act by the police on December 6, 2019. When the commission asked if accused Md Arif managed to throw soil in the eyes of all cops, Krishnamurti responded that how many were affected was not relevant as even a spec of dust in eye could incapacitate a person. On constable Aravindh Goud being hit with an iron rod or stick, the senior lawyer dismissed the commission’s query and said the fact that he was injured was important and not the weapon used. After it was argued that police team took the accused to Chattanpally on December 6 for recovery of Disha’s articles, commission chairman V S Sirpurkar asked the advocate why the words reconstruction of crime scene appeared in the GO issued for formation of SIT. The advocate claimed that it had no relevance to the events of December 6. But when the commission asked her to read investigating officer (IO) ACP V Surender’s petition before the local court seeking police custody of the accused which mentions crime scene reconstruction, the state’s counsel again claimed that ‘scene reconstruction’ did not mean anything and that the IO had gone there to recover the articles. Responding to commission’s question on whether the police arrived at Chattanpally at 4.40 am as stated in NHRC statements or at 5.30 am as per the depositions, the advocate said that some may have arrived earlier and others later, adding that such nitty-gritty was suited for trial and was not in the scope of commission formed to inquire into the circumstances in which the four accused were killed. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-counsel-questions-relevance-of-panels-queries-on-encounter-day/articleshow/87898005.cms||Mahesh Buddi

During their three-day inspection, the team will interact will all deans of faculties, heads of departments, vice chancellor and other university officials. TOI had earlier reported that a section of teachers fear that the internal rift in the university, as well as the fact that around 125 cases are pending against it in court, may affect its current ‘A’ ranking. The NAAC peer team’s day began with a presentation by the VC and the director of Internal Quality Assessment Cell (IQAC) R C Dubey. In interaction with the faculty, the focus was on curricular aspects, teaching-learning evaluation, research, innovation and extension. On the second day, the team is scheduled to evaluate the university's infrastructure and learning resources apart from governance, leadership and management. On the third day, institutional values and best practices of the university will be evaluated. The visit and its outcomes are significant as vice-chancellor Roop Kishore Shastri had earlier denied any rift in the university, saying the employees’ apprehensions, if any, were unfounded and their resentment “unjustified”. He had said that the measures taken by him in the last two years were to improve its “academic and administrative standards” and were necessitated by financial crunch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/naac-team-reaches-gurukul-kangri-amid-internal-rift/articleshow/87897168.cms||---

Commuters are at risk due to the lack of guards. Many drivers are speeding through BRTS stretch and jumping signals. Other drivers who follow traffic rules promptly are harmed as a consequence. Citizens claim that the signals at the BRTS stretch are unscientific, and the withdrawal of guards is adding to traffic woes.Rajendran Iyer, a marketing professional, stated that crossing the road at BVB College and other intersections has been extremely difficult, particularly during college hours and in the evening. “Some riders and drivers have developed the bad habit of focusing on traffic cops or security guards rather than traffic signals. Previously, security guards were on duty at all times, but their absence has resulted in traffic junctions becoming accident hotspots,” he added.Vikas Soppin, a social activist, said that any department or organisation constantly corrects its mistakes. "However, BRTS is the only organisation that is learning to make mistakes," he rued. While its unscientific traffic signals haunt commuters, they have now made commuters and pedestrians even more miserable by removing security guards. Officials should understand that as their technology fails, human intervention should be maintained in the public's interest, he added.Basavaraj Gonal, a techie, noted that because there is no barricade or guard, many visitors from other cities unknowingly enter the BRTS stretch. “Although they have erected a bigger signboard prohibiting the entry of private vehicles, it is not easily visible to people sitting in cars or other light motor vehicles. Traffic cops have stopped deploying their personnel because they believe BRTS has their own guards. Police are only concerned with major intersections such as Channamma Circle. Hosur Cross and Arts College are both located in Hosur. We can't expect them at intersections like Bhairidevarakoppa, Sattur,” he said.Manjunath Jadenavar, BRTS's public relations officer, admitted that the the number of guards has been reduced since the Covid pandemic owing to a sharp fall in commutement by passengers. "Previously, we had over 50 guards stationed at all intersections. We have now deployed approximately 30 guards at junctions located within the city limits of Hubballi and Dharwad, as well as major junctions such as SDM Hospital between the cities. Because almost all drivers and riders are aware of the restriction on the BRTS stretch, there is no need to maintain guards at all junctions. We have made certain that guards are stationed at one end of both the entry and exit points to operate boom barriers. They stop anyone who enters the stretch. As our CCTV captures the registration number of the erred vehicle, we will also impose a penalty through the police. We've seen a significant reduction in such violations as people have become more aware of the rule," he defended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/absence-of-guards-at-brts-stretch-poses-danger-to-commuters/articleshow/87897175.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Due to a gap of few days between the alleged rape and her suicide, the medical report doesn’t clearly mention that she was raped, Parikshita Rathod, superintendent f of police, railway, told reporters on Wednesday. Rathod said that the incident happened in Vadodara on October 29 while the girl committed suicide by hanging in a coach of a train in Valsad on November 4. But going by the statements of the witnesses and the injury marks on victim’s hands, legs and thigh, as mentioned in the medical report, the cops are certain that the girl was raped. Rathod said that the cops are investigating through technical and human intelligence to nab the culprits. She also informed that before the Special Investing Team (SIT) took over, the investigation was carried out by Superintendent of police (SP), three DSPs, four PIs, 10 PSIs along with the team of LCB and SOG. The DSP also claimed that the officials of the Vadodara-based Oasis Institute, where the girl was doing internship, are cooperating with the investigators. When asked why the institute officials did not immediately report the matter to police, Rathod said that the trustee of the institute told the cops that he was in Jammu & Kashmir when the incident happened. He thought that the legal proceedings can be initiated once he has a talk with the victim after returning to Vadodara. Rathod informed that the victim had called a friend to pick her up after she was sexually assaulted. The girl too told the cops that the victim herself didn’t want to file a police complaint that time, Rathod said. During initial investigations, the railway cops found the girl’s diary wherein she had written that she was kidnapped and raped by two auto-drivers near Vaccine Institute ground in Vadodara. But later few pages of the diary were found to be missing and later recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/medical-report-doesnt-confirm-rape/articleshow/87897173.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

KTR was in Delhi at the time of the incident. Condemning the incident, KTR, in a tweet, said: “Some thugs and hooligans of BJP in Hyderabad have vandalised the GHMC office yesterday. I strongly condemn this atrocious behaviour. Guess, it’s too much to ask Godse Bhakts to behave in a Gandhian manner (sic).” The minister also asked Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar to take “strictest action on the vandals” as per law. Meanwhile, all TRS corporators visited GHMC office on Wednesday and cleaned the premises with milk and water. “The cleaning process began at 12 noon and continued up to 2pm,” Boudhanagar corporator Kandi Shailaja told TOI. Later, the TRS corporators met mayor Vijaya Lakshmi R Gadwal and GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar and gave a representation urging them to take action against the BJP corporators. The mayor, in an official release, said the attack was a “heinous act”.

Further, he clarified that the corporators did not break the flower pots and furniture during the commotion at the GHMC office on Tuesday. BJP corporators said on Wednesday that the goods were damaged due to police jostling.

Every year the Union ministry of health and family welfare conducts a nationwide drive where men are even awarded Rs 1,110 to undergo the operation, but not many come forward. According to officials, not more than 20 from each district have expressed interest despite pleas from volunteers. “We explain to them that it has no side-effects, but still many refuse to come for the procedure,” said Dr Swarjya Laksmi, district medical and health officer ( DMHO) of Ranga Reddy. “Although vasectomy is regarded as a permanent method of family planning, a reversal is possible,” an official said. A variety of circumstances prevent males from shouldering the burden of family planning. Most men tend to think that the process affects a man’s sexual drive and virility. “Loss of libido is the biggest myth associated with sterilisation,” a health department official said. The associated social stigma as well as lack of understanding about new treatments were the key reasons for men’s poor participation in family planning. Many women also do not want their husbands to have a vasectomy, officials said. Vasectomy is a small procedure performed under local anaesthesia that is quick, painless and non-invasive, officials said. The tubes that transfer sperm from the testicles to the penis are surgically clipped or clamped to prevent fertilisation. Innovations have sped up the process over time. The No-Scalpel Vasectomy is a relatively recent surgery. The drive is set to be launched in the state on November 29 and end on December 4.

---||Dehradun||Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority to inspect around 80 food joints along Mussoorie-Doon road, act against illegal ones||Dehradun: The Mussorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) has decided to inspect the food joints operating at the Mussorie-Dehradun highway. According to civic officials, several of these commercial establishments are operating without permission and a few of them have even carried out construction activities without the MDDA nod. “Any establishment that undertakes a permanent construction activity is mandated to take permission from the MDDA. We believe several food joints operating at the stretch have violated norms,” said Sanjeevan Soontha, system administrator, MDDA. On Tuesday (November 23), the MDDA sealed two food joints at the stretch. “One of the fast-food points was instructed to not carry out any construction activities on the ground and first floors but the owner violated the order. Therefore, we sealed the food joint. Similarly, a shopping complex near Doiwala was also sealed for carrying out illegal construction,” said Soontha. The officer added that the department will continue to take action against all such places in the area. About 80 food joints are currently operational at the stretch. Last year too, a few such establishments were sealed for not adhering to regulations. On the other hand, shop owners say that the decision to expand mostly depends on the consumer footfall. “We started as a small tea shop 11 years ago. Gradually, our customers started increasing and therefore, we expanded our establishment after taking all necessary permissions. We are now planning to seek MDDA’s nod to add one more floor,” said Ehsaan Shahi, owner of a food joint on the Dehradun-Mussorie road. Meanwhile, activists and civic officials say that unregulated and unauthorised construction activities could pose a risk to public safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-dehradun-development-authority-to-inspect-around-80-food-joints-along-mussoorie-doon-road-act-against-illegal-ones/articleshow/87897206.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The association claimed that more than 2,000 vendors attended the protest to express their disappointment to the CM, but Kejriwal refused to meet their delegation. No response was available from the Delhi government. “Police also refused to cooperate and tried to detain two street vendors. The vendors have vowed to return on December 2 in larger numbers if their demands are not met immediately,” said Arbind Singh, NASVI’s national coordinator who headed the march. The demands include formation of active grievance redressal committees as per the Act, giving full power to the town vending committees (TVC) as mandated by it, and immediately conducting the extended street vendors’ survey, Singh added. Other demands are granting allowance to TVC members and specifying important details on the certificate of vending such as place and type of vendor. NASVI also announced that on December 10, it would protest in all civic zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/street-vendors-to-hold-mega-protest-on-dec-2/articleshow/87898711.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Foundation of mosques in secretariat to be laid today||HYDERABAD: The state government has decided to start the work of re-constructing the secretariat mosques that were razed during the demolition of the old secretariat buildings. The foundation stone for the construction of the two mosques in the new secretariat premises will be laid by Jamia Nizamia university vice-chancellor Mufti Khaleel Ahmed on Thursday. Sources said that the foundation stones for the construction of a grand temple and a church in the secretariat premises would be laid soon. Home minister Mahmood Ali, state Waqf board chairman Mohammed Saleem, TRS MLC Farooq Hussain and other government officials on Wednesday inspected the proposed site of construction of the mosques in the secretariat campus. Though the plan of the TRS government was to simultaneously start the construction work on all three places of worship—temple, mosque and church, a good muhurat to start the temple construction is expected soon, said Mahmood Ali. There were two mosques and a temple in the secretariat premises, which were damaged during the demolition of the old secretariat buildings. As a result, the places of worship were also demolished. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had promised the people of the state that a grand new temple and mosques would be constructed along with the new secretariat complex. He also announced that a church too would be constructed in the secretariat campus. Several Muslim organisations have been demanding re-construction of mosques in the secretariat premises. The AIMIM too had been urging KCR to start construction of the two mosques at the earliest and had also finalised, in consultation with the government and Islamic scholars, a design of the mosques. There were two mosques in the secretariat campus, one located adjacent to the old C Block and another near the old D Block (both the blocks along with other buildings in the secretariat had been demolished to pave way for the new complex).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/foundation-of-mosques-insecretariat-to-be-laid-today/articleshow/87898025.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Goa||Goa: Cabinet nod to new housing scheme for govt employees||PANAJI: In a relief to around 1,500 state government employees, ahead of the assembly elections, the cabinet on Wednesday decided to reintroduce a new and revised House Building Allowance (HBA) scheme for them, who are beneficiaries of the earlier scheme. For government employees who want to take benefit of the HBA scheme as new beneficiaries, a separate scheme will be introduced through the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), chief minister Pramod Sawant said. Under the HBA scheme, the beneficiary government employee has to pay only 2% of the interest rate of their housing loan and the remaining interest is borne by the state government. However, in May 2020, the state government abruptly withdrew the old scheme (in force since 1988). This led to the government employees being suddenly charged the prevailing bank interest rates by the financial institutions. A group of the employees had even approached the high court against the government for withdrawal of HBA scheme. “We are streamlining and reintroducing the scheme for existing and new beneficiaries. We have fixed an interest rate with empaneled banks at 6.5%. Of this, 2% will be paid by the employees, the rest will be paid by the government,” the CM said, after the cabinet meeting. The earlier government scheme was very complicated, said Sawant. “Because of this, the interest deducted from the beneficiaries remained with the government for up to two years. Then the government had to pay it to the bank at double the interest rate. The scheme was turning out to be a burden for the government. We have revised this scheme and streamlined some procedures. We have empaneled almost all banks and beneficiaries will have to pay installments directly to the bank,” said Sawant. The scheme has around 1,400 beneficiaries at present and some 45 new applicants, he said. “Now, the bank will directly raise the bill of the remaining interest to the government. All existing beneficiaries will get benefit of the streamlined scheme. And for the new applicants who want to take benefit of the scheme, EDC will offer it at 2% interest rate and they will get the loan through EDC,” said Sawant. Existing beneficiaries will get benefit of the scheme through empaneled banks, he said. The scheme is being fine-tuned and within the next four-five days the circular will be issued, said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-to-new-housing-scheme-for-govt-employees/articleshow/87898023.cms||---
---||India||Opposition's dissent notes ill-conceived: JPC chief||NEW DELHI: Dissent notes moved by opposition members against the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 are "ill-conceived" as the recommendations of the JPC are a fine balance that protects individual privacy while encouraging growth of the digital economy, panel chair and senior BJP leader P P Chaudhary said. If implemented, the dissent note recommendations will bring the growing digital sector to a grinding halt and make it difficult for poor people to access welfare schemes and benefits due to them, Chaudhary told TOI. Speaking on the JPC report on the Personal Data Protection Bill, he said allegations that government agencies have been "exempted" are a sweeping exaggeration. "Please read Section 35, the safeguards and limits are laid out. The exemptions are only on basis of grounds like national security, where reasons have to be set out and where such decisions are open to judicial review," he said. "Some people think the government wants to deprive people of their personal liberty and privacy. That thinking is wrong," he said, adding that the Bill strikes the "right balance" between individual privacy and creating an enabling environment to harness the true potential of the digital economy. He also said exemptions with regard to government are in keeping with provisions of Article 19 (freedom of expression) but with clear definitions. "This legislation is not only constitutionally compliant, but also goes far beyond the Constitution in so far as reasonable restrictions and safeguards are concerned. There are reasonable restrictions for the benefit of the individual and for the security and integrity of the country," Chaudhary said. The Pali MP also defended Sections 12 and 35 of the proposed legislation, to which opposition MPs had principally objected while alleging that the central government was giving "unbridled powers" to itself. Chaudhary said the draft bill has provisioned enough checks and balances, and detailed procedures that will be contained in the rules to define exactly how individual data will be processed by the agencies concerned so that there is no excessive regulation by the government. Similarly, he said, Sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill detail the exceptions when an individual's consent may not be sought, for instance, while delivering services or benefits like PDS rations or pensions. "Consent" in such services will actually harm the deprived, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppositions-dissent-notes-ill-conceived-jpc-chief/articleshow/87899599.cms||Swati Mathur

Rajinder Kumar Chawala had come to Jaipur from Gurgaon on August 26 to meet the representatives of E5 Infrastructure Private Limited, a private construction involved by the NHAI for the construction of 14 foot-overbridges (FoB). Both Chawala and the private company were locked in disagreements over the extension of time (EoT) and designs of the project. Chawala remained adamant and as a result was shot down by two shooters that the company’s officials had brought from Haryana. As soon as Chawala stepped out of the meeting to smoke a cigarette, he was killed right outside the NHAI’s office in Vaishali Nagar. Police investigation revealed the NHAI had shortlisted Sheoran’s company for the construction of 14 FOBs on the Gurgaon-Kotputli-Jaipur stretch of NH-8 for Rs 35 crore. These FOBs were sanctioned to be constructed as single span, which meant that there should not be any pillar underneath the bridges. The construction timeline was sanctioned for completion by August 2021. The FOB project soon ran into trouble because of continuous delays in construction and its design. Police said Sheoran wanted modification in tender conditions including changing its design from single-span to double-span along with an extension of time (EOT). The murder led to the arrest of six persons including the MD of the company, identified as Karandeep Sheoran (29). The murder had led to a huge uproar with a renewed focus on the security for consultants, also known as authority engineers (AEs) who are tasked with overseeing the pace of NHAI projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chargesheet-soon-in-nhai-consultant-murder-case/articleshow/87898697.cms||---

The constable, Saidul Islam Molla, a resident of Baruipur, had even announced a reward of Rs 50,000 for finding his wife, who had gone missing nine days ago from home. The woman, who has been suffering from neurological disorders, was reunited with her family. Rajib Mondal, a resident of Haridevpur, spotted the woman on Tuesday morning and tweeted, “A destitute lady is lying unattended near my house since morning. Calls to local Haridevpur police have elicited no response so far. SOS immediately or she might not see tomorrow’s daylight. Location details-Satyen Park, Kol-104.” Following this post on Twitter, cops rescued the woman and brought her to the police station, said DC (Behala) Swati Bhangalia. According to the police, the woman had been begging for food on the road. “On being asked about her address, she could not tell cops anything.

But it was Phase III, which made the metro accessible to major localities of Delhi. The Phase III is also believed to be the toughest in terms of major civil engineering challenges it encountered. A film being screened at the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) documents these challenges of the Phase III of the Delhi Metro project and how engineers overcame them The 160 km-long metro stretch saw work on 11 different corridors with 30 mammoth tunnel boring machines and a workforce of nearly 30,000. “This film highlights how DMRC overcame such engineering challenges with out-of-the-box solutions,” said Satish Pande, the filmmaker of ‘Surmounting Challenges’. Pande said that the Delhi Metro project also helped reduce carbon footprints and fatal accidents. So the socio-economic benefits of the metro project are remarkable. He said that when constructing the Delhi Metro, detailed environmental impact assessment studies were carried out. “The construction of Phase III started in 2011 and ended around 2020. We were shooting all the developments continuously for these 10 years. ‘Surmounting Challenges’ is two hours, which is very technical and can be of immense importance to IIT students and engineers,” said Pande. He said that a community interaction programme was also conducted before starting the construction. “People were skeptical about the metro at the beginning. But it was a success,” said Pande. He said that his bond with the metro is very old and he made his first film on Delhi Metro 27 years ago on the broad theme ‘Why Delhi needs a metro?’. “I have started my journey from there. I have made films on Phase-I and Phase-II of Delhi Metro. I have also made movies on Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gorakhpur, Agra and Jaipur Metro too”, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-hour-film-on-delhi-metro-can-help-iit-students-enggs/articleshow/87898033.cms||---

The rescue operation was started by Jhajhra range officer Vinod Chauhan around 10:30 am and it continued till 1:30 pm. “We tranquilised the sub-adult leopard to rescue it. The big cat was also given treatment for a minor injury in the paws. It seems that the snare was put to trap the wild animal for its meat. Such incidents often increase in winters. Besides leopards, animals like pigs and deer are also trapped by some locals,” said Ravi Joshi, member of the team that rescued the leopard. Recently, a leopard had died after getting stuck in a snare in the Masandwala area of the Jhajhra range. Later, four people of Nepalese origin had confessed to setting up the trap for the animal's meat. In yet another similar incident at Bidholi, another trapped leopard was rescued. The repeated instances of leopards being trapped in snare have raised questions on the safety of wild animals in the outskirts of Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/leopard-trapped-in-snare-rescued-in-bhauwala/articleshow/87897253.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Pune||Plans to use international departure space for domestic flights at Pune airport||PUNE: City airport authorities have requested the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to allow them to handle domestic operations from the international departure area to effectively control the crowd. Speaking on the sidelines of the Pune Airport Advisory Committee meeting on Wednesday, airport director Santosh Dhoke said that in addition to this, a requisition has been sent to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) headquarters in Delhi to increase the number of Central Industrial Security Force personnel by 200. “At present, the airport is 12 hours operational but from December 1, it would operate 24 hours. This would require spacing of flights. The total flights’ movement after December 1 is expected to grow. We are looking at a total of 160 to 180 flight movements daily after December 1,” Dhoke said. He said with this, the number of passengers is also expected to rise. “Thus, a request has been sent to BCAS to allow us to use the international departure area of the airport to process domestic passengers. This will help in better crowd management,” Dhoke said. Before the pandemic outbreak, the Pune airport had two international flights to Dubai operated by SpiceJet and Air India Express. The director said at present, they were handling around 1,500 to 1,800 passengers per hour. “This is almost double to what the airport was handling per hour in the pre-pandemic times. However, earlier the airport was operational round the clock, which isn’t the case now, leading to crowding. Several steps such as increasing the number of X-ray baggage scanners, additional door frame metal detector machines and creating space by removing many offices located inside the terminal building have been taken,” he said. He, however, added that screening every passenger diligently is highly important considering the risks involved in the airline business. “We cannot ask CISF to speed up. We had a meeting on the issue with our headquarters and decided that the number of CISF personnel will be increased from the present 358 to 528,” the director said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plans-to-use-intl-departure-space-for-domestic-flights/articleshow/87898053.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Patna||Get allegations against LNMU VC probed: Bihar CM to chancellor||PATNA: Taking cognizance of the allegations of corruption against L N Mithila University (LNMU) VC and Raj Bhavan officials, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday wrote a letter to governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan to get the charges inquired into properly. The chancellor left for Delhi in the evening after a meeting with the CM before appointing the VC of Patliputra University and the pro-VC of Nalanda University. The CM has reportedly stated in his letter that the allegations made by the VC are of serious nature and, hence, there must be a thorough inquiry into the charges. Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU) vice-chancellor Md Qudus had written a letter to both the chancellor as well as the chief minister on Sunday, levelling serious charges against his predecessor and LNMU VC Surendra Pratap Singh. Incidentally, Singh received the best vice-chancellor’s award from the chancellor on Monday. The award ceremony was, however, not attended by education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary or any other official of the education department. S P Singh was earlier given additional charge of the Patliputra University VC. He is also the officiating VC of Aryabhatta Knowledge University. The allegations against the LNMU VC have been made within a week of the Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) raids at the residence and office of Magadh University (MU) VC Rajendra Prasad, who has proceeded on a month’s medical leave from Wednesday till December 23, according to a Raj Bhavan notification. MU pro-VC Bibhuti Narayan Singh has been made its officiating VC. Meanwhile, senior academics have expressed their concern over the charges of corruption levelled against the vice-chancellors of MU and LNMU, which have vitiated the academic atmosphere of the state. The Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said the MU vice-chancellor must be removed from the office immediately in view of the gross financial irregularities allegedly committed by him. The chancellor should not have granted him medical leave for one month, they said. They also demanded that the best vice-chancellor’s award given to LNMU VC should also be taken back as he has also been accused of corrupt practices. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur, in a public petition sent to the chancellor and the chief minister, has alleged that in gross violation of the statutory provisions, the vice-chancellors of BRA Bihar, LN Mithila and Magadh universities were assigned to perform their duties in two or more universities simultaneously in breach of law. Consequently, the recovery of huge cash to the tune of Rs2 crore from the house of MU VC during the vigilance raid epitomizes the malfeasance on a large scale. He demanded a thorough inquiry against all the three VCs. New VC of Patliputra varsityThe chancellor, in consultation with the CM at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday, appointed R K Singh as the VC of Patliputra University and Sanjoy Kumar as the pro-VC of Nalanda Open University before leaving for Delhi. Prof Singh is from electronics and computer engineering department at Bipin Tripathi Kumaon Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand, while Prof Sanjoy is posted at JLN College, Khagaul under Patliputra University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/get-allegations-against-lnmu-vc-probed-cm-to-chancellor/articleshow/87898061.cms||B K Mishra
---||Vijayawada||AP: Institutions adopt wait & watch policy on reopening||VISAKHAPATNAM: Even after 20 months into the Covid-19 pandemic, educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh are still taking a wait-and-watch approach to fully open their campuses due to the anticipated third wave. Only a few institutes are currently functioning offline, while some have adopted a hybrid model of three-day online and three-day offline classes. Considering the safety and health of the students, the majority of the higher educational institutions are still limited to virtual classes. During the first wave of the Covid-19 last year, nearly one crore students of Andhra Pradesh, pursuing various courses, were confined to their homes for about seven months- from March 2020 to November 2020. The Union home ministry, under ‘unlock 4.0’ guidelines, gave a partial reopening permission for the classes 9-12 from September 21. The schools (classes IX and X), junior colleges, and higher educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh resumed their conventional classroom teaching on November 2, 2020. The students of class VIII started attending face-to-face instruction from November 23, while offline classes for class VII started on December 14. While physical instruction had begun for the higher classes in 2020 itself, the primary schools resumed their offline academic activity only in February 2021. However, several educational institutions had to revert to online classes from April 2021 due to the then steep surge in the daily case numbers. Thousands of students and faculty members tested positive for the pandemic in both first and second waves. Even though the state is currently reporting manageable case numbers, several institutions are in a waiting mode as to how the pandemic would unfold in the coming months. Director, Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (Petroleum University), Prof VSRK Prasad said that the choice should be left to the students and their parents, considering the pandemic situation. “We, at the IIPE, have brought only the willing students of a few sections to the campus for practicals. Otherwise, the students are attending online classes. As the students’ health and safety remain the top priority for any academic institution, it is better to closely watch things than bringing all the students to the campuses,” said Prof Prasad. Even the concerned parents are preferring online classes over physical instruction. Revella Trinath, a parent of a class VII student studying in MVP Colony, said that he chose to continue with virtual classes for his child. “If all the students appear for offline classes, it will become difficult for the schools to maintain social distancing or other Covid-related protocols due to their limited infrastructure,” said Trinath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/institutions-adopt-wait-watch-policy-on-reopening/articleshow/87897237.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Earlier, those who passed class X/attained 18 years and cleared an entrance exam conducted by the universities used to gain admissions into the graduate programmes like BCom and BA. According to the officials, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has now mandated 10+2 qualification to admit aspirants into these programmes. Andhra University, Visakhapatnam had to halt the process even after conducting the entrance test this year due to the UGC’s latest directive. Similar is the situation with other universities in the state. The decision is expected to have an impact on about 50,000 aspirants, who take admissions every year through various higher educational institutions in the state.  Open and distance learning (ODL) is considered a catalyst for development in the rural milieu as it provides an avenue for knowledge and information upgrading. ODL, over the last several decades, has come in handy for those aspirants, particularly from the agrarian background who cannot devote their full-time to education or those who discontinued their studies after class X. The ODL has provided them with access to higher education. Director, School of Distance Education, Andhra University, Prof K Visweswara Rao, said that 10+2 (intermediate) qualification is now mandatory to get admission into distance under-graduation programmes. “This in fact is expected to improve the academic standards. We have explained the situation to those aspirants, who appeared for the entrance test for admission into the undergraduate programme and they agreed to the same,” said Prof Rao.  According to educationalists, the universities used to give admissions into distance under-graduation programmes to those who completed 21 years of age till around 1995. Later, it was relaxed to 18 years. Nakka Sreenu, an aspirant, said that he may now have to complete intermediate (10+2) in regular mode or through open school society to pursue graduation. “Some of my friends earlier completed their graduation in distance mode with class X qualification,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/class-x-not-enough-for-distance-ug-courses/articleshow/87897259.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

With voters coming from both Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), and ZP and panchayat samitis in rural areas, Congress has chalked out a strategy to get a commitment from not only their own party members, but also allies. Rajendra Mulak, senior Congress leader and former MoS, said, “The process has already started. Voters are being contacted and we are confident that a big surprise is in store for December 14 (result declaration date).” Mulak, president of Congress’ rural unit, is spearheading the voter contact campaign under his jurisdiction. Since MLC candidate Dr Ravindra Bhoyar is new to the party, the leg work of securing voters lies with senior party leaders. Cabinet minister Sunil Kedar has shouldered the responsibility of working the phone lines. Ally Shiv Sena is standing firmly behind Bhoyar. Senior Sena leader and MP from Ramtek Krupal Tumane said, “All our votes are for Bhoyar, there is no confusion about that. That directive has come from party headquarters itself and all our voters here have been informed about it.” With Sena’s votes firmly in the bag, Congress now has to bring its ‘natural ally’ NCP over to their side. The rift between the two parties started after Congress state president Nana Patole’s comment earlier this month, which talked about ending NCP’s existence in Vidarbha. This is the reason NCP stayed away from the photo session on Tuesday, when Bhoyar filed his nomination. NCP city president Duneshwar Pethe said, “It’s true that we are natural allies but then our brothers must at least complete the formality of asking for support. Instead, some people were busy in talking about finishing off NCP. If two brothers live in separate homes, the bond is still there but the formality of inviting each other for dinner still has to be done.” He ruled out revenge voting, which may harm the Congress candidate. “We will never vote for BJP, our ideology is aligned to that of the Congress. Now, we are waiting for our senior leaders to instruct us and we shall act on it,” said Pethe. With Patole meeting Pawar, talks of ruffled feathers being smoothed are doing the rounds. This will help ensure NCP voters don’t abstain, if not cross vote, and help Bhoyar’s cause. Now comes the competition of snatching away opposition votes, and that’s where Kedar’s strategic electoral management comes into play. With deep roots in the complex rural political ecosystem, Kedar has a reputation of swaying votes. In city, Kedar along with Bhoyar are hoping to make a dent in BJP voters. A senior Congress leader said, “If not a victory, then even defeat by a slender margin will set the tone for civic polls. Basically, we need to show that BJP has lost its hold on party cadre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-bjp-ring-fences-voters-congress-works-the-phone-to-swing-votes/articleshow/87896395.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||Rising prices of tomato in local markets have consumers red-faced||Nagpur: After fuel, it’s the prices of tomatoes that have left consumers fuming. Retail vendors in the local markets are selling tomatoes at Rs80 to Rs100 a kg. English tomato, as the superior grade is called in the local markets, is available for Rs100 and vendors say it is short in supply too. This grade is used in salads and soups. “The vegetable has become costly at such a level after four years,” say traders. The wholesalers in Nagpur get tomato supplies mainly from Chhattisgarh, Chhindwara in MP and Andhra Pradesh. Bouts of unseasonal rains around a month ago have hampered the crop which has left the rates spiraling say traders. “Tomatoes from Chhattisgarh are in the range of Rs1,400 to 1,500 per 25 kg. It’s Rs1,000 to Rs1,100 for the supplies from Andhra and Chhindwara,” said Nandksihore Gaur, president of vegetable traders association at the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC). This translates into Rs40 to Rs60 a kg in the bulk markets alone Gaur said the situation was worse in 2016 when the rates had touched Rs1,400 to Rs1,600 per 25 kgs. The yield has come down to minimal levels leaving not much for the farmers to earn. Gaur said the rates are expected that to remain on the higher side for some more days. Durgesh Pardhey, a farmer in Chhattisgarh, said the rates are expected to ease soon, as supplies have started increasing. “The rates have started coming down to Rs900 per 25 kg. It is expected to slide further. Ideally, tomatoes should be around Rs20 a kg in the wholesale markets,” he said. At Gokulpeth vegetable market, the local or gavrani tomatoes were sold for Rs80 and the better variety for Rs100 a kg. Some of the vendors were ready to settle for Rs70 too, as they could get it at Rs60 a kg from the wholesalers. Dilip Verma, a vegetable vendor at Gokulpeth, said people have started buying lesser quantity. “Instead of one kg, many are preferring to buy just half a kg,” he said. NOGA Nagpur orange growers association (NOGA), the state government undertaking, is also expected to be affected by the rising tomato prices. Though set up for orange growers, over the years tomato ketchup has become one of the major products marketed by NOGA. Tomato procurement had become its mainstay. High rates are expected to affect its calculations. Over three years ago, it has stopped direct procurement of fresh tomatoes. Unable to stand competition from bigger players, direct procurement has been stopped. Now, NOGA directly buys tomato paste to make ketchup. “As even the paste is expected to be costly due to tomato prices, it may affect NOGA’s economics. At Rs80, it would be indeed costly for NOGA,” said source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-prices-of-tomato-in-local-markets-have-consumers-red-faced/articleshow/87896403.cms||Shishir Arya

The parking lot will get the connections in a month after which the facility can be made operational from January 1,” said Bapat, who is also the Pune MP. Sources said a technical team from AAI would inspect the project and present its report by next week on whether or not the facility could be made operational by January. The project’s scheduled completion date is April 2022. “The work on the skywalk connecting the second floor of the parking lot to the terminal building can continue along with the parking,” Bapat said. On the delay in executing the new Pune airport project, Bapat said it is in the nascent stage. “No timeline can be given for it. It can even take 10 years,” the MP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-multi-level-parking-lot-may-open-from-january-1/articleshow/87898062.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||MLC elections: Independents in Telangana forge papers, rejected||HYDERABAD: Dozens of Independent candidates, who filed their nomination in the MLC elections, have submitted either forged signatures of proposers or furnish the proposers’ names, the election authorities said. They rejected their nominations while scrutinising the papers on Wednesday, authorities said. For instance, three independent candidates’ nominations were rejected by the election authorities saying the signatures of the proposers on the nomination papers were not genuine. Similarly, in Karimnagar Local Authorities’ Constituency, where 14 independent candidates’ nominations were rejected, either signatures were not genuine or they proposers have not signed on the nomination papers. Some have not submitted their affidavits. In some constituencies, candidates have not even submitted security deposit. In Nizamabad, the lone independent candidate Kotagiri Srinivas’s nomination was not accepted as the affidavit was incomplete. According to the rules, the candidates aspiring to contest in MLC elections have to submit either 10% of the total electors or 10 voters in their nomination papers. In Local Authority Constituency, elected local bodies representatives are voters. While the last date for nominations ended on November 23, the election returning officers and observers scrutinized the nominations on Wednesday. Of more than 100 nominations filed till November 23, 92 were found to be valid. Apart from the ruling TRS, Congress candidates are in the fray in the segments like Medak and Khammam Constituencies. KCR’s daughter and sitting MLC K Kavitha from Nizamabad, Patnam Mahender Reddy and Sunkari Raju from Ranga Reddy are likely to be declared elected unanimous as they are no other candidates in the contest. After withdrawal of the nominations, more MLCs are likely to be get elected unanimously. It has become a herculean task for the ruling party leaders to convince independent candidates to withdraw them from the contest. But in Adilabad and Karimnagar districts, where huge number of candidates in fray, unanimous election is unlikely. In Ranga Reddy district only one independent candidate Chandrasekhar Chalika filed his nomination. His nomination was also rejected on Wednesday during scrutiny of nomination as he failed to get the proposers names and pay deposit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/independents-forge-papers-rejected/articleshow/87898059.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Dehradun||In a first in India, house built using hemp fibre in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: An architect couple has built a sprawling 5-room house in Yamkeshwar block of Pauri Garhwal district, using ‘hempcrete’ – a mixture of parts of “bhang” or hemp plant, lime, wood, mud, water and other minerals – which can be used as a green alternative to concrete. Architect Namrata Kandwal, 30, who conceptualised and built the house with husband Gaurav Dixit, said that this is the first time hempcrete has been put to extensive use to build a house in India. The technique is prevalent in countries like Australia and New Zealand. Former Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Rawat inaugurated the house, spread over 800 sq ft and built at a cost of Rs 30 lakh, on Wednesday. As part of its "all-green" message, the house also has 3 kilowatt rooftop solar power panels and a 5,000-litre underground water harvesting facility. The interiors are also decorated with eco-friendly materials. The house has been developed as a homestay and can be experienced by tourists as well. Kandwal said that the building material uses farm waste and is therefore both eco-friendly and affordable. “Farmers in Uttarakhand used to burn hemp fibre after extracting the seeds but we procured it from them and used about 3 tonnes of hemp to make this house,” she said. Apart from being eco-friendly, hempcrete has several other advantages, Kandwal added. “Houses built of hemp are good at absorbing moisture and radiating excess of it without leading to mould on the walls. Hempcrete has superior carbon absorption capacity, naturally purifying the air of the house,” the architect said, alleging that houses made of hemp can even absorb tremors, reducing the impact of earthquakes and the ill effects of excessive rainfall, which destroy life and property every year in the hill state. Dixit, her husband, pointed out that there is evidence of hemp fibre being used in Ellora caves, which may have led to their longevity. “The Ellora caves date back to the 6th and 11th centuries AD. The fact that these caves have stood the test of time shows that the material they were made of has strong endurance,” he said. Experts said that the use of hempcrete would considerably reduce dependence on virgin construction materials like soil, sand etc. Avlokita Agrawal, associate professor, department of architecture at IIT Roorkee, said, “India is yet to arrange 60% of the building material that will be needed by 2050, which means there will be immense pressure on virgin minerals used in concrete construction. Materials like hempcrete will be of tremendous benefit in taking the load off these natural resources.” Kandwal has now founded a start-up with her husband and brother to create hempcrete, with plans to replicate this construction technique across Uttarakhand to ensure affordable housing, especially in rural areas.

The NGT had sought a status report in the matter from Jaipur district administration by December 1, the next date for the hearing. A writ in this regard was filed at the NGT in 2017 stating that sewerage water flowing out of 50 industrial units had polluted Mansagar Lake. These are primarily small units mainly dealing with printing work. “Out of 50 units, 41 have already been shut. Nine units are still operating in that area,” said Rakesh Kumar Meena, subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Jaipur. “We have conducted a survey and submitted the report to the ADM-1 (Iqbal Khan),” said Meena. “After municipal corporations and pollution control board take action against these units, we will file an affidavit in the tribunal stating that all units have been closed down.

---||Jaipur||HC seeks report on Kartarpura drain||Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court has sought a report from the state government and JDA on the encroachment at Kartarpura drain and removal of encroachment from the downstream area. The court has asked the JDA to make an action plan on constructing a concrete drain in four weeks and place it before the court. The division bench of Justice M M Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani gave the order on the petition of Rajendra Prasad Sharma. The petitioner said that there is a lack of proper drainage system in this drain which is about four and a half kilometres long and the land mafia in connivance with officials dumped construction debris in the drain. In 2014, the JDA had admitted that they did not have the record of Kartarpura drain. On April 24, 2015, the high court had directed the JDA and the state government for the protection of the drain. But those instructions are not being followed. The state government said that the land along the drain is of private owners leading to the problem. . The court then directed the state government and JDA to take action in this regard in public interest. Hosp told to pay Rs 40L for negligence Jaipur: State consumer dispute redressal commission had directed a private hospital to pay a compensation of Rs 40 lakh to the family of a deceased patient for medical negligence. In the order passed by S K Jain and Ramphool Gurjar the commission directed the hospital to pay a compensation of Rs 40 lakhs to the kin along with Rs 42, 850 for medical expenses and Rs 25,000 for legal expenses. The amount has to be paid with 9% interest from September 4, 2017. The order was passed on a petition by son Vikram Singh. The commission said deceased Kusum Yadav, a resident of Ahmedpur under Tehsil Malakheda in Alwar district, went to see Dr Vijaypal Singh of Vijay hospital on September 7, 2015 with complaints of stomach pain. After sonography it was found that she is having stones in gallbladder. She was advised to have the operation. The doctor conducted the operation on the same day by administering anaesthesia himself without a specialist. The doctor also had not ensured that the patient was on an empty stomach to administer anesthesia and performed the operation. After the operation the patient suffered from many complications and she died on the next day. The hospital had no ICU facility and despite the patient's condition worsened the doctor did not advise advanced medical care by referring to another hospital. Dausa Collector summoned with bailable warrant of Rs 25,000 in contempt case Jaipur: The HC has summoned the Dausa collector with a bailable warrant for not complying with the order to remove the encroachment from the way of the cremation ground. Despite the service of notice in the contempt petition, the district collector did not present his side. Expressing their displeasure, Justice MM Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani have summoned the Dausa Collector with a bailable warrant of Rs 25,000 and ordered to appear in person on December 15. Remove encroachment from Mansarovar metro station to RIICO flyover Jaipur: Encroachment will have to be removed from Mansarovar metro station to RIICO flyover on New Sanganer road. The Rajasthan High Court dismissed the petition filed for review of the earlier order. The court said that the order does not deal with the issue of width of the road but pertains to the encroachment on it. Whether the width of the road is 200 feet or not the issue pertains to removal of the identified encroachments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-seeks-report-on-kartarpura-drain/articleshow/87898709.cms||---

The ministers and the MLAs said that the welfare initiatives have helped these communities to withstand the Covid-19 crisis, besides getting due representation in political and nominated posts. Minister Viswaroop said that the whole world was hit by Covid-19 as people had no work to make a living across the world due to lockdown. It was during this crisis, the chief minister’s initiative of direct cash transfer to the beneficiaries had helped thousands of these families to survive. “There would have been starvation deaths had there not been this direct cash transfer programme of the chief minister,” said the minister. Ruling party MLA TJR Sudhakar Babu said that the money given to the poor through various schemes had helped them survive this critical period. “The money given to these poorer sections would come back to the market keeping the state economy active and vibrant,” the legislator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/assembly-debates-sc-st-welfare-initiatives/articleshow/87897267.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kochi||Kerala vulnerable to cloud-burst events: Study||Kochi: Kerala is under the threat of enhanced deep convection and cloud-burst type extreme events, said a study presented at the ongoing climate change conference Intromet-21 being hosted by Cochin University and Indian meteorological society. The southeast Arabian Sea surrounding the Kerala coasts suffer from enhanced deep atmospheric convection (vertical transfer of heat and moisture) resulting from unprecedented warming of the surface waters, points out the results of a combined study conducted by a group of scientists including Prof Brian Mapes of Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Miami, Florida, USA and Abhilash S, director, Advanced Centre for Atmospheric Radar Research, Cusat. The study said that compared to the 1980s, the warming of the SE Arabian Sea has exceeded by more than 1C, surpassing the maximum sea surface temperature of 29C in 1980s to greater than 30C in 2020s. The warming in SE Arabian Sea is about 1.5 times that of the rest of the world’s oceans. This has huge consequences in the form of increased frequency of deep (cumulonimbus) clouds even during monsoon, leading to very heavy to extreme rainfall and cloud-burst type events. There is cause for concern as it indicates that the warming in the SE Arabian Sea has paralleled the warming of the west-Pacific where the frequency of severe typhoons (cyclones) is on the higher end, globally. The warming has been responsible for the recent extremes and subsequent landslides Kerala has witnessed since 2018. Delivering a talk in the plenary session, Andrew Turner of UK’s University of Reading, who spoke on ‘The effects of climate change on global and regional monsoons’, said that the IPCC report points out that the basic pattern of ‘wet getting wetter’ although there is a large uncertainty in climate model simulations. While the intensity of rainfall will increase on land, the regional monsoons like the south Asian monsoon will weaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-vulnerable-to-cloud-burst-events-study/articleshow/87898070.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 92 lakh people skip second Covid vaccine dose, list shared with district collectors||PUNE: Nearly 92.5 lakh people due for the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines were yet to take it in Maharashtra, said the latest data of the state public health department issued on November 22. As many as 77 lakh people gave the second shot of Covishield a miss on the due date and another 15 lakh are yet to take the second dose of Covaxin, showed the data. Health officials on Wednesday said all collectors have been directed to ensure that these citizens take their second jab immediately under the ongoing Har Ghar Dastak drive. The list of overdue beneficiaries has been shared with them.The eligible beneficiaries either delayed the second shot for some reasons after completing the required time gap between the two doses or simply skipped it. Laxity on the part of citizens and some misconceptions could have led to it, stressed experts. People not taking the second shot on the scheduled due date are considered as the beneficiaries skipping it. When people in this category take the second dose (any time after the due date), they are added to the list of fully vaccinated people. The beneficiaries taking the two shots in two different cities or states are also considered as completely vaccinated. About 39% of the eligible population in the state have taken both doses of the Covid vaccines so far. About 78% beneficiaries have been administered the first shot in Maharashtra. During the Diwali holidays, many citizens had travelled out of the state. A section of them either forgot or did not bother to take their second dose of Covid vaccines after noticing a decline in cases, said a senior health official. “We have to try and motivate these beneficiaries to ensure that they take their second dose at the earliest. The state has enough vaccines and citizens should not delay their second dose,” the official said, adding that calls were being made and special camps were being organised for such people in most districts. Former state health director and public health expert Dr P P Doke told TOI that immunisation against Covid-19 was complete only if both the doses were taken. “There is a certain complacency among the public regarding taking the second dose. One should remember that the first dose primes the body and the second shot helps in the development of antibodies. So people cannot afford to ignore the second dose,” he said. Some health experts said there was reluctance among a section, and counselling could help. “Reaching out to people at their homes with the list will help. Single dose alone will not help because the second dose is needed for greater protection against hospitalisation and death,” said a health expert. As many as 12 crore eligible beneficiaries of Covid-19 vaccines in the country were due for their second dose but had not taken it, the central government had said recently. According to officials, over 80% of the eligible population in the country has received the first dose of the vaccines, while only 41% have been fully inoculated. In an advisory, the health ministers of all the states have been directed to ensure that all the adult beneficiaries are covered with the first dose of vaccines during the existing door-to-door campaign. Those due for the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines should be motivated to take it at sites close to their houses, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/92l-people-skip-2nd-dose-list-shared-with-district-collectors/articleshow/87898065.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Rahman has a congenital heart condition, aortic regurgitation, for which he was being treated at AIIMS before he was arrested. The PhD scholar was arrested last year in October with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others while on his way to Hathras to meet the family of a Dalit woman who had been gang-raped and murdered. He was charged with sedition and under UAPA. The HC has also asked jail authorities to produce a fresh medical report regarding his treatment by the next date of hearing on Thursday. While hearing the habeas corpus petition, the double bench of justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and justice Subhash Vidyarthi, stated that despite repeated orders passed by a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Lucknow on September 23 and October 12, which have been brought on record in this case, adequate medical facility had not been provided to Rahman till date. Advocate SFA Naqvi, representing Rahman, informed the court that his client was suffering from a serious heart disease. "His proper treatment is possible in AIIMS, New Delhi, but no action was taken by the state government on several applications seeking his admission to that hospital," he said. Mathura jail superintendent Brijesh Kumar, told TOI that Rahman has been taken to AIIMS for treatment guarded by six police personnel after the state government approved the funds for the required surgery. Rahman was being taken to the PMLA court for a hearing on September 22 when he fell ill. He was taken to a primary health centre, from where he was sent to the district hospital in Agra and then to SN Medical College in the same city. Doctors there referred him to a higher centre — SGPGI in Lucknow or AIIMS in Delhi. But authorities took him back to jail instead. Later, jail authorities approved his check-up at AIIMS and he was taken to the centre but brought back again. The 26-year-old's lawyer in Mathura, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, said that after a prolonged struggle, the state government has finally given the required medical attention to Rahman. He added that he deserves bail on medical grounds.

---||Nagpur||After online classes, why offline exams, ask Maha college students||Nagpur: A section of students under the aegis of Maharashtra Students Welfare Association (MSWA) has rushed a letter to state minister for higher and technical education, Uday Samant, requesting him to direct the government-run universities to offer online and offline options for forthcoming winter examinations. Following reopening of colleges in the state, some universities have announced to conduct papers in offline mode. Miffed over the declaration, students pointed out to the minister that most of them are unvaccinated and the threat of coronavirus prevails. They also opposed the government’s decision to start offline teaching, pointing out that even many teachers are unvaccinated or have taken only the first shot so far and, therefore, “posed a threat of spreading Covid-19”.Students, especially from Amravati, Pune and Kolhapur universities, have voiced their concerns on social media. According to them, when classes were held online, “why is the insistence on holding papers in offline mode that may risk their lives”. “Cases are still being detected though in small numbers. Not all examinees are vaccinated with double doses. In such circumstances, there is no point in taking the risk. We will launch agitation if offline exams are made mandatory. Even our parents are not ready to send us to exam centres,” they said.The students cited newspaper reports about Amravati, Pune and Kolhapur universities conducting offline exams from next month. “They have made it mandatory for the examinees to appear in offline format. In view of the Covid-19 threat, we request the minister to offer a hybrid model of exams so that those who want to appear online should be able to do it,” MSWA president Vaibhav Edke told TOI.Edke said that outstation students would be immensely benefited with the online facility because hostels are yet to reopen. “A majority of poor students can not afford the rent needed to be paid outside in absence of hostels and food mess. Instead of taking the risk of using public transport to the exam centres, they can easily appear for the papers from safety of their homes,” he said.Nagpur University would be conducting theory papers from December 1 in both online and offline mode.  # Major demands * Same pattern of examinations across all universities in Maharashtra* Option of online and offline mode of exam as per convenience of students* Ensure 100% vaccination of all students and teachers in colleges* Avoid holding offline exams until target is achieved* Clean hostels used for Covid patients before inviting students* All universities must declare their timetable at the earliest||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-online-classes-why-offline-exams-ask-maha-college-students/articleshow/87896411.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The interest accrued on this deposit is paid to the kin. In case of permanent disability, Rs3 lakh is granted.A similar proposal has been submitted to the state government by the forest department on September 9, 2020, but it has not been considered yet. Now, Patil has demanded to revise the proposal by increasing the deposit amount from present Rs25 lakh to Rs1 crore, and in case of permanent disability, Rs50 lakh be paid instead of Rs3 lakh.The sanghatana has threatened to stop work and launch a strike in front of the PCCF office if the demand is not met by the state government. The issue has been specifically raised after woman forest guard Swati Dhumne died in a tiger attack in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) on November 20.Under the scheme, the amount of fixed deposit cannot be withdrawn till 10 years. On September 18, 2012, state allowed to withdraw the money in exceptional cases.Patil asked why the scheme is not being implemented for forest personnel. As per the GR issued on September 22, 2008, the Maharashtra government announced its forest policy. One of the clauses (3.3.13) states, “If any forest officer/employee dies or attains disability while attending the call of the duty, such employees and officials will be paid compensation package as per the existing policy in the police department.”Considering the state forest policy and existing scheme prevailing in the police department, the forest department sent a proposal to the government but it is gathering dust.Patil said forest field staff move into the forest without any safety measures and are true protectors of the huge environmental assets that fight against climate. The state should immediately approve the proposal.As per the home ministry GR issued on June 1, 2011, there is a provision that if any officer/employee dies while on duty, the last salary he was drawing should be paid next to his kin till the date the deceased employee was to retire. Besides, the payment of salary should be enhanced as per the time-bound promotions the deceased employee/officer was supposed to get during his service period. Over the last few years, there is a spurt in attacks on foresters by poachers, encroachers, timber wood smugglers. Besides, foresters are also vulnerable to wild animal attacks during patrolling and extinguishing forest fires.According to an application filed by Kishor Rithe, member, Nature Conservation Society Amravati (NCSA), in the Supreme Court, from 1987 to 2020, in Maharashtra alone, 656 foresters have been attacked causing the death of 19 of them. The situation in other states like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is even worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/declare-foresters-dying-on-field-duty-as-van-shahids/articleshow/87896407.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

It must immediately withdraw the circular in force. Although the cabinet has taken the decision, it is not clear when it will be implemented. The election code of conduct can come into force at any time,” Mohandas Lolienkar, general secretary, GFP told reporters. Lolienkar said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has taken the decision with an eye on elections. “If the government was really sincerely, it would have told the high court that it was reintroducing the scheme,” he said. After government revoked the benefit of the low interest housing scheme about a year ago, several employees challenged the decision in the high court of Bombay at Goa. The sudden withdrawal of the scheme had left government employees in the lurch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-govt-is-sincere-it-must-revoke-previous-circular/articleshow/87898068.cms||---

The high court was hearing two PILs filed by Ajay Tiwari and Shweta Burbure, through counsel M Anil Kumar, and Swachha Foundation secretary Sharad Paliwal, through lawyer Ritesh Tahaliyani. According to the petitioners, the government is yet to constitute the tree authority, whose permission is needed if the number of trees to be felled exceeds 200 at Ajni Vann. The petitioners contended that National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the nodal agency to execute Inter Modal Station (IMS) project at Ajni Vann, has claimed that out of the 7,000 trees in the area, only 1,940 will be cut while the Nagpur Municipal Corporation has put the number at 4,930. The petitioners also raised doubts about the success of relocation of trees and claimed that all previous experiments yielded mixed results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reply-in-6-weeks-on-setting-up-tree-authority-hc-to-govt/articleshow/87896428.cms||---

The action in city followed a similar operation by FDA team in Thane a day before where ‘Myfair cream’ worth around Rs10 lakh was seized.The FDA is learnt to have cracked the whip on ‘Myfair cream’, a product by Zee Laboratories Limited, for its contravention of Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945 and Schedule J, which specifies the list of diseases or ailments which a drug may not be able to cure or prevent, including fairness of the skin. Schedule J has list of 51 types of conditions and ailments like AIDS, impotency, increasing brain functioning, insanity, epileptic fits, forms and structure of breasts, size and shape of male sex organ, hernia, goitre and so on, which a drug may not be able to cure or prevent. Any claims to cure or eradicate such diseases or conditions included in the Schedule J is a breach of law and liable for action, said an FDA official.In Nagpur, the action was initiated by drug inspector Maneesh Choudhari under the supervision of joint commissioner Viraj Paunikar. Around 35-40 cartons of ‘Myfair cream’ were seized from the godown.Assistant commissioner, FDA, PM Ballal, said the concerned fairness cream has Schedule H contents, which must be strictly sold under prescription of registered medical practitioners, but the product was being picked up from shops at random by even school-going students in rural areas as a cosmetic cream, which it is not. “Manufacturers advertise the product as an agent which can turn one fairer. This is misleading information and hence attracts penal provisions,” said Ballal, adding samples would be sent to FDA headquarters in Mumbai for further action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fairness-cream-worth-rs33l-seized-for-unfair-promises/articleshow/87896425.cms||Soumitra Bose

Dollu coveys how urbanisation has been affecting indigenous folk art forms like Kunitha, a folk-dance form of Karnataka, slowly vanishing. Asserting that urbanisation is a global issue, Puranik said that over the years, there has been a steady stream of migration from Karnataka’s rural areas to big cities as people seek improved standards of living. “But while doing so, we should make sure that we do not forget our roots,” he added. He, however, remains firm that no art can vanish in a jiffy. “There are thousands of people who are striving hard to keep them alive. Maybe the popularity is going down because the youth are notpaying attention to it. Through the film, we wanted to give the message that art has norules and it is not defined by the constructs of the society,” he said. Sharing how it was another challenge to ready the cast to be compatible with the film, Puranik said that his team trained professional drum-dancers to act and professional actors to dance. “It was excruciating for them, but the results are for there for everyone to see,” he said. Dollu had its first public screening in the USA at the Caleidoscope Indian Film Festival Boston and has just been awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke award 2021 (MSK Trust) for Best Kannada Film at the Innovative International Film Festival. Paying tribute to Late Kannada Superstar Puneeth Rajkumar, Puranik said that Rajkumar was a veritable pillar of the Kannada film industry. “He was very close to our team and it is an unbearable loss.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/urbanisation-affecting-indigenous-folk-art-forms/articleshow/87898072.cms||---

The deceased, identified as Rimjhim Chaturvedi, was a native of Buxar and had a beauty parlour on Boring Road in Patna. Her husband, Vishwajit Chaturvedi, is a dentist at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh. She lived with her 14-year-old son in a flat at Krishna Kunj Apartment on Sahdeo Mahto Marg under the S K Puri police station area in the state capital. Police recovered her body from a secluded place near Punpun dam under the Naubatpur police station area at around 9am on Wednesday. Rimjhim was traceless since Tuesday evening and her family members had lodged a complaint with the S K Puri police station at around 11am on Wednesday when they failed to locate her. Phulwarisharif SDPO Maneesh Kumar Sinha said she had left her parlour at around 3pm on Tuesday. Technical investigation indicates that she was murdered around 4.30pm on Tuesday. “She reached Naubatpur via AIIMS-Patna while continuously talking to a person on phone. It is yet not clear in which vehicle she went and if she was alone or someone accompanied her,” he said. Sinha said she had one bullet injury near her temple and another in the abdomen. “She was killed where her body has been recovered as clotted blood was found on the ground there. A live cartridge was also recovered. Her two cellphones were switched off at the same location at around 4.30pm,” he said. Sinha said she might have been allured to Naubatpur for land purchase. He said Vishwajit and his father, who is also a dentist, run a well settled dental establishment in Ghazipur. “They had a love marriage and cordial relationship. Vishwajit, who reached Patna, was interrogated. He used to visit Rimjhim fortnightly or monthly,” the SDPO said. When contacted, City SP (West) Ashok Mishra told TOI that the murder is seems to be fallout of revenge killing or love affair. He said Rimjhim had her ornaments present on her body. He said initial investigation reveals that she had gone to Naubatpur on her own after being called by someone. S K Puri police station sub-inspector, who responded on the SHO’s official cellphone number, said Rimjhim’s brother-in-law Brajesh Kumar submitted her missing complaint at around 10.30am on Wednesday. “By 11am, we received information about a body recovered in Naubatpur with the description which matched with Rimjhim as per her family members, who went there and identified her,” he said. Police said Brajesh is married to Rimjhim’s sister and they live in Vijay Nagar under the Rupaspur police station area in Patna. Vishwajit had studied at Buddha Dental College in Patna and Rimjhim was his elder brother’s sister-in-law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bullet-riddled-body-of-dentists-wife-found-in-naubatpur/articleshow/87898091.cms||Debashish Karmakar

A Nigdi police team, led by senior inspector Ganesh Jawadwad, arrested the engineer from Akurdi after a tip-off. Her accomplice was taken into custody later, said Manchak Ipper, the deputy commissioner of Pimpri Chinchwad police. “We have found Aadhaar cards, school leaving certificates, marksheets of those duped from Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Solapur and Mumbai. Three victims informed the police that the duo had taken a total of Rs 18.7 lakh from them and duped them,” Ipper said. Assistant inspector Amol Korde of the Nigdi police told TOI that recently a beautician from Nigdi filed a complaint with the police stating that a woman, working as TTE, had taken Rs 8.5 lakh from her on the promise of helping her and her brother get a TTE job with the Indian Railways. “As the woman was constantly changing her addresses, we gathered information on her and one day when she had come to Akurdi we got hold of her,” Korde said. He said the police have recovered two black blazers, a fake badge, identity card and a name plate from her. “During the questioning, the accused said she had duped a woman four years ago and now that woman has joined her too in duping other people. We have arrested the second woman too,” Korde said. He said the probe revealed that after completing the diploma, the woman did not take up any job. She rather chose to dupe people by posing as a TTE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-women-dupe-20-promising-railways-job-held/articleshow/87898073.cms||---

---||Goa||I have complete trust in my young players, they will all come good: Juan Ferrando||Panaji: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando is not the one to give up on his players too easily. Last season, for example, Dheeraj Singh faltered on his debut for FC Goa and looked uncomfortable with the ball at his feet when he made the switch from ATK Mohun Bagan. Ferrando, though, kept the faith and the goalkeeper simply got better, even making it to AFC Champions League all-star match day squads. The Spanish coach started this season with a back-four that did raise eyebrows. Between Sanson Pereira, Leander D’Cunha and debutant Papuia, they had played just two matches in the Indian Super League (ISL) and appeared to struggle to contain Mumbai City. Goa eventually lost 3-0 but Ferrando’s faith in his players is strong as ever. “To be honest, I trust Leander, I trust Papuia and I trust Sanson. Of course, they don’t have a lot of experience, but they can only get that experience when you play,” said Ferrando. The defensive trio had done well to win Goa the Durand Cup and were first-choice during the friendlies against Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC. They were found wanting in the ISL opener, but the coach has been left in no doubt that they can be Goa’s mainstays for the future. “I understand the talk about the lack of experience. But for me, as head coach, my most important job is to help them. They are our future. We have to do more work and then give them more chances to improve. “Of course, we lost, and I don’t want to give an excuse for that. You can say that my plan was not a success, but I trust these players. If FC Goa needs these players, I can use them. “If there remain faults, it’s the fault of the head coach. If there are individual mistakes, we have to see how we can work with them in training and overcome them. They are good players, they have talent, but they need time,” said Ferrando. The Spanish coach has stayed true to his promise to the club that he will not just win games but also develop players. He has now taken more youngsters under his wings and believes they will come good, sooner rather than later. “It’s not always easy to be in the starting line-up. You cannot have immediate success. Trust these players and we keep on working,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-have-complete-trust-in-my-young-players-they-will-all-come-good-juan-ferrando/articleshow/87918720.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The work commenced from Pirachi Kond, and a total of three houses were demolished on the first day of the operation as per the order of the district collector that was carried out with the assistance of the construction removal squad. These are among the 18 structures listed for demolition as they are located along the proposed alignment for the new road. There was no resistance to the demolition operation. However, some house owners were caught unawares. Some families had to rush to neighbouring houses for shelter, while other citizens had to face acute hardships while shifting the household items due to the unseasonal rain. One of the occupants, Khushali Salelkar had to be shifted to Bicholim community health centre after feeling uneasy. Kunjmol Thomas, a widow, complained that the administation began the demolition process without giving prior intimation. Work on the state highway from Mapusa to Khandepar via Bicholim is under way. A total of 18 structures, including houses and buildings from Pirachi Kond-Vathadev under the jurisdiction of Karapur-Sarvan panchayat will be demolished for the new road. The demolition process had started last year in May. A demolition squad had arrived at the site along with machinery to commence the operation. However, local MLA Praveen Zantye had intervened and requested chief minister Pramod Sawant to postpone the demolition. Subsequently, the district collector had ordered the house owners to vacate their premises by October 15 to undertake the demolition process. However, some house owners had requested Sawant not to undertake the demolition process until the issue of migration is resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vathadev-home-owners-caught-unawares-as-officials-begin-demolition-of-structures-for-road/articleshow/87898082.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Government schools to house kindergarten classes soon||Coimbatore: The school education department is all set to introduce kindergarten classes in all government schools that have Class I at the entry level. The move is expected to help government schools withstand the challenge posed by private CBSE schools and retain students by preventing migration.Kindergarten classes in government schools would considerably lessen financial burden on the parents, who could easily enrol their wards to a school in their neighbourhood, an official source said. In 2019, more than 2,300 anganwadi centres operating on government middle school campuses were allowed to start kindergarten classes. Following this, 122 government middle schools in the district had started kindergarten classes.Teachers said there was a general perception that the government school students were weak in spoken English. “The move to introduce kindergarten classes in government schools will enhance the English language proficiency of students with appropriate training at the entry level. This will also improve the prospects of government schools in terms of admission to Class I, as most parents are likely to retain their wards in the same schools where they had enrolled their children to kindergarten classes,” one of the teachers said.A senior school education department official said the lack of kindergarten classes in government schools had an impact on the admissions as well. “Parents were preferring private schools as kindergarten classes offer a foundation for their wards before they enter Class I. Select government schools were allowed to start kindergarten classes in 2019 and it may now be extended to all the schools with primary classes.” Pointing out that many government and aided primary schools were unofficially running kindergarten classes by employing temporary teachers, headmaster of an aided school said they could now regularise the classes. “Since there are surplus teachers in aided and government primary schools, they could be redeployed to schools that will have kindergarten classes.”However, there are concerns over redeploying the surplus teachers. “The kindergarten classes are in English medium. Teachers to be redeployed from other classes may not be fluent in English and they may have the required skill to handle children below the age of five years,” said headmistress of a corporation school at Town Hall. “Therefore, regular workshops and orientation classes are essential before the teachers take up kindergarten classes.” The state government is, meanwhile, yet to take a call on resuming physical classes for kindergarten.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/government-schools-to-house-kindergarten-classes-soon/articleshow/87898093.cms||Sampath Kumar

The report also suggested that there must be common policies for online and offline retail sectors.It recommended that the government not ban sales and discounts as they are used as marketing tools. “Discounts & flash sales are one of the major reasons that attract consumers to e-commerce platforms and enable them to buy exclusive and high-priced products at the best price. A prohibition on such sales events will stifle competition and deprive consumers of the best price …,” the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/isb-roots-for-simplification-of-e-comm-retail-norms/articleshow/87898667.cms||---

It took about 200 days to restore the ‘Gachi-baoli’ (meaning lime-well) by clearing the debris in the well, installing aquifers for water restoration and developing the site to make the well accessible to people. The well with its volume of 30,00,000 litres will now benefit the members of mosque, schools, residential and community area nearby as well as help in landscape irrigation and storage. “Restoring, preserving and bringing a heritage structure back to shape is not just a great initiative but it’s fulfilling for every human being,” said MA&UD special chief secretary, Arvind Kumar who was the chief guest at the event. CHIREC International School is the funder and The Rainwater Project and SAHE are the implementers who took the responsibility of restoring this heritage structure. “It is high time we as individuals and as community start taking responsibility of not just saving water as much as we can but join hands for restoration of our water resources,” said Kalpana Ramesh, CEO of The Rainwater Project. Chairman of Telangana Water Resources Development Corporation, V Prakash Rao, said that Hyderabad has always been famous for its baolis (wells) and baghs (gardens). “Restoring them will help us revive the city’s historical significance and will bring us closer to giving back to nature,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/200-yr-old-stepwell-springs-back-to-life/articleshow/87898657.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: November Covid deaths lowest in year, 15 districts had no fatalities||MUMBAI: Fifteen districts in the state have not recorded a single Covid-19 death so far in November. The month has also seen a considerable decline in fatalities and so far is the lowest monthly toll this year. Nine districts — Akola, Amravati, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Nagpur, Bhandara, Buldhana, Yavatmal and Washim — are from Vidarbha. This region was the first to be hit by the second wave driven by the Delta variant. It is said the first Delta case was isolated from Amravati, although experts say the origin cannot be pinpointed. The remaining districts of the region, Chandrapur and Wardha, have recorded two and one fatalities each. Three districts from northern Maharashtra, including Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon, and two from Marathwada, Hingoli and Nanded, also didn’t record any Covid deaths. From the Konkan belt, Palghar is the only district to not report casualties. A state official said some of these districts are not densely populated and have less urban population that is working to their advantage. This month, Maharashtra has reported 591 Covid deaths, a drop from 1,013 in October and 1,645 in September. As the second wave hit, deaths started to increase from March as it shot up to 6,070 from 1,463 in February. April and May were the deadliest months with Covid claiming 29,551 and 28,664 lives, respectively. Dhule and Bhandara haven’t recorded any deaths since April and June, respectively. Nandurbar and Washim would soon be completing 90 days of no Covid deaths. A state analysis till November 16 showed that the majority of the deaths are now concentrated in six districts. Mumbai had the highest deaths (49), followed by Ahmednagar (46), Satara (25), Pune (23), Raigad (14) and Thane (14). Another 14 districts reported deaths but in single digits. Zero deaths shouldn’t push them into complacency, cautioned Dr Shubhash Salunkhe, a member of the national Covid task force. “This is a good sign, but we cannot afford to slow testing or surveillance at any cost. Maharashtra was testing up to 3 lakh but now it’s down to one lakh,” he said. On Wednesday, Covid fatalities in the state rose to 41, the highest in 11 days, though new case detections remained under 1,000 (960). The city added 251 cases and four deaths.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra worried as 92 lakh people skip 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine||PUNE: Nearly 92.5 lakh people due for the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines were yet to take it in Maharashtra, according to the latest data of the state health department issued on November 22. As many as 77 lakh people gave the second shot of Covishield a miss on the due date and another 15 lakh are yet to take the second dose of Covaxin, showed the data. Health officials on Wednesday said all collectors have been directed to ensure that these citizens take their second jab immediately under the ongoing Har Ghar Dastak drive. The list of overdue beneficiaries has been shared with them. Second Covid vaccine dose critical for development of antibodies, says expertImmunisation against Covid-19 was complete only if both the doses were taken, former state health director and public health expert Dr P P Doke told TOI. “There is a certain complacency among the public regarding taking the second dose. One should remember that the first dose primes the body and the second shot helps in the development of antibodies. So people cannot afford to ignore the second dose,” he said. The eligible beneficiaries either delayed the second shot for some reasons after completing the required time gap between the two doses or simply skipped it. Laxity on the part of citizens and some misconceptions could have led to it, stressed experts. People not taking the second shot on the scheduled due date are considered as the beneficiaries skipping it. When people in this category take the second dose (any time after the due date), they are added to the list of fully vaccinated people. The beneficiaries taking the two shots in two different cities or states are also considered as completely vaccinated. About 39% of the eligible population in the state have taken both doses of the Covid vaccines so far. About 78% beneficiaries have been administered the first shot in Maharashtra. During the Diwali holidays, many citizens had travelled out of the state. A section of them either forgot or did not bother to take their second dose after noticing a decline in cases, said a senior health official. “We have to try and motivate these beneficiaries to ensure that they take their second dose at the earliest. The state has enough vaccines and citizens should not delay their second dose,” the official said, adding that calls were being made and special camps were being organised for such people in most districts. Some health experts said there was reluctance among a section, and counselling could help. “Reaching out to people at their homes with the list will help. Single dose alone will not help because the second dose is needed for greater protection against hospitalisation and death,” said a health expert. As many as 12 crore eligible beneficiaries in the country were due for their second dose but had not taken it, the Centre had said recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-second-vax-dose-critical-for-devpt-of-antibodies-says-expert/articleshow/87898107.cms||Nisha Nambiar

We did not know whom to approach and how to get our money back,” Rahul, a final year student at College of Law, KL Deemed-to-be-University told TOI. The app, developed by Rahul and his friends, is not the only initiative in his plans to help victims of cyber crime. The law student also intends to provide to legal aid to victims of cyber crime and internships to students interested in the subject. “We realised that many lost their money, like us, during the pandemic and did not know what needs to be done. This experience motivated me to start an app to provide all required information to victims,” Rahul said. He added that while he was unsuccessful in getting his money back, he managed to help a relative who lost Rs 80,000 and a friend who lost Rs 10,000, in retrieving the money, with the help of officials.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: After Covid lull in rentals, co-living spaces now a hit||HYDERABAD: As more offices prepare to open their physical premises, there’s a growing demand for a new form of housing in town – co-living. Though limited to a handful in Hyderabad at present, these spaces have already become a hit with mid-level executives eyeing a furnished one-bedroom home. The cost: Anywhere between Rs 11,000 & Rs 20,000 per month. Post a lull during Covid-19, owners of these facilities say they are now swamped with calls from outstation professionals — IT professionals, doctors, pilots, banking sector employees — asked to report to office in the next few months. “Many large companies have told their workforce to come back by the first quarter of 2022. Worried that they might not get a seat later, a lot of people have started paying a booking fee to block their rooms,” said Moonis Ali, founder of Living Quarters, that has a presence in five locations across Financial District and Gachibowli. The concept of co-living, Ali explains, entails providing housing to the working class along with a community of like-minded people who they can socialise and network with. Driven by this increased interest in Hyderabad, Bengaluru-based Settl, too has turned its focus to the Telangana capital. After its Madhapur property, it’s adding a second co-living space in Gachibowli now and is certain to expand its footprint further in the future. Realising the potential of the market, founder of Sensation Group, Bhavishya Gupta, has planned a 4,000 bed co-living project in Hyderabad – expected to come up in the next three to four years. “We will have three facilities in and around Financial District,” said Gupta who believes this is the way ahead for the housing sector. “This new-age form of hostels is sure to find many takers because of three reasons – sense of community it offers, availability of services (including food) at a subsidised rate and security especially for women,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-covid-lull-in-rentals-co-living-spaces-now-a-hit/articleshow/87898189.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Earlier, he was selected for IPS and even underwent training at the National Police Academy, Hyderabad, before getting selected for IAS in the subsequent attempts. A woman filed a complaint against him charging him with cheating her with a promise of marriage during his NPA training days. The complaint says that he allegedly raped her once at the academy accommodation and pacified her with a promise of marriage. He has been forcing her to submit to his physical pleasures under a threat that any refusal from her would result in the cancellation of marriage. Later, he started ignoring her after entering into a relationship with one of his female batchmates at Mussorie. His father too threatened her with dire consequences if she did not go away from his son’s life. She is now feeling a threat to her life also, the complaint says. “Even police are asking me to go for a compromise,” she said.

All girls of a marriageable age, states the chargesheet. Police told the court that one of the key accused, Mohammad Umar Gautam, a resident of Delhi, had converted ‘100 to 200 Hindu girls and married them off.’ The 1,860-page chargesheet states that the accused — managing trustee of Afmi Charitable Trust and his aides — got foreign funds through hawala and illegally diverted these for proselytization purposes, building mosques and providing legal help to the protestors and rioters of the anti-CAA stir held in Delhi after the 2020 riots. Gautam, a close aide of main accused Salauddin Sheikh, managing trustee of Afmi Charitable Trust, had also converted nearly 1,000 people of different faiths using the trust’s funds, the chargesheet said. Those who were converted included around 10 speech and hearing impaired people, said assistant commissioner of police (crime), Vadodara, DS Chauhan said. While Gautam, Sheikh and Mohammad Mansoori have already been arrested, the police have shown London-based Abdulla Fefdawala, a native of Gujarat’s Bharuch district, and UAE resident Mustafa Thanawala, originally from Mumbai, as absconders. Gautam was nabbed by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) in June on charges of fraudulently converting people. Later, the UP ATS also arrested Gautam’s aide Sheikh from Vadodara for his involvement in diverting funds of the Afmi trust for conversions and other purposes. In August this year, Vadodara special operations group (SOG) had registered a separate FIR against Sheikh, Gautam and others on charges of promoting enmity between different communities, forgery and criminal conspiracy under sections IPC sections 153-A, 465 and 120-b, said police in the statement. The cops earlier took custody of both Sheikh and Gautam from the UP ATS and brought them to the city. The accused duo are currently in judicial custody. Sheikh was accused of using Afmi Trust’s FCRA account to receive Rs 19.03 crore from foreign donors during the last seven years. With the help of UAE-based Thanawala, Sheikh received another Rs 60 crore through hawala and ‘angadia’ channels, it said. Sheikh sent nearly Rs 60 crore to Gautam and others to facilitate conversion of people of other faiths in different parts of the country and to carry out other activities, including building mosques, the charge-sheet added. At the behest of Fefdawala, who had also sent funds to Shaikh, Rs 65 lakh was dispatched to their Delhi-based connections to provide legal help to anti-CAA protesters and rioters apprehended by the police in the national capital, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/100-200-girls-converted-to-different-faith-chargesheet/articleshow/87897152.cms||---

The SDG framework scrutinized 14 goals by analysing relevant data of participating cities sourced from Union ministries, the national crime record bureau (NCRB) and the national family health survey (NFHS). The framework consists of 56 urban local bodies and 77 indicators.Out of the 56 cities, Shimla topped the index with 75.5 points followed by Coimbatore, and Chandigarh with 72.36 points.SDGs encompass key development sectors including education, health, sanitation, employment, infrastructure, energy and environment. Marks were tabulated separately for each sector including clean water and sanitation, gender equality, economic growth, peace, justice and strong institutions. While Coimbatore scored well in poverty reduction, quality education, good health and well-being, industry, innovation and infrastructure, peace, justice and strong institutions, it faced challenges in clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, reduced inequality, decent work and economic growth and sustainable consumption and production. The city was ranked at 38 of the 56 cities with a score of 67 out of 100 in the clean water and sanitation category. In the affordable and clean energy parameter, the city was ranked at 33rd, indicating that much needs to be done.The data for the sanitation category was taken from the cleanliness ranking, where the city did not do well, a corporation official said. “We have launched works to make the city cleaner and more hygienic. It will reflect in the next cleanliness survey,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-adjudged-2nd-best-city-in-niti-aayogs-urban-index/articleshow/87898103.cms||V Devanathan

She had informed the school principal about the incident, but no action was taken against the teacher. Further, the girl was made to feel that she is responsible for the incident. Subsequently, she hung herself.Had the school acted on the victim’s complaint, her life could have been saved, Coimbatore CEO N Geetha said. “But the principal tried to hide the incident, fearing that the reputation of the school would be harmed,” she said. “It was decided that teachers and students in all schools, especially private schools, will be educated on child sexual abuse and ways to prevent themselves from falling victims. The orientation sessions will be a continuous process by inviting various resource persons so that teachers and students are adequately educated.”In the meeting, the CEOs were also asked to be aware of the legal aspects of handling such cases. The child protection unit and the police are the competent agencies to investigate child sexual abuse cases. They should only inform the department of the happenings and allow the appropriate people to conduct inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stop-hiding-incidents-of-child-sexual-abuse-edu-dept-tells-schools/articleshow/87898097.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Poor air raises COPD risk in non-smokers||Lucknow: For the last five years, poor air quality due to high pollution levels has emerged as a major contributor to the rising number of non-smokers contracting respiratory disseases. According to experts, in some cases, it not only leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), but also asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and lung cancer. With the start of winter season, the city is recording a rise in air pollution levels with the Air Quality Index (AQI) being constantly in poor or very poor category for the last one month. As a result, the footfall of patients with respiratory distress in hospitals has increased. As November is also observed as Lung Cancer Awareness Month, TOI spoke to experts who said though smoking is the biggest contributor to COPD, the proportion of non-smokers with the disease has witnessed a rise of at least 20% in the last five years. Earlier, non-smokers used to be about 5-10% of total COPD patients, but the share has gone up to 25-45%. Director of medical education and head of pulmonary medicine department at Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital, Prof Rajendra Prasad, in his paper published in the Indian Journal of Chest Diseases and Allied Sciences in July 2021, has concluded that 25-45% COPD cases comprise of non-smokers and the major reason is indoor and outdoor bad air quality. The paper is based on several national and international studies published in reputed journals, including the Lancet. “Long-term exposure to smoke generated by various sources like biomass fuel burning, mosquito coils, incense sticks and liquidators, among others, has the potential to cause COPD and other lung diseases. We should minimize activities causing air pollution so that we can save future generations from COPD which accounts for 8 lakh deaths every year in India. It is the second leading cause of death. Now, even youngsters and children are being affected,” said Prof Prasad. Five years ago, around 400 chronic pulmonary patients used to come to KGMU for treatment every week. The number has now reached 480-500. Similarly, at Balrampur and Civil hospitals, the number of weekly COPD patients has increased from 100 to 125 in five years. Likewise, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences has recorded a 15% rise from 90 patients five years ago. Prof Darshan Bajaj of KGMU’s respiratory department said, “Analysis of OPD patients shows that nearly 30-40% are non-smokers who got COPD due to outdoor and indoor air pollution. Five years ago, it was 10-15%.” Prof RAS Kushwaha of KGMU’s respiratory department said, “Tiny particulate matter, which causes air pollution, comprises acids, organic chemicals, metals, soil and dust. It wades through the lungs and enters the bloodstream to cause COPD, lung cancer, asthma and other cardiovascular ailments.” Senior pulmonologist, Balrampur Hospital, Dr Anand Gupta said, “Mixture of solid and liquid that are emitted largely by vehicles (nitrates), power plants, industries (sulfur dioxide) may appear clean as we cannot see these particles, but they all cause lung inflammation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/poor-air-raises-copd-risk-in-non-smokers/articleshow/87898770.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

A private school hostel had reported 12 Covid cases on Tuesday. Reacting to it, Meena said that the schools had reopened following guidelines issued by the Centre. “We took time to reopen the schools. We followed Centre’s guidelines for it and also provided relaxations following it. We have not taken any step other than the Centre’s guidelines. We have received complaints about schools, but it is actually about hostels. We have to investigate if children staying in hostels are following distancing norms or not, or what kind of management do hostels have and present a report,” said Meena. Schools and colleges opened with 100 % capacity in the state on November 15. “Schools will continue to remain open. But collectors, SDMs and education department officials will first examine the facilities at hostels and ensure that the children staying there are following distancing norms. They will examine cleanliness and give NOCs. For hostels, both government or private, we will ask collectors to issue NOCs. For that, we will request the education minister. The schools are functioning well,” Meena said. He said that an investigation was on. “We will first see the investigation report. If schools were negligent, if children came from outside to the hostel or if RT-PCR tests were done or not. All these issues will come out in the report. If we find carelessness, we will certainly take action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hostels-a-concern-but-schoolswill-remain-open-health-min/articleshow/87898764.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Delhi||Centre to repeal Delhi Rent Control Act soon to bring a new law for the capital||NEW DELHI: The central government will soon repeal the Delhi Rent Control Act of 1958 to bring a new rent act for the national capital. The Union Cabinet in June this year had approved a Model Tenancy Act and had asked the states to adopt it. In the case of Delhi, the Union government has to enact the law as land in the national capital is a central subject. Sources said the process has been initiated to repeal the decades old law so that the new law can be enacted. Though officials didn’t divulge about the provisions that the proposed bill will have, going by the government’s stand so far it will be in complete alignment with the Model Act that the Centre has approved. Going by the Model Act, the proposed law won’t impact the old contracts between the landlords and tenants. According to the Model Act, there would be separate rent authorities, courts and tribunals in every district to protect the interests of owners and tenants. The rent and duration of tenancy would be fixed by mutual consent between the landlord and tenant and a written agreement will be mandatory in each case. The Model Act suggests that the security deposit for residential properties won’t be for more than two months’ rent and for commercial properties, it can’t be more than that of six months. For revision of rent, landlords would need to give a written notice three months in advance and the new rent would be on mutual consent. Enough provisions have been suggested to protect landlords. One such example is if a tenant does not vacate the premises after the tenancy expires, the landlord would be entitled to compensation and the amount would be double the monthly rent for two months and four times the monthly rent after that. Similarly, the landlord won’t be allowed to forcefully evict the tenant during the agreed contract period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-to-repeal-delhi-rent-control-act-soon-to-bring-a-new-law-for-the-capital/articleshow/87898766.cms||Dipak K Dash

The bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy said that the stay on the single judge order would be vacated if the state government failed to comply with the order within the stipulated time. Earlier a single judge of the high court directed the state government to pay the dues with 12 per cent annualised interest along with 21 per cent amount kept on withhold by the state government. The state government moved an appeal petition challenging the single judge order. A division bench, after considering the government’s plea, granted stay on the single judge order. The appeal petition once again came for hearing before the Chief Justice’s bench on Wednesday. The counsels representing the petitioners told the HC that they have not received even the principal amount. They sought relief from the high court confining the stay on single judge order to only interest and withheld amount. Considering the arguments of the petitioners, the high court granted four weeks to clear the principal amount in all bills sans they would vacate the stay on single judge order which would result in paying the interest as well as withheld amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-asks-govt-to-clear-all-mgnregs-pending-bills/articleshow/87897343.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Coimbatore||Reduce yarn prices, EPS urges govt||Coimbatore: Former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has urged the state government to take efforts to bring down yarn prices. In a statement issued on Wednesday, EPS said the price of yarn had increased upto Rs 120/kg in the past 10 months and it had a cascading effect on the supply chain affecting the livelihood of thousands of workers dependent on the textile sector. He demanded the government to take steps to prohibit cotton and yarn exports, weed out cotton hoarding, provide subsidy for yarn and urge the Centre at GST council meetings for abolishing 5 % GST for yarn and cotton. The Tirupur garment industry, which enjoys 60% of market share in woven garments in India, is struggling, he said. “They are unable to deliver old orders and receive new orders due to yarn price rise.’’ The ever-busy handloom and powerloom units in Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Namakkal and Salem have gone silent. EPS said the situation was so worse that some weavers were resorting to panic selling of looms as they are unable to get orders. “35 lakh people dependent on textile industries are affected because of yarn price rise.’’ EPS said the previous AIADMK government had given orders worth Rs 490 crore to handloom and powerloom weavers to produce saris and dhotis meant for distribution to ration cardholders during Pongal. “We had provided yarn when orders were placed in July. This government had placed orders only this month. Yarn supply to weavers is also incomplete.” The government, he said, should immediately hold talks with the garment manufacturers, weavers and exporters to resolve the issues plaguing the sector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reduce-yarn-prices-eps-urges-govt/articleshow/87898111.cms||---

While the gap between two doses of Covaxin is 28 days, it is 84 days for Covishield. While 95% of the eligible population has been inoculated with the first dose, only 55% has received the second dose. The civic body has been conducting vaccination camps regularly and mass vaccination camps once a week. Although vaccines are available, the response has come down. “Plenty of doses are available, but response has been low. As of Wednesday, we have 60,000 plus doses and can get 30,000 more doses from rural health officials. The mass vaccination camp held last Thursday had only 9,000 takers from the city,” a health official of the corporation said.“The lukewarm response to the second dose could be due to reducing fear of Covid-19 as the number of cases has come down. While 4,000 to 5,000 tests are conducted daily, only 45 to 55 cases are reported. People who had fever after taking the first dose could hesitate to take the second dose. However, we have observed that those who experienced fever after the first dose don’t experience it after the second dose,” the official said. “Special vaccination camps conducted on Sundays get better response than other days including Saturdays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-5-lakh-people-skip-second-vaccine-dose/articleshow/87898114.cms||V Devanathan

---||Kolkata||KMC to bldrs: Will slap stop-work notice for flouting pollution norm||Kolkata: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has warned real estate developers that it will slap stop-work notices if any project is found to flout pollution norms this winter. The move follows Delhi government’s decision to ban construction and demolition activities after the air quality index worsened. The prohibition was lifted on November 22. While KMC is yet to contemplate a blanket ban on constructions unless the city’s air quality worsens drastically, it has signalled tough steps against errant builders who do not take any measure to check pollution at construction and demolition sites in the city. Construction dust contributes to 12% of pollutants in Kolkata’s air. KMC had in 2019 engaged experts from IIT-Kharagpur and IIEST to suggest ways of minimizing air pollution caused by constructions, especially in winter. Going by their recommendations, the municipal commissioner had issued a circular, making certain portions of KMC buildings rules mandatory for developers and promoters. Buildings department officials in the borough were assigned to look after constructions in their jurisdictions, and were told to especially keep an eye on dumping of construction materials on roads without proper cover. According to the circular, all construction and demolition sites are required to be covered by geotextile fabric that will act as dust barrier and prevent minute particles from spreading into the air. While the minute suspended particulate matters disperse in summer with the rising hot air and gets washed down in monsoon, it hangs low in winter, making the air we breathe in toxic. The sites are also required to be watered to ensure the soil does not turn dry and dusty. Water needs to be added in good quantity when excavation or any other earthmoving activity takes place to keep the soil moist throughtout. The KMC also wants builders to follow environmental management practices while disposing of construction debris. “Debris disposal is often not given due importance. It is a major source of pollution and proper methods need to be followed,” the official said. Though unrelated to air pollution, the SOP also urges builders to ensure sound pollution is not created. “During construction, including cutting of marbles, ambient noise level should not exceed more than 65 decibel,” a civic building department official said. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India’s Bengal chapter president Sushil Mohta said the on-site environment management guidelines had been shared with member companies and most of them adhered to them. “There is greater awareness on pollution among people. We need to manage dust also for the well-being of the workforce at the site,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-bldrs-will-slap-stop-work-notice-for-flouting-pollution-norm/articleshow/87898126.cms||Saikat Ray

Pune student, Chahel Singh, was among the gold medallists. The other team members were Anilesh Bansal from Faridabad, Suren from Hisar, Arhaan Ahmad from Meerut who also won gold medals, and Dhruv Ahlawat from Mumbai who won silver medal. The team was led by A N Ramprakash from Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) and A A Deshpande, a retired professor from Raman Research Institute. Singh said that the competition covered wide range of topics from celestial mechanics, binary stars, extrasolar planets, astronomical telescopes and detectors, to even cosmic rings, but he could negotiate these questions with ease to win the medal. The competition consisted of a five-hour theoretical examination, a three-hour examination on data analysis, two observational examinations (software-based) for about three hours and a team competition for three hours. A statement issued by the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education said the team bagged the second prize in the team competition and was placed in top position in country-wise medal tally. Ramprakash said, “In terms of medals, this was India’s best-ever performance in the Olympiad.

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Education department’s new guidelines to tackle rising Covid cases soon||JAIPUR: Following the rising number of Covid cases reported among students in private schools, the government has been forced to rethink its decision to reopen schools with full capacity and without the online option to hold classes. Newly appointed education minister B D Kalla said on Wednesday that the government would release fresh guidelines in view of this development. “We will release the guidelines soon to tackle the situation. Discussions will be held with the health and home departments before taking a final decision.” Around 19 students have been found positive in the state after schools started functioning with 100% capacity. In the last guidelines issued, the government had let the schools decide on holding classes physically or virtually. This resulted in a majority of schools opting for physical classes and the consequent rise in the number of infections. Kana Ram, director of secondary education, Bikaner, said, “We have not prevented schools from holding online and offline modes simultaneously. It is between the parents and schools. A decision will be taken at the ministerial level.” If sources are to be believed, the education department has given a suggestion to the government on schools having to hold online along with offline classes, giving parents the option to choose.

---||Dehradun||Disaster management secy tells U’khand HC about steps being taken to stop landslides in Nainital; petitioner says no work done on ground||Nainital: About three weeks after the Uttarakhand high court (HC) sought an action taken report from the state government concerning the works undertaken in the landslide-prone Baliya Nala area of Nainital, SA Murugesan, secretary of disaster management department, appeared in the court through video conferencing on Wednesday (November 24). In his affidavit, Murugesan listed the measures undertaken to prevent landslides in the area. He told the court that the measures suggested by a high-powered committee -- constituted by the HC in 2018 -- were being taken and accordingly, retaining walls have been built and the forest department has planted trees to prevent landslides. He added that several people living in vulnerable areas have been relocated and the warning systems -- that were washed away in the previous landslide -- are being re-installed. Besides, a Pune-based company has been given the contract to fix the issues with the existing drain and for this purpose, the state government will sanction Rs 20 crore to the irrigation department. To this, the petitioner -- Nainital-resident and advocate Syed Nadeem Moon -- said that the “affidavit had been written while sitting in a room” and in reality, no work had been done and that Baliyanala still becomes very unsafe during rains. After hearing the arguments, the court asked petitioner Moon to back his counter with evidence, including latest photos of the region, so the court can assess the ground reality and take a call in the matter. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik has fixed December 29 as the date for the next hearing. The secretary of the disaster management department has been asked to appear for the next hearing as well. Notably, the Baliya Nala area on Bhowali Road has been witnessing landslides almost every year since the 1970s. However, these rain-triggered occurrences have started impacting human settlements adversely in the last few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/disaster-management-secy-tells-ukhand-hc-about-steps-being-taken-to-stop-landslides-in-nainital-petitioner-says-no-work-done-on-ground/articleshow/87897357.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||HC takes exception to single judge order on housing scheme||Vijayawada: The high court on Wednesday observed that the single judge order in Navaratnalu – Pedalandariki Illu scheme is affecting the women who have already benefited from the scheme by receiving house sites. A division bench of the high court said that the arguments of the beneficiaries should have been considered before passing the orders. On the assurance of advocate general that the state government is ready to allot house sites to men where no women are present in the family, the high court directed the state government to file an additional affidavit and posted the matter for further hearing to Thursday. After hearing about 128 petitioners who moved court alleging non-allotment of house sites to them under the scheme, the high court had earlier directed the state government not to go ahead with any construction without there being an environmental impact assessment with an expert committee. Challenging the single judge order, the state government moved high court arguing that the single judge gave orders beyond the scope of the petitions as none of the petitioners pleaded for impact assessment. Arguing on behalf of the state government, the advocate general S Sriram said that the house sites were allotted to women in line with the Union government scheme of Pradhan Mantri Avaas Yojana. The advocate general further said many of the petitioners who moved high court subsequently received house sites and in case of some others, the officials could not even locate them. As the state government has already spent about Rs 10,000 crore on house sites and Rs 1,800 crore for construction of houses, the scheme should be allowed to continue in order to prevent public money going waste. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel VSR Anjaneyulu said the single judge heard the matter at length and gave a well thought-out judgement. He said that allotting house sites to only women is against the Constitution. The high court bench comprising Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Justice B Krishna Mohan observed that as possession of house sites has already been given, the court should have made them parties and also heard their version before staying the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-takes-exception-to-single-judge-order-on-housing-scheme/articleshow/87897359.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The completion of the metro bridge and its immediate descent underground was a challenge for the construction team. Officials said the most important work was to cross the river and after that the line goes underground. Work on the bridge across the river has been completed and the elevated end is now being connected to the underground stretch. Officials of the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) said apart from this stretch, parallel to Gandhi Bridge, the metro does not cross the Sabarmati river. Officials said around 78.5% of the concrete work on Phase I has been completed and work has begun on laying the signals and tracks. Official said underground work from Apparel Park to Shahpur has also been completed. The underground stretch is part of the east-west corridor, between Vastral with Thaltej. Officials said “The open web girder (OWG) spanning the seven railway tracks at Sabarmati has also been placed. The OWG is 73m long and 12m wide. It is made of 550MT of steel members and its total weight is 850 MT. The girder was launched using two winches with a lifting speed of 250mm per minute.” Officials said that construction on the metro stations is going on and that is one area where the GMRC is lagging. Officials said construction of the elevated corridor on the north-south corridor, between APMC and Motera, is going on. They said that they have resolved that the metro will commence operations across the entire city on August 15, 2022. The state government has made it clear that they want to have the metro running on both east-west and north-south corridors before the election next year. A senior officer said that they have asked contractors to speed up work and ensure that the trial runs are made and all necessary permissions for operation is obtained by August 1. Officials said the GMRC, for the second phase, has decided to drop direct connectivity to the airport, which was planned earlier. Officials said the 28km Phase II, work on which began on Monday, connecting the Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad city, will be completed by 2024. Officials said the length of the corridor for Phase II is 22.8km, from Motera Stadium to Mahatma Mandir. The corridor of Phase II is a completely elevated with 20 elevated stations and interchanges at Koteshwar Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/metro-bridge-over-sabarmati-now-complete/articleshow/87897373.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Coimbatore||DMK synonymous with graft, misgovernance, says Nadda||Tirupur: BJP national president J P Nadda launched a tirade against the DMK on Wednesday stating that the ruling party was synonymous with corruption and misgovernance.Inaugurating the party office here on the day, he said the DMK and corruption were two sides of the same coin. The state government, he said, was full of corruption, misgovernance, nepotism and favouritism. “Give a fitting reply to the family rule and corruption. Bring a transparent, people-friendly government so that in coming times the BJP becomes the voice of Tamil Nadu,” he said while calling upon the party cadres.Nadda said it was a dynastic rule in the state, where none other than those from a particular family could ascend to power in the DMK. In contrast, he said, leaders like L Murugan and Pon Radhakrishnan, who come from humble backgrounds, have become Union ministers in the BJP. “Dynastic rule is a challenge for democracy. You have to kill your conscience, because you have to serve the family and not the nation. But the BJP serves the people, state and the nation.”Listing out the central schemes, the BJP leader said lakhs of people, particularly women, had benefitted from them.He said the BJP was building party offices in 720 districts in the country to widen their base. “We have completed 473 offices so far, while four more are included in Tirupur, Erode, Tirupathur and Tirunelveli today (Wednesday). Another 188 more are being constructed.”Nadda said six more party offices would come up in the state in two months and another six in the third phase. “Ours is not a party that has office at a leader’s house. It is in our office where we have deliberations and discussions to make the party stronger.”BJP state president K Annamalai, meanwhile, said the party would win 150 seats in the 2026 assembly election and form the government. “To start with, we should win the urban local body polls.”Union minister of state for information and broadcasting L Murugan, former minister Pon Radhakrishnan, national women’s wing president Vanathi Srinivasan and other leaders attended the function.Former AIADMK MLAs K Manickam (from Sholavandhan) and Chola C T Palanisami joined the BJP at the event.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Will propose new law to deal with snatching cases, says police chief Rakesh Asthana||NEW DELHI: A new law will soon be proposed by Delhi Police to tackle the rising cases of snatching. It is proposed to increase the jail term for offenders up to 14 years and make snatching a non-bailable offence, said Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Wednesday. This year has witnessed a 30% rise in snatching and robbery incidents with over 7,504 cases lodged till October 31. In the past one month alone, over 1,000 snatching incidents were reported making it at least 29 snatchings daily on average. Asthana said a separate IPC section would be introduced to ensure snatching accused get the maximum punishment. At present, the accused are booked under IPC sections 379 (theft) and 356 (use of criminal force) or Section 390 (robbery). A similar law was implemented by the Haryana government in 2014 with new clauses being added to IPC Section 379. Delhi Police is planning to replicate the amendments. Interacting with the media at Indian Women’s Press Corps, Asthana also addressed the issue of women’s safety. He said all police stations would now have a separate team of inspector-rank officers to help women register their complaints and get redressal. “We will also set up shadow police booths in areas with lower connectivity for women. These booths will work along with traffic staff, beat police staff and locals. We are also giving soft-skill training to staff to ensure that victims are dealt with sensitively,” said Asthana. Over 1,725 rape cases were registered till October 31, reflecting a hike of 18% in crimes against women compared with last year. In only 1% of cases, the accused were not known to the victims. In 46% of cases, the accused were either family members or friends of the victim. In 11% cases, neighbours were involved, 28% were known people and 14% extended family. The response time of police to SOS calls had reduced from 7-8 minutes to only three minutes and 8 seconds on average. Asthana said each district would now have a cyber police station. “Over 7,000 cops were trained for three months to handle such offences,” said Asthana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-propose-new-law-to-deal-with-snatching-cases-says-police-chief/articleshow/87898780.cms||---

Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain on Wednesday reviewed the situation arising out of the increase in the retail prices of tomato in the markets and directed officials to crack down on hoarders or black marketeers. The retail prices of tomatoes now range between Rs 80 and Rs 100 per kg in markets and more than Rs 100 per kg online. Its wholesale price at Azadpur mandi on Wednesday was between Rs 28 and Rs 72 per kg, depending on the quality. The same time last month, the wholesale price ranged between Rs 14 and Rs 40 per kg. According to data available on the official “Agmarknet” platform, the average wholesale price of tomato was Rs 41.8 per kg this month, while it was being sold at Rs 34.3 per kg in October and at Rs 16.1 and Rs 15.8 per kg in September and August, respectively. A statement from Delhi government said that Hussain expressed serious concern about the sudden surge in the prices of tomato in a meeting attended by the food and civil supplies commissioner and other officials of the department. He directed that the market intelligence unit depute teams in markets to ascertain the reasons for the abrupt increase in prices. Hussain said that Delhi government was keeping a close watch on the price trends of essential commodities and assured that wherever was considered necessary, the government would undertake market intervention for stabilisation of prices. The minister also reviewed the price trends of onion, potato and other essential commodities and directed the officials to take action against hoarding. He directed that the intelligence teams should gather information about instances of hoarding and black marketing of tomatoes, if any, so that action could be taken under Essential Commodities Act. Directing the department to carry out intense inspections of wholesale markets at Azadpur, Okhla, Ghazipur, Keshopur, etc, apart from inspection of retail markets, Hussain directed officials to send daily inspection reports. He also directed the commissioner to convene weekly meetings with stakeholder departments and agencies such as APMC, DAMB, Nafed, etc to ensure that prices of tomato and other essential commodities stayed in range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tomato100-govt-cracks-the-whip/articleshow/87898123.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court issues notice to Waqf Board||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday (November 24) issued a notice to the state Waqf Board, asking the steps it took after an SDM-level probe revealed financial irregularities of Rs 2.5 crore in the allotment of shops on Jama Masjid and Rehmania Madarsa land in Khatima (Udham Singh Nagar). The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik has asked the board to submit its response by December 22, when the case will be next heard. The matter had reached HC after Khatima-resident Shadab Raza filed a petition accusing the members of the Waqf Board committee of getting 34 shops constructed on Jama Masjid and Rehmania Madarsa land and then allotting these shops to their acquaintances. The petition says that the Waqf Board, as per the law, was supposed to carry out a notice inviting people to bid for these shops in at least two newspapers. However, they got the notice published in just one newspaper and allegedly bought all the copies of that daily to prevent anyone else from bidding for the shop. Besides, several of these waqf board committee members have legal cases pending against them. According to the protocol, no committee member shall be booked in any case, adds the petition. Later, a probe conducted by SDM Khatima revealed financial irregularities of Rs 2.5 crore in the allotment of shops. While the board initially suspended its committee members, they were later re-instated under ‘political pressure’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/court-issues-notice-to-ukhand-waqf-board-after-sdm-probe-concludes-rs-2-5-crore-scam-in-allotment-of-shops/articleshow/87897361.cms||---

The discharge was so high that people found thin flakes of fly ash floating down the air and thick disposition of ash on the vehicles, plants and rooftops. Environmentalists cried foul after the videos of fly ash flakes deposited on the vehicles all over the city went viral. “With winds blowing towards city, the fly ash emission from CSTPS flew in the direction of habitation. Layer of fly ash flakes coating the cars and other surfaces can be clearly seen during afternoon hours,” said environmentalist Bandu Dhotre. Dhotre claimed that many complained of difficulty breathing and irritation of eyes. President of Sanjeewani Paryawarn Sanstha, Rajesh Bele was quick to file a written complaint with Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) office here. “The air with fly ash created difficulties in breathing. Chandrapur already has a large number of patients of asthma, eyes ailments, cancer, skin diseases due to high pollution. This spark of emission from CSTPS is life threatening,” Bele stated in the complaint. Bele has demanded a criminal offence be registered against the chief engineer of CSTPS. Inspection carried out by MPCB officials following Bele’s complaint revealed that the fly ash discharge was coming out from the top opening and vent pipe of two fly ash silo (HSD silo) at unit no. 8 and 9 of CSTPS after maintenance work. HSD silos are used to transport fly ash generated at the plant through the closed pipes to ash bund in the form of slurry. After inspection, MPCB official issued instructions to stop the silos immediately and to operate them only after their maintenance and repair work is complete. MPCB is likely to issue show cause notice to CSTPS based on the complaint and inspection report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fly-ash-shower-in-chandrapur-complaint-filed-against-cstps/articleshow/87897386.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Lucknow||Booklet to highlight BSP’s devpt works ‘usurped by BJP, SP’||Lucknow: Refusing to release an election manifesto, claiming that her party believes in doing work rather than making tall claims, BSP chief Mayawati has issued a booklet of her party’s major achievements during the four terms that she was in power in Uttar Pradesh. Not only will this highlight the development in the state under her government, Mayawati said, it would also make people aware of the projects which were launched by her and which the previous Samajwadi Party and the current BJP government have tried to appropriate. Among various infrastructure projects which BSP says it started work on, are the Kushinagar Airport, which was recently inaugurated by PMNarendra Modi and the Jewar Airport, for which the PM will be performing bhoomi pujan on Thursday. “BJP is claiming infrastructure development and employment generation as its main achievements but people should know that commendable work was done on this by BSP,” said a party member. “To promote Buddhism in the area, it was BSP which started the work on airport in Kushinagar. We also submitted a plan for the Taj International Airport and Aviation Hub in Jewar to the Centre but the government did not give clearance for it,” the booklet says. The booklet also mentions the start of the Ganga Expressway scheme, the alignment of which has been changed by the BJP government and relaunched as its own scheme, Lucknow Metro Rail Scheme, the Delhi-Noida-Greater Noida Metro Link scheme as achievements of the BSP governments. The booklet hits out at the SP Government for changing the name of the first medical university in Lucknow which was named after Chattrapati Shahuji Maharaj to King George's Medical University even though there is already a college in his name, and the name of the Manyawar Shri Kanshiram ji Urdu, Arbi, Farsi University constructed by the BSP Government “due to its caste and political biases, like it changed the name of newly carved out districts”. BSP lays claims to rejuvenation of Saryu river ghats in Ayodhya, construction of International Ramlila Centre in Ayodhya, the construction of the Noida-Agra Yamuna Expressway, establishment of the ATS and construction of the first formula one racing track, the Budh International Circuit. Mayawati has also claimed that law and order was finally established in the state under her government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/booklet-to-highlight-bsps-devpt-works-usurped-by-bjp-sp/articleshow/87898793.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Guwahati||Assam gives 4 days parental leave: 'Ministers not entitled to leave, but allowed some time off'||GUWAHATI: In a first-of-its-kind initiative for geriatric care, the Assam cabinet on Wednesday created a special bucket of four official holidays at the start of the new year - two extra days off from work stretching into a weekend - that all ministers, bureaucrats and other employees must utilise to spend quality time with either their parents or in-laws. The additional holidays, January 6-7, cannot be availed for any purpose other than to visit elderly parents or in-laws living elsewhere, take them on a trip, or spend time with them at home. "I will be personally very happy when each of them takes the blessings of their parents at the beginning of the new year so that they can work well for the benefit of the state," said CM Himanta Biswa Sarma. The Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma had announced on the Independence Day that the BJP-led government would grant an extra week's leave to its employees every year to spend time with their elderly parents. As finance minister in the erstwhile Sarbananda Sonowal cabinet, Sarma had announced in 2018 that government employees failing to take care of their dependent parents will have 10% of their pay deducted and transferred directly to the latter. The Assam Employees' Parent Responsibility and Norms for Accountability and Monitoring Act, 2017, mandates taking care of dependent parents as well as disabled siblings. Sarma said although ministers weren't entitled to leave, the government had allowed them to take some time off from work on the designated days to spend time with their parents or in-laws. "From IAS and IPS officers to Grade IV staff, anyone other than those on field duty can avail this special leave," he said after the cabinet meeting in lower Assam's Bongaigaon. The BJP-led government holds a cabinet meeting every Wednesday, including one outside the state capital on alternate months. The first such cabinet meeting was held in Dhemaji in September. Diphu is the venue for the next one in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-gives-4-days-parental-leave-ministers-not-entitled-to-leave-but-allowed-some-time-off/articleshow/87899634.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Delhi||South corpn goes digital at OPDs for better patient care||New Delhi: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has developed an OPD module for computerised registration at its hospitals, dispensaries and polyclinics. It will also help in keeping digital records of the patients, including their contact details, treatment history, and visits to doctors.The module, developed by SDMC’s IT department, has already been introduced at a healthcare centre in Mahendra Park and other facilities will also be covered soon. A senior official said that till now, details of patients, their treatment and prescriptions were recorded on cards issued to them. “But some times patients forget to get the OPD card or misplace it. This creates confusion as the staff at the reception faces difficulty in guiding them to the exact doctor. It also becomes difficult to understand the treatment history. Now all information will be recorded digitally by the operators and it will be easier to access the details,” the official pointed out. “It will also help us analyse the number of patients visiting a facility. Most private and some government hospitals, including AIIMS, follow the same practice,” he added. To use the module, the patient will need to get himself registered at the reception and the staff will generate a slip and direct them to the specific room. “The module will also help the doctors to feed information about their patients, their next date of appointment, disease/treatment status and other details. As the details can be accessed by the staff at the reception, they can verify the actual date of next appointment and accordingly guide patients,” said the official. Work is also in progress to develop similar modules for medicine management, labs and doctors. In case of medicine management, staff can easily find out the out-of-stock medicines, especially the important ones, and place an order accordingly. SDMC is hoping to complete the project in the next financial year. SDMC has 96 health facilities, including three hospitals, two TB chest clinics, 10 polyclinics, 21 dispensaries, 14 mobile dispensaries, five maternity centres, 34 maternity and child care centres, four school health centres and three physiotherapy units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corpn-goes-digital-at-opds-for-better-patient-care/articleshow/87898803.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||PMC food testing lab to restart after 2 yrs||Pune: The civic body will restart its maiden food testing laboratory nearly two years after it was closed. The laboratory has been shut since September 2019, first due to contract issues and then as the pandemic broke out. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had built the laboratory , located in Kondhwa, in 2014, spending around Rs7.7 crore. Now, the PMC’s general body has given its approval to appoint a new agency to run the facility. Some corporators have pressed the PMC to rope in staff and experts to run the laboratory and conduct recruitment, if needed. “The PMC is the biggest municipal corporation and cannot run the laboratory at its own; this sends a wrong message. We have only one such laboratory, so it should be operated by the PMC. A private agency should not be allowed to take over its affairs,” said NCP corporator Prashant Jagtap. Leader of the house in the PMC Ganesh Bidkar said the civic administration has been following the practice of leasing out the facility. “The laboratory was operated by a private agency earlier as well. Non-availability of staff was a key reason for this decision. There have been no complaints about the the laboratory despite a private firm running it so far,” he said. Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group, had requested the PMC to expedite the process to restart laboratory. The group said revenue generation from the laboratory increased from Rs12 lakh to Rs30 lakh after it was handed over to private agencies. “This loss is more significant amid the pandemic with the PMC grappling with a cash crunch,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-food-testing-lab-to-restart-after-2-yrs/articleshow/87898133.cms||---

He was focused on his family rather than farmers while he was in power. Every person’s life is precious but Yadav should also make it clear whether the life of innocent karsewaks had no value? Shouldn’t their families get compensation as well?” he asked. Claiming that farmers’ welfare was a priority for his government and a number of successful schemes had been launched for them, Singh said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, when Yadav and other leaders had quarantined themselves, the government and BJP were engaged in the service of farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sps-concern-for-farmers-fake-says-min/articleshow/87898795.cms||---

Data shows that for November 1-22, there were 1.25 lakh visitors, which is around 5,600 daily. Authorities said on weekends visitors touch 10,000-plus. Humboldt penguins, tiger and hyenas enclosures have most visitors. One can visit the zoo between 9.30am-6pm but issuing of tickets is being stopped by 4pm instead if 5.15pm. Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi said, “The response since we reopened on November 1 was very good. We had to shut the zoo for an hour during weekends as a precautionary measure in case visitors increased to a level that crowds accumulate. The highlights are the new penguin chicks and the tiger exhibit with a water enclosures. We increased security at these two enclosures and we request people to view animals and birds by queuing up.” The tiger was the last animal to have entered in February 2019. Royal Bengal tigers Shakti and Karishma were brought in from Siddharth Garden and Zoo in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad city. The Byculla zoo gave Siddharth Zoo two male and two female spotted deer. Tiger Shakti was born in November 2016, while tigress Karishma was born in July 2014. By next year the zoo plans to get two pairs of lions from Indore and Sakkarbaug zoo. One pair of Asiatic lions will be brought from Sakkarbaug Zoological Park in Junagadh, and another from Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalaya in Indore. In exchange, Byculla zoo plans to procure two pairs of zebras from Ramat Gan Safari Park in Israel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crowds-return-to-byculla-zoo-for-penguin-tiger-hyena-enclosures/articleshow/87898131.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Education dept to evaluate class I-IX kids in state schools with open-book test||KOLKATA: The school education department has decided to conduct an open-book assessment for government school students of classes I to IX to evaluate how much they have learnt—or forgotten— in the last 20 months of the pandemic, when schools remained shut. The education department will send out question papers, along with activity tasks, to state-board schools. Parents will receive the question papers from Thursday, when they visit schools to take the food items of mid-day meals. Children will write a 50-mark exam at home and they can consult books. Parents are supposed to submit the answer scripts to schools by the second week of December. This will be treated as an annual test. A large number of students have been facing learning gap for the pandemic shutdown of schools. Without any evaluation, students have been promoted to the next class. “These students need to be evaluated to check their status. They may consult books but they at least, will have to go through the books to do that,” said an official. Schools, like Scottish Church Collegiate School, have held final exams in the open-book format. Holy Child has started annual exams. Scottish Church principal Bibhas Sanyal said, “We distributed question papers after Diwali.” Jadavpur Vidyapith headmaster Parimal Bhattacharyya, said, “The education department will give out the papers, so we are not preparing them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/edu-dept-to-evaluate-i-ix-kids-in-state-schools-with-open-book-test/articleshow/87898141.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa keen to make amends after Mumbai City loss||Panaji: Given a choice, FC Goa would have stepped out the next day itself to correct all the wrongs they did in their 3-0 loss against Mumbai City FC. Goa were counted among the favourites in this season’s Indian Super League (ISL), but after a calamitous 36 minutes, doubts started creeping in. Goa conceded two against Mumbai in the first session itself, and it was a familiar face – Igor Angulo – doing the damage. Juan Ferrando’s side seemed completely unrecognisable from the team that logged a record 15-match unbeaten run last season and gave the big guns in the AFC Champions League a run for their reputation. “We just want to win and make things fine,” said midfielder Glan Martins. “The loss was difficult. We were frustrated but knew we had one more match coming up this week (itself). From the time we entered the dressing room, we started to focus on the next game. We are ready for the challenge.” The next challenge is against Jamshedpur FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Friday. “Nobody is happy with this performance,” said Ferrando. “It’s not easy (to digest the loss). Our performance was not good. But now I am only thinking about Jamshedpur. We worked on a plan, on our style, but it didn’t work against Mumbai.” Just too many things went wrong for Goa against the defending champions, who they have now failed to defeat in five attempts. The inexperienced defence showed nerves, midfield lacked creativity and new striker Airam Cabrera failed to fire. These, though, are early days. Ferrando knows his team can only get better, and with the availability of new players, Muhammed Nemil for example, there will be more options. Jorge Ortiz was rusty after returning from the ankle injury in the Durand Cup. “When players are injured, we have to stay calm and give them time. Maybe if we play them for 90 minutes, it’s a risk that can force them to miss three to four (more) games,” said Ferrando. Brandon Fernandes, a key player for this team with his creativity, will sit out for another game. Redeem Tlang too continues to be sidelined, but the possible return of Nemil is welcome news. Whoever Ferrando chooses to start, it won’t be easy against Jamshedpur, still hurting from the ghost goal that eventually denied them a place among the top four last season. “Everyone knows what happened as Alex Lima had clearly put the ball over a yard or more within the goal line,” said coach Owen Coyle. “But that was not given as a goal and ultimately that’s football. Until you bring in VAR, you will end up having such a decision being taken.” Jamshedpur didn’t have the best of starts as they dropped points against SC East Bengal and, just like Goa, are now keen to make amends. “There is no doubt Goa will look to freshen up and win the game, but whatever challenge they present, we have to be ready for that,” said Coyle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-keen-to-make-amends-after-mumbai-city-loss/articleshow/87918774.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Jagtap is the brother of Laxman Jagtap, the BJP MLA from Chinchwad. Senior inspector Sunil Tonape said the suspects had attacked to gain notoriety. No one was injured in Tuesday’s incident. “We are also looking into other possible motives,” Tonape said. CCTV footage showed three people on a scooter, with the pillion riders hurling two petrol bombs at the office. “We traced the scooter. The two minors, who were riding pillion, had hurled the bombs. We have detained them and arrested the youth riding the scooter and also the owner of the vehicle,” Tonape said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-nabbed-for-hurling-bombs-at-realtors-office/articleshow/87898138.cms||---
---||Lucknow||SP, RLD poll pact to test vote transfer ability of both parties||Lucknow: When Samajwadi Party and Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ave forged a formal pre-poll alliance for the upcoming UP assembly elections, the ‘vote transfer ability’ of the two allies would be put to test even as BJP is sprucing up its organisational machinery to tame its political opponents. Political experts believe that SP can transfer its votes, essentially Yadavs and Muslims, in favour of its ally that may potentially benefit RLD in the communally restive west UP region. “But the same could be a challenging task for RLD, which banks mainly on Jat and Gujjar communities that are being keenly eyed and wooed by BJP too,” said director of GB Pant Institute of Social Science, Badri Narayan, while speaking to TOI. These apprehensions of experts have roots in the political discourse gradually and apparently treading the communal path. CM Yogi Adityanath has been unleashing ‘abba jaan’ barbs at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who recently retorted by calling BJP leaders as ‘ek rang wale log’ — in an apparent reference to the saffron colour. The communal narrative took an upswing when Akhilesh compared Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabhbhai Patel, inviting the ire of BJP ranks who termed it ‘minority appeasement’. RLD ranks, however, sound confident. “It is a natural alliance. People want change and therefore RLD supporters will vote in favour of SP to defeat BJP,” said RLD national secretary Anil Dubey. While a formal seat sharing arrangement is yet to be finalised, speculations are rife that RLD may field its candidates on 30 seats, and its candidates may contest six seats on SP ticket. If this electoral understanding works out, it will closely resemble the alliance SP and RLD had cobbled up for Kairana and Noorpur bypolls in May 2018. SP had fielded Tabassum Begam on RLD ticket in Kairana, while in Noorpur, RLD campaigned for SP candidate Naimul Hasan. The arrangement had worked as both Tabassum and Naimul had defeated BJP candidates Mriganka Singh and Avani Singh in Kairana and Noorpur respectively. Significantly, Congress and BSP had stayed out of the bye-elections and supported the SP-RLD alliance. This, however, is not the case this time. RLD was also part of the alliance SP had struck with BSP for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Akhilesh had given three seats — Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Mathura — to RLD, then headed by Jayant’s father Ajit Singh, who passed away in May this year. RLD had lost all the three seats, but this did not deter Akhilesh from inking alliance with RLD, even though his pact with BSP fell through.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-rld-poll-pact-to-test-vote-transfer-ability-of-both-parties/articleshow/87898814.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Pune||Calendar honours Vir Chakra awardee for bravery, sacrifice||Pune: Major Ramesh Dadkar was carrying a wounded fellow soldier on his shoulder, and moving towards safety when he went down to the enemy’s firing in the Indo-Pak war of 1971. A grateful nation honoured him with Vir Chakra, and he lives on among his family and a close group of people who knew him well. For all these decades, his wife Geeta has been visiting his 22nd Maratha Light Infantry (MLI) batalion with nostalgia. This year will be extra special as a group of veterans will accompany her to commemorate the 50th death anniversary of her husband at the battalion’s location in Gujarat. “Visiting the battalion always brings back his memories and cherishing them,” Geeta, now a septuagenarian, said. She has been living with her daughter Poonam in Pune since 1978. A calendar on 27 soldiers and officers, including Major Dadkar, who laid down their lives in the 1971 war, will be released next month at the unit, she said. “The calendar as well as a trophy will be in their memory. It will be a proud moment for all of us,” she added. Poonam, a graphic designer, has designed the calendar. “I was a one-year-old when my father attained martyrdom. His unit's officers have always treated me as family. I have heard so many good things about my dad. I am the proud daughter of a brave soldier.” On November 26, 1971, the forward battalion of Pakistan had launched an attack to recapture the Naopara area in East Pakistan (now in Bangladesh). A patrol party from Major Dadkar’s battalion was sent for reconnaissance and to provide information on the enemy’s activities. While returning to the Naoapara area, Naib Subedar Ismail had stepped on a land mine, and the blast tore through his leg. “Major Dadkar, who was commanding the party, rushed to rescue him along with a nursing assistant under heavy enemy fire. The nursing assistant was shot and he died on the spot. Major Dadkar lifted the subedar on his shoulder and brought him to safety. But in the process, he was shot by the enemy and attained martyrdom. For his bravery, he was awarded Vir Chakra posthumously,” Lt Col SG Shinde (Retd), who was commanding the Bravo company of the battalion in the same area, told TOI. Major Dadkar went to King George High School in Dadar in Mumbai. He completed his graduation in economics and French from RN Ruia College in Mumbai. During the college years, he had joined the NCC unit and had participated in the Republic Day parade. He later joined the Indian Military Academy and was commissioned into the Maratha Light Infantry (MLI) regiment on December 11, 1962. He had also fought in the 1965 Indo-Pak war in the Poonch sector in Jammu and Kashmir. “He was a tough officer who led the battalion’s commando team to win the first army level commando competition. He was jovial and an avid reader of books. He would mingle very well with the troops,” recalled Colonel Sambhaji Patil (retd) who had served with Major Dadkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/calendar-honours-vir-chakra-awardee-for-bravery-sacrifice/articleshow/87898148.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Nagpur||NIT gave instalment facility to developers, builders for 3 years against norms||Nagpur: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has been allowing payments in instalment for sanction of layouts and building plans over Rs1 crore to developers and builders for last three years. This is in violation of state government norms, and did not have the government’s okay. Now, three years after implementing it, NIT has proposed to seek approval of the government for giving instalment facility. This discrepancy came to fore from the minutes of meeting of NIT board of trustees held on July 13. The board has approved the minutes in the meeting on October 4. Now, the process to send letter to the government is going on. TOI has copies of the minutes of the meeting. The NIT board of trustees had in a meeting on September 4, 2018, taken a decision to allow instalments for paying land development fund recovered for approval to layout and building construction charges recovered for approval of building plan of over Rs1 crore. As per the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, NIT is supposed to recover charges within 30 days of issuance of demand note. The decision was taken to allow payment of 25% amount within 30 days followed by next payment within six months at 18% rate of interest, and within a year at 24% rate of interest. Accordingly, NIT implemented and allowed instalments to many developers and builders. On July 13, NIT administration proposed to reduce interest from 24% to 18% and make payments easier for developers and builders. Proposal was to allow second instalment at 18% interest within a year, third instalment within two years, and fourth instalment within three years at the same interest. As per minutes, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B pointed out there were no provisions in MRTP Act to give instalment. He said NIT will need to take permission of the government if it wants to allow instalments. Accordingly, a decision was taken to seek the government’s permission. It was also decided to stop the instalments for new applications, but continue them for those who have already availed the benefit. NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi told TOI, “We will seek the government’s approval and implement the system. NIT gave instalments for last three years as per decision of the board. And NIT earned more revenue as instalments were recovered with interest. Therefore, NIT did not incur any financial loss.” Activist Anil Wadpalliwar said, “NIT has been taking many decisions in violation of norms only to benefit developers and builders for years now. The system of instalment should have been provided to people constructing small residential buildings. Demand of over Rs1 crore is generated only for layouts and flats or commercial buildings. The NIT is giving one to three years for payment to developers and builders so they can sell off plots and flats, earn and then pay NIT. It means NIT is saving their money. Government should taken action.” Wadpalliwar added NIT never follows rules. “I had exposed various irregularities of NIT. Also, auditors did the same. Even committee formed by the high court confirmed series of irregularities. Still, NIT continued to work to favour developers and builders and not common man,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-gave-instalment-facility-to-developers-builders-for-3-years-against-norms/articleshow/87897448.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Man acquitted of raping wife, Ahmedabad court says charge doesn’t apply||AHMEDABAD: Nineteen years into marriage, a woman accused her husband of rape and the man was put on trial by a city sessions court, though it said that rape charges cannot be made applicable in this case and finally acquitted him with observation that the wife’s testimony was doubtful. Besides absence of evidence and legal provisions on marital rape, the court acquitted the man considering that the wife requested the court to show leniency citing a compromise with her husband. Moreover, the court also said that the woman has a mental condition and has been in treatment for many years. According to case details, a 51-year-old resident of Sabarmati was acquitted last week after some witnesses turned hostile and the court did not believe his wife’s accusations that she was raped. The couple had been living together since 1998 and had two children. The rape charges were levelled in 2017 and the couple continued to live under the same roof since then even while the husband stood trial. The woman complained that her husband came to the house to give her maintenance amount and raped her. The husband took a defence that his wife seduced him and that it was not forcible intercourse. The man was charged under Section 376 of IPC. After examination of witnesses and hearing the arguments, the court said that the case does not fall under Section 376 because the accused was husband and the marriage was in subsistence. On claims by the woman that she was living separate from her husband at the time of incident, the court said that this would apply the exception in definition of marital rape. It examined applicability of Section 376B that provides minimum two years punishment for raping a wife, who is less than 15 years of age. The court concluded that the separation was not under a court decree or by way of custom, therefore Section 376B would also be not applicable. It said that the case does not fall under the exception – 2 as in Section 375 in the definition of rape. In acquitting the man, the court considered litigation pending at the behest of the wife regarding maintenance and under the Domestic Violence Act. It said that the wife’s claim that he had torn her clothes was doubtful . Moreover, there are seven provisions with regard to consent in Sections 375 and 376 of IPC. The woman’s statement was enough to reflect that she had not given consent, but because the accused is husband and there was no separation under judicial order, the requirement of consent become immaterial.

Deputy Commissioner KV Rajendra has filed the complaint at the Punjalkatte police station, following the threats by Karanth during a rally at Karinja in Bantwal taluk on November 21. The rally was held to demand that the government to put an end to stone quarrying around the centuries-old Sri Karinjeshwara temple. In the complaint, Rajendra alleged that Karanth, while addressing thousands of people, set December 21 as the deadline to stop the stone quarrying, failing which thousands would picket at the Deputy Commissioner’s Office and will hold him by the collar. The TOI tried to contact Karanth for a reaction to the police complaint, but he was not available. Rajendra also wrote in the complaint that Karanth had challenged him to stop the mining if he had guts or else take a transfer. The official wrote that this indecent statement not only showed Karanth’s disrespect to the post of deputy commissioner but was also a manner of threatening a government officer and instigating others to commit a crime. Karanth not only had the mindset of committing a crime but had also provoked thousands of people to do it, the complaint read. The accused has been booked under IPC Sections 153 (provocation for rioting), Section 117 (Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons), 504 (Intentional insult, with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 189 (threat of injury to public servant).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dk-official-complains-against-threat-from-hindu-jagaran-vedike-leader/articleshow/87897377.cms||---

---||Pune||Robbers in Pune shoot cooperative credit society manager dead||PUNE: Two armed robbers on Wednesday afternoon shot dead the 50-year-old manager of a credit cooperative society at Kandali village in Junnar taluka, about 130km from here, and fled with Rs2.5 lakh from the counter. “The manager, Rajendra Dashrath Bhor, died on the spot after being shot in the chest from very close range,” said Mitesh Ghatte, additional superintendent of police (Pune rural). Police teams have fanned out to trace the duo, Ghatte told TOI. The incident occurred at the Anant Rural Credit Cooperative Society, located along the service road of the Pune-Nashik highway at Kandali. “The helmet-wearing duo entered the society office around 1.30pm. As it was lunchtime, only Bhor and a woman cashier were in the office having their lunch,” said superintendent of police (SPPune rural) Abhinav Deshmukh. Deshmukh said the suspects threatened the employees with firearms and asked the manager to hand over cash from the office. “When Bhor refused, one of the suspects shot him in the chest. Another went inside the cashier’s room and took around Rs2.5 lakh. The duo escaped on a motorcycle,” he said. Bhor was immediately taken to a hospital in Narayangaon, where he was pronounced dead by doctors. Bhor was working with the credit co-op society for the last 30 years, said an officer of Pune rural police. The police have collected CCTV footage from at least 50 spots where the duo was spotted. “We are working on some clues,” the officer said. This is the second such robbery at a financial institution in the district in the last one month. On October 21, five armed men had robbed cash and gold ornaments collectively worth Rs2.8 crore from the Pimparkhed branch of Bank of Maharashtra in Shirur taluka. The Shirur police had arrested all five robbers. Deshmukh said that sundry suspects have been targeting banks and credit cooperative societies during their lunchtime, when there are usually much fewer employees and customers around.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/robbers-shoot-co-op-credit-soc-manager-dead/articleshow/87898167.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Possibility of pre-poll alliance with SP is being explored, says AAP MP||LUCKNOW: A day after his meeting with Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav met Aam Aadmi Party MP and Uttar Pradesh in-charge Sanjay Singh. In a separate development, Apna Dal (Kameravadi) chief Krishna Patel also called on Akhilesh Yadav. While AAP MP later said his party may formally join hands with the SP for the assembly elections, Apna Dal chief said she discussed her party’s alliance with Akhilesh. Shortly after meeting the SP chief, Sanjay Singh tweeted a picture shaking hands with Akhilesh. He described the interaction as “a constructive interaction where common issues and strategies were discussed to further the idea of freeing Uttar Pradesh from the misgovernance of the ruling BJP”. Singh told TOI that the possibility of a tie-up between the two parties was being explored. “We may contest the upcoming elections in alliance with SP,” he said. Asked what had drawn the party towards SP, especially as earlier rounds of discussions had fallen through after which AAP had declared that it would go alone in UP elections, Singh said SP was the strongest contender against BJP and it would be possible to defeat the saffron brigade only if they fight it together. On Wednesday evening, Akhilesh tweeted a photograph of his interaction with Krishna Patel saying that the two discussed and agreed upon the “all important and decisive issue of caste census” and the two parties will continue to exchange views and ideas in future as well. The tweet though was silent on any talks of alliance with Apna Dal (K). Apna Dal (K) chief, however, told reporters that her party has entered into an alliance with SP for UP assembly polls. She added that soon senior leaders of the two parties will jointly share the stage. Krishna Patel is the mother of Union minister Anupriya Patel who heads Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction. Sources in SP said the alliance with AAP will be given serious consideration. “Party leadership will take the final call after taking into account all the aspects including sharing of seats with other alliance partners with whom the party has already made a commitment,” said a senior SP leader. On Krishna Patel’s announcement of tie-up with SP and a formal announcement will be made soon, SP sources said the issue was being addressed by the party leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/possibility-of-pre-poll-alliance-with-sp-is-being-explored-says-aap-mp/articleshow/87898829.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Delhi HC to pass directions to ensure safety in courts||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it would pass directions to ensure safety and security in courts that would remain in force till April 18. A bench comprising Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a suo motu case concerning the September 24 shootout, which killed three people in a courtroom at Rohini Court. It said earlier suggestions by various stakeholders would be incorporated as directions. These will include directions on strictly regulating entry in courts by deploying an appropriate number of personnel and devices based on a security audit. The bench said it would review the situation once again in April. “The directions can be amended later on if there is any difficulty in execution. I am adjourning this matter… Changes can’t be made every 15 days (and) it can’t be a superfluous difficulty. Directions will remain in force till April 18,” the Chief Justice said. “There is checking at airports also… All should cooperate. There is bound to be checking. Let us cooperate with the cumbersome process for some time,” he added. The high court asked Delhi High Court Bar Association to ensure that it issues passes for entry of cars belonging to its members inside the high court premises. On November 8, the court had said that it expected full cooperation of Delhi government, city police and lawyers in matters of safety and security in courts and suggested a slew of directions that could be issued. It proposed that the government should be accountable for allocation of budget for the purchase of security devices and since police have the expertise, such devices should be purchased by them. The court had said that the entry of all, including advocates, would be subject to frisking, which is quick and efficient, and going through metal detectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-pass-directions-to-ensure-safety-in-courts/articleshow/87898179.cms||---

Last Sunday, 3.93 lakh domestic passengers boarded flights, the highest volume so far since Covid hit air travel in March last year. On November 14, last week’s Sunday, 3.85 lakh passengers flew, shows data shared by ministry of civil aviation. Percentage growth this Sunday, compared to the last one, was only 2%. The Sundays that fell around Diwali and Dussehra saw the highest increase in passenger volumes. While 3.33 lakh passengers boarded flights on October 31; on November 7, the next Sunday, 3.78 lakh flew, registering a 13.5% jump in passenger volumes. Similarly, passenger traffic rise during Dussehra week in early October was 13%. An airline official said, “Percentage growth in passenger traffic Sunday-on-Sunday has gone down. That was expected. In fact, we had expected passenger traffic to drop post-Diwali, but it did not happen. Every Sunday brings a higher volume of passengers.” In the past few months, the highest passenger volumes for the week typically is on Sundays, while Tuesdays are when airlines get least volumes. Passenger traffic on Sunday has turned into an indicator of demand for travel; leisure travel, especially. “We expect a huge jump in passenger traffic in the last week of December, when Christmas and New Year will increase demand for leisure travel,” the airline official added. Credit rating agency ICRA revised upwards its estimate for passenger traffic growth. Rajeshwar Burla, group head, corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “As per ICRA’s base case scenario, passenger traffic growth is now estimated at 82%-84% year-on-year in FY2022, as against an earlier projection of 71%-73% year-on-year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-3-9l-domestic-passengers-at-pre-covid-level/articleshow/87898182.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||You’ve pocketed crores at cost of river, lives: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday came down heavily on industries for discharging trade effluent in sewage pipeline causing extensive damage to civic body-run sewage treatment plants. The judges accused them of pocketing crores of rupees “at the cost of human beings, people of Gujarat and ecology” and of causing irreversible condition for the Sabarmati river. Following a drive undertaken by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation upon the HC’s directions in a suo motu PIL to disconnect sewage connections of guilty industrial units, the Gujarat Chambers of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) approached the high court and took exception to a letter that AMC wrote to industries regarding snapping of legal or illegal connections to sewage lines. It complained that the civic body was disconnecting drainage line as well as trade affluent lines connecting to common effluent treatment plant (CETp). The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati made it clear that AMC will continue with its drive and the court would initiate contempt of court proceedings against anyone who tries to interfere. The judges told GCCI advocate, “The situation is so grim. You should have heard the experts speaking in court. A stretch of 200km of the Sabarmati is dead and gone. It is an irreversible situation. You have pocketed lakhs and crores of rupees at whose cost? At the cost of human beings, at the cost of people of Gujarat, at the cost of ecology. At the cost of pollution. This is nonsense.” The judges made it clear that the industries have to discharge trade effluent not in sewage pipeline but in CETp which will treat it and discharge it into the Sabarmati. “They (industries) have no business discharging trade effluent in sewage lines. They have caused damage of crores of rupees. All STPs and CETps are extensively damaged. This drive will go on. We are very clear. If you have to take care of your trade effluent, you cannot have connection with sewage pipeline,” the judges told GCCI’s advocate. Brushing aside GCCI’s objections against AMC’s action, the court further said, “You have created hell. Look at Sabarmati. It’s a dead river. Ask your chamber of commerce not to interfere.” The judges asked AMC to disconnect every connection. AMC’s counsel told the court that the situation was abysmal and civic body employees faced threats every day due to this drive. The HC asked it to report any threat to court so that police machinery can be moved into action. The court said that industrialists are interested in gain only and AMC must continue with its work and disconnect all connections, if industries found discharging trade effluent through drainage connection to sewerage network. The high court insisted that AMC should expose those industrialists whose units are caught connecting illegally to sewage lines. “Why are you not exposing those who are indulging in dubious tactics, playing with the river and lives of crores of people. We want this information,” the court asserted. The HC also applauded the civic body for the work undertaken and said, “Do it. Even if you have to work at night. Do it. You are doing it for the people, for the good of society. One day, you will realise the result of these efforts. We are doing it for the next generation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youve-pocketed-crores-at-cost-of-river-lives/articleshow/87897431.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Nurses shunted over ants on patient’s face||Vadodara: Months after a video of ants crawling in the mouth of a paralytic woman admitted in the Covid ICU of SSG Hospital went viral, the state government has shunted two nurses out of Vadodara.  Sources said that the state health department has relieved from their services at the government hospital. While one staff nurse has been transferred to community health centre (CHC) at Balasinor in Mahisagar district another has been transferred to Ranjitnagar CHC in Panchmahal district. The transfer orders issued by the state health commissioner states that the services of the two nurses cannot be continued at SSG Hospital after the reports of ants crawling on the paralytic female patient. They have been transferred citing public interest.  The video of ants crawling in her mouth was recorded by the female patient’s husband in July this year. The 47-year-old woman, a resident of Jambusar in Bharuch district, had multiple health complications. After she had tested positive for Covid-19 and faced a paralytic attack, she was admitted in the Covid ward of SSG Hospital.  When her husband went to visit her, he had recorded a video of his conversation with the patient. It was at this time that he noticed ants in her mouth and recorded the video.  In another video, her husband was seen interacting with the staff present in the ICU. A nurse had expressed sympathy with him but also mentioned that since SSG was not a private hospital they should have made some adjustments there.  The staffer had even told the patient’s husband that taking care of the patient was not merely their responsibility, but also that of the relatives. This even as relatives were not allowed inside Covid wards.  After the videos went viral, an explanation from the staffers was sought and an inquiry was conducted against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nurses-shunted-over-ants-on-patients-face/articleshow/87897186.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Mangaluru||Children collect Rs 50 each to clean Mangaluru City Corporation playground||Mangaluru: Children from various schools playing cricket, football and badminton at the Mangaluru City Corporation’s (MCC) playground at Nandigudda, have pooled money to clear weeds and bushes there, after the city corporation failed to do so. Children met the local corporator and the mayor, seeking city corporation’s help to clean the playground, which was covered with weeds and wild plants, that were a haven for poisonous snakes. When the city corporation failed to respond to their demand, children pooled their pocket money and hired workers to clean the ground on their own. A picture of a banner put up by children on how the ground was cleaned, by collecting Rs 50 from each of them, when the MCC failed to respond, has gone viral on the internet. Subrahmanya, a resident, said that nearly 50 children volunteered to pool money and clean the playground. “Children requested the local corporator in August, after the lockdown, to clean the playground. Recently, they pooled money by each child contributing Rs 50, and I arranged labourers to clean the playground by spending more than Rs 4,000. The children were worried because they noticed cobras while playing, since a large portion of the playground was covered with weeds and wild plants, since there were no activities on the ground during the lockdown,” he said. The playground, which is also known as Vaman Nayak Maidan or Nandigudda Maidan, is one of the recreation spots that is frequently used by students and locals of the area, he added. Mayor Premanand Shetty said that the city corporation was ready to clean the playground. “Earlier, we had helped children when a water tank under the Jalasiri drinking water scheme was planned at the playground. We changed the plan, and now a water tank is being built at a corner of the playground, so that the playground will remain intact. They had met me many months ago, but did not approach me recently on this issue. We would have cleaned the playground if they approached me,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/children-collect-rs-50-each-to-clean-mangaluru-city-corporation-playground/articleshow/87897351.cms||---

The housing scheme, which will have flats that have remained unsold in the authority’s previous schemes, is expected to be launched next month. DDA said in a statement that the ‘Online Special Housing Scheme’ would be held for approximately 15,000 flats of different categories at various locations such as Dwarka, Narela, Rohini, Jasola, etc. The authority said that it would soon share further details of the scheme, including the launch date.

The entire process from application to allotment and possession is being done through online mode and the allottee needs to visit DDA office only for execution of conveyance deed, it said. DDA also said that its flats at Narela sub-city were being offered after taking several remedial measures in terms of improvement of infrastructure, security and connectivity on the basis of suggestions and feedback of the allottees and residents of the area. DDA said the allottees would be eligible for subsidy under the central government’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, if they take a home loan. The authority also approved amendments in its policy to mitigate risks of prospective bidders for upcoming in situ slum rehabilitation projects, including sharing of risk of the developer in case of foreclosure of the project or delay of three years in the execution of the project on account of reasons attributable to DDA. DDA also approved the provision for enforcement of vacation of premises for undertaking in situ projects by allowing penal action against the dweller who fails to cooperate with the developer, concessionaire or DDA at any stage, causing delay in implementation of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-housing-scheme-for-unsold-flats-approved-around-15k-units-on-offer/articleshow/87898184.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Time to muffle those downhearted ditties, stamp out domestic violence||A mother to an infant who walked 15km from her in-laws’ home to her parents’ to escape beatings after the baby spilt milk. A former teacher who wanted to end her life on discovering the extra-marital affair of her second husband who had made her quit her job by calling her “worthless”. A Bhiwandi-based migrant from UP who knocked on alien doors after her husband absconded with their two kids. A 50-year-old with two grown sons whose husband of 30 years still ‘suspected her character’. These aren’t protagonists of women-centric dramas, but on the occasion of International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women that is observed today (November 25), a look at some real women who survived domestic violence between the first and second waves of Covid. Compiled from calls got on its helpline and cases attended to by its crisis centres named Dilaasa between April 2020 and April 2021, the stories in this casebook by ‘Cehat’, a centre that researches violence against women and children, may sit at odds with the graph in NCRB’s 2020 report, which showed a dip in number of domestic abuse cases from 553 in 2019 to 446 in 2020. Fewer than 10 cases were from Maharashtra, accorsding to the report. However, numbers don’t tell the whole story, say city NGOs running women helplines though their phones have stopped ringing as desperately and frequently as they used to amid lockdown. While many cases go unreported due to fear of stigma, the nature of violence counsellors have been seeing and hearing in the wake of Unlock continues to present a portrait of overt and covert forms of violence against women. “They are not letting me stay with her,” said the “scared” voice of a woman to a helpline run by NGO ‘Sneha’. Identifying herself as one half of a same-sex couple, she she said her parents “house-arrested” her on discovering her sexual orientation. The NGO sent two teams to the caller’s rescue. “Mental health of women has really taken a beating during Covid,” says Nayreen Daruwalla of Sneha, which runs 11 counselling centres in Mumbai’s slum communities and four in city hospitals. Soon after the lockdown in March 2020, its helpline saw the number of monthly average calls double from 40 to 90 from women complaining of “their mobility being restricted” and confessing things like: “My husband keeps tabs on me, nags me and fights with me.” The number of calls reverted to its pre-Covid default after the city reopened and access to cops became easier. However, rise of emotional abuse is worrying, warns Daruwalla. “It’s more insidious than physical abuse,” she says even as Sangeeta Rege of Cehat recounts a middle management executive who called up in April 2020 when her family refused to believe she was working from home. “They thought she was sitting in front of the laptop to escape chores,” says Rege, adding that the burden of housework on women compounded the issue of abuse during lockdown. Noting that domestic violence victims are especially vulnerable during isolation, National Commission for Women had launched an exclusive WhatsApp number last year for such victims. And while frequency of distress calls received by ‘Mala Bolaycha Ahe’, the state government’s helpline for domestic abuse victims, has gone down post Unlock, stories of abuse survivors from underprivileged backgrounds who walk into the state’s Special Cells for Women and Children, are now freighted with grief and financial uncertainty. “Many have lost family members and husbands who were bread-earners,” says Divya Taneja, co-ordinator of Mumbai’s Special Cell for Women and Children. In this backdrop, sensitising men on covert forms of violence against women is key, say NGOs like Men Against Violence And Abuse (Mava), which is staging a Hindi play by a chiefly-male crew of underprivileged collegians at a women’s college on Thursday. “The idea is to demonstrate ill-effects of toxic masculinity and introduce men to nuances like ‘no means no’,” says student Rohit Thapa (23), co-ordinator at Mava and actor in the play directed by Rasika Agashe titled 'Mard Ko Dard Hota Hai'.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/time-to-muffle-those-downhearted-ditties-stamp-out-domestic-violence/articleshow/87898192.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

This is the first poll in which the state’s ordinance restoring the OBC quota will be implemented after it was issued in September. The ordinance was challenged in the Aurangabad high court but the court allowed the polls to go ahead while it hears the petition. In March, the SC had struck down the 27% OBC quota for local body polls on the grounds that the combined quota of SC, ST and OBCs could not exceed the 50% cap. The state government decided to issue an ordinance to provide for the OBC quota in rural local body polls by amending the state’s gram panchayat law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-polls-for-nagar-panchayats-on-december-21/articleshow/87898186.cms||---

The duo on Wednesday visited the Billboard that Breathes (artificial lungs billboard) that has turned black in just six days on Tuesday. The duo interacted with the experts to get information about rising pollution. The billboard was installed at Sawrkar Square on November 17. President of Eco-Pro organization, Bandu Dhotre briefed the MP and MLA about the issue of pollution. He explained to them the functioning of the lungs billboard and pointed out that they have turned back in half the time similar lungs billboard installed in Mumbai took to be blackened. Dhotre claimed that the doctors who carry out postmortem at government hospital here find lungs of the deceased pitch dark while taking viscera. “Even doctors in Nagpur involved in lung-related surgeries on patients from Chandrapur have observed blackened lungs,” Dhotre said to highlight the severity of the problem. Expressing concern over rising pollution in the city, Dhanorkar claimed that Chandrapur is more polluted as compared to capital and metro cities but the government is more focused on curbing pollution there. “There is a need to save people from such toxic pollution,” he said. Dhanorkar promised to speak with the ministry and department concerned to come up with a solution for the problem. Jorgewar expressed shock over the high Air Quality Index and maintained that high pollution has reduced life expectancy of people in Chandrapur by 8-10 years. He expressed his resolve to fight for the problem, but underlined the need for collective efforts. “Chandrapur is among the topmost polluted cities in the country and there is a need to build air purifier towers here through CSR funds of highly-polluting industries in the district,” he said. Dhotre submitted a memorandum urging both the people’s representatives to take up the issue with the Union and state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mp-mla-to-raise-chandrapur-high-pollution-issue-in-winter-session-of-parlt-assembly/articleshow/87897477.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Lucknow||One in 10 adults has high blood sugar in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The findings of the fifth National Family Health Survey released on Wednesday deepen concerns about the burden of non-communicable diseases in Uttar Pradesh. The finding is a result of the survey in which blood sugar and blood pressure levels of persons above the age of 15 years across states were recorded. The data indicates that 10% of the adults in UP had high to very high levels of blood sugar. The survey included blood sugar levels of people selected randomly as well as those taking medicines for diabetes. By high blood sugar, the surveyors meant 141-160 units (microgram per decilitre) and very high for blood sugar more than 160 units. The survey also recorded hypertension among people aged 15 years and above and noted that one in five (20%) persons surveyed had high blood pressure. The prevalence holds true for men and women living in rural and urban areas in the state. On both counts, however, the prevalence in UP was lower than the national average. Experts are of the view that the situation cannot be ignored, especially, after the learnings from Covid-19 pandemic. Data from the state health department shows that coronavirus patients with underlying comorbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease suffered the most, both in terms of morbidity and mortality, in the first and second waves. It may also be noted that both diabetes and hypertension eventually trigger cardiovascular disease. Internal assessments indicate that over 85% of the Covid-19 deaths were linked to the three comorbidities. Data from across the world shows that the spectrum of non-communicable diseases — of which the three diseases form the major share — kills 41 million people per year which is about 71% of total deaths reported in all the countries. The survey also indicated that unhealthy body weight is also an increasing worrying trend as it found 21.3% women were overweight or obese compared to 16.5% in the last survey. Likewise, the proportion of overweight men increased from 12.5% in NFHS-4 to 18.5% now. Besides, every second adult in state had high waist to hip ratio — another indicator of unhealthy body weight. It may be noted that deranged body weight can be a precipitating factor for diabetes and high blood pressure. Experts said the data calls for renewed focus on strategies to check the prevalence of the two diseases. The survey also noted prevalence of health risk behaviour in the population for the first time. It recorded that 44% men above 15 years used tobacco while 14.6% of males consumed alcohol. The proportion of women tobacco users is 8.4% while those consuming alcohol is 0.3% in UP. Both the factors are linked to hypertension and affect overall well-being.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/one-in-10-adults-has-high-blood-sugar/articleshow/87898843.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Ahmedabad||Non-veg food row: Vendors move Gujarat HC against ‘bigotry’||AHMEDABAD: Some street vendors have moved the Gujarat high court against the drive of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to remove carts and stalls selling eggs and non-vegetarian food on public streets, terming the action unconstitutional and a result of “bigotry”. After hundreds of food carts were seized by the AMC earlier this month, following public statements from civic body’s political wing and a couple of officials and their insistence on not releasing the carts before 45 days, some vendors have challenged the action, asserting that not permitting them to sell food items of their choice and abruptly removing them from the streets is against the Street Vendors [Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending] Act, 2014. As the AMC cited provisions of the GPMC Act to defend its anti-encroachment drive, they asserted that the Street Vendors Act prevails over other municipal laws. Targeting mostly food stalls selling eggs and non-veg food, has left these poor vendors high and dry and it violates their right to earn a livelihood. The petitioners cited the Rajkot mayor’s action against the sale of non-veg food on streets on the pretext of it hurting religious sentiments, and said that the other municipal corporations — of Vadodara, Surat, Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Ahmedabad — quickly followed suit. “There is no embargo on selling eggs or other non-vegetarian food items either in the Constitution or in any other law enacted by Parliament. Under what authority or power are the respondents preventing the petitioners and persons alike from vending is something that is not available in the public domain. This is nothing but bigotry to say the least,” the petition reads. The petition elaborates, “It seems that the real reason that some individuals have a problem with selling of non-vegetarian food items is bigotry, otherwise there can’t be a logical plausible argument to be made against selling of non-vegetarian food on the streets.” The petitioners counter the argument of the involvement of religious sentiments by questioning who would decides what constitutes to be ‘offending’ and if a person has a right to feel hurt, they have a right to earn a living by selling food items that are not illegal. Food vendors are not bootleggers who deal in contraband, but they are treated like criminals. The petitioners also raised the contention that while restaurant owners, being rich, are allowed to sell non-veg food items, poor street vendors are prohibited and their carts are impounded for 45 days. The petition is likely to come up for the hearing in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/non-veg-food-row-vendors-move-hc-against-bigotry/articleshow/87897483.cms||---

If at all the DIMHANS has seen some development over the years, it is because of constant monitoring by the judiciary. The courts have been monitoring the functioning of mental health institutes run by the government following direction from the Supreme Court in the Sheela Barse vs Government of India. Justice SR Bannurmath and Justice N Kumar had evinced keen interest in the development of DIMHANS.DIMHANS is the only institute in North Karnataka catering to the needy in 15 districts. With all constraints the staff here has done a wonderful job during Covid-19 pandemic.However, the state government has remained apathetic to the institute’s urgent needs, and local elected representatives have also failed to address the institute’s problems.The government has failed to appoint a permanent medical superintendent for DIMHANS for the past three years. Despite the fact that there are qualified candidates, the government has chosen not to appoint anyone. The high court recently reprimanded the government for failing to appoint a regular medical superintendent. DIMHANS director Dr Mahesh Desai said that process of appointing the medical superintendent has begun.DIMHANS requires an MRI CT scanner. Despite repeated requests, however, the machine has not been provided. When he was chief minister, BS Yeddyurappa announced a Rs 75 crore grant for the development of DIMHANS, but no funds have yet been released.Dr Desai said tenders have been called for procuring the MRI CT Scan machine.Political interferenceNo qualified person is willing to work in a government hospital for the salary offered by the government, and doctors are wary of political interference and the aggressive nature of the public. In addition , the requirement that a roster be followed during the recruitment of psychiatrists has made things difficult. According to an insider, there is a severe shortage of psychiatrists right now, and finding a qualified person in that category is a near-impossible task. There is also a scarcity of qualified psychiatrist nursing staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/govt-remains-apathetic-to-urgent-needs-of-dimhans/articleshow/87895819.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The new security plan for the KVT-Gyanvapi campuses will be sent to the standing committee of Kashi Vishwanath Gyanvapi security for approval after examining its effectiveness by the officials on Thursday. Batches of civil police personnel have also started getting training for operating advanced security equipment and gadgets from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) contingent deployed for LBSI Airport security. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh on Wednesday reviewed the progress in installation of security equipment in KV Dham area. “All movable security components, including advanced door-frame metal detectors (DFMD), hand-held metal detectors (HHMD), female frisking booths and x-ray baggage scanners listed for installation in KV Dham have arrived and their installation has also started,” he said. “The advanced DFMDs and female frisking booths are being placed at all the entry points of the KV Dham, while X-ray baggage scanners are being installed at the entry points of the pilgrim facility centres on its campus,” said the CP. “The installation of the vast CCTV network for monitoring every nook and corner of the site, including the Kashi Vishwanath temple and Gyanvapi mosque, is also in progress. The existing network is being monitored from the makeshift office following demolition of the old control room of the shrine’s security. But, with the completion of a new building of a security control room inside KV Dham by mid January, the control and command would be done centrally from there,” he added. “Moreover, to enable the policemen to operate the new security gadgets and equipment smoothly, separate batches of 25 cops each have been formed for conducting seven-day capsule courses for them with CISF,” he said, adding, “Training of the first batch has already started. Their efficiency in operating the gadgets will be checked with the beginning of testing of equipment and gadgets being installed there.” With the beginning of Ayodhya temple movement in 90s, the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex was declared a highly-sensitive site and a standing committee on its security came into existence after 1992. After the city witnessed terror attacks between 2005 and 2010, the sensitivity of this complex increased and security plans were revised to meet the challenges in case of a terror attack. Spending by the government on arranging technical resources apart from manpower to meet the requirements of three-layered security of the shrine also increased massively. Apart from a huge network of CCTVs, security gadgets, this highly sensitive site also had power sliding gates, dedicated units of bomb disposal squad and fire brigade. The CP also spoke on the possibility of changes in the security arrangements for the KVT and Gyanvapi campuses following development of the KV Dham corridor in their vicinity. “All the security plans are being finalised as per the guidelines of the standing committee. As per the guidelines, the KVT and Gyanvapi campuses come under the red zone (inner cordon). In the new security plan, its limit will remain unchanged. The security of the red zone will remain in the hands of the Central paramilitary forces, while the civil police will hold the responsibility of frisking and crowd regulation like in the past.” “Not only this, the entire KV Dham area will be yellow zone (middle security cordon) and areas outside it will be green zone (out cordon),” he said, adding, “After examining the effectiveness of the new security plan on Thursday, it will be forwarded to the standing committee for approval before execution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kv-dham-security-upgrade-begins-ahead-of-pms-visit/articleshow/87898222.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Lucknow||This village stadium grooms international hockey players||Lucknow: As Indian colts start their Junior Hockey World Cup campaign on Wednesday at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, to defend the crown they won in Lucknow in 2016, UP has the lion’s share again with five of its players making it to the squad. These players include Rahul Kumar Rajbhar, Uttam Singh, Vishnu Kant Singh, Prashant Kumar Chauhan and Shardanand Tiwari. Of these, Rahul Rajbhar and Uttam Singh, come from Karampur, a remote village in Ghazipur district in Purvanchal region, which has become a hub of hockey over the years. The two players give credit of their success to their mentor, late Tej Bahadur Singh, who founded Meghbaran Singh Stadium in the village which has produced world-class talent, including Lalit Upadhyay, who was the lone hockey player from the state to participate in the Tokyo Olympics earlier this year. Starting off with limited resources, hockey enthusiast Tej Bahadur, brother of former MP Radhey Mohan Singh, started training children in the ’80s with a bamboo stick on a ground belonging to his family. Later, he developed a stadium, Meghbaran Singh Stadium, on the ground and planted grass, brought from Sarnath, on the ground. His dream of an astroturf finally came true in 2015 and the facility was inaugurated in 2016. Today, the stadium is well-equipped with astroturf and modern facilities and has produced 14 international players. Tej Bahadur died of Covid-19 in April this year. Uttam Singh, who is in Bhubaneswar to take part in the Junior Hockey World Cup, recalls: “I started my journey from Meghbaran Singh Stadium in 2010-11 after which I went to Ludhiana Hostel (2011-12), Patiala Hostel (2013-15) and then to SAI Centre in Lucknow (2015 onwards).” “My family’s financial condition was not good. Teju bhaiyya (Tej Bahadur) arranged hockey sticks and kits for me. He even used to pay for the conveyance that I had to spend on my daily commuting,” he adds. Rahul Rajbhar, who also started from Meghbaran Singh Stadium in 2010, says: “I joined Guru Gobind Singh Sports College, Lucknow, in 2013 and stayed there till 2017. I joined IAF in 2017 and now represent the Services. Even when I was in Lucknow, Teju bhaiyya used to help me whenever I visited my village. He treated us like his family,” he says. Besides giving training to children, Tej Bahadur would provide food to them and also organise tournaments. Olympian Lalit Upadhyay says, “After passing my intermediate, I enrolled myself at Meghbaran Singh College for graduation in 2012. The college belongs to Tej Bahadur’s family. During my graduation days, I used to practice at the stadium and also played for the Purvanchal University team.” Coach Inderdeo, who has been training players at the stadium since 1989, says: “Teju bhaiyya was very fond of hockey. He roped me in while I was playing at university level. Besides Uttam and Rahul, the stadium has also produced Olympian Lalit Upadhyay, 14 international players and 70-80 national level players. Ajit Pandey, who played in the 2016 Junior World Cup in 2016, also belongs to our stadium.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/this-village-stadium-grooms-international-hockey-players/articleshow/87898860.cms||Fazal Khan

The airport was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 20 and SpiceJet airlines will provide the air service. Giving this information on Wednesday, airport director AK Dwivedi said, “From Friday, Kushinagar International Airport is becoming functional with the launch of the first flight between Kushinagar and Delhi by SpiceJet. From next month, flights for two more cities-for Kolkata from December 17 and for Mumbai from December 18, will start.” Despite a rich cultural heritage of the place, Kushinagar was among the most backward places of Purvanchal. But after becoming the chief minister in 2017, Yogi Adityanath strengthened the infrastructure of the district and also provided it with an international airport for air connectivity and opened a new gateway of development of the entire area. It is the third functional international airport of the state to have domestic flights. Kushinagar is the land of Lord Buddha and with the air connectivity of the place, there are chances that flights for Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore may start from here soon. The flight to Delhi will be available four times a week — Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. The flight will take off from Delhi at 12 and reach Kushinagar at 1.35 pm and from Kushinagar it will take off at 1.55 pm and land in Delhi at 3.55 pm. From December 17, flights for Kolkata from Kushinagar will be operational for three days a week — Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On December 17, the flight will take off at 1.35pm from Kolkata and land in Kushinagar at 3.20pm and from Kushinagar it will take off at 3.40pm and land in Kolkata at 5.15pm. From December 18, flights for Mumbai from Kushinagar will start on three days a week — Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On December 18, the flight will take off at 12.10pm from Mumbai and land in Kushinagar at 2.25 pm and from Kushinagar it will take off at 3 pm and land in Mumbai at 5.35 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kushinagar-delhi-spicejet-flight-to-begin-from-friday/articleshow/87898230.cms||---

The minister is in the city in connection with the visit of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Bhumre expressed displeasure over the unhygienic surroundings and undergrowth on the campus. The boundaries have been encroached by petty shop keepers and eateries, often pestered by goons and hardcore criminals. The administration has turned a blind eye though in the past the district collector had been apprised of the problems. The minister held discussions with dean Dr Surendra Gawarle, staff, doctors and students and heard their grievances and demands. The minister sanctioned installation of 85 CCTV cameras, increasing height of boundary walls to 10 feet and above, 15 new hi-mast lamps along with repairing the three defunct ones, permanent police chowki on the campus and regular police patrolling by one police jeep and two motorbikes. He has also instructed the college administration to submit a proposal to enhance the hostel intake capacity to 200. Bhumre has accompanied by district collector Amol Yedge, SP Dilip Patil-Bhujbal and Yavatmal Zilla Parishad CEO Dr Shrikrishna Panchal. While talking to students and residents, the guardian minister said that he has already submitted a proposal for granting adequate compensation to the next of kin of deceased MBBS student Ashok Pal who was brutally murdered in a road rage. He instructed police to take all care to avoid repetition of such incidents in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-guardian-minister-reviews-security-at-gmc/articleshow/87897517.cms||---

Talking to TOI, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma on Wednesday said, “Neither NH-56 nor NH-233 is going to be completed by December when the PM is likely to inaugurate the over Rs 700-crore Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project. Both these projects have been excluded from the list of completed projects to be dedicated to the nation by the PM.” The companies engaged by the NHAI to execute the projects for converting NH-56 and NH-233 into 4-lane roads failed to finish the work near a railway overbridge on Jaunpur by-pass on NH-56. While moving on NH-233, the TOI found that the work is incomplete in many areas despite repeated revision of the deadlines of both the projects. Regarding delay in completion of the two projects, NHAI’s project director Varanasi RS Yadav said, “The companies handling NH-56 and NH-233 projects have internal financial issues. Despite our intervention to get it resolved for avoiding further delay in completion of the work, the issues could not be settled. Therefore, the finalisation of work at a ROB and three under-passes on Jaunpur by-pass of this highway were delayed. Of the 13-km by-pass, work is incomplete in 2-km.” According to Yadav, under the jurisdiction of NHAI’s Varanasi unit, the work on NH-233 is incomplete in the 400m area on Devgaon by-pass. But, after crossing the limits of the NHAI’s Varanasi unit, the work on this highway was found to be incomplete in many areas due to which people were bound to take the old route via Chandawak to continue their journey towards Azamgarh. The last revised deadline for completing NH-56 and NH-233 projects was September 30 and October 15, respectively. Yadav said that as a safe option, the authority has sought time till December-end to finish all the pending work. The deadline for completion of Rs 806 crore NH-56 four-lane conversion project and Rs 785 crore NH-233 project had been revised multiple times in the past, as per official records. The officials count consecutive Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 and this year as well as long wait for getting possession of land acquired for the projects in districts like Jaunpur, and Azamgarh as the major reasons for the delay in the two projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/nh-56-nh-233-dropped-from-list-of-projects-to-be-opened-by-pm/articleshow/87898225.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hybrid education mode ‘not working’ for online students||MUMBAI: With schools requesting the state to make attendance in physical classrooms compulsory, students attending virtual classes from home are complaining about being “left out” by teachers when hybrid lessons are in progress. All schools in the city reopened on Monday after the Diwali vacation. As attendance is voluntary, the strength of students in physical classrooms is less than 50%, say school heads. Students from classes 8 to 12 are allowed in-person schooling in the city. Across the state, students from classes 5 to 12 can choose between online and offline learning.  “With classes going hybrid, students attending online are feeling left out during interactive sessions. Teachers are not adequately trained to handle in-person and virtual students at the same time,” said the principal of a Sion school.  A few schools trained their teachers to teach in the hybrid format but “the focus shifts to students who are present in the real classroom”, said a teacher who finds it difficult to teach mathematics to Class X students in the hybrid mode.  Online students too are complaining of missing out on learning. “It was easier when it was all online. Since the hybrid mode began on Monday, teachers look involved with students in the real classroom. The virtual ones like me feel lost,” said a Class 8 student of a Vile Parle school.  A few schools have even gone back to teaching entirely online following students’ complaints and teachers’ inability to catch up with the hybrid mode. “We tried online and offline last month. After Diwali we have stuck to online. Teachers are in classrooms and all students are logging in from their homes,” said the principal of a school in Kandivli. Schools want the state to make physical attendance compulsory. As of now, absenteeism from online and offline classes is not dealt with sternly. Schools feel if the parental consent clause is removed all students will be in classrooms.  School heads said in-person schooling should be made compulsory for higher classes. “If board exams are to be offline, students of classes 10 and 12 should be in school,” said one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hybrid-edu-mode-not-working-for-online-students/articleshow/87898237.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Stray dog issue: Amicus curiae to file report today||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation which promised to make amends in the conduct of animal birth control project in the special council held on Monday may likely have to deal with adverse remarks in the report of High Court appointed Amicus curiae. Suresh Menon, whom the court appointed to look into the state of affairs at ABC unit, Vandithadom, and file a report will submit his report to the court on Wednesday. The case is posted on Friday. It is learnt that Amicus curiae during his visit to the centre and following his interaction with the corporation officials concerned has expressed displeasure over the upkeep of dogs at the centre. The city corporation’s apparent reluctance to provide spacious cages with all facilities at the centre has come to the notice of Amicus curiae. The corporation has communicated to Amicus curiae that 10 dogs are being sterilized on a daily basis. Sources said that questions were raised regarding the efficacy of this initiative since there has been an exponential increase in number of stray dogs in the past five years and corporation failed to upgrade the facilities in tune with the demand. The corporation may have to deal with critical findings in the report for which it will have to answer in the court especially with regard to the callous manner of handling dogs at the birth control centre. The collective of animal lovers had met with Suresh Menon and submitted a report on the present condition of ABC unit and also placed a few suggestions. One of the demands was to enable social audit by making public, details of catching and release of dogs on the corporation website so that community carers can also be involved in the program.  They said that without people’s participation, this programme could never be a success. They also demanded that a probe shall be ordered to expose the cruelty and corruption in the implementation of ABC. In the letter, the collective also stressed about the need to involve animal welfare workers and collectives in the welfare aspects of street dogs and to have Mayor involve citizens in discussions pertaining to implementation of the project. Citizen initiative had earlier reported that dogs were kept crammed in small cages with no space to stand up, move or lie down.  “They have to lie on top of each other or crouch. Base of the cage is made of metal rods which do not allow them to rest their paws firmly. They have to clutch the bars or their feet slip into the gaps. Spending even a few hours will permanently damage their paws jeopardising their survival prospects on the streets after release,” a statement issued by citizen initiative read. The civic body had spent Rs 2.41 crores to sterilize 12,715 dogs between 2016-17 and 2021-22, as per the latest figures presented in the assembly. Since 2016-17, the funds being spent on animal birth control have increased phenomenally leaping from Rs 8 lakhs in 2016-17 to 73 lakhs in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/stray-dog-issue-amicus-curiae-to-file-report-today/articleshow/87875901.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kanpur||Fans express joy as test cricket returns to city after 5 years||Kanpur: The cricket fans in the city are excited and eagerly waiting for Thursday morning when Kanpur’s pride, Green Park, will host an International Test match after a gap of five years. The pandemic failed to dampen their spirits as on the very first day of sale, online tickets of the match were sold out on BookMyShow.com. Though the enthusiasm was not like the old days when cricket used to be the talk of the town before every match. But residents, especially new cricket fans, are going crazy to see their heroes on the ground. The fans are all set to move towards Green Park as the entry would commence from 7.45am. The district administration is hoping that the fans will lead towards Green Park from all corners of the city, therefore traffic diversions have been implemented to make it convenient for them to reach the stadium. Host UPCA has also engaged e-rickshaws at all entry points of the road to bring the cricket fans to the stadium at a very nominal rate. Most of the entry points are around a kilometer away from the stadium. The administration will not allow private vehicles to move inside the entry points. The district administration has also imposed certain restrictions and spectators will not be allowed to bring anything which could be hurled inside the ground. Moreover, masks have also been made mandatory under Covid protocol . Since the Indian captain had already announced that Shreyas Iyer will make his debut in test matches, Kanpurites have started discussing how he would perform. “Will he repeat what GR Vishwanath did when he scored a century after a duck in the first innings,” asked a little fan Shivam . Cricket fans are hopeful that the Indian team which won the T20 series this week would continue its winning spree and a competitive game of cricket would be played. Sardar Ajit Singh Daare, a cricket fan, said these days the craze for cricket matches is relatively low as compared to old days. He said during those days, he along with others, used to reach stadium early in the morning and there used to be a long cue at the entry gate to go inside and grab the best place to witness the match. The two teams completed their net sessions on Wednesday evening in the absence of cricket fans.

The ED is likely to question Kunte regarding the transfer and postings of police officers when Deshmukh was holding the home portfolio.It is learnt that Kunte may not appear before the ED on Thursday due to his busy schedule. Kunte did not reply to calls and text messages from TOI. Earlier, the ED had recorded the statement of deputy-secretary home (Maharashtra) Kailash Gaikwad in the case. The ED arrested Deshmukh in the money-laundering case on November 2. He is currently in jail custody. The ED is investigating a money laundering case based on the FIR registered by CBI that has accused Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars in the city. The agency is also pursuing the alleged corruption involved in transfers and postings of police officers based on a confidential report by then state intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla, who tapped telephone calls indicating a nexus between brokers and others last year.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Call likely today on school for all kids from standard 1||MUMBAI: The state education department's proposal to reopen physical classes for the primary section is likely to be taken up in the cabinet meeting on Thursday. The proposal has been cleared by the health department as well as the Covid-19 paediatric task force. "There is no reason to delay opening schools for children from Class I," said Dr Suhas Prabhu, senior paediatrician who heads the state paediatric task force on Covid-19. Currently, there is no physical school for classes I to IV in rural areas and I to VII in urban areas. No need to make vax must to start classes, says Task forceThe pediatric task force has conveyed to the government that there is no need to make vaccination for under-18 a prerequisite for starting classes. The only caveat is that schools should take all the precautionary measures against Covid.  Education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI: “The chief minister told me four days ago that he will discuss the matter with me and then take a decision. If the CM attends the cabinet meeting on Thursday, we will speak to him. We have recommended the reopening of classes I to IV in rural areas and classes I to VII in urban areas. We will incorporate the suggestions from the task force concerning the health and safety of the students that need to be adhered to for the reopening.” Meanwhile, health minister Rajesh Tope said the proposal is likely to be taken up in the cabinet meeting on Thursday. “We will also urge parents to allow their children to go to school as all the safety measures are in place. Meanwhile, we are also following up with the Centre regarding starting vaccination for kids,” said Tope. Dr Suhas Prabhu, who heads the state government pediatric task force on Covid-19, said parents should not wait for the third wave or vaccination before letting schools start. “I have seen children who have put on 15kg during the pandemic, some who are depressed or have sleep disorders. We need to get the economic and education cycle back on track so that people, including children, can lead normal lives,” he said. Another pediatric task force member, Dr Vijay Yewale, said it has already been communicated to the government that vaccination is not a prerequisite for opening schools for primary classes from I to VII. There has been a lot of debate on the need for vaccination for children; children are likely to stay asymptomatic during Covid infection or get a mild infection. Several western nations, though, have begun vaccinating children over five years of age, but the Indian government hasn’t yet, despite clearing vaccines for pediatric use. “World Health Organisation officials as well as local experts have said that India may not see a third wave. Even if it does, schools can be closed again. But children need social interactions with peers. Studying and playing with the iPad was a stopgap arrangement that shouldn’t be prolonged further for both physical as well as mental health of our children,” said Dr Prabhu. Regarding parents who want to wait for vaccination before sending children to school, he said pediatric vaccination may take a minimum of six months. “Even if we start vaccinating immediately, given the 84-day gap between shots, it will take six months or more to vaccinate children. Should they then continue to sit at home for that duration? Let’s not waste another academic year,” he added.

---||Ahmedabad||Contractors want charges paid by govt revised||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Contractors’ Association (GCA) on Wednesday moved a representation seeking that the government pays revised construction charges, in the wake of increase in costs. GCA members have cited that the increase in price of steel, cement, tar, sand, gravel and bricks in addition to costlier transportation and increased labour wages have led to an increase of at least 30% in the cost of construction. A meeting to discuss the rising input cost was organised in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, which was attended by some 200 construction contractors. Most of these contractors take up construction projects proposed by the civic body as well as the state government. “Contractors came to a consensus it is no more viable to do business at the rate decided at the time of submitting the tender for government’s construction contract. Therefore, a representation has been made before the state government seeking to revise charges levied by contractors,” said Arvind Patel, president, GCA.

---||Nagpur||Women unsafe under MVA rule: BJP||Nagpur: In continuance of its strategy to unleash a multi-issue attack on Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the BJP on Wednesday said that women are unsafe under the current political dispensation. Former city mayor Archana Dehankar said that across the state incidents of crime against women are being reported and “the situation is getting worse”. “Be it Beed, Sakinaka, Parbhani or Dombivili, we are seeing shocking news of rape and crime against women. The government has failed to bring the situation under control,” said Dehankar. “Should women now take law into their hands or should they sit at home forever?” the former mayor said. Dehankar said that promises are still unfulfilled when it comes to laws related to women safety. “Shakti, a law which was supposed to empower women and ensure that safety and security in Maharashtra, has still not been brought in. It was in 2019 winter assembly session that this was discussed but why is it still pending?” she said. She also pointed out that the government appointed head of women commission last month only, after 1.5 years of vacancy. “BJP has been at the forefront of reminding this government of their duties, and now things work only when we push for it,” she said. The former mayor said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, new initiatives for women safety had been introduced. “If cops delay the FIR filing, then action can be taken against them. In rape cases, the investigation must be completed within two months etc. But in Maharashtra, just to register the FIR itself is a major task,” said Dehankar. She added that issues closer to home are being ignore by the state government. “Those protesting against Lakhimpur incident fail to see the activities going on in state. One minister had to resign after a female committed suicide, another is busy taking press conferences following the arrest of a celebrity’s son but there is no one to help women in need,” said Dehankar. As the MVA government completes two years and civic polls draw near, the BJP is stepping up its attack on various issues through different leaders. On Thursday, the party has planned gherao of NIT office over increase in Gunthewari charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/women-unsafe-under-mva-rule-bjp/articleshow/87897530.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Kanpur||Kanpur test pitch report: Spinners likely to rule the roost||Kanpur: The Green Park wicket, which is usually result oriented, is likely to remain the same in the first test match between India and New Zealand slated to be held from Thursday. The strip on which the five-day test will be played might prove helpful for spinners after two days and both the teams would like to field three spinners. The wicket has very little grass and moisture in upper soil which would evaporate in two days. Therefore the wicket will play sportingly in the first two days and thereafter there are all possibilities that spinners may rule the roost. To read and assess the pulse of the strip number five on which the test match will be played, the visiting side stayed for long in the evening and observed it minutely for minutes. Kiwi team coach Gary Stead had already indicated on Monday that his team might field three spinners. He had also commented that the visiting team faced a difficult task in India to win and had indicated that it was due to the track which supported Indian spinners.The Indian test squad was decorated with three specialist spinners-Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. Till December 1986, Green Park wicket was known as docile and matches usually ended up in a draw. The year 1983 was an exception when the visiting West Indies team had defeated the Indian team in just three and half days. Though the highest wicket taker at Green Park is medium pacer Kapil Dev, who had captured 25 wickets in 7 matches. But Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Subhash P Gupte and Jasu Patel had also grabbed 21, 20, 19 and 14 wickets respectively. Ravichandran Ashwin too had played one test here and had collected 10 wickets in his bag. According to former cricketer, Gopal Sharma, who had made his debut in Kanpur, the nature of the wicket is well known and bounce would become low after the first two days .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-test-pitch-report-spinners-likely-to-rule-the-roost/articleshow/87898248.cms||अनंत नारायण
---||Delhi||Delhi: All unregistered projects stayed by Rera tribunal||NEW DELHI: In a move that will help homebuyers, Delhi’s Real Estate Tribunal on Wednesday stayed all construction activity on unregistered projects. Taking note of Delhi Police’s stand that it is investigating at least 27 FIRs registered against societies/individuals fraudulently offering membership of housing projects, the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal noted that even though builders are covered under the Rera Act, several projects have been constructed without seeking the mandatory registration. “The object of the statute is to redress the grievances, if any, of the buyer against any builder in transactions of residential and commercial projects and to further ensure the timely completion of the projects. These objectives are not meant to be flouted by some unscrupulous people for their own benefit. They must be strictly complied with,” observed a bench headed by Justice Chander Shekhar. It said in view of rampant violations, “all construction activity in NCT of Delhi, residential as well as commercial, being undertaken without registration with Rera is stayed till the registration of their project. “The commissioner and the executive engineers of all municipal corporations concerned, Delhi Development Authority, New Delhi Municipal Council and the police commissioner, through the SHOs of local police stations concerned, shall ensure that no further construction activity is continued in the absence of Rera registration with immediate effect,” the bench added. It directed that the field staff of all authorities, including the corporations, will carry out a survey of properties under construction in their jurisdiction and “take necessary steps in terms of this order, take photographs as also the details of the developers.” The tribunal also asked the three municipal authorities not to grant sanction of building plans regarding such projects unless they obtain registration with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority appointed under the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-unregistered-projects-stayed-by-rera-tribunal/articleshow/87898249.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Mangaluru||Establishments must ensure safety of women and children at shelters: Mangaluru police||Mangaluru: With the second incident of sexual assault on a minor girl being reported from a shelter for labourers in the city this month, the Mangaluru city police has decided to identify establishments that engage migrant labourers and make sure that they look into the security and safety of women and children. As a first step, the officials will list out places where labourers stay, visit and collect details of the owners and the condition they live in. “We will also hold a discussion with deputy commissioner K V Rajendra and request him to convene a meeting with all the departments concerned, including labour, revenue, women and child development and social welfare to discuss necessary measures to be taken up in such shelters, “ he said. It may be recalled that in an incident that came to light on November 1, the city police arrested Chandan, 38, on charges of sexual assault on a two-year-old girl and throwing her into a saltwater fish tank of a fish processing unit in Mangaluru South police station limits, the previous day. At this fish processing unit, nearly 80 migrant labourers — most of them from from Bihar — are engaged in cutting and salting fish. The survivor was treated at a government hospital. Meanwhile, on November 21, an eight-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered at a tile factory allegedly by four labourers, who have been arrested. At the tile factory, about 31 labourers are working including six women. About six children are staying in the shelter. About 21 labourers, including 19 men, are from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, the police said. Stressing on the need for better facilities as per the law, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) chairman Renni D’Souza told TOI, the need of the hour is to identify children in these shelters and ensure that they are admitted to schools. “There was also a case, where a minor fled from a shelter and the CWC is attempting to send him back home. The government provides several facilities for the migrant labourers, if they are identified. A coordinated effort by all concerned departments is essential to prevent such incidents in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/establishments-must-ensure-safety-of-women-and-children-at-shelters-mangaluru-police/articleshow/87897403.cms||---

---||Delhi||Over a third of slum dwellers in Delhi without jobs||NEW DELHI: Over 36% of slum dwellers in Delhi are unemployed and 48% of the households, with approximately five persons in each, don’t spend more than Rs 10,000 per month. According to a recently concluded survey of 4,262 households in 10 slums of East district sanctioned by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, people gave a number of reasons for their unemployed status. Of the 20,414 individuals covered by the survey, 24% cited fear of Covid as the prime reason why they didn’t have jobs, 22% said they lacked the skills to be employed, 19% blamed slackness in work and business, 9% said they had to look after children and an equal number said they were attending school, college or training. Among the rest, 8% said they had no jobs due to household responsibilities and personal obligations, 3% because of health-related reasons and 2% claimed to be awaiting results. Only 1% said work was hard to find and 3% didn’t specify any reasons for their unemployed state. TimesViewThe high number of unemployed people in slums — the neediest among us — is both unfortunate and worrying. The situation underlines the need for focussed social welfare measures and more employment generation schemes.The survey was conducted in August-September with the objective of determining the socio-economic status of JJ cluster residents and obtaining information about their interests, time they can devote to acquiring skills and limitations in learning new skills. The report said that taking the main source of the household’s income in the past 365 days, 34% households were regular wage-salary earners, 34% were casual labourers, 27% were self-employed and the remaining 5% were categorised as ‘other’. The monthly expenditures of 48% of the households was less than Rs 10,000, though 46% spent Rs 10,000-19,999 and 5%, Rs 20,000-29,999. Just 1% has expenditures of over Rs 30,000 per month. Only 12% of the surveyed had studied up to graduation or beyond and 15% were unlettered. Around 7% had below primary education, 11% up to primary, 19% had received middle school education, 17% secondary and 18% higher secondary education. Only 1% of those who had studied from secondary to post graduation had obtained a diploma or certificate in a professional trade, with 7.6% having acquired some skills through hereditary training, self-learning and learning on the job. The most preferred vocational training involved textiles and handlooms, apparels, beauty and wellness, electrical, power and electronics and other. Nearly 63% of the respondents were interested in receiving skill training, 60% of them males and 66% females. But 46.6% of the individuals lacked any awareness about available training to boost their employability through new skills. The survey established that a skill training programme of 6 to 12 months would be most preferred, with 33% of the respondents positive about this. Over a third, or 37%, felt it would be most helpful to have a skill training centre located within a distance of 1km from the targeted locality. The Directorate of Economics and Statistics has recommended that the slum dwellers be given skill training to make them more employable while also starting education centres for the non-literate adults. It also suggested opening counselling centres to help the underprivileged slum dwellers develop a career plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-a-third-of-slum-dwellers-without-jobs/articleshow/87898314.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kanpur||Contribution of unsung freedom fighters should be made known to public: President Ram Nath Kovind||KANPUR: President Ram Nath Kovind said here on Wednesday that “the independence of the country was achieved due to the contribution of several unsung freedom fighters and their contribution should be made known to the public”. Kovind was speaking at the birth centenary celebrations of former MP Chaudhary Harmohan Singh Yadav, who was also a freedom fighter and a Shaurya Chakra winner. Harmohan, who died in 2012, had been associated with the Samajwadi Party (SP). During his address on the occasion, the President said: “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav is being celebrated all over the country to mark 75 years of our Independence. During this two-year-long mahotsav, we will remember the contribution of unsung heroes of the freedom struggle who had laid down their lives.” Remembering freedom fighters Ajijan Bai, Mainavati, Jaidev Kapoor, Shiv Varma, Bijay Kumar Sinha and Gaya Prasad on the occasion, Kovind said India could get Independence due to the important contribution of many such freedom fighters. “Therefore, it is the duty of all of us to bring information about the contribution of such anonymous freedom fighters to the public,” he added. The President said that the future of any nation is guided by the experience of the past and enriched by its heritage. “We all should actively participate in building a strong, successful, developed and prosperous India. Every hand of our country should rise together for the progress of the country,” said the President. Kovind said that the life of Chaudhary Harmohan Singh Yadav is worthy of emulation. “He was a perfect example of simplicity and an inspiration for public service. He strove to bring happiness in the lives of the people, particularly those living on the margins and the farmers. From gram sabha to Rajya Sabha, his views about agriculture were heard very seriously by policy makers,” said the President. The President further said that “the doors of Harmohan Singh Ji’s house were always open for all”. “In the year 1984, he set an excellent example of communal harmony when he saved a large number of lives from a violent mob. In the year 1991, he received Shaurya Chakra for his exceptional gallantry and fearlessness,” said the President. The President noted that “with Harmohan Singh Ji’s efforts, many educational institutions were established to give fillip to the educational awareness in this area”. “He understood that education is the basis of the progress of every family and society. And education is the best tool to improve the lives of people and make society and country better, he used to say,” the President recalled going down the memory lane. The President said that “whenever Harmohan Singh Ji used to travel in the train, he considered everyone as his companion”. “If this spirit of companionship is realized in the society as well and people adopt caste, sect, rich and poor even in the neighbourhood, then wherever we live there will be heaven,” he said. The President also lauded the achievements made by the state in various fields. “Uttar Pradesh has made many achievements in the field of education. An IIT, NSI, three universities and many educational institutions are on the map of Kanpur. Due to this, the responsibility of Kanpur also increases a lot for other regions in the country,” he said.

The couple had two children and Karpagavalli was pregnant with her third child. Suspecting her fidelity, Suresh often tortured his wife. He picked up a quarrel with Karpagavalli on July 21, 2015 and punched her on her private part and abdomen with his fist. The woman bled profusely, resulting in the death of the foetus. He also strangulated her.Subsequently, Suresh took her to the government hospital but she died the next day. The Chinnamanur police arrested Suresh.In December 2020, the Theni district fast track court convicted and awarded death sentence to Suresh under Section 302 of IPC for murder of his wife and awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 316 of the IPC for causing the death of his unborn child.Since death sentence was pronounced on the accused, the case was referred to the HC Madurai bench for confirmation of sentence. Suresh had also preferred an appeal before the HC challenging the conviction.A division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and S Ananthi observed that this court is of the considered view that the prosecution has clearly established that it is a case of homicidal death where the accused had caused the death of his wife and the nine-week-old unborn child.The question arises for consideration is whether the trial court is justified in imposing a death sentence on the accused. The law is well settled that life imprisonment is the rule to which the death penalty is the exception.The judges observed that in the present case the accused was aged about 31 years at the time of the occurrence. This case falls short of ‘rarest of rare cases’ category and we are of the considered view that the mitigating circumstances had outfaced the aggravating circumstances.Confirming the conviction of the trial court, the judges commuted the death sentence to life sentence for offence under Section 302 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/death-sentence-of-man-who-killed-wife-commuted-to-life/articleshow/87898290.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The final result of this recruitment exam was declared on April 12, 2021, but the selected candidates are upset as even after seven months they have not received the appointment letters. Now they are apprehensive that the appointment letters may be received after elections as the code of conduct for the assembly elections may delay the process. “It is disheartening and frustrating that even after qualifying the highly competitive exam and getting selected we haven’t got appointment letters till now and are unable to join service,” shared one of the affected candidates. The candidates demanded that the whole selection process has been completed, so the appointment letters should be issued to them immediately. They also pointed out that selected candidates of several other posts like Women Child Development Officer, Social Welfare Officer, District Employment Officer have already been issued the appointment letters by the state government in recent months and duly appointed. “We have been told that a ceremony is to be held in which Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will issue the appointment letters and as the date of this function has not yet been decided by the state government, the appointment letters are being withheld,” claimed another affected candidate. UPPSC’s public relations officer Pushkar Srivastava maintained that the commission has completed all formalities and has sent the list of the 55 selected candidates to the state government, which now in due course of time will issue the appointment letters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/candidates-selected-for-sr-lecturer-diet-wait-for-appointment-letters/articleshow/87898285.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC seeks health status of UAPA accused from state||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has directed the state government counsel to apprise the court about the progress made in the medical treatment of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) accused Atiq-ur-Rahman, who had moved an application seeking his admission in AIIMS, New Delhi, as he is suffering from a serious heart disease. Atiq-ur-Rehman was detained on October 5, 2020, along with journalist Siddique Kappan, Masood Ahmad and cab driver Alam while they were on their way to Hathras to protest against the gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old girl. Hearing the habeas corpus petition moved by Atiq-ur-Rehman of Muzaffarnagar, Masood of Bahraich and Alam of Rampur, a division bench comprising Justice Mahesh Chandra Tripathi and Justice Subhash Vidyarthi fixed November 25 as the next date of hearing while asking the government counsel to apprise the court about the case. Passing the above directive in its order dated November 23, the court observed, “In spite of repeated orders dated September 23, 2021 and October 12, 2021 passed by sessions judge/special court, PMLA, Lucknow, which have been brought on record but till date, the adequate medical facility has not been provided to the first petitioner.” To recall, an FIR was lodged against the three accused on October 7, 2020, alleging that they were going to Hathras to take undue benefit of the Hathras incident of gangrape and murder of a woman, disturb the law and order situation and fuel caste riots in the state. Senior advocate SFA Naqvi, representing Atiq-ur-Rahman, informed the court that Atiq-ur-Rahman is suffering from a serious heart disease. His proper treatment is possible in AIIMS, New Delhi only, but no action was taken by the state government on several applications seeking his admission to AIIMS, New Delhi. “However, after the court’s order dated November 23, we have been informed that Atiq-ur-Rahman has been shifted early morning on November 24 from Mathura District Jail to AIIMS, Delhi for medical treatment where he reached around 11am,” he added. Hence, UAPA accused Atiq-ur-Rehman was shifted to AIIMS after the Allahabad high court pulled up the state authorities for not paying heed to his deteriorating health, informed Naqvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-health-status-ofuapa-accused-from-state/articleshow/87898298.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Victim’s kin attack accused man out on bail||Thiruvananthapuram: An accused in an assault case was brutally attacked by a group of men few hours after he was arrested and granted bail by the Mangalapuram police on Tuesday. Faisal of Masthanmukku near Kaniyapuram is the one who faced the attack. He has sustained serious injuries in the attack. According to the police, Faisal was attacked around 7.30 pm at Masthanmukku. His assailants are suspected to be friends and relatives of one Anas of Chiramukku, who was allegedly beaten up by Faisal on Sunday night. It is alleged that the attack was carried out because the assailants believed that the police did not invoke serious charges against him despite Anas sustaining serious injuries in the attack. On Sunday night around 9.30 pm Anas was attacked by Faisal and two others. Police registered the case and arrested Faisal only on Tuesday that too after the surveillance camera footage of the vicious attack went viral on social media. Meanwhile, police officials said that the attack on Sunday night was fuelled by road rage incident. Anas who was allegedly under the influence of alcohol caused an accident outside Faisal's residence. The police invoked a bailable section of causing simple hurt because the assailants did not use any weapons. ''We checked the surveillance camera visuals and it is clear that Faisal and others were not carrying any weapons. They did not have any enmity either as they were not known to each other before,'' police said, explaining why bailable sections were charged against Faisal. However, this act irked the close ones of Anas, who decided to serve their own justice by attacking Faisal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/victims-kin-attack-accused-man-out-on-bail/articleshow/87875958.cms||---

She presumed they had come to purchase milk and was getting ready to give it to them when they pumped bullets into her, killing her instantly. The woman's husband is a farmer and the family was at home when the incident happened. Villagers, on hearing the commotion, managed to catch hold of one of the men, who later told police that he was part of a gang of contract killers, who had been hired by the woman's neighbour to kill her. On interrogation, the man told police that Prajapati's neighbour, Charanjeet Singh, 20, had suspected the woman of practising witchcraft and was afraid that she would do 'something bad' to him. He further claimed that Singh's father had died of cancer last year and he believed that the disease had come about because of his neighbour's 'witchcraft.' Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Bulandshahr, Santosh Singh, said that the contract killers had struck a Rs 2 lakh deal with the woman's neighbour for killing her and had received Rs 50,000 in advance from him. "As part of the plan, they had started purchasing milk from Prajapati and were waiting for the right moment to kill her." The SSP added, "An FIR of murder has been filed against the neighbour and the three contract killers. Police teams have been formed to nab the other suspects who are on the run."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-38-shot-dead-while-milking-cow-on-suspicion-of-practising-witchcraft-in-up/articleshow/87896702.cms||Ishita Mishra

Many such cases came to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic. With an aim to avoid such hardships in future, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) has launched a web-based process of e-nomination by the member. The Aadhaar based e-nomination will make claim settlement fast and easy without requiring the kin of the deceased to visit the office. The ministry of labour and employment mandated e-nomination of EPFO subscribers. “The subscriber just needs to add his or her picture and those of their nominee along with Aadhar numbers and bank account details. Afterwards, the claims can be made online by submitting their Aadhar-linked phone numbers,” said Manoj Yadav, regional provident fund commissioner-I, Vadodara. “In Vadodara region we have 5.72 lakh are active contributors. In the last two months, we have covered 30,000 subscribers and we have set a target of covering 100 % active contributors by December 31 through our e-nomination drive,” he said. The office is settling nearly 60% claims within three days and 95 % claims within ten days, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/epfo-aims-to-cover-5-72l-workers-by-dec/articleshow/87897234.cms||---

In certain cases a non-bailable warrant too has been issued, while a court has declared him a proclaimed offender. “SC has given a blanket order not to arrest him, therefore we will seek clarification from the apex court on December 6,’’ he added. When asked if Singh is in touch with either the Mumbai police or the DGP and whether he has expressed desire to report to the law-enforcing agencies, the IPS officer said there is no such information. “Ever since he proceeded on leave, we have no information on his whereabouts. There is no communication from him,” he said. The IPS officer said if his address is found or communicated to the police, the Mumbai police will ask him to join the investigation. “We will follow the process of law and order issued by the SC,” he said. The Chandigarh police told TOI on Wednesday evening that they had no information about Singh’s presence in the city. Police said that their Mumbai counterparts had a few days back conducted searches in Chandigarh to trace Singh, but in vain. Sources in the police said they expect Singh has already left Chandigarh. A crowd of mediapersons on Wednesday gathered outside a Sector 27 house in Chandigarh, which is home to Singh’s close relatives. When the crowd outside the house grew huge, a relative denied that the house was a residence of IPS officer Param Bir Singh. Instead, the relative said, the house belonged to Param Bir’s brother, who lives there with his family. “Param Bir Singh does not live in the house and did not come here,” said the relative and urged the media not to disturb the family by inquiring about Singh again and again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/singh-has-not-contacted-us-yet-say-mumbai-cops/articleshow/87898325.cms||---

Kotwali SHO Sanjeev Kumar said that SP youth wing city president Neeraj Yadav and two others have been booked under 505 (1) (B) IPC for putting up these banners. The posters carried the images of SP members, including district president Neeraj Yadav, national secretary Suhail Abrar and member of national committee Komal Gurjar. On the top, with pictures of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav, a question was being asked: "If the Jewar airport is being inaugurated now… when will the BJP government sell it?" It also mentioned that only Akhilesh can save this airport from being sold. Police immediately took them down. “Pasting such posters is a criminal offence and we have filed a case against all those local office bearers in the banner,” the SHO added. Commenting on the removal of posters and FIR against him, Neeraj Yadav said, “Even BJP has posters across the city criticising the last government.

---||Mumbai||Ex-Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh’s private secretary had never demanded money: Sachin Waze to panel||MUMBAI: Dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze on Wednesday told the Justice K U Chandiwal commission probing ex-Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande had never made any demand for money from him. “Palande had never made any demand for (sic) communication of any money for any reason,” Waze told Shekhar Jagtap, Palande’s counsel, during his cross-examination. Waze’s statement assumes importance in view of Singh’s letter to the CM of March 20. In the letter, Singh had submitted that Deshmukh had told Waze at his official residence in mid-February to mobilize Rs 100 crore from 1,750 bars and restaurants. Singh had mentioned in his letter that Palande was present during discussion. Further, Waze told the commission that he knew Palande but had no personal acquaintance or friendship with him. However, he admitted that he did meet Palande at Deshmukh’s official residence. “There was no interaction with Palande on the (then) ongoing probe conducted by me or CIU (crime intelligence unit),” Waze said. On Tuesday, Waze had told the commission he was reinstated at the instance of Anil Deshmukh and not by Singh, while on Wednesday, he said that barring his statement, he has no other record to establish that the former home minister had recommended his reinstatement. Following Singh’s letter, the NCP had sacked Anil Deshmukh, and Central agencies including ED, CBI and income-tax department initiated a probe. The CBI has already registered an offence against Deshmukh, and he has been arrested by ED. Palande too has been arrested by ED. Anukul Seth, appearing for Singh, said that since he does not wish to cross-examine any person and lead further evidence before the commission, his personal appearance is not necessary. Singh’s lawyer Abhinav Chandrachud has informed the panel that the letter is based on hearsay and on information given by his subordinates and colleagues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ex-home-ministers-pa-had-never-demanded-money-waze-to-panel/articleshow/87898313.cms||---

The train will be pressed into service from Friday, said an official release. TOI on November 15, carried a report on how scores of students and office-goers were being affected due to the cancellation of the train. Raj Somani, a railway activist, said, the timings of the restored DEMU train were convenient to the students and the working population that commute daily between Aurangabad and nearby areas. “We welcome the move to restore the DEMU train. We expect that SCR authorities will not take such unilateral decisions in the future that will have a drastic impact on the passengers,” Somani said. As per the official announcement, the Nanded-Manmad DEMU train (07777), will depart from Nanded daily at 7.25pm and is expected to reach the destination at 5.50am on the next day. In the return direction, the train (07778) will leave Manmad at 6.10am daily and is scheduled to reach Nanded at 3.20pm. As per the official timetable, the train is slated to reach Aurangabad at 8.35am daily after leaving Manmad and will halt there for five minutes before proceeding for the further journey.

The police identified the accused as Deepak Dinesh, 33, of Pathanapuram in Kollam. His arrest was recorded at Pettah police station. The police said that Deepak Dinesh was an employee of a Saudi Arabia based IT company. He worked at its branch office located under Pettah police station limits as accountant manager. Since last year, he had been allegedly siphoning small amounts of money from the salary accounts of the employees in his branch. Recently, the company management found out that discrepancies in the accounts and on further audit, they realised that a total amount of Rs 2.5 crore has been siphoned from the employees' salary account to the account of the accused. Following this, they filed a complaint before the police. Soon, the accused absconded to evade the arrest. He had been staying at various hideouts across Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then. He was caught from his hideout at Punalur in Kollam district by a special team led by Pettah station house officer Riyas Raja and sub inspectors Ratheesh and Sunil were also part of the team. The arrest was made based on a tip off received by Shangumugham assistant commissioner D K Prithwiraj.

---||Delhi||50% Covaxin efficacy may not be as bad as it seems||NEW DELHI: A study conducted by AIIMS has shown that two doses of Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine developed by Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with Bharat Biotech, is 50% effective in preventing symptomatic infection due to Covid-19. This is lower than the 77.8% efficacy claimed by Bharat Biotech after phase 3 trials of the vaccine. However, there’s a caveat for the differing efficacy figures. The phase 3 trials looked at vaccine effectiveness in the general population, while the AIIMS study involved doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who were working in the hospital setting and, therefore, had a greater exposure to the coronavirus. Also, the study was conducted between April 15 and May 15, when the second Covid wave was at its peak in India and nearly 80% of the infection was caused by the Delta variant, which is known to have a higher rate of breakthrough infections compared with the other variants. Dr Naveet Wig, professor and head of medicine, AIIMS, told TOI that it was actually a positive finding that Covaxin was effective in preventing symptomatic infection in 50% of the subjects in the middle of the tsunami of cases, that too in the hospital environs. “It means the vaccine works,” he said. The study, results of which were published in top medical journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, involved 2,714 hospital employees who were symptomatic and underwent RT-PCR testing for Covid between April 15 and May 15 despite full vaccination. Of them, 1,617 (60%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 1,097 returned negative results, the study says. When the positive cases were matched with the negative cases to remove confounding factors such as age and gender, the adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid after two doses of Covaxin with the second dose administered 14 or more days before undergoing RT-PCR testing turned out to be 50%. An AIIMS doctor explained that if one were to look at the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventive symptomatic infection now, when the infection rate is low, it would likely be very high. “Vaccine effectiveness increases as more and more people are protected. This is because the viral load in the environment reduces, lowering the risk of the disease spreading,” she said. Dr Manish Soneja, additional professor of medicine, AIIMS, said the study offered a more complete picture of how Covaxin, which is also referred to as BBV152, performs in the field and the possible immune evasive potential of the delta variant. “Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that rapid vaccine rollout programmes remain the most promising path to pandemic control while public health policies must continue to include additional protective measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing,” Soneja said. The authors acknowledge several limitations in the study. Most importantly, this study does not estimate the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation, severe disease and death. Additionally, the study was not designed to estimate vaccine effectiveness for different time intervals after vaccination or to determine if vaccine effectiveness changed over time. Another limitation was the absence of data on comorbidities and prior Covid infection, all of which could affect health-seeking behaviour and vaccine effectiveness. Covaxin, which is formulated from an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen, was approved for emergency use in India in January for people aged 18 and above. WHO added the vaccine to its list of approved emergency-use Covid vaccines on November 3. A WHO statement said, “Technical Advisory Group, convened by WHO and made up of regulatory experts from around the world, has determined that the vaccine meets WHO standards for protection against Covid-19, that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs risks and the vaccine can be used globally.” Covaxin is also under consideration for vaccination of kids in India, subject to the approval of the designated authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-covaxin-efficacy-may-not-be-as-bad-as-it-seems/articleshow/87898321.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Supreme Court reimposes ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR||NEW DELHI: Not leaving it to the wind factor or the act of God to reduce air pollution, the Supreme Court on Wednesday re-imposed ban on all construction activities in Delhi and the national capital region (NCR) and asked the states to pay minimum wages to all construction workers disengaged because of the ban from the building construction welfare fund. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant said, "we re-impose the ban on the construction activities in the NCR subject to the following two conditions - Non-polluting activities relating to construction such as the plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry are allowed to be continued; States shall use the funds which have been collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers to provide them subsistence for the period during which construction activities are prohibited and pay wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act for the respective categories of workers." Bowing to the concern expressed by the SC over severe air pollution in Delhi and NCR, the Delhi government had imposed a ban on construction activities till November 21 and thereafter did not renew the ban taking into account slight improvement in the air quality. Disapproving the fire-fighting measures taken by authorities only after the ambient air quality worsened to severe category, the bench said the governments and authorities in the Centre, and governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan must prepare a statistical model about air pollution during different seasons taking into account last five years data and devise preventive measures to be taken in anticipation of possible deterioration of air quality index. "We direct that instead of waiting for the air quality to deteriorate before initiating action under the graded response plan, necessary measures must be put into place in anticipation of a deterioration of air quality," it said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre fully supports the SC's suggestions and directions to make residents of Delhi and NCR breathe better air. During the hearing it observed, ""This is the national capital. What message are we sending across the globe? Why should Delhiites come to a situation to suffer severe levels of pollution. We must anticipate and take preventive measures. We will keep monitoring the situation through periodic hearings on this petition." To enable authorities to take measures against anticipated hike in pollution during different seasons, the bench said, "For this purpose, it is necessary for the Commission (for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas) to engage expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modelling. The Commission must commission a scientific study of air quality based on available data of previous years bearing upon recorded levels of air pollution." The CJI-led bench said, "The study must factor in seasonal variations and other relevant parameters. Once a scientific model is available, which factors in wind velocity as well as natural and man-made phenomena, the graded response plan can be modulated to provide for measures being taken in advance, based on anticipated changes in air quality without waiting for the air quality to deteriorate." "On this basis steps can be planned at least a week in advance and even earlier, based on anticipated levels of air pollution in the foreseeable future. The Commission shall carry out the above exercise within a month and report the steps taken for compliance with this direction," the bench said and posted further hearing of the matter on November 29. FARM FIRES:When petitioner Aditya Dubey's counsel Vikas Singh complained that because of forthcoming Assembly elections, the Punjab government has not stopped farmers from burning stubble, penalised them not have they given the incentives to farmers to dissuade them from burning the crop residue. The bench said, "the farm fire problem has to be tackled on a long term basis, but there has to be a systematic approach. We are using only common sense to discuss the issues. What is the bureaucracy at the Centre and the states doing? Can't they go to the fields and talk to the farmers to evolve a long-term solution to the stubble issue? Let the secretaries of these states sit together, involve scientists and find a solution to the recurring problem." "Farm fires are going to be a problem for the entire country in future and not only for these three four states. The problem is the hardship faced by farmers in disposing of stubble," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-reimposes-ban-on-construction-activities/articleshow/87898328.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Review of China trade via security prism: Foreign secretary||NEW DELHI: While acknowledging India's trade ties with China, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Wednesday that there were outstanding issues related to the military standoff in eastern Ladakh that needed to be addressed before the two countries could get back into a "normal relationship mode". Shringla also said the government was carefully examining options related to India's trade and investment ties with China to ensure India's security and integrity remained intact. "Trade continues, there are investment ties that continue but all of this has to be examined very carefully and the government is examining all these options very, very carefully to ensure that our integrity and security remain intact," he said. India and China are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh and India has repeatedly said it's important to resolve the issue for overall development of ties. Shringla said China had maintained an aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions along the border in eastern Ladakh and that wasn't conducive to peace and security. "And as a result, we are not able to conduct normal relations. Having said that, of course, trade continues, import and export continues, China continues to be an economic partner," he said. "But obviously we need to today evaluate whether we are over extended in terms of our supply chains, in terms of our investment tie-ups, in terms of the technology that we get," he said, speaking at a seminar. "We need to examine all of those very carefully to see that it is in keeping with our larger strategic and security interests and that obviously, as we move forward, our own economy grows, our own interactions grow," Shringla said, adding India had to ensure that it was not vulnerable in any way. "We have resolved some of the (border) issues but there are still some outstanding issues and until we can resolve those issues, obviously we will not be in a normal relationship mode," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/review-of-china-trade-via-security-prism-foreign-secretary/articleshow/87899712.cms||---

The UPPCB headquarters in Lucknow will, however, take the final call on the proposal. According to officials, the factory located on the Panipat Road in Shamli produces compounds such as ferrous sulphate powder and magnesium sulphate, among others. During an inspection, a PCB team found the factory violating pollution control norms and proposed a fine of Rs 7,12,500 to be imposed on it, said officials. Confirming the move, PCB's Shamli-based regional officer Ankit Singh said, “The action is part of the ongoing crackdown on polluting industries operating in violation of the rules and regulations set by the authorities to check pollution across the state. The factory was found guilty of emitting hazardous gases in excess — beyond the prescribed limits.” “The fine was calculated on a per-day basis since the factory was constructed. The PCB has also sent a notice to the factory owners and if they give satisfactory answers to the points raised, the fine amount can be reduced,” added Singh. The pollution control board swung into action following the directives of the newly constituted Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, the most powerful body constituted to protect and improve the quality of air in Delhi and surrounding regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/pcb-propose-rs-7l-fine-on-chemical-factory-for-emitting-hazardous-gases-in-shamli/articleshow/87896749.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Room, banquet hall demand at peak for vibrant summit||AHMEDABAD: After a year of the post-lockdown slump and little business for the hospitality sector, hoteliers are set to rake in the moolah in 2022.  With the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) 2022 to be held in Gandhinagar in January, rooms and suites at hotels across Ahmedabad have already been booked for the January 10-12 period, the time of the summit. Some hotels have been booked from a couple of days in advance. “The overall market is strong and we’re expecting good business during VGGS. Inquiries have begun pouring in and some rooms have already been earmarked for the event,” said Aveek Sengupta, general manager, Taj Skyline. On booking portals, several five-star hotels in the city are completely sold out from January 9 till January 12, as the rooms have been blocked for VGGS delegates, embassies, trade bodies and companies. “Inquiries from Japanese and Korean companies have begun and we’re looking to finalize bookings over the next couple of weeks. The first quarter of 2022 looks robust not just with the Vibrant Gujarat summit but also a couple of other events taking place later,” said Jay Sudhakaran, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad. The average daily rate (ADR) in Ahmedabad has touched Rs 4,000 per room per night at five-star hotels. With high demand and limited supply, hotel tariffs are expected to run high. From January 9 to 12, tariffs have already crossed Rs 15,000 per room per night and in some cases have gone up to as high as Rs 30,000 per room per night, industry sources say. As the dates draw near and room inventory shrinks, hotels are expected to further raise tariffs. Hoteliers are up for big business as after VGGS 2022, the Indian Foundry Congress and Defence Expo are to be held in Gandhinagar. Hoteliers say VGGS 2022 will also be a confidence booster for travellers. “As an investment summit of this scale takes place in Gandhinagar, the confidence of travellers will return. The event will not just give a boost to hotels but will also help travellers be more confident of travelling after it, which will greatly help the hospitality sector,” said Neelabh Chug, general manager, Renaissance Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/room-banquet-hall-demand-at-peak-for-vibrant-summit/articleshow/87897642.cms||Niyati Parikh

But two years on, the government is yet to enact the law, revealing the official apathy towards safety of women in Maharashtra,” she said. Addressing reporters here, Khadse said the vacant post of the chairperson of Maharashtra State Commission for Women was filled by the government after a long gap of one-and-a-half years only when BJP took up the issue. “The state has witnessed a spate of incidents in which women were subjected to brutal atrocities and heinous crimes. Given such shameful incidents, the silence and inaction of the MVA government is highly deplorable,” the BJP leader said. Khadse, who represents the Raver Lok Sabha constituency in Jalgaon district, said the MVA government has no moral right to remain in power when the feeling of insecurity among women is constantly growing. “It is evident that the government wants women to be confined to their homes. It will not be surprising if women are compelled to take the law in their hands in the days to come if the government fails to ensure their safety,” she said. Khadse, who is the daughter-in-law of former Cabinet minister Eknath Khadse, also alleged that the MVA government failed to ratify different schemes and programmes of the Centre for women’s welfare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/khadse-criticises-mva-over-delay-in-enacting-shakti-law/articleshow/87895985.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Congress wants no-poaching pact ahead of BMC polls||MUMBAI: Even as the Congress has said that it will fight the upcoming BMC polls alone, the party is now seeking a ‘no-poaching’ pact among the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners, Shiv Sena and NCP, to prevent a possible party hopping by corporators and aspiring candidates. The Congress has said that in a bid to prevent poaching, an understanding must be reached between MVA partners, Shiv Sena in particular, before the BMC polls so that Congress corporators don’t jump over to the Sena and vice versa.“Even though the Congress has said that we will go it alone in the BMC polls, the issue of a no-poaching pact will be discussed within the MVA leaders for the BMC polls. This will ensure that there is no displeasure and discontent among the MVA partners even if the BMC polls are being fought alone,” said Charan Singh Sapra, working president of the Mumbai Congress. While Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap has maintained that he is not in favour of an alliance with the Sena for the BMC elections, Sena strategists have said that instead of a formal alliance, the party may have an ‘understanding’ with the Congress in key areas to defeat the BJP. Political analysts said that with the redrawing of ward boundaries, there would be large-scale poaching with several corporators and aspiring candidates jumping parties to get tickets. “In this scenario, a no-poaching pact will help the MVA against the BJP. This will also help them in case they form an alliance after the elections in the BMC,” said an analyst. A senior Sena functionary said that it would be difficult to adjust the Congress in an alliance since the Sena has for decades contested over 150 seats in the 227-member BMC. “The Congress will not concede fewer than 80-100 seats,” the functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-wants-no-poaching-pact-ahead-of-bmc-polls/articleshow/87899251.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Need govt job? Sign affidavit against dowry in Bijnor||BIJNOR: The sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Bijnor "in an initiative to fight the social evil of dowry", has started asking youths visiting his office for verification of various documents required for applying to or joining government jobs, to first sign an "anti-dowry" affidavit. "If you want documents verified for government job, you will have to give it in writing that you will not take dowry,” announces the notice by SDM Devendra Singh issued in his personal capacity. Youths coming in for the attestation of their documents have no option but to sign the pledge. Singh, who started the initiative on Tuesday, said, “The aim is to weed out dowry from society. The Dowry Prohibition Act is already in force. Under it, dowry includes property, goods or money given during marriage by parents of either party or by anyone else. Despite the Act, many people still indulge in it." Singh clarified that making the youths give such affidavits is his "personal decision" and it has nothing to do with state authorities. "I hope this decision of mine will have a psychological impact on the youths and will discourage them from accepting dowry when they get married,” the SDM said. Since the initiative began, two men who were selected for the Indian Army have already acquiesced. One of them, Shah Faisal, was the first to do it. In his affidavit, Faisal, a resident of Tappa Nangal in the district, wrote: “I am unmarried, and I will not take any dowry whenever I get married.” Singh's other move: people booked for breach of peace are being readily granted bail on the condition that they would plant trees. He said, "So far, nearly 12 people have given such affidavits. Their plantation work will be inspected randomly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/need-govt-job-sign-affidavit-against-dowry-in-bijnor/articleshow/87896777.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: 14-year-old girl raped by neighbour, delivers baby||MADURAI: The child welfare committee (CWC) in Theni on Tuesday evening asked the district police to initiate action against a 27-year-old man from a village near Andipatti for raping a 14-year-old girl, resulting in her delivering a baby girl two weeks ago. The incident came to light when the girl approached the CWC to hand over the newborn as she would not be able to raise her. CWC member B Pandiaraja said the girl had stated that a few months ago her neighbour Perumal gave her some food laced with sedatives and raped her. The matter came to light a couple of months ago when her mother took her to a government-run ‘Amma Maruthuvamanai’ as she was falling ill. “The girl said that only then did she come to know that she was pregnant and that she was in her seventh month of pregnancy,” the member said. She gave birth to the girl in a government hospital. The CWC directed the Theni district police to initiate action against Perumal under sections of Pocso Act and file action taken report within 15 days. The baby was sent to a home in Tuticorin for temporary care. In another incident, a couple surrendered their newborn girl for adoption through the cradle baby scheme as they would not be able to raise her. They claimed that they have a girl child and that the mother of the children is mentally unstable. According to the CWC, both the newborns would be available for adoption soon.

During the raids, 26 phones, 156 SIM cards, a laptop and over 100 ATM cards were seized. Around 111 bank accounts were frozen during the investigation. The gang created fake websites, promoted them through search engine optimization and flashed fake customer care numbers to dupe people. DCP KPS Malhotra said, “The victims were steered towards installing malicious apps. After gaining access to the victim’s phone, the fraudsters obtained OTP messages and even netbanking. The raids were conducted in Bengaluru, West Bengal and Jharkhand.” The West Bengal module was the logistics service provider for the syndicate and various other online cheating gangs and arranged for SIM cards and bank accounts. The Jamtara module in this case was busted from Bengaluru. “This indicates that these modules are shifting bases to other states. Their links have been found in over 1,000 cases across India. The mastermind, Muslim Ansari, based in Jamtara was in contact with different modules with layers of communication between them,” said Malhotra. IFSO started a probe after receiving a complaint from a victim. He claimed that he had a cheque-related query so he searched for the customer care number of Canara Bank and got the number 988322**** through Google. When he called the number, he was provided a link, www.customercomplaintregisters.com, for lodging his complaint. The website was similar to the official bank website. Acting on the instructions from the fraudsters posing as bank executives, the complainant filed his account details. Following the steps provided on the website, an application/malware was automatically downloaded on his mobile phone and Rs 27.1 lakh was fraudulently transferred from his bank account to eight other accounts. An FIR was registered based on the victim’s complaint and a team comprising ACP Raman Lamba and inspectors Kuldeep and Arun started the probe. Technical investigation and human intelligence uncovered that this module was operating at a pan-India level. The first raid was conducted in Bengaluru and six accused, all residents of Jamtara in Jharkhand, were arrested. The arrested men — Mujahid Ansari, Asif Ansari, Gulab Ansari, Shahnawaz Ansari, Baharuddin Ansari and Basaruddin Ansari — are in judicial custody. They would act as authorised bank officials and misguide victims to follow the steps on their malicious website, thereby installing an app/malware on his mobile phone and gain access to incoming SMSs and netbanking. They would then siphon off the money. Subsequently, raids were conducted in West Bengal and Jamtara and five people — Sahani Khan, Abubakar Saha, Rajesh Ghorai, Suraj Saha and Mijanur Ansari — were arrested. On November 23, the mastermind, Muslim Ansari, was arrested and taken on remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pan-india-gang-wiped-out-bank-a/cs-with-malicious-apps-busted/articleshow/87898379.cms||---

One can witness more cattle on the roads between 6am and 4pm and then in the night,” said S Selvakumar of Anna Nagar. Impounded animals are kept in the corporation shelters. In 2019, the owners were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as fine and Rs 1,000 each for every day that the animal remained in the corporation's custody. But, in spite of the action taken, the animals continue to roam on the roads in large numbers. “If the impounding is done on a daily basis, the cattle population on the roads can be reduced. But it is done only twice or thrice a month,” said A Asokan of Bibikulam.The corporation has constituted a team of volunteers of bull tamers with the help of Blue Cross to catch stray cattle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-to-auction-stray-cattle-if-owners-fail-to-claim-them-in-three-days/articleshow/87898365.cms||---
---||Trichy||As more rain looms, CM tells collectors to prevent havoc||Trichy: Chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday discussed preparedness for the upcoming heavy spells of northeast monsoon at a review meeting with district collectors through video conferencing from Chennai. The areas of focus at the nearly two-hour-long meeting were the northern and coastal districts where the low pressure is anticipated to bring heavy and very heavy rain in the next two days. A senior official said that the chief minister advised the collectors to make the best efforts to save the public from unfortunate incidents caused by the rain. Villupuram collector D Mohan told Stalin that 57 teams have been formed to undertake relief and rehabilitation measures in the district. He assured the CM that the district administration will increase the number of relief shelters to ensure accommodation for all displaced people. Immediate evacuation of people from low-lying areas irrespective of water stagnation, ensuring uninterrupted electricity supply with the help of generators and keeping basic amenities ready for the people and their livestock at shelters were among Stalin’s important instructions. Tuticorin collector K Senthil Raj said the CM asked them to shift cattle also along with people living in low-lying areas. “The CM emphasised on shifting cattle as their owners will not be ready to leave them and relocate to the temporary shelters,” he said. Nagappattinam district collector Dr A Arun Thamburaj has been told to ensure safety of fishermen by alerting them on time to return from sea. Collectors of Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappatinam and Mayiladuthurai besides Trichy were instructed to take all precautions to prevent severe damage to crops. Since rain water stagnation submerged several thousands of acres of samba paddy fields in the delta districts in the recent rain, Stalin advised the collectors to put in place adequate safeguards to avoid rainwater damaging agriculture fields.

---||Trichy||Stone idol stolen from Trichy temple||Trichy: A Chandikeswarar stone idol was stolen from Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple at Chathirapatti near Thuvarankurichi on the outskirts of Trichy on Monday night. Police suspect that the incident took place on Monday after the priest closed the temple after the puja hours. Chandikeswarar temple was outside the temple. The temple is said to be several centuries old. The theft came to light when the temple priest Karthikeyan opened the premises on Tuesday morning. The temple, run by a private trust, is situated on Thuvarankurichi to Natham Road at Chathirapatti near Azhagupuri close to Thuvarankurichi. Acting on the complaint, the Thuvarankurichi police inspector Jaisankar registered an idol theft case. Jaisankar said on Wednesday that the no security system was in place in the temple, which is situated in a spot where the movement of the people is rare. The police also suspect that the stone idol might have been stolen by those who were constructing new temples. The police said that there was a practice of stealing the idols of Vinayagar and Chandikeswarar from the ancient temples to install them in newly constructed temples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stone-idol-stolen-from-trichy-temple/articleshow/87898374.cms||---
---||Madurai||Hike in GST on textiles will wreck industry: Merchants||Madurai: The Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association has said that the increase in GST on textiles and garments from 5% to 12% from January 1, next year would impact the industry badly and render crores of people dependent on this industry jobless.In a representation to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union finance minister Nirmala Sithraman, Union minister for textiles and others, secretary of the association, Ashraf Tayub said that the recommendations of the 45th GST council to increase the GST on textiles could have a colossal negative impact and affect the total textile and garment industry and lead to the closure of lakhs of factories and shops. This in turn could cause unemployment to crores of people dependent on this industry.Eighty five per cent of the textile and garment shops are in the small and medium sectors and have a turnover of less than Rs 40 lakh per annum and they are not in the GST ambit. But, all of them pay GST on their purchases. The existing 5% GST is fully borne by the traders and industries and not passed to the customers. If the GST is increased, it would lead to inflation and they would not be able to compete with the larger stores and would be forced to close down.Small and medium textile and garment retailers constituting about 65% of the Indian market are already suffering due to competition from the conglomerates, which have penetrated even the smallest cities and towns.This is an industry which employs lakhs of uneducated, illiterate and physically challenged people. Job losses in this sector could impact other trades like restaurants, hotels, travel and packagingHe said that the government should increase the threshold limit of GST to more than Rs 2 crore turnover and allow inter-state transportation of goods for non-GST small traders and industries also. This would boost free sales across the country, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hike-in-gst-on-textiles-will-wreck-industry-merchants/articleshow/87898381.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Day 3: Govt schools see higher attendance||AHMEDABAD: Since Monday, when the state government gave the go-ahead for schools to reopen for Classes 1 to 5, a clear divide has been starkly visible in “offline class” attendance between government schools and private schools. On Wednesday the state education department reported 42.37% attendance in schools located in remote places, small and large towns and even in cities, while in case of private schools, the attendance was 16%. Elaborating on government school attendance for Classes 6 to 8, an official said, “The overall attendance is 60.1%. The highest attendance for Classes 1 to 5 was 59.4% in Navsari district. The lowest was noticed in the municipal-run schools in Ahmedabad with just 24% attendance. Also the lowest attendance for Classes 6 to 8 was recorded in Chhota Udepur, with just 29% children attending school.” The districts which witnessed more than 50% attendance in government schools were Tapi (54.64%), Surat (51%), Devbhumi Dwarka (50.4%) and Bharuch (50.2%). Coming to attendance for Classes 1 to 5 in private schools in cities, Surat recorded the highest at 18.8%. Vadodara saw 8% and Rajkot saw 7.8% attendance while Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar combined saw 8% attendance. Devbhoomi Dwarka district reported the highest attendance for Classes 1 to 5 with 35.7% children attending school. A senior state government official claimed, “There seems to be a clear digital divide between children attending private and government schools. Often families have one smart phone which is not available to children all of the time. There are connectivity issues too. Sending children to school is the best option in small towns and villages.” However, Gujarat government school teachers’ association president Digvijay Jadeja countered the digital divide argument, “In many private schools the official note is yet to be issued to parents. One should wait for a few days to see attendance improve.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/day-3-govt-schools-see-higher-attendance/articleshow/87897645.cms||---
---||Goa||Sunburn will not be allowed in Goa this year, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that the electronic dance music (EDM) festival Sunburn won’t happen in Goa this year. However, tourism minister Manohar Agjaonkar said that once Goa’s eligible population is covered with both doses of the vaccine, the festival can be held in January or February next year. After the CM, post-cabinet meeting, said that it has been decided not to grant permission for the festival, Ajgaonkar said he hadn’t been informed about the decision. However, he added that it was the “right decision” given the pandemic situation. “We have not given permission to hold Sunburn this time,” said Sawant. “We are not having Sunburn this year. I have cancelled it. I have already made the note on the file and have sent it back.” The festival organisers had announced on October 24 that they would hold the EDM on December 28, 29 and 30 this year at Vagator, with limited entry. Ajgaonkar explained that he had sent the proposal to hold Sunburn for the chief minister’s approval, as he felt the situation was conducive for it. “Whether any event should take place or not, the final call is with the CM,” he said.  “There is a pandemic, and he knows better what the exact situation is like. We had approved the file and sent it to the CM to take the call. CM must have taken the decision because he thinks the situation is not right for it. According to me, the situation was right.” He said that at Sunburn, the crowd runs in lakhs. “We should not think of profit and loss at this moment,” he said. “We have to give priority to save Goans’ lives. Once the entire Goa population is covered with both doses of the vaccine, any event can take place in the state. Until then, we are not safe. If the vaccination target is achieved by January-February, the event can take place. Those coming in for the fest should also have taken both doses. The show must go on.” He said the chief minister has possibly taken the decision respecting the wishes of the local people. “What the people want has to happen in the end,” Ajgaonkar said. “The CM has taken the decision by studying the entire situation. I cannot take any decision on my own without the CM’s approval. CM had not told me that he would not give approval. His decision is final.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sunburn-will-not-be-allowed-in-goa-this-year-says-cm/articleshow/87898370.cms||---

In collaboration with Indo-German Development Cooperation, a total of 56 cities were ranked based on 75 indicators under 14 major pillars including health, education and sustainability. While Shimla, Coimbatore and Chandigarh secured the top three spots, Trichy with a net score of 70 out of 100 marks came eighth, Chennai 11th and Madurai 26th. The SDG framework scrutinised 14 goals by analysing relevant and authentic data of cities sourced from various ministries, the national crime records bureau (NCRB) and national family health survey (NFHS). PwD-friendly infrastructure, crimes such as murder and kidnapping, air quality and water quality level as well as literacy rate of women in the cities were analysed. Marks were tabulated separately for each pillar including clean water and sanitation, gender equality, economic growth, peace, justice and strong institutions. Apart from securing a position in the top 10 urban areas list, Trichy was graded a frontrunner urban area by the SDG urban. While Trichy scored well in terms of “no poverty’, quality education, peace, affordable and clean energy, it scored very poorly in clean water and sanitation, health and economic growth. Trichy has been ranked 44th among 56 cities in drinking water quality, stormwater drain management and presence of sewage treatment plants. Despite river Cauvery flowing through the city, lack of focus on clean water and sanitation was exposed by the ranking. The city scored very low in “decent work and economic growth” which include availability of bank ATMs, banking outlets and skill training facilities. “Despite having a strong air, rail and road connectivity, industrial and skill development scenario in Trichy has not improved on par with the western Tamil Nadu. We need investment in the IT sector to generate employment opportunities,” Dr M A Aleem, member, Trichy district welfare fund committee, said. In gender equality and peacefulness, the city has outperformed most of its counterparts by securing rank 11 and 5 respectively. High women’s literacy and emphasis on girl children education as well as less crime rate were advantages of the city. “After the completion of ongoing smart cities mission projects, Trichy’s position on various parameters including sustainability and clean water will improve. Securing one of the top 10 ranks among 56 strong participants is an achievement,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-ranks-8-in-nitis-sustainable-devpt-goals/articleshow/87898384.cms||Deepak Karthik

The doctors managed to retrieve two kidneys, two lungs and liver from her body. While the kidneys and liver were transplanted in Ahmedabad, the lungs were sent to Hyderabad by chartered flight, said Civil Hospital officials. “Basuben Kalasva, a resident of Dungarpur, had met with an accident last week.

Her condition deteriorated further after which she was brought to Ahmedabad,” said an official. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that it was the 20th body donation in the past 10 months. “In all, about 68 organs were retrieved through which 54 lives have been saved.

The registration has already started and the CM appealed to senior citizens to apply on the e-district portal to avail the scheme. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has also decided to add Velankanni Church in Tamil Nadu to the list of pilgrimages and Christian devotees will be able to avail free pilgrimage to the religious destination. Over 36,000 people have taken benefit of the scheme, which was on hold due to Covid pandemic but has now been restarted. “There used to be 12 listed routes to where the people could avail the free pilgrimage under the scheme. The shrines included Puri, Dwarka, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Rameshwaram, Shirdi and Ajmer Sharif among other holy sites. Now, Ayodhya has been added to the list as well. One can choose any site of their preference out of these to go on pilgrimage and apply. Senior citizens of Delhi can take benefit of this scheme,” said Kejriwal. In a press conference, he also announced that more trains will be used if required to ensure that all applicants are taken on the pilgrimage to Ayodhya. The CM said: “You must not worry that if there are too many applications, then yours will be left out. I will ensure everyone gets to visit. If there are more people than the capacity of the train, then we will put another train on the route. If there are still more applicants, then we will put in a third train. The train may leave after a week, but will take everyone.” The CM said the government decided to include Velankanni Church in Tamil Nadu in the list on the demands from Christians. “We are going to include Velankanni Church in the list of pilgrimage very soon and you will also be able to go on pilgrimage as per your wish,” he stated.

Minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad has announced that the ministry of earth sciences has given its nod to the installation of the C-band Doppler radar at the earliest. A letter issued by the ministry concerned, however, is silent on the type of radar and mentions only “one Doppler weather radar.” Weather expert Kiran Johare, who had written a letter to the Centre on April 3 demanding X-band Doppler radar for Marathwada, said the Centre has offered a raw deal for Aurangabad by promising C-band Doppler radar. “Since the beginning, we are demanding X-band Doppler radar for Marathwada. The desired system is necessary to study minute weather changes and issue necessary warnings and forecast,” he said. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Astrospace Science Centre said the X- band radars operate on a wavelength of 2.5 cm-4 cm and a frequency of 8 GHz-12 GHz. “Because of the smaller wavelength, the X band radar is more sensitive and can detect smaller particles,” he said. K K Dakhore, agricultural meteorologist with Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada University, said the Centre should install X-band Doppler radar at Aurangabad. “Considering the geographical spread of Marathwada and neighbouring districts, long range weather observation is required using the Doppler radar. Therefore, X-band Doppler radar is desirous,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/c-band-doppler-radar-approved-for-aurangabad/articleshow/87896011.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why primary students may have to wait longer for return to school||NEW DELHI: Even as Delhi government has announced the resumption of classes from November 29 following the improvement in the city’s air, the first to return will be the middle school students and those of classes IX and XI. Term 1 exams for classes X and XII are underway, and it will be some time before the primary school students in private schools restart classes. At Mount Abu Public School, principal Jyoti Arora said, “Exams are going on and we have to accommodate 12 examinees in one classroom. This requires a lot of space. So, even with 50% of the other students being accommodated, we cannot have more than 2-3 classes per day.” The Indian School is calling students of classes IX and XI for practicals and those from classes VI-VIII. “As earlier, the hybrid model will continue and students will come to school only twice or thrice a week,” said Tania Joshi, principal. “As for the junior students, we have to see how many parents will consent to send them back.” Sudha Acharya, chairperson, National Progressive Schools Conference and principal, ITL Public School, similarly said that intricate planning for classes was necessary, especially with the exams in subjects starting soon. But school associations, like Action Committee, said schools had to be reopened now. “I urge the parents to support the schools in resuming classes,” said Bharat Arora, general secretary, Action Committee. “Most member schools in our organisation and allied organisations have received approval from parents to resume the transport facility. Before the pollution break, most rural schools in our organisation reported good attendance.” Many parents said that with children going to school once a week, reopening isn’t a problem. As parent Ravi Khatri said, “The coronavirus is in check, the air quality has improved, so keeping the kids away from school will only affect them psychologically.” However, Delhi Parents’ Association has issued a statement criticising the government for hurriedly deciding to reopen schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-primary-students-may-have-to-wait-longer-for-return-to-school/articleshow/87898474.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||In unprecedented move, Goa to auction mining leases in December||PANAJI: For the first time ever, the state government will auction its mining blocks next month. CM Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that six to eight blocks would be auctioned before December 15, through the state mining corporation in collaboration with State Bank of India. The reason no auction has ever taken place before is that leases granted during the Portuguese regime were only given approvals for renewals. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The state government had recently engaged the Mineral Exploration Corporation Limited (MECL), a PSU, for the work of mining block exploration in the state, which will be the first survey of blocks in Goa. On Wednesday, the state cabinet gave its approval so the directorate of mines and geology (DMG) could make its first payment to MECL. This is the first step before MECL completes its report and paves the way for the auctioning process. “DMG was to make payments to MECL, which will be done now,” Sawant said after the cabinet meeting. “After exploration, they will finalise the mines and then the auction will be done. It is not yet finalised which mines (will be auctioned).” “They have started exploration work. Before December 15, the procedure of auctioning will be completed. There are six to eight blocks in all. The auction will be through the mining corporation and SBI will be brought on board.” MECL has arrived at the itemised charges of Rs 36.1 lakh for exploration of five blocks for the financial year 2020-21, and escalation of charges will apply for the financial year 2021-22. As per the MoU, 50% of the payment has to be made in advance to MECL, and the rest on submission of the geological assessment report to DMG. The cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod for this initial payment to MECL. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act (MMDR) was amended in 2015 and the provision for auction of leases was inserted in the amended Act after the expiry of the mining leases. But for Goa, it was more important that geological mapping was carried out, so that scientific and sustainable mining could take place, to generate revenue for Goa. Accordingly, an MoU was signed by the state with MECL on July 19, 2021, the cabinet note read. “To undertake proposal for assessment of mineral acreages (phase-I) for Goa for auction related work, MECL submitted a proposal for the initial work related to geological mapping and field-related surveys for demarcating the mineral blocks by collecting data in the field and submission of report in respect of five mineral blocks for immediate auction process,” stated the cabinet note. MECL has said that the proposed activities like survey work, geological work, sampling work, laboratory studies and reports can be submitted by it within 30 days from completion of field work. The offer of the MECL proposal is valid up to November 30. The proposal received administrative approval of the government and was then placed before the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-unprecedented-move-goa-to-auction-mining-leases-in-dec/articleshow/87898383.cms||---

A CCTV grab showed that the animal was roaming around on the premises of the temple and climbing up the idols in search for food. The incident occurred around 11pm when the priests and devotees were not present on the temple campus. The wildlife division was called in to send the bear back to a nearby forest. “The Sinchel temple is located inside the wildlife sanctuary and the sighting of bears and other wild animals is common. We are keeping tabs on the movement of the animal to ensure that none gets injured by it,” said Suratna Sherpa, a wildlife divisional forest officer. Earlier, in October, a black bear had been spotted in the Mul Dara area while another was trapped from Lebong and later released in the forest. In November, a Himalayan black bear and her cub were spotted loitering on the Darjeeling Gymkhana premises. The wildlife division officer said that easy availability of food draws black bear to the urban areas frequently. “Tourism activities and unhygienic disposal of food are some of the reasons why this area is being frequented by the animal. The temple in Tiger Hill is a popular tourist spot,” Sherpa added. “From November, black bears go into hibernation. They mate before that. They often come down from their dwelling areas located at great heights,” Sherpa said. The Himalayan black bears are found above 8,000 feet and come down to 4,500-5,000 feet before they hibernate. Darjeeling is located at around 6,700 feet. Sherpa, however, expressed fear of a possible man-animal conflict with growing black bear population. “In 2012 census, we had around 7 to 15 bears. Now, we feel population of the animal has gone up. In the coming years, we might see a possible conflict. People need to be aware,” said the DFO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bear-gatecrashes-tiger-hill-temple-in-search-of-food/articleshow/87897659.cms||Deep Gazmer
---||Madurai||Madurai: Shops, malls find insisting on jab certificate harms business||MADURAI: Though the state health department recently directed that Covid-19 vaccination certificates can be made mandatory to enter various public places including malls, theatres, work places, commercial establishments, schools, and colleges in a bid to encourage vaccination, implementation of the rule is not a smooth affair. Though district health officials have instructed establishments to try and insist on vaccination certificates, it is yet to be fully implemented. In Madurai, it is being implemented in a few shopping establishments with little success. At Vishaal de Mall in Chinna Chockikulam, visitors are allowed only if they carry vaccination certificates. “The number of visitors has seen a decline due to this rule. Many are also facing difficulties in accessing their certificate online and keeping it in hand as they don’t knos how to do it,” said an employee. N Selvaraj, a resident of Kamarajar Salai, whose second dose of Covid-19 vaccine is not due yet, said the government should give more time to implement the rule. “It would be unfair to stop someone from going to a place just because of vaccination certificate. Further, there are technical issues over implementation as we have to have our mobile phones in hand with the phone number that we registered with to access the certificate. It is a great hassle for public,” he added. Theatre owners are also fearful over implementing the rule and so far barring the theatre at Vishaal de Mall, none has come forward to enforce it. “Only now, slowly, we are getting our business back after the lockdown. However, such a rule can greatly harm us. It is also not practically possible to implement it when we have hardly half an hour before a show begins. If we make the public wait and check vaccination certificates, it will eat up much time and crowding will be there too,” said a theatre owner in Madurai, who did not want to be named. On the other hand, traders and industries have been keen to ensure 100% vaccination of their employees. “We are insisting on employees getting vaccinated for both doses. More than 90% of employees in our unit are vaccinated. When workers work closely together, there is risk of spread, so we have to ensure they get vaccinated,” said M S Sampath, president, Maditssia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shops-malls-find-insisting-on-jab-certificate-harms-biz/articleshow/87898387.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Pawar was reacting to BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil’s recent statement that his party would be back in power in the state next year. Pawar said: “He (Patil) initially said the MVA government will not last even 15 days; then he said one month; and then six months. I think he is more interested in predicting others’ future.

---||Ahmedabad||Rahul Gandhi says 3 lakh died of Covid in Gujarat, BJP denies charge||GANDHINAGAR: The Congress party made a startling claim on Wednesday, asserting that 3 lakh persons have succumbed to Covid in Gujarat. The BJP was quick to refute the claim, saying the opposition party was attempting to malign Gujarat’s image. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi released a video on Wednesday, claiming that 3 lakh persons had succumbed to Covid in Gujarat, while the state government claims a little over 10,000 Covid deaths. “We sent Congress workers from home to home. The truth is 3 lakh people died of Covid in Gujarat when the state government says 10,000 died,” Gandhi said in the video. “The Congress should stop discrediting Gujarat. The state government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court on the matter. We will abide by all directions of the SC and financial assistance will be based on its directions. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi should dare to expose incorrect Covid death figures in Congress-ruled states too,” said Jitu Vaghani, the state government spokesman. Earlier in the day, the Congress demanded that financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh be given to the next of kin of all those who died due to Covid, and that it will launch a sustained campaign to force the government to pay this sum to the victims’ families. This came one day after the BJP government in the state said it will provide financial assistance of Rs 50,000 to the families of Covid victims. The state government announcement came after the SC reprimanded the state government over compensation for Covid deaths. Gujarat government figures show the death toll due to Covid to be 10,088, the Congress on Wednesday said that the Covid death toll in Gujarat was actually 3 lakh. The video circulated by the Congress features family members of Covid victims from across the state, who allege that their dear ones did not get basic facilities like hospital beds or ventilators during the pandemic. Others said death certificates of their kin had no mention that they died of Covid even though that was the reason of their deaths. Vaghani said the Congress was resorting to baseless allegations as it has been out of power in Gujarat for many years, and the people of Gujarat are firmly with the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/raga-says-3l-died-of-covid-in-gujarat-bjp-denies-charge/articleshow/87897664.cms||---

The authority, during its meeting earlier this month, also decided that henceforth a fine of Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per day would be imposed on project proponents who fail to file the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) compliance. The conditions are set to ensure that projects do not adversely impact the local environment and include suitable mitigation measures, like planting of local species of trees, etc. As per the EIA notification issued on November 26, 2018, by the Union environment ministry, it is mandatory for all project proponents to submit a six-monthly compliance report. Noting that there is a general trend among project proponents to not submit this report, the authority decided to prescribe a fine for all violators. “It is being observed that the six-monthly compliance reports are not being submitted by many to the regulatory authority,” GSEIAA decided at its meeting on November 12. “Therefore, Goa-SEIAA issued two consecutive office memorandums on July 2 and August 19, 2021, respectively. The authority has decided to put a fine of Rs 500 for category B2 and Rs 1,000 for category B1 for whoever failed to submit the six-monthly compliance reports.” Stating that in the matter of Manuel da Costa it was observed that the project proponent had not submitted the six-monthly compliance reports for a period of two years, the authority said that it was “decided to impose fine for 730 days i.e. Rs 500 per day which works out to Rs 7.3 lakh”. Since the project proponent had two projects, the amount of penalty works to Rs 14.6 lakh, it said. A unit in the Cuncolim industrial unit, Global Ispat, was also pulled up by the authority and the unit admitted to not having submitted compliance on time. “The project proponent had not submitted the six-monthly compliance report from January 1, 2021, to November 12, 2021, for a period of 316 days. The authority decided to impose a Rs 1.58 lakh penalty for non-submission of the six-monthly compliance report. Project proponent shall deposit the said amount within one month before this authority on receipt of letter,” GSEIAA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/eia-non-compliance-state-authority-sets-fine-of-up-to-rs1k/day/articleshow/87898389.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The association demanded a special camp for school vehicles to obtain and dispose FCs. “Private schools are struggling financially for the past one-and-a-half years and maintenance of vehicles cost us a lot. Extension was being given for validity of vehicle documents till October 31 due to the Covid-19 pandemic but the state government abruptly stopped further extension putting us in a spot. Also, with schools reopened for all classes from November 1, there was a rush to get school transport ready but no priority was given for vehicles to get fitness certificates,” said Senthilnathan M, president, PSCC. The association also demanded to renew permit at the earliest, to allow to pay motor vehicle tax for the pending periods without penalty and to extend time for fixing of cameras and GPS in school transport. “Without school transport, it is getting difficult for us to send our children to school. Spending on private transport is expensive. The school management is telling us that the vehicles are not ready to operate,” said K Nivedha, a parent of two who attend a private school. Meanwhile, officials from the transport department said that due to pile up of a large number of vehicles, there may be some unavoidable delays but arrangements have been done to prioritize school vehicles. “If the school vehicles adhere to what is mandated in the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles (Regulation and Control of School Buses), Special Rules 2012, FCs will be issued without any delay. Flying squad teams and RTOs have also been instructed to prioritize school vehicles.

---||Goa||Tarun Tejpal’s plea for in-camera appeal hearing rejected by HC||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa rejected a plea by Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal seeking in-camera hearings in the state’s appeal against his acquittal by a sessions court earlier this year. Justices R M Dere and M S Jawalkar pronounced the verdict on Wednesday, after hearing Tejpal’s advocate, senior counsel Amit Desai, and solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta, representing the state. Desai said he would challenge the court’s verdict. During the hearing, Mehta told the court that he wouldn’t name and shame the accused, and wouldn’t read out sensitive paragraphs. He pointed out that the judgment was already in the public domain. Desai, on the other hand, said that the case has been heard in-camera right through the stages of bail, framing of charge and trial, and added that the appeal is a continuation of the proceedings. Desai cited Section 327 of the Criminal Procedure Code and said that both the accused and survivor have the constitutional right to be protected. He added that open court proceedings would leave him afraid over who would be listening and who would be writing and publishing the proceedings. He pushed for protection of the privacy and reputation of the accused. Desai also said that Tejpal has been acquitted by a very senior woman sessions judge, who delivered the verdict after a full trial, and added that this couldn’t be ignored. To this, advocate general Devidas Pangam pointed out that the sessions judge was very experienced (but) she named the survivor in the judgment. Desai said that we don’t need the public participating in these proceedings, and don’t need to have publications on a daily basis to assist us. Mehta, on the other hand, told the high court that Section 327 is not applicable to appellate proceedings, and stated that it is restricted to inquiry into and trying of an offence, and added that the trial stage ends at Section 353 of CrPC, when the judgment is pronounced in court. He added that appeals are separate and distinct where there is no provision for in-camera hearing. The moment the case reaches the Section 353 stage, the umbrella of Section 327 is over, he said, adding that there is no provision for in-camera hearings here. Once the trial is over, the judgment and evidence is in public domain, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpals-plea-for-in-camera-appeal-hearing-rejected-by-hc/articleshow/87898400.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Hoping to attract more revenue, the north corporation has modified its scheme regarding advertisements in parks. “Some of the companies that have taken up our parks for maintenance had demanded increasing the size of the display boards, so we have made some amendments to the our parks adoption policy,” said standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain. As per the modified rules, the companies maintaining parks will now get more space to advertise their brands on boards. Depending on the park’s size, the corporation passed the amended scheme of display boards for five different categories. “It has been acknowledged that the number of parks adopted by companies has decreased in the last consecutive years. It is submitted that the size of the displays must be revised, so the process of selection of private players goes up to make it more lucrative and feasible,” said Sanjay Goel, north corporation, in a letter to the standing committee. For a 0.5 acre park, one display board can now be up to the size of 50 square feet, 0.5 to 1-acre parks can have two display boards of around 50 square feet size, 1 acre and above four display boards with a max size of 50 square feet for each display board is permissible.

Complaints, where no tickets are issued or when conductors misbehave, can lead to suspension of licences for the driver. According to cops passengers can call these same contact numbers to report about app-cab and taxi drivers charging excess fare. The police reply came following a video that went viral of a conductor on route 24A/1 (Mukundapur-Howrah) threatening a passenger who refused to pay an exhorbitant fare. Tamojit Seal also posted a video of a bus plying on the same route. “Bus route 24A/1 having bus registration number as per video (where the number is visible).

He is misbehaving also,” he tweeted. “Please mail us the details (location,date,timing) at dctp@kolkatatrafficpolice.gov.in, so that we can take action. Pls inform us on control room number (03322505096/22143644),” DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha tweeted back. Passengers are irked about the inconsistency in rates. “Often conductors on the same route are demanding different rates. What used to cost Rs 10 is now between Rs 15-20.

Even in a video that is currently in circulation, an RTO official in Aurangabad is heard saying that auto-rickshaws will be seized if the drivers fail to get themselves vaccinated. High court advocate Vishal Bakal told TOI, “The orders making vaccination mandatory to even purchase items of basic necessity, are not in consonance with the central government guidelines. Various HCs have observed that vaccination is voluntary and not mandatory.” Bakal, on Wednesday, filed a petition challenging one of the orders of the Aurangabad district collector. Final-year law student Chaitanya Talhar, who has filed a PIL challenging the orders making vaccination mandatory, too echoed the legal experts. “Vaccination cannot be directly or indirectly made mandatory, or kept as a condition for enjoying fundamental rights. It is already a settled law that it cannot be mandated,” he said When contacted, HC assistant government pleader Rashmi Gour said, “People who feel this is an infringement of fundamental rights, should contemplate on the legal position that fundamental rights are to be exercised with some reasonable restrictions and everyone should take appropriate decisions.” The government pleaders maintained that even for claiming the bills, it has become mandatory for people to produce vaccination certificates. Senior HC advocate Prashant Katneshwarkar said more steps should be taken to convince the masses, instead of making vaccination mandatory through direct and indirect means. Senior practicing HC lawyers are even citing the ministry of health and family welfare’s statement on its website stating that Covid-19 vaccination is voluntary. However, it is advisable to take a complete schedule of Covid-19 vaccine to protect oneself against this disease.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vaccine-cannot-be-made-mandatory-legal-experts/articleshow/87896021.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Ahmedabad district collector Sandip Sagale told TOI that they have registered 3,412 deaths from Ahmedabad — 3,319 deaths from Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation areas and 93 from the district. “Teams have been formed to get addresses and phone numbers of family members. The teams will approach families for their bank details. If there is more than one claimant or heir, then the family will be advised to get affidavit of the other heir to nominate one bank account to get the amount,” said the collector, adding that the administration will go to the beneficiaries. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health & family welfare), had told media on Wednesday that the process of giving compensation to 10,000-plus families would be expedited as they already had proof of Covid deaths. “The families matching other criteria will also be covered soon,” he said. The state government had recently come out with two notifications, including all who died within 30 days of testing positive. The notification even included those who had ended their lives during the stipulated period. The bone of contention, said experts, is the scenario where the families have no proof that the death was caused due to Covid in form of a death certificate. The state administration however maintained that their priority is to cover the 10,091 families already registered with the government. The Supreme Court had recently reprimanded the top officials of the state health & family welfare department for their poorly drafted submission to the court. Earlier, the bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna had observed that the constitution of the scrutiny committee appeared to be an attempt to overreach directions passed by the apex court to give compensation to the families of the Covid victims in the state. Gujarat government had earlier formed city and district-level Covid death ascertaining committee (CDAC). The move was scrapped and the powers of providing compensation were given to the district collectors.  The amount would be given from the state government’s disaster management funds, mentioned the latest notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3412-families-from-ahmedabad-to-get-rs-50k/articleshow/87897792.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Maintenance-dodging dad loses bid to wrest cash from son||Ahmedabad: A man disregarded a court’s order to pay regular maintenance to his estranged wife and instead waited for years to win the legal right to get Rs 2,500 monthly allowance from his now adult son. But the man’s maintenance-dodging history has reaped for him what he had sowed. An appellate court has said that his son owes no responsibility to him. Ramanbhai Parmar, 63, a Dhandhuka town resident, was ordered 21 years ago to pay maintenance to his estranged wife. Their son was a minor at the time. In the 14 long years, he paid an amount just once. Years later, he won a battle at a magisterial court in Dhandhuka to secure maintenance from his son. But a sessions court on the Mirzapur rural court campus granted relief to the son by quashing the maintenance order. According to the case details, Parmar married Bhanuben in 1998. The couple had a son, Kaushik. Following matrimonial discord, the wife and the minor son left Parmar in 1998 and went to Bhavnagar. They have been living in there since then. Bhanuben approached a magisterial court in Bhavnagar and demanded maintenance from Parmar. In 2000, the court ordered Parmar to pay Rs 700 monthly maintenance to his wife and son. But Parmar was lax about heeding the order. In fact, he moved a magisterial court in Dhandhuka in 2014, seeking Rs 12,000 per month from his son under the provisions of the Section 125 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). He claimed that his wife had deserted him and had taken their son with her. He said he was old and diabetic and was suffering from various other ailments and could not work. He had no means of income, said. He had performed his duties as a father and had ensured good education for his son, he submitted. Since he has become mature and earning Rs 20,000 salary at GIDC, Chitra, he should be ordered to pay maintenance to his old father, Parmar contended. The son, Kaushik, vehemently opposed the father’s maintenance plea by submitting that his mother had left her matrimonial home because of his father’s harassment. He said that despite the court order in 2000, his father had made only a one-time payment of Rs 17,000. The pending amount over the 14 years was Rs 1.17 lakh, Kaushik said. He added that the case was an attempt by his father to evade responsibilities. In 2018, the Dhandhuka court accepted the father’s plea and ordered Kaushik to pay Rs 2,500 monthly maintenance. The court observed that looking after parents is the moral and pious duty of a son. Kaushik challenged the maintenance order in a sessions court on the Mirzapur rural court campus and reiterated that his father had neglected him and his mother for more than two decades. The court was convinced with the son’s arguments and quashed the order on November 2 with the observation that the son was told to pay his father only on the grounds of the father-son relationship. But, the court said, the provisions of law and the want of evidence in this case had been ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/maintenance-dodging-dad-loses-bid-to-wrest-cash-from-son/articleshow/87897739.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede’s father appeals against court order on Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: Dnyandev Wankhede, father of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede, on Wednesday filed an appeal in the Bombay high court against the rejection by the single-judge bench to restrain NCP minister Nawab Malik and others under him from putting up defamatory tweets and posts on social media. Dnyandev’s senior counsel, Arshad Shaikh, mentioned the appeal before a ben-ch of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav, which posted it on Thursday for a hearing on interim relief. On Monday, Justice Madhav Jamdar had said that Malik’s posts against the Wankhedes, which began in October, a month after his son-in-law was granted bail in a drugs case filed by NCB, were “actuated by malice or from personal animosity”, but had agreed with the NCP minister’s senior counsel, Atul Damle, that a “blanket” restraining order cannot be passed agaisnt him. Justice Jamdar had said that a “balance” has to be struck between Wankhedes’ right to privacy and Malik’s right to free speech, both fundamental rights of citizens. But he had also agreed with Shaikh that Malik had not acted after reasonable verification of facts before tweeting or holding press conferences and had directed him to first reasonably verify content before making posts in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wankhedes-father-appeals-against-court-order-on-malik/articleshow/87899266.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra: MVA will be in power again if parties contest polls together, says Sharad Pawar||KOLHAPUR: If the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituent parties — NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress — contest the next assembly elections together, then alliance will again be in power in the state, said NCP chief Sharad Pawar speaking at Mahabaleshwar in Satara district on Wednesday. Pawar was at the hill station to address the representatives of the party’s youth wing. A few days ago, BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil had said that BJP will return to power in the state in the new year. Reacting to Patil’s statement, Pawar said: “He initially said the MVA government will not last even 15 days; then he said one month; and then six months. I think he is more interested in predicting others’ future. I have no doubt that this government will complete the entire five-year tenure. I am also sure that if the constituent parties contest the next election together, then the MVA will be back in power.” Commenting on some BJP leaders’ presence in the MSRTC staff strike, Pawar said: “When the government is running smoothly, and there is an agitating by someone, the opposition always tries to seize the opportunity. But we have face such things in politics.” The NCP chief said that to end the strike, he has suggested a hike in the salaries of MSRTC employees. He added that if the MSRTC is merged with the state government service, workers from many other departments will make similar demands and the state will be run only to pay the salaries of government servants. There will be no money left for development works. “We have found that MSRTC employees are paid less than the ST employees of neighbouring states, except Gujarat. I have suggested that the salaries of MSRTC staffers be made at par with what other states pay their transport workers. Another problem that is causing the strike to remain unresolves is that the government is in a fix over whom to talk to. The registered unions have been sidelined. The state can take a decision, but whom will it enter an agreement with?” asked Pawar. Meeting with MamataPawar said that West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is going to reach Mumbai in two-three days and both will have a meeting. He, however, did not reveal the meeting’s agenda. Dig at FadnavisLeader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had said he would give information on people behind the riots to Pawar. The NCP chief said, “He should meet the home minister instead. Why bring me into this? Earlier, he had said same thing about providing information on Nawab Malik. So far, Fadnavis has not come to meet me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mva-will-be-in-power-again-if-parties-contest-polls-together-sharad-pawar/articleshow/87896038.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Palamu police to include gang rape charge in 4-mnth-old case after NHRC rap||Ranchi: Following months of agitations by a 23-year-old rape survivor, Palamu police have agreed to include gang-rape charge against two men who had been accused of sexually assaulting the woman on August 24 but the cops had refused to include IPC’s Section 376(D) (gang rape) in her complaint, which she had filed on August 27, citing that the woman was involved in a consensual relationship with the main accused and ‘therefore, it was not a case of sexual assault’. The development comes a day after the law division of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued a notice to Palamu SP Chandan Kumar Sinha, seeking an action taken report in the case from him within four weeks. NHRC has also issued a notice to the state human rights commission, seeking reply on whether any action was taken by it in the case. The NHRC came to know of the case after the state unit of People Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) picked up the matter after being approached by the rape survivor and lodged a complaint with the former on October 21, a copy of which was sent to Palamu SP. Responding to the NHRC notice, the Palamu SP said that all the complaints raised by the PUCL have already been resolved. “A corrigendum has been sent to the court for inclusion of the gang rape charge and the rape survivor’s statement has been recorded under 164CrPC,” he added. The woman’s medical test has also been conducted. “The main accused (Abhishek Kumar Chandravanshi) surrendered last week and is in judicial custody. We are trying to nab the other accused (Dilip Kumar Chandravanshi),” the SP said. Police said that though the matter is still under investigation, their preliminary inquiry has found that the woman, who is married, had a consensual and illicit relationship with Abhishek and it is not a case of gang-rape. On the night of August 24, the woman, who belongs to a Scheduled Caste, was allegedly gang raped by the two accused at her home. In her complaint, which was filed at SC/ST police station in Medininagar, she had alleged that the two broke into her house in Huntar village under Ramgarh police station and raped her at gun point. The complainant had also mentioned that the perpetrators are from an upper caste and they had abused her and called her names for a being minority. The cops registered an FIR in the case but did not include the gang-rape section in it. The woman had allegedly pleaded with them for its inclusion but it was all in vain. The state general secretary of PUCL, Arwind Avinash, said that when the complainant had mentioned gang-rape in her application to the police, Section 376(D) must have been levelled. “In the course of an investigation, police have the liberty to explain in court, whether the gang-rape accusation was correct or not, but they cannot refuse to register a case,” he said, adding that it was because of negligence by police that the woman had to sit on a dharna, meet the DIG with the complaint and even approach the PUCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/palamu-police-to-include-gang-rape-charge-in-4-mnth-old-case-after-nhrc-rap/articleshow/87897686.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The move, a joint initiative of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC), Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) and Ranchi Smart City Corporation Ltd (RSCCL), also sought citizens’ cooperation to improve the city’s air quality. The billboard will display the ambient air quality index, thereby informing people about the city’s pollution level. The Jharkhand government and the JSPCB are working on the “Clean Air Action Plan” for Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Chaibasa, Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Sahibganj, Dumka and Pakur to combat air pollution in Jharkhand. The capital, at present, has only one AQI monitor. Y K Das, member secretary, JSPCB, said, “The state government has already prioritised reducing air pollution as an important public issue. We regularly issue health advisory and publicise air quality-related data to keep people posted. The billboard campaign will create awareness and help garner public participation to achieve the goal of clean air.” Jyoti Kumar Singh, assistant municipal commissioner of Ranchi, said, “We are committed to ensure clean air in the city and be pro-active in adopting innovative cleaner solutions to minimise the pollution load. This campaign is a timely initiative as we give prominence to citizens’ involvement in civic affairs. We are looking forward to get localised support to bring a sizeable impact on the ground.” Asha Devi Gupta, councillor of ward 18 (Ranchi), said: “This is indeed a commendable effort to engage and educate people about the ill effects of air pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-artificial-lungs-drive-sheds-light-on-air-pollution/articleshow/87897904.cms||---

The governor had summoned the JPSC chairman and Ranchi senior superintendent of police following the lathicharge on protesting candidates on Tuesday. The aspirants have been demanding cancellation of the results of the preliminary combined civil service examination conducted by the JPSC, which were declared on November 1. According to Raj Bhavan sources, governor Bais asked Choudhary to be considerate to the demands of the agitating candidates and ensure that the commission rises above all sorts of allegations and doubts. Though the Raj Bhavan did not issue any official statement on the meeting, Choudhary said the action taken would be visible on the JPSC website by Thursday. He said, “How can I make public the talks with governor?” Assuring that everything would be set right, he added, “No one needs to worry, just smile,” trying to dodge questions about allegations levelled by the examinees. The candidates have accused the JPSC of partiality and corruption as the minimum cut-off marks were not issued with the results. “I am not going to speak anything out of provocation,” Choudhary said. Ranchi SSP Surendra Jha briefed the governor about the situation which compelled the police to use mild force against the agitating candidates on Tuesday. The governor summoned the duo after a high-level delegation of the BJP comprising former chief minister Babulal Marandi and BJP state president and MP Deepak Prakash met Bais on Tuesday evening seeking his intervention in the matter. Backing the agitating candidates, the BJP alleged JPSC of wrongdoing and accused the government of misusing constitutional bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jpsc-chairman-ranchi-ssp-meet-governor/articleshow/87897787.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Street vendors in Ranchi protest ‘illegal’ seizure of goods||Ranchi: Hundreds of hawkers and street vendors protested near the Raj Bhavan on Wednesday against the ‘illegal’ confiscation of their goods by the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC). The enforcement team of the RMC had seized goods of the hawkers and vendors at Birsa Chowk on Monday and allegedly beat them up. The hawkers, under the aegis of Ranchi Footpath Dukandar Hawkers Association, claimed that under the provisions of the Street Vendor Act, 2014, the RMC team was supposed to hand over a notice and a list of the seized goods. The act also calls for constitution of town vending committees to look into issues of street vendors which have remained pending for years, they said. Local vendor Suraj Kumar said, “We are here against the injustice done to our fellow hawkers.” “Protesting this brutality, members of town vending committees staged a protest but instead of listening to their grievances, an FIR was registered,” alleged Nagendra Pandey, president of Jharkhand Sikshit Footpath Dukandar Mahasangh. According to the Act, vending zones should be set up in each ward. Pandey said, “The principle guidelines of the Act have not been followed to allocate a proper place to each vendor.” Mahasangh secretary Anita Das said, “The RMC has alone taken the decision and released orders without involving the town vending committees, which is illegal. The central government’s guidelines to provide an ID and vendor certificate to each vendor is yet to be followed. We are demanding our legal rights and to get them we will go to the top court.” In Morabadi, shopkeepers protested by closing markets and shops for the whole day. The vendors have decided to continue their protest till the RMC fulfils their demands. The vendors also marched to the RMC head office and waited for hours. RMC deputy commissioner Kunwar Singh Pahan subsequently invited them for talks. Fifteen vendors met him and were assured of resolution of their demands. Pahan said, “The RMC along with town vending committees will take action immediately on all the demands.” Pahan assured vendors that their seized belongings would be returned soon. Morabadi Dukandar Association president Jansevak Kumar Roshan appealed to the RMC to follow the guidelines of the central government. He warned the RMC that they would not accept such action in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/street-vendors-in-ranchi-protest-illegal-seizure-of-goods/articleshow/87897878.cms||---

Nadda told doctors that Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a timely lockdown in India when even the developed countries were confused. It saved millions of lives, he said. “Prime Minister took the timely and bold decision of locking down and preparing the country. But if you look at America, they could not decide till the end whether life was important or the economy,” Nadda said. He also said that during the previous pandemics people in India died more of hunger than disease. But this time around Modi provided free ration to the poor and the scheme has now been extended to March 2022. Nadda said that Goa has also got a superspeciality block at Goa Medical College with seven specialities now. There are also plans to set up new medical institutions in Goa. “We have seen that you do not have to go to Mumbai or anywhere, the best treatment is available here and the infrastructure has been created here,” he said. He said earlier India had to wait for up to 30 years to receive medicine for a new disease from the developed world. Today, India is exporting vaccines to the developed world, Nadda said. “When this pandemic came, Modi formed a task force and he decided India will make a vaccine and within a short span of nine months, not one but two vaccines were made in India. India is now in a position to even give vaccines to other countries,” Nadda said. In India, 118 crore vaccinations have been done, of which 22 lakh are in Goa, in the world’s fastest vaccination programme, he said. “Forty percent of the Indian population, that too very poor, have been given a health coverage of Rs 5 lakh per year. More than 2.5 crore people have taken benefit of it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/timely-lockdown-by-pm-saved-millions-of-lives/articleshow/87898435.cms||---

Calling the state’s pace of vaccination unsatisfactory, state health secretary Arun Kumar Singh has set a statewide target of 3.5 lakh daily jabs between November 20 and November 30 to catch up with the national vaccination coverage average. “From October 13 till now, the daily coverage of Covid-19 vaccination in the state has been unsatisfactory. Even now, the state’s first dose coverage has been 66.07% while that of the second dose is 28.43%, which is substantially low from the national averages,” Singh wrote in his letter to all the deputy commissioners on Monday. In a bid to ramp up the vaccination numbers, Singh directed the DCs to ensure that special vaccination drives are held every Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the district and panchayat levels. Singh also asked the districts to effectively implement the Har Ghar Dastak programme, which was launched on Diwali eve by the Centre, by taking up door-to-door vaccination in rural households according to the overdue list of beneficiaries available with the Co-Win portal. Singh’s directives came after the Union ministry of health and family welfare recently asked all states to ensure that 90% of all its eligible beneficiaries are administered the first dose by November 30. As of Tuesday evening, out of Jharkhand’s 2.41 crore beneficiaries, 71.92 lakh people had been fully vaccinated while 1.61 crore people had taken their first dose. As per the health department’s statistics, second dose coverage was the poorest among young adults aged between 18-44 (24%), followed by senior citizens and people aged between 45-59 (35%). A senior doctor in the health department, who is involved with the vaccination programme, said: “Vaccination figures dipped from October 6 onwards as it marked the beginning of the month-long festive season, beginning with Navratra. Devotees were fasting, they had social gatherings and were involved in several rituals and hence, did not want to take jabs fearing its after-effects such as fever, weakness and body ache. Now that the festive season is over, we shall see a rise in the numbers once again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/state-asks-dists-to-administer-4l-jabs-a-day-through-special-camps/articleshow/87906303.cms||Dhritiman Ray

The dentists who submitted a representation to the BJP national president said that they were protesting over the problems they face over the exorbitant hike in charges in disposing of biomedical waste in Goa. They said the state government has not addressed the issue, despite several representations made by the dentists over the months. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, later issued a statement saying that he had assured the dentists of resolving the issue, yet they held the protest. “Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, the protest began after the assurance was given,” the chief minister said.

---||Goa||Now, Aleixo Sequeira says never met Fadnavis||Panaji: Congress working president Aleixo Sequeira on Wednesday rubbished allegations levelled against him by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries that he had a meeting with BJP election in-charge for Goa Devendra Fadnavis and charged that AAP is trying to misguide people. He is the second Congress leader in the last two days to have been accused of meeting the BJP election in-charge. Sequeira said that AAP Goa vice-president Vincy Viegas and party functionary Amit Palekar “have alleged that I had a meeting with Fadnavis. I know that he is a former chief minister of Maharashtra, but I have never met him. The charge levelled against me is not true”. “AAP likes to create confusion,” he said at a press conference. He ridiculed the party for harping about Congress being BJP’s B-team. “Senior members of AAP had approached me on various occasions to join the party,” he said, adding that he had asked them to convince him that AAP is not BJP’s B-team. Recently, a former AAP functionary charged that funds come from BJP to AAP. Countering the charge of defections, Sequeira said AAP’s MLAs have joined Congress in Punjab. “From 20 MLAs, their strength has come down to 10-11,” he said. Referring to some banners put up by AAP saying ‘Jobs for All’ with a line ‘Pay bribes and get jobs’, Sequeira said as an MLA and minister around 3,000 jobs were given. He said, “Let even one person come forward and say I’ve taken one paise to give jobs.” He added that the people of Goa will not be fooled by AAP. GPCC president Girish Chodankar on Tuesday had accused the BJP-government of favouritism in filling government posts, and said that eligible and deserving candidates were being left out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-aleixo-sequeira-says-never-met-fadnavis/articleshow/87898457.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Senior Cong functionaries are corrupt’||Panaji: Trajano D’Mello, who was expelled from Congress on Tuesday for alleged anti-party activities, in turn has accused the state’s senior Congress functionaries of indulging in anti-party activities. D’Mello told reporters that he was expelled after he raised concerns over alleged “selling of power by Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president, and illegalities of other seniors”. He said that he has not received any communication from the party about his ouster but learnt about it through the media. On Tuesday evening, GPCC vice-president M K Shaikh issued a statement saying that D’Mello has been expelled from the party’s primary membership for six years for alleged anti-party activities and that action was taken on the direction of Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao. D’Mello questioned why the statement was issued by the party vice president and not president. Without naming anyone, he said that he was thrown out of the party as he had been raising the alleged illegalities by certain party seniors for a while. D’Mello said he was left aghast after the party’s strategist, at a recent meeting with the Calangute block where there has been an outcry over the possibility of ports minister Michael Lobo joining Congress, refused to acknowledge the “enemy”. “When you do not know who your enemy is, how will you fight it?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/senior-cong-functionaries-are-corrupt/articleshow/87898466.cms||---

He said that if provided with hard proof, the state will take strict action against the guilty. “Any Tom, Dick and Harry emerges and makes any allegations they want. It doesn’t mean I should respond to it. Every department is conducting its exams, declaring results, and carrying out recruitments accordingly. It is very easy to make allegations. If there is any wrongdoing, let them prove it. We will take strict action. No one will be let off. There is complete transparency maintained by the CM’s office,” said Sawant. Congress on Tuesday had alleged that personal assistant to fisheries minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues scored cent percent marks, superseding other qualified candidates, for the post of inspector in the legal metrology department. Rodrigues also holds the legal metrology portfolio. Congress has demanded that all posts of the legal metrology for which results were declared recently be scrapped and the minister be sacked immediately, failing which the party will launch a statewide agitation. “I am not against anyone making any allegations, but they should have some valid proof under RTI, etc, to prove it. And action will be taken,” said Sawant. Chodankar had said that 1,128 candidates had appeared for the post of inspector of the legal metrology department and that the marklist had four candidates scoring 100 out of 100. One of the four who scored full marks was Bhupendra Umesh Dessai, the personal assistant to Rodrigues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/provide-proof-of-job-scam-will-take-action-sawant/articleshow/87898481.cms||---

The latest addition to the country’s aviation map, the Noida International Airport (NIA), whose foundation stone will be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is dressed up for its ‘airport carnival’. The road leading to the airport launch site, where a giant stage for the main event now stands, has been given a complete makeover. More than 3,000 hoardings and banners with photographs of Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath have been put up on the main road leading up to the venue. Posters highlighting the state government’s achievements can also be seen across the entire stretch between Yamuna Expressway and the launch site. On Wednesday, Jewar was abuzz with visitors as well as security personnel and government officials busy giving final touches to the venue that is going to host a bevy of dignitaries. Besides political workers and local residents, thousands of security personnel from various parts of western UP were present at the site for the briefing. With a few hours to go before the launch ceremony, Special Protection Group additional director general Alok Sharma supervised the arrangements for about 1,200-1,500 VIPs who will converge in Jewar from all over the state and other parts of NCR. UP ADG (security) Binod Kumar Singh and GB Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh also took notes of the minutest details of the security arrangements. At least two lakh people are expected to attend the event. The Prime Minister and the chief minister will both arrive at the venue in helicopters, said officials. Modi is expected to join the event around 12.50pm and leave at 2.30pm. Officials also said that entry to the main dais, where the PM will preside over the launch ceremony, will be allowed only from the back stage. Though the final seating plan of the dais has not been shared with the media, it is expected that almost three dozen invitees will occupy the main stage. A 30-metre-wide LED screen has been set up at the dais to showcase the proceedings of the event. Three videos covering the journey so far and key features of the airport will also be relayed. Officials said that folk dancers and a troupe will present the Braj culture of Mathura and Vrindavan before the audience. S P Goyal, additional chief secretary principal to the CM, said, “We are extremely confident that the project is going to be successful. We will present the hard work of the state government before the audience on Thursday. Our future plans pertaining to the connectivity and accessibility via the airport in Jewar will also be shown.” Spread over 1,330 acres, the greenfield airport at Jewar is expected to be operational by October 2024. Swiss airport major Zurich AG, the concessionaire, has committed to delivering Phase 1 of NIA within three years. This phase will see a runway and a terminal with a capacity of handling 1.2 crore passengers annually. In the second phase, a runway and a terminal building will be added that will take the airport to its eventual capacity of 7 crore passengers annually. The Jewar airport will be the second international airport to come up in Delhi-NCR and is expected to decongest the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the national capital. It is strategically located to serve cities like Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Agra, Faridabad and neighbouring areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/jewar-dresses-up-for-airport-carnival-today/articleshow/87898450.cms||Shalabh

---||Goa||Calls for joint efforts between Goa, Maharashtra, K’taka for tiger conservation in Wester Ghats region||Keri: Camera traps inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary have revealed that the male tiger, which has been repeatedly captured on camera, also moves in the neighbouring forested areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka. In 2015, the photo of male tiger was shared on Facebook by then chief conservator of forest, Vijay Mohan Raj. Wildlifer Girish Punjabi, who is studying the movement of tigers from the Tillari valley forest into Goa and Karnataka, told TOI, “An image of the male tiger that won the best photograph award in 2015 in Sanctuary Asia magazine’s contest has presently been captured on a camera trap in the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary. Earlier, a female that was trapped by our camera in Mangeli, also took refuge in Goan forests. Belagavi-based environmentalist Durgesh Kasbekar said, “Since ages, the forest of the Western Ghats, spread across Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka, has been known for tigers. This is why there is an urgent need for coordinated efforts by the three states towards tiger conservation. I am already in touch with senior forest officers to materialise the initiative.” A year-long occupancy study in the Sahyadri Konkan corridor conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Trust Pune has indicated that tigers travel from Maharashtra’s Sahyadri Tiger Reserve into Goa and Karnataka and vice versa. It also highlighted the need for improved protection efforts in corridor areas. Meanwhile, deputy conservator of forests of the Sawantwadi division, Shahaji Naranvar, said, “The Wildlife Institute of India has been involved in studying the status of the Tillari region on the ecological and wildlife angles. We are ready to work with our counterparts for tiger conservation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calls-for-joint-efforts-between-goa-maharashtra-ktaka-for-tiger-conservation-in-wester-ghats-region/articleshow/87898522.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Husband, in-laws arrested over law student’s death||KOCHI: Ernakulam rural police, probing Mofiya Parveen’s (21) alleged suicide over harassment and domestic violence, arrested her husband and his parents on Wednesday. CL Sudheer, the inspector of Aluva East police station who had abused her verbally when she filed a complaint, was transferred to police headquarters on Wednesday. The arrested persons were identified as Mofiya’s husband Muhammed Suhail (27) of Eramalloor and his parents Rukhya (55) and Yousuf (63). The police team arrested them early on Wednesday from a relative’s house in Kothamangalam where they were hiding. District police chief SP K Karthick said the case, which was initially registered as a case of unnatural death, was altered and IPC sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) were added. He added that Aluva deputy SP PK Sivankutty was assigned the case. A departmental enquiry is underway against Sudheer and this is done by Ernakulam DIG Neeraj Kumar Gupta. The girls’ family had alleged that the inspector had verbally abused Mofiya in front of her husband and father when they were called to the station in connection with the domestic violence complaint she had filed a month ago. “The inquiry has only started, and it is too early to comment on it. He has already been transferred out of the district,” said DIG Gupta. The law student from Edayapuram was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home on Monday night. A suicide note recovered from her room said that she had to endure mental torture from her husband, Suhail, and his family. The note also alleged denial of justice and sought action against the inspector. Mofiya and Suhail got acquainted on Facebook and married in April this year. Her family alleged that Suhail, who convinced them that he was working in the Middle East, had said that he did not want a dowry. Two months after their marriage, Suhail and his parents allegedly started harassing her in the name of dowry, sources said. Her father Dilshad K Salim had alleged that Suhail even asked him to pay Rs 40 lakh as he wanted to produce a film. Police hadn’t even registered a case based on her complaint; her relatives had alleged. According to them, the inspector verbally abused Salim and Mofiya during a discussion. Salim had said that the incident shook her, and she was later found dead. Meanwhile on Wednesday, state human rights commission chairman Antony Dominic ordered a detailed probe into her death. The district police chief was asked to submit a detailed enquiry report within four weeks. The case will be considered by SHRC on December 27. Suicides are preventable and help is just a phone call away. Those in distress can call Maitri at 0484-2540530 or the state’s health helpline 104.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/husband-in-laws-arrested-over-law-students-death/articleshow/87897926.cms||---
---||Delhi||Air unlock: Schools, colleges in Delhi can reopen from Monday||NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday announced a phase-wise relaxation in the restrictions imposed to deal with the air emergency in the capital. All schools, colleges, other educational institutions and libraries will reopen from November 29. The Delhi government has also allowed the entry of CNG and electric trucks, along with commercial vehicles catering to essential services, from November 27. Entry of other trucks will remain prohibited till December 3. Government offices will reopen on November 29 with the work-from-home provision coming to an end. The easing was announced on a day when pollution levels increased with the air quality worsening. According to IITM-Pune's early warning system, it is likely to stay "very poor" for the next five days. Rai, who reviewed the situation with senior officials, noted that "there have been improvements in Delhi's pollution levels for the past three days" while announcing the decisions. Parents remain split over the decision to reopen schools, and school managements say that because of the 50% ceiling on the capacity of a classroom to ensure social distancing, they will anyway have to stagger classes. Primary school students may be the last to be called. Colleges are yet to evolve a strategy and are likely to continue with the online mode in the short term. Though the government has allowed entry of CNG and electric trucks, experts said there aren't too many around. "There, really, aren't any CNG or electric trucks, but quite a few logistics companies have switched to smaller CNG and electric vehicles," said a Delhi government official. Delhi Goods Transport Organisation president Rajendra Kapoor said, "There are CNG-run small goods vehicles but these are very few and ply locally in Delhi. Trucks carrying bulk goods don't run on CNG because these vehicles make long journeys from as far as Tamil Nadu and Kerala and can't be refuelled on the way." "What happens to the trucks waiting near the border to enter Delhi? if a truck has come from Kerala, it is not going all the way back laden with goods," Kapoor said, complaining that transporters were facing a lot of problems. CNG is not easily available outside NCR, and that's the reason why Delhi Transport Corporation, which has a CNG-run fleet, doesn't operate any long-distance inter-state services. The nearly 3,500 buses arriving from other states run on diesel. With all government offices set to reopen from November 29, the Delhi government has advised employees to use public transport and plans to introduce special CNG bus services for them. "There are areas like Nimri Colony, Gulabi Bagh and Timarpur where a large number of Delhi government employees stay. The Kejriwal government has decided to start special bus services in all these areas. Private CNG buses, which the government had hired recently, will be used for this purpose. To promote the use of Metro, we have decided to start shuttle bus services from Delhi Secretariat to the nearest Metro station," said Rai. The Delhi government had on March 13 announced the closure of educational institutes and work-for-home provision for government employees to curb vehicular pollution. However, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on November 16 ordered a ban on entry of non-essential trucks till November and the Delhi environment department extended the ban on November 21. "We are reopening things but our fight against pollution will continue. Therefore, it is necessary for everyone to cooperate because together we can reduce this pollution further so that Delhi can have better air. The conditions will definitely improve and the government will not shy away from taking any tough step if needed," Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-unlock-schools-colleges-in-delhi-can-reopen-monday/articleshow/87899793.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

A third one had died in the interim. A tearful Shashi, Avdesh's wife, told TOI on Wednesday, "We continued to fight for justice and finally it was served. My daughters' souls would be in peace now. I still remember their innocent faces." Additional sessions judge Siddhartha Kumar Wagav while pronouncing the judgment also issued non-bailable warrants against the then investigating officer (IO) Hoshiyaar Singh and a witness, Dinesh Kumar, for "connivance with the actual murderers" and for "falsely implicating an innocent father in the murder of his own daughters". The IO had filed a chargesheet against Avdesh based on a statement by "witness" Kumar. The police officer had then said that after killing his daughters, Avdesh had come to him and "confessed that he committed the crime due to poor financial condition at home". The IO proceeded to file a closure report after "detailed investigations". Back in 2002, October 15, Avdhesh, his daughters Rohini (9), Neeta (8) and Surmi (7), and other members of his family were sleeping in their house in Shahjahanpur district when three men, Chutkannu alias Naththulal, along with his brother Rajendra, and son Narvesh barged into the house and opened indiscriminate fire. Avdhesh managed to escape but the three girls were gunned down.

---||Nagpur||42 hosps to stop cashless facility from Dec 1: VHA||Nagpur: Come December 1 and policyholders of three health insurance companies and their six third party administrators (TPAs) may not be able to use cashless treatment facility at 42 major hospitals in the district. These hospitals, led by Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA), have adopted a tough stance against the three insurance companies and TPAs following de-empanelment of six hospitals. The six hospitals had disagreed to accept the revised treatment charges, which they claimed, were reduced by 50% as compared to the previous year’s tariff. Employee and consumer unions too have come out in support of these hospitals. The employee union said in case the hospitals agree to the revised lower tariffs under cashless facility, there is possibility of many job losses. Earlier this month, 20 big private hospitals, through VHA, had set November 18 as the deadline to reverse the de-empanelment of six hospitals and rollback the rate cuts. By November 24, the number of hospitals joining the cause has more than doubled to 42. In a press release, VHA president Dr Ashok Arbat said, “Soon, all the 160 member hospitals will be forced to join this agitation, if these companies do not mend their ways and value quality care by offering reasonable rates.” Wockhardt, Orange City, KRIMS, Alexis, Meditrina, Care, Viveka, Suretech, Arogyam, Center Point, Midas, Ortho Relief, Hope, Icon, Lotus, Samarpan, Sengupta, Treat Me, Radiance, Keshav, Swasthyam, Crescent, Sushrut, Aureus, Getwell, East End, New Era, Asha and Platina among others have announced withdrawal of cashless facility for the beneficiaries of the three companies and 6 TPAs from December 1. Ganesh Iyer, general secretary, Insurance Beneficiaries Association, said even if the hospitals agree to attend patients in such minimalistic package costs, which are inclusive of medicines, consumables and diagnostics, it will affect quality of treatment and complications may increase. Prakash Shende, working president, Vidarbha Private Hospitals Employees Union, said hospitals will be forced to either reduce remuneration or retrench personnel, which will be detrimental to those already working in these hsopitals. Iyer alleged, “Till date, hospitals were issuing prescriptions to patients and they used to get the medicines on cashless basis from hospital pharmacy so the relatives were aware of what was being procured and administered. If package rates are levied, they will be in the dark and hospitals, because of such low rates, will use substandard drugs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/42-hosps-to-stop-cashless-facility-from-dec-1-vha/articleshow/87897934.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||17 thefts in Nov, most on city’s outskirts||Nagpur: Theft and burglary cases are on the rise in the city. In little over a fortnight, 17 such incidents, including many daylight burglaries, have been reported. As per police data, most cases took place on the city’s outskirts, raising serious questions over police patrolling. Of these, most cases were reported under the jurisdiction of Hudkeshwar and Jaripatka police stations, revealed a quick look into the theft cases reported in the city from November 1 to 23. As many as three cases of theft each were reported in the periphery of these two police stations. There was a decline, though, during Covid-induced lockdown as people were forced to stay at home. With the relaxation in restrictions, thefts have increased. Pre and post Diwali, Nagpur city has witnessed sudden spurt in thefts, admitted DCP (crime) Chinmay Pandit. On November 23, between 11am and 10.30pm, thieves entered a house in Santaji Society in Manish Nagar and decamped with valuables worth Rs2.36 lakh. Beltarodi police said the burglary took place at the residence of Sachin Salankar (36), who had gone for his younger brother’s marriage reception on that day. The theft came to light after Salankar returned home and found the house ransacked. Police said unidentified thieves sneaked into Salankar’s house by breaking open the rear door and then broke open almirah to decamp with gold ornaments and Rs9,000 cash, collectively valued at Rs2.36 lakh. Pandit said most of the cases are being reported from the outskirts and also from residential areas situated along the Outer Ring Road. Crime branch unit of the city police has a special anti-housebreaking squad and all five units have been assigned to do motorcycle patrolling in areas where burglaries have increased manifold. These units patrol during crucial timings — from 12 midnight to 5am, said the DCP. The DCP said that CCTV surveillance in the city’s outskirts is insufficient. The areas are not also covered under Smart city’s CCTV surveillance. “The crime branch is also into detection of theft cases on a war footing,” he said. He appealed to citizens to install CCTV cameras in their houses. “Though it will not prevent thefts, it will definitely help in detection of burglaries,” he said. Pandit also advised citizens going outstation to inform their neighbours so that they can keep a watch on any suspicious activity, which will help in preventing thefts.

---||Delhi||Delhi cops to probe if investigating officer tried to shield northeast riots accused||NEW DELHI: A city court has directed police to investigate whether a deliberate attempt was made by the investigating officer to shield five accused in a northeast Delhi riots case related to vandalism and looting of a medical store. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said the five men were being discharged not because the incident did not take place or that they were falsely implicated, but merely because there was no sufficient evidence produced against them. DCP (Northeast) was ordered to conduct the probe and submit a report to the court on the next date of hearing. The court observed it was not insensitive towards the mental agony and financial loss suffered by the complainant, but sensitivity or emotions alone couldn't be taken into consideration while deciding the fate of any accused. "These cannot take the place of evidence. There should be sufficient and legally admissible evidence based on which charges can be framed, which is lacking in this case," it added. It was further noted that during an unlawful assembly or when a large number of people take part in arson or a clash, to convict an accused at least two prosecution witnesses have to support and identify their role and involvement. However, in this case it was evident from the chargesheet that there was only one eyewitness, the complainant himself. "The complainant himself had not identified the accused directly from the mob. He identified them as assailants from photographs shown to him in the police station on March 15, 2020. There are no other witnesses who identified, either directly or indirectly, the accused to be the assailants," the November 22 order mentioned. The judge said charges couldn't be framed against the accused taking into account the material annexed with the chargesheet and there was no possibility of their conviction at the final stage. "It would be a sheer wastage of judicial time if the charges are to be framed against the accused upon consideration of the evidence on record based on which the accused may be acquitted later," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cops-to-probe-if-investigating-officer-tried-to-shield-northeast-riots-accused/articleshow/87899817.cms||Usha Das

Meanwhile, Amarinder, who is launching his new outfit Punjab Lok Congress, said in an interview to a news channel that he would invite PM Modi to campaign for his party (because he plans to have a seat-sharing arrangement with BJP) and that he, too, would be willing to campaign for BJP in UP and Uttarakhand. The move follows hints from Preneet that she would support him in his political endeavours.

---||Nagpur||Collector rejects Bhoyar’s complaint, accepts Bawankule’s nomination form||Nagpur: Collector R Vimala has rejected the objection filed by Congress candidate Dr Ravindra ‘Chotu’ Bhoyar and accepted the nomination form of BJP candidate Chandrashekar Bawankule for the MLC elections (Nagpur local authorities’ constituency). Nomination forms of all five candidates were found to be okay during scrutiny. The scrutiny of nomination forms went on for over nine hours on Wednesday following the objection and the hearing conducted by Vimala who is also the returning officer for the election. In the order, Vimala struck down all five points raised by Dr Bhoyar. Bawankule had not disclosed that he was the president of Mahalaxmi Jagdamba Charitable Trust in the affidavit filed on Monday. “After our objection during the scrutiny, he filed a new affidavit. But the returning officer says it was submitted on November 22 itself. The affidavit filed by him with nomination form was displayed on notice board and not the new one,” said Dr Bhoyar. In her written reply, Vimala said, “The nomination was displayed. As regards the additional affidavit, it had been submitted along with nomination form filed on November 22 and subsequently along with the two other nomination forms filed on November 23.” During the day of scrutiny, affidavits of all five candidates were not displayed on the notice board at the collector office. Also, the additional affidavit of Bawankule was not uploaded on the election website. Dr Bhoyar also alleged that the state government had sanctioned Rs 350 crore to Shri Mahalaxmi Devasthan in Koradi and it comes under office of profit. Rejecting this, Vimala said, “Bawankule was elected as chairman by members of the trust. Per contra, Bawankule submitted reply that objections are not tenable in view of judgement of Supreme Court. Upon perusal of the same vis-à-vis Article 191 of Constitution of India which is specifically and sufficiently clear that only appointment made by government of India or government of any state specified in first schedule are to be considered for any disqualification. Therefore, the statement made by the objector is not valid.” Dr Bhoyar also complained that Bawankule did not disclose about his dependent son Sanket, the latter’s contracts in government offices, property etc. “Bawankule did not disclose offences registered against him at two police stations. He did not submit ‘no dues certificate’. Bawankule informed about his wife in two companies. But he himself is in these companies,” he said. Vimala said, “These objections appear to be related about the false information on affidavit or suppression of the information which is not the ground for rejection of nomination papers. Still, it is necessary to ask the objector to file an affidavit clearly stating the averments made in his complaint and supporting documents attached therewith are all true and genuine. Therefore, the reference may be forwarded to the chief electoral officer for further action in terms of direction of election commission of India. Accordingly, direction is given to the objector to file an affidavit separately clearly stating that averments made in his complaint and supporting documents attached therewith are all true.” Vimala did not respond to TOI’s calls. She declined to meet the media after the scrutiny meeting. Bawankule also did not respond to calls. Bhoyar told TOI that the collector rejected his objections under pressure from the election commission of India. “My objections were proper. I also submitted related documents. I was not given copy of affidavits on time even though I submitted applications at 2.50pm and 5.30pm. I got copies after 8.30pm. I will approach the appropriate forum,” he said. Bhoyar did not raise objections related to education qualification of Bawankule. As reported by TOI, on Wednesday, in his 2014 affidavit for the state elections, Bawankule had mentioned 2nd year BSc while in the recent one it is 1st year BSc. The other three candidates in fray are Praful Gudadhe, Mangesh Deshmukh and Suresh Rewatkar. The last date for withdrawal of nomination forms is November 26.

---||Nagpur||13 from Desh held in train, cops claim human trafficking||Nagpur: The crime branch of city police and Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad claimed to have busted an international human trafficking racket after detaining nine women, three children and a youth – all Bangladeshi nationals – on Tuesday night. Those detained had allegedly infiltrated into India with fake identities and were detained when they were travelling in a train from Kolkata to Mumbai. The Bangladeshi nationals are being interrogated by Nagpur police. “Of those detained, two to three women were being taken to Surat in Gujarat to push them into flesh trade, while others were to be engaged in casual labour,” said DCP (crime) Chinmay Pandit. Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar had received a tip off about women, children and men being forcibly taken to Gujarat via Mumbai in a train. The CP directed ACP (crime) Sunil Fulari and DCP Pandit to take action. Two units of crime branch sleuths and ATS team laid a trap at Nagpur railway station on Tuesday night. After one of the trains entered Nagpur station, the police team searched all the coaches. Nine women, including two girls, three children and a man along were found in the last bogie in suspicious condition. Police took them into custody and brought them to the crime branch office in Gittikhadan. On interrogation, the police learnt that they were all residents of Jessore district in Bangladesh. It came to light that the young women were allegedly being sent for prostitution while the other Bangladeshi nationals were being sent to Surat and other cities in Gujarat to work as daily wagers. The two young women – one an engineer – were allegedly involved in prostitution. Police investigation has revealed that one of the girls was also involved in prostitution in Bangladesh. Police also seized Aadhaar cards from them. It is being speculated that the Aadhaar cards may be fake. It has come to fore that they had crossed the Indian border two days ago and stayed in a hotel in Howrah. The trafficker also charged Rs20,000 (in Indian currency) from each of them. They boarded a train for Mumbai on Tuesday. During preliminary investigation, it was revealed that all had fake Indian ID proofs prepared from a man in Kolkata. “A team of Nagpur crime branch police will visit Kolkata, Mumbai and Surat for further investigation,” said Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-from-desh-held-in-train-cops-claim-human-trafficking/articleshow/87898006.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Delhi’s IGI was busier than Dubai airport in November||NEW DELHI: The pandemic has flipped the pecking order of world airports. This month, Delhi's IGI Airport was busier than Dubai International Airport in terms of combined domestic and international seat capacity deployed by airlines. At close to 30.9 lakh, IGIA is the seventh busiest airport globally this month, ahead of Dubai at a little over 30.7 lakh, according to UK-based air consultancy firm OAG. In pre-pandemic November 2019, Dubai was at number 3 and IGIA at number 10. While Dubai remains the world's busiest international airport by seats, IGIA does not figure in the list of top 10 international airports due to continued restrictions on scheduled foreign flights by India. The revival of domestic air travel in India has led to a revival of footfall at airports, making IGIA overtake Dubai in overall seat capacity. In pre-pandemic times, nearly 60% of the international traffic between India and the rest of the world flew foreign airlines. Of them, Gulf carriers took the lion's share in terms of both point to point and connecting traffic. "If India is able to take steps to lower the steep operating cost structures for its airlines and the latter are able to mount more nonstops to the rest of the world, including distant continents, then the blow to airlines of nearby hubs will be big. Transit traffic to and from India is a big source of filling the planes of these airlines," said an airline official. Thanks to traffic recovery, India's busiest and second busiest airport, Delhi's IGI and Mumbai airport, respectively, are now using all their terminals. Meanwhile, the 10 busiest airports overall this month, according to OAG, are Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Dallas Fort Worth, Chicago O'Hare, Guangzhou, Denver, Los Angeles International, Delhi IGIA, Dubai DXB, Tokyo Haneda and Shenzhen. The 10 busiest airports by international seat capacity alone this month are Dubai DXB, London Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris CDG, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Doha, Madrid Adolfo Suarez-Barajas, New York JFK and Dublin. "Only half of the current Top 10 airports were in the Top 10 in November 2019. Still missing are Singapore (23), Hong Kong (27), Incheon (45) and Bangkok (63) as recovery in Asia continues to falter," says OAG.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-igi-airport-was-busier-than-dubai-airport-in-november/articleshow/87899838.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Yadav also held talks with Apna Dal (K) chief Krishna Patel. Singh, who tweeted a picture of him shaking hands with Akhilesh, described the meeting as "a constructive interaction where common issues and strategies were discussed to further the idea of freeing UP from the misgovernance of BJP". The Rajya Sabha MP later told TOI that a tie-up between the two parties might yet happen. AAP had declared it would go it alone in the UP elections, due early next year. On Wednesday evening, Akhilesh tweeted a picture of another interaction he had with a potential ally: Apna Dal (K) chief Krishna Patel. While the SP chief's tweet made no mention of a poll alliance, the Apna Dal (K) chief told reporters that the deal was done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-alliance-bid-akhilesh-meets-aaps-up-in-charge/articleshow/87899839.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

The state Cabinet, which took this decision on Wednesday, also did away with the qualifying language papers. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in his post-Cabinet briefing said, "The Cabinet took a decision that the language papers in the mains examination will no longer be there. But there will three conditions for eligibility - the candidate should be a permanent resident, his or her name should be registered in the employment exchange of the state and must be fluent in the state's official and associated languages and other local languages. Obviously, Hindi will also be an option." He added that knowledge in written Assamese was earlier compulsory for the candidates but this has created a lot of reaction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/civils-exam-assam-introduces-residency-and-language-riders/articleshow/87899860.cms||Prabin Kalita

The 1.15-minute video purportedly shows a conversation between the two at the party office on October 31. It was picked up by mics on the table while the cameras were on. In the video, Siddaramaiah can be seen reminding Shivakumar, at the beginning of the event, that the day also happens to be Patel's birthday. In response, Shivakumar says, "It is, sir ... (but) we don't keep their portraits together." Following which Siddaramaiah says, "BJP will take advantage of it." The video then shows Shivakumar asking a person to get Patel's portrait and tells Siddaramaiah that he will get it placed next to Indira's. Sharing the clip, BJP leaders attacked Congress. "Congress leaders Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar agreed to place photo of Sardar Patel along with that of Indira Gandhi fearing BJP," the saffron party's national general secretary C T Ravi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/whispers-of-karnataka-congress-netas-on-patel-give-bjp-fresh-ammo/articleshow/87899863.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Easy moolah lures tribals to grow marijuana in Chhota Udepur||VADODARA: Farms in interior villages of Chhota Udepur would grow paddy and millets, the staple meal of tribals. However, these are now surreptitiously getting replaced by marijuana, a cheap contraband, often connected with spirituality. Although the tribal population may not be addicts in any form, the lure of moolah attached to these easily available psychotropic substances in urban centres lure the farmers to earn some quick bucks on the side. Illegal farming of marijuana has, however, turned into a pestilence of sorts in the tribal-dominated district throwing the police to literally sniff around fields to catch such wilful tillers. The local police can measure their huge success by seizing over 2,822kg marijuana plants from different villages in just 11 months. While police value one kilogramme of marijuana at Rs 10,000, they suspect that the farmers are getting paid much more than that. So far, cops have arrested 10 farmers for growing the banned crop at their farms or backyards of their homes, but those providing the tillers with the seeds and buying the fully grown plants later are yet out of law’s reach. Interestingly, cops are perplexed by the farmers’ explanations. A police official disclosed that a farmer revealed that godmen living ascetic lives supply them with the seeds and are even the buyers of the final products after some months. “Earlier it did not seem convincing, but as we started catching these farmers, we kept hearing the same explanation from each one of them. And, their versions didn’t smack of being ‘tutored statements’ as these farmers don’t know one another and also live in different villages,” said inspector J P Mewada of special operations group of Chhota Udepur police. Looking at the rapid rise in marijuana cultivation, the police, including senior officials, have now resorted to educating the tillers on the menace. They hold awareness drives and village-level meetings regularly. “We make these illiterate farmers understand the severity of the crime. We explain that if they get lured to grow the plant, they will be arrested and getting a bail will also be very difficult,” said Dharmendra Sharma, superintendent of Chhota Udepur police. Sharma added that they have identified a couple of seed providers and will track them down soon. Earlier this year in another big seizure, Amreli police unearthed an opium cultivation racket in Babra taluka. Cops had seized 339.5kg of opium from three different farms in May and booked the farmers under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/easy-moolah-lures-tribals-to-grow-marijuana/articleshow/87897370.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Justice N Seshasayee, deprecating the attempt to establish another memorial when Rs 80 crore had been already spent in building a memorial for Jayalalithaa on the Marina, asked: "Is it not one memorial too many? What is the inspirational story that 'Veda Nilayam' may provide which the Marina memorial does not?" The judge then directed the Chennai district collector to hand over the keys of Veda Nilayam to Jayalalithaa's niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak, who are her sole legal heirs, within three weeks. As to the claim made by the income tax department over the properties of Jayalalithaa for recovery of pending tax dues to the tune of Rs 37.54 crore, Justice Seshasayee said: "The department is free to proceed for recovering any arrears of tax payable by Jayalalithaa." In his order, the judge categorically dismissed the contention of the then state government that the conversion of the Poes Garden property into a memorial constituted public purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/is-one-memorial-not-enough-hc-quashes-jaya-house-acquisition/articleshow/87899880.cms||---

Mine partially came down and other shacks at Baga also suffered damage to their roofs. We cover the thatched roofs with plastic sheets, but all the roofs are not sloping, so the water does not drain immediately. Some parts are flat, so the water accumulates and then the roof collapses with the weight,” John Lobo, general secretary of the Shacks Owners Welfare Society (SOWS), said. Besides damage to the shacks, workers have to also remove tables, deck beds and umbrellas whenever it rains, shack owners said. Although there are a large number of domestic tourists visiting the coastal belt, shacks are getting fewer tourists because of the inclement weather. “It’s a very bad situation. We were hoping for a good season after two bad seasons. But the rain has brought bad luck. There is no business at all,” Manuel Cardozo, president of the Traditional Shacks Owners Association, said. With foreign charter tourist flights yet to resume, some beach shack owners have not yet started to erect their shacks, while some others have begun setting up their shacks hoping business is good during the peak December-January season. “First, they (government) said charter tourism will start in November. Now, they’re saying charters will come in December. We’re hoping they come. Otherwise it will be a complete loss again,” Cardozo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rain-hits-shacks-biz-operators-lament-losses/articleshow/87898170.cms||---
---||India||SC: Is govt willing to put a life ban on convicted netas?||NEW DELHI: In its more than a decade long tryst with loudly debated issue of decriminalisation of politics and after passing several orders to make perceptible changes in the polity, the Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared to have reached a dead end over a year-old plea for imposing a life ban on convicted netas from contesting elections. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant indicated this after asking additional solicitor general S V Raju to spell out the Centre's view on the plea of advocate-petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay seeking the life ban on convicted politicians. When Raju said that he has to take instructions on this issue from the Union government, the bench said, "It is almost 15 months since the court sought the Centre's view. Are you willing to impose a life ban on convicted politicians? Unless the Centre takes a decision and consults the Election Commission for enactment of a law or amending the Representation of People Act, it is not easy for this court to decide the issue. The government has to decide whether or not to take the legislative route." Upadhyay argued that conviction in a heinous offence disqualifies a person for the entire life to hold even the post of a constable. "But it does not disqualify a similarly convicted person from contesting elections and becoming the home minister," he said. Referring to the numerous PILs filed by Upadhya, the bench asked, "how many PILs have you filed?" It went on to give a back-handed compliment to Upadhyay and advocate M L Sharma, who was not present in the proceedings, for flooding the court with PILs. "A day is not far off when we have to set up a special bench to hear only the PILs filed by Upadhya and M L Sharma," the CJI-led bench said. In Upadhyay's petition, the bench has passed numerous orders since 2018 to speed up long pending trials in criminal cases against sitting and former MPs and MLAs, including setting up of special courts. SP leader from Rampur, Azam Khan and his family members, through senior advocate Kapil Sibal said though the case against the Khans was cheating, triable by a magistrate, the Allahabad HC has referred the case, on a misinterpretation of SC orders, to sessions court, robbing the Khans the right to seek revision of magistrate's order. The bench said it would clarify the confusion. On September 10 last year, the SC had asked the Centre to respond to a new prayer in a pending PIL seeking a life time ban on netas, convicted of heinous offences, to contest elections. On December 3 last year, the Union government filed a short affidavit opposing lifetime ban to contest elections on politicians convicted of serious offences. The Representation of People Act stipulates disqualifying the convicted person, who has been sentenced to two or more years imprisonment, from contesting elections for a period of six years after serving the sentence. The law ministry had said that unlike the government servants, "there are no specific service conditions laid down in respect of elected representatives, even though they are categorised as public servants. Elected representatives are bound by the oath that they have taken, to serve the citizens of their constituency in particular and the country in general. Their conduct is bound by propriety, good conscience and they are expected to generally work in the interest of the nation. They are already bound by the disqualification in terms of Representation of People Act as well as various directions and precedents as laid down by the SC from time to time." On August 10 this year, the SC had underlined the urgency for weeding out criminals from electoral politics and scathingly criticised the Centre's lackadaisical approach in enacting suitable laws to decriminalise legislatures. It had said, "The nation continues to wait, and is losing patience. Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government." The SC had recounted its continuous efforts for nearly a decade to decriminalise politics and said, "No one can deny that the menace of criminalisation in the Indian political system is growing day by day. Also, no one can deny that for maintaining purity of the political system, persons with criminal antecedents and who are involved in criminalisation of the political system should not be permitted to be the law-makers." "This Court, time and again, has appealed to the law-makers of the country to rise to the occasion and take steps for bringing out necessary amendments so that the involvement of persons with criminal antecedents in polity is prohibited. All these appeals have fallen on the deaf ears. The political parties refuse to wake up from deep slumber," it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-is-govt-willing-to-put-a-life-ban-on-convicted-netas/articleshow/87899901.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The maddi commenced the celebration of the novenas on Tuesday. In a bid to ensure that there is no crowding at the venue, the Basilica of Bom Jesus has increased the number of daily novena Masses to 10 and also spaced them out. The first Mass each day will be held at 5am, and a half hour gap is being maintained between each service. Basilica rector, Fr Patricio Fernandes said a bigger pandal has been erected accommodating 5,000 chairs. “The faithful must wear masks, sanitise and maintain social distancing. Most people are vaccinated, so that is good,” he said. The theme of this year’s novena is ‘Stay with us Lord, to love communion, participation, mission like St Francis Xavier’. On the feast day, too, there will be 10 Masses. The high Mass, at 10am, will be celebrated by archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao and emeritus bishop Alex Dias, along with other priests. Pilgrims who annually occupy the corridors during the novenas have been permitted to stay by registering themselves. Fernandes said that on the account of ban on fires and cooking, pilgrims can avail of food packages from the canteen. “For nearly two years, devotees of Goemcho Saib have not freely visited the shrine or participated in the novenas and feast. But this year, special arrangements are made to encourage the faithful to safely come and pay their respects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-masses-longer-gaps-for-sfx-novenas/articleshow/87898272.cms||---

According to the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21), the problem is much bigger in rural India where the percentage was 27%, whereas in urban areas underage marriage accounted for 14.7% of marriages. The data shows that 6.8% females aged between 15-19 years were already mothers or pregnant at the time of the survey. The rural-urban difference was prominent, with 3.8% women falling in this category in urban areas and 7.9% in rural areas. NFHS-5 reflects an overall marginal decline from 7.9% from 2015-16. Men aged between 25-29 years who were married before the legal age of 21 years was 21.1% in rural areas and 11.3% in urban India. Overall, such men accounted for 17.7% in 2019-21 as compared to 20.3% in 2015-16. NFHS-5 defines gender based violence as spousal violence which includes "physical and/or sexual violence". This remains an area of concern despite a slight decline nationally from 31.2% women in the age group of 18-49 years suffering it in 2015-16 to 29.3% in the latest survey period. Data for 11 states and three UTs released in the second phase of NFHS on Wednesday shows that the percentage of women who "ever experienced" spousal violence was highest in Tamil Nadu (38.1%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (34.8%), Jharkhand (31.5%), Odisha (30.6%), Puducherry (30.5%) Madhya Pradesh (28.1%), Arunachal Pradesh (24.8%), Rajasthan (24.3%), Delhi (22.6%), Chhattisgarh (20.2%), Haryana (18.2%), Uttarakhand, (15.1%), Punjab (11.6%) and Chandigarh (9.7%). In the data released last year for 17 states and five UTs under NFHS-5, Karnataka topped the list with 44% women surveyed saying that they have faced spousal violence at some point of time. The survey also cites data on young women aged 18-29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18. The all-India percentage remains static from NFHS-4 to NFHS-5 at 1.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/child-marriages-down-but-still-remain-area-of-concern/articleshow/87899928.cms||Ambika Pandit

In a sign that Goa’s nascent startup sector is gaining global attention, FI has announced that it aims to incubate projects in the ideation stage and build 20 technology companies per year in the state. With a presence in 200 cities, FI is one of the world’s major pre-seed accelerators and focuses on mentoring and guiding startups through the early stage funding process. In Goa, FI’s virtual accelerator programme will be steered by advisor for Lloyds Ventures, Chintan Oza, co-founder and chief executive officer of Brunchbites, Pritam Onsker, Brunchbites co-founder and image consultant Priyanka Row. The final admissions deadline for the Goa Virtual 2022 programme is March 13. Started in 2009 by serial entrepreneur Adeo Ressi and his colleague Jonathan Greechan, FI puts aspiring entrepreneurs and early-stage founders through an assessment programme and a rigorous course. “After spending 22 years in the corporate space, I thought it was time to do something for Goa. As a state, Goa comes with a high per capita income and literacy rate as well as smartphone penetration. The education system in Goa is ever improving thus creating a pool of youngsters waiting for an opportunity. With all these ingredients, Goa can become a good start-up hub and hence Goa,” said Onsker. Based in Silicon Valley, and with chapters across 200 cities, FI claims to help startup teams get traction, mentoring and funding. Many of India’s top startup technocrats such as IBM India’s associate partner Bhaskar Bulusu, former Dell director Ajay Hiraskar, founder and board member of Kilowott, Aaron Fernandes and others have agreed to be part FI-Goa and mentoring entrepreneurs. Local incubators such as CIBA, FiiRE and Atal Tinkering Labs have also agreed to be part of the programme. “With FI, Pritam and I wished to bring back to our home state the opportunity for our local technology startups to pitch to global world class funds, investors and mentors,” Row said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-startups-to-get-boost-from-silicon-valley-company/articleshow/87898310.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The duo were booked for allegedly assaulting their neighbour Suryakant Girodkar over a frivolous issue of wooden fencing on their pathway on Tuesday. Collem police inspector Prajyot S Fadte said the accused are at large and have approached the South Goa district and sessions court at Margao for anticipatory bail. According to the complaint lodged by Radhika, Girodkar’s wife, the petty scuffle was triggered as the accused were erecting a wooden pole fencing around their property, and had also covered the pathway that leads to Girodkar’s property. Her husband had requested the accused to leave their pathway open, but instead the accused assaulted him with a weapon, Radhika stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/villagers-demand-arrest-in-sacorda-assault-case/articleshow/87898348.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh's total fertility rate drops from 2.7 to 2.4; child immunisation jumps sharply||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh has recorded a sharp decline in the total fertility rate, a crucial indicator of population control, in the fifth National Family Health Survey released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare here on Wednesday. Besides, improvement on several other indicators, including maternal and child health fronts has given UP government and health sector players a reason to smile. As per the survey, UP's TFR 2.4 which was a substantial decline from 2.7 in NFHS-4 (2015-16). #UttarPradesh fared well #NFHS5#TFR down frm 2.7 to 2.4Any method of #contraception up from 45 to 62#4ANC up frm… https://t.co/8QZWocB1jF— Dr Manoj Kr Shukul (@ManojShukul) 1637809016000The national target here is is 2.1. While on one hand this is being linked to dedicated campaigns like Mission Parivar Vikas to promote family planning among newly wed couples, introduction of new methods of contraception like quarterly injectables and weekly pill is also being linked to the improvement on the indicator. The survey indicates success of these methods as the use of contraceptive methods (any form) has increased from 45 % to 62% among eligible users. '69.6% babies in 12-23 months age group fully immunized'Also, the total unmet need has declined from about 18% to 12.9%. Policy makers always see UP's large population size as its biggest health challenge and improvement on the count will have short term and long-term implications on a number of health indicators particularly maternal and child health, say experts. Improvement on the child immunization front is also significant. The survey shows that 69.6% children in the 12-23 months age group were found to be fully immunized under NFHS-5 as compared to 51.1% in the NFHS-4 (2015-16). The jump of 19 percentage points is a record, say child health experts. Several indicators on the child health front have also recorded reasonable improvement. Prevalence of childhood diarrhea has reduced from 15% to 5.6% and the improvement being associated with the improvement in the house-hold toilets and its usage. The surveyors have also noted that the use of ORS (oral rehydration solution) and zinc for diarrhea management increased from 37.9 to 50.7% and from 12.6 to 28.5% respectively. As a result of the change in health seeking behaviour, improvement against the infant and child mortality indicators has also been recorded. The neonatal mortality (death of children below 28 days of life) has come down from 45.1 to 35.7 per 1,000 live births while infant mortality (death of children below one year) has declined from 6.3% to 5.4%. The two have triggered a decline in the under-five childhood mortality rate bringing it down from 78.1 per 1000 live births to 59.8. The decline on the three fronts is also linked to a surge in mothers-to-be availing all the four antenatal check-ups in the pregnancy period. Earlier, only one in four women availed the facility while now about 42% are making use of the service. The decline in underage marriages is also being associated with the same. Data shows that under-age marriages in UP have gone down - from 21% to 15.8% in women and from 28.7% to 23% in men. A mixed bag of achievements was recorded on the nutritional front. A 6.6% reduction was seen in under-5 children with stunting and 7.4% reduction in underweight children. Though exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up from 41.6% to 59.7%, early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth has recorded a decline from 25.2 to 23.9% which is an area needing improvement. Anemia rates in pregnant women came down from 51% to 45.9% but that in children has increased from 63.2% to 66.4% A mixed bag of achievements was recorded on nutritional front. A 6.6% reduction was seen in stunting among children under five years of age and 7.4% reduction was recorded in underweight children. Though exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up from 41.6% to 59.7%, early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth has recorded a decline from 25%.2 to 23.9%.

---||India||Big jump in hospital births, C-sec deliveries also rise||NEW DELHI: Institutional births have increased substantially from 79% to 89% at the all-India level, the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey shows. Many states performed remarkably better with percentage of institutional births more than 90%. But even the low performing states did better compared to the last round. Institutional delivery is 100% in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu and more than 90% in seven states and UTs, findings of the survey show. In urban areas, 93.8% births were in institutional settings, whereas in rural areas it was 86.7%, data shows. However, institutional deliveries in public health facilities were more in rural areas as compared to urban areas. Along with an increase in institutional births, there has also been a substantial increase in C-section deliveries in many states and UTs, especially in private health facilities. While most of the C-section deliveries are in urban areas, there is a huge disparity in private and public hospitals. Private hospitals accounted for 47.4% of births through C-section, while only 14.3% births were through C-section in public hospitals. Maternal deaths are more common among poor and rural populations. Over the last few years, the central government has initiated various programmes like Janani Suraksha Yojana, particularly in areas with high maternal mortality rate (MMR). The objective of Janani Suraksha Yojana is to reduce the MMR and neo-natal mortality rate through promotion of institutional deliveries. Availability of institutional services have increased births in hospitals and lower deaths related to pregnancy and birth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/big-jump-in-hospital-births-c-sec-deliveries-also-rise/articleshow/87899956.cms||Sushmi Dey
