The government's clean energy drive is expected to reduce the country’s fuel demand growth rate to 1.5% from nearly 5% by fiscal 2030, creating redundancy in India’s projected refining capacity expansion worth an estimated 1.5 lakh crore. But despite the shrinking fuel demand, India’s incremental oil demand is expected to rise by 1.8 million barrels/day to 7 million barrel/day by fiscal 2030 from 5 million barrels/day in fiscal 2020, driven by growth in naphtha and petrochemicals capacities, says a CRISIL Research impact analysis of the clean energy drive on the transport sector. It shows the annual growth in consumption of diesel, the most-consumed fuel, dropping to 2.5% by 2030 after maintaining a growth rate of 4% till 2025. The fall in the growth rate in petrol sales will be sharper, halving to 1% by 2030 from 2% between 2022 and 2025. Petrol has clocked about 8% annual growth and diesel about 4% so far. The analysis says expansion of CNG networks and resultant rise in the number of CNG vehicles will drive down diesel consumption, while e-petrol (petrol laced with ethanol) and electric vehicles will displace petrol sales. “A more than three-fold increase in the number of CNG stations, advancing of the ethanol blending target and a significant decline in EV battery prices are likely to slash demand growth in petrol to 1% this decade from 8.4% in the last. Demand for diesel will be relatively resilient (2% annual growth compared with 3.9% earlier) because of non-exposure to the two-wheeler segment, where the shift to EVs is sharper, and the presence of a significant proportion of freight vehicles where CNG and EV penetration would be limited. Consequently, the proportion of diesel and petrol in the consumption of petroleum products will reduce to ~44% by 2030 from ~50% now,” according to CRISIL Research director Hetal Gandhi. Petrol and diesel account for 93% of the country’s overall transportation fuel basket. The decline in liquid fuel consumption will cast shadow over the viability of the planned expansion in refining capacity. According to the analysis, 40-60 mtpa (million tonne per annum) of capacity addition lined up by refiners — in addition to 110 MTPA capacity expected to come on stream by 2030 — may have to be trimmed as these may not be needed. India currently has a refining capacity of 250 mtpa and is on way to add 110 mtpa to take the total capacity to 360 mtpa by 2030. Even if the 40-60 mtpa additional capacity is excluded, the analysis says, capacity utilisation will be less that 100%, which will drive refiners to focus on petrochemicals. Roughly, 50% of crude is consumed in India for making transportation fuels. Within crude, petrol and diesel have a share of 14% and 39%, respectively. Crude makes up 28% of India’s overall energy mix and is a large source of carbon emission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-fuel-demand-growth-seen-shrinking-to-1-5-by-2030-on-clean-energy-drive/articleshow/87856232.cms||Sanjay Dutta

While jail authorities termed it a case of suicide, the victim’s family alleges foul play saying he was looking forward to the hearing of his case on December 4. A judicial inquiry will be conducted into the matter, which is mandatory under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). According to jail authorities, Omkar Singh was brought to the jail on September 24 in a cylinder theft case. “Earlier also, Omkar was arrested on September 9 after he was booked under section 151 of CrPC (prevention of commission of cognizable offences) but he managed to get bail and was released on September 18. A week later he was arrested again on September 24,” said jailor Pramod Kumar Singh. Singh’s brother Veeram told media persons that the family learnt about his brother’s death from the police. Veeram added that Omkar, who worked as a driver, had called his family a few days ago to inform them that his case would be heard on December 4.“How could he kill himself when he was looking forward to the hearing of his case? He might have been killed inside the prison,” the victim’s family alleged. Jail superintendent Vipin Kumar Mishra refuted the allegations of the family and said there was no callousness on the part of the prison authorities. He said none of his family members visited the prison to meet Omkar during his two months’ stay in jail. “We provide counselling sessions to prisoners every day and make all efforts to ensure that inmates do not suffer from depression,” claimed Mishra. After postmortem, the prisoner’s body was handed over to the family following which it was cremated in the evening. According to jail authorities, a total of 4,000 prisoners, including 550 convicted ones, are lodged in the district jail at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/undertrial-prisoner-found-hanging-from-tree-in-aligarh-jail-family-alleges-foul-play/articleshow/87856648.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

"The withdrawal of the farm laws has proved it that this government only listens to protesters," said Rajbhar, who was in Aligarh to attend a private function organised to celebrate SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s birthday on Monday. "There are several pressing issues such as inflation and waiver of electricity bills and to get them resolved people should start a movement to get their demands met. Because, it’s ironic that even as BJP leaders insulted the protesting farmers by calling them anti-nationals and khalistanis, the PM apologised to them and decided to repeal the contentious farm laws," said Rajbhar, who later addressed a Dalit mahapanchayat organised by the Banjara community in Khair area. Targeting BJP leaders, Rajbhar said the BJP government came to power by making false promises. "Nagpur is the centre where BJP leaders get training to lie to get votes. In Gorakhpur, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that he had given employment to 40 lakh people, while in Ambedkar Nagar, he said 25 lakh youths had been employed, and now he is saying that 4 lakh youths have been given jobs. Which one is correct," he sought to know, adding that BJP leaders are expert liars. Rajbhar, who recently allied with the Samajwadi Party to defeat the BJP, said the ruling dispensation is against everyone whosoever speaks truth whether journalists or officials. "An FIR has been lodged against a journalist in Mirzapur for highlighting drawbacks in the mid-day meal scheme. Instead of improving the situation, the government has targeted journalists. They are snatching freedom of everyone," he said. "If our government is formed in the state, we will ensure a peaceful atmosphere, waive off domestic electricity bills, conduct caste census, provide free treatment to poor people, free education till graduation and form a journalists’ commission," promised Rajbhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/people-should-take-to-streets-to-be-heard-by-the-pm-says-bjps-former-up-ally-om-prakash-rajbhar/articleshow/87856732.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

It has also issued notices to two firms for displaying and selling non-BIS two-wheeler helmets on their online platforms, which is prohibited by law. The CCPA, established as per the Consumer Protection Act, has given seven days to these e-commerce firms and the manufacturers of non-ISI helmets to submit their responses. Interestingly, during surveillance, the CCPA officials found that the e-commerce companies, in their description of products, mentioned these don’t have BIS marks. In this case, the CCPA has taken suo motu cognisance of violation of the BIS Act. Since the government has issued a ‘quality control order’ for both pressure cookers and two-wheeler helmets, manufacturing, storing, marketing and sale of non-BIS standard items is an offence. The BIS Act specifies that contravention of these provisions for the first time is punishable with imprisonment of up to two years or with fine, which shall not be less than Rs 2 lakh. “Since non-standard pressure cookers, two-wheeler helmets and LPG cylinders pose threat to life and these are used extensively, we have been carrying out a pan-India exercise to detect this malpractice. Every entity has to follow the law of the land. While manufacturers of such items are responsible, consumers often believe that the e-commerce firms must be complying with the laid down norms. So, we have directed the BIS director general to investigate and initiate action against all concerned,” said a CCPA official. Earlier this month, the CCPA had issued directions to district collectors across the country to investigate unfair trade practices and violation of consumer rights concerning manufacture or sale of such goods. “Essential, the daily-use products that have been identified for the three-month-long campaign are helmets, pressure cooker and cooking gas cylinders,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-biz-giants-issued-notices-for-selling-non-bis-standard-products/articleshow/87856888.cms||Dipak K Dash

"This is the first step. It's not the last step," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, describing Blinken's conversations, a day after the reinstatement of Sudan's civilian prime minister.  Price said there was no resumption of assistance, adding, "These decisions will be predicated entirely on what happens in the coming hours and the coming days and the coming weeks."  Blinken, who earlier has said he was "encouraged" by the weekend deal, spoke separately with General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and with Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok who was released from house arrest.  "That was essentially his message -- that we must continue to see progress, we must continue to see progress, we must continue to see Sudan move back down the democratic path," Price said.  Sudan set up a fragile power-sharing arrangement between the military and civilians after the 2019 toppling of dictator Omar al-Bashir, with elections due in 2024.  The United States sought to support the transition through $700-million aid package, which it suspended when Burhan ousted Hamdok and later appointed new members to the ruling council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-urges-more-sudan-progress-before-us-aid-resumes/articleshow/87857481.cms||---
---||World||Police: US parade-crash suspect was in a domestic-dispute scene||WAUKESHA: The man suspected of plowing his SUV into a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee, killing at least five people and injuring 48, had left the scene of a domestic dispute just minutes before, Waukesha's police chief said Monday.  Police chief Dan Thompson said there was is no evidence the crash on Sunday was a terrorist attack or that the suspect, Darrell Brooks Jr, knew anyone in the parade.  The chief said police were drawing up five charges of intentional homicide against Brooks, 39, of Milwaukee.  A joyous scene of marching bands and children dancing in Santa hats and waving pompoms gave way in an instant Sunday to screams and the sight of crumpled bodies as the SUV sped through barricades and struck dancers, musicians and others. Members of a "Dancing Grannies" club were among those killed, as was an employee of Citizens Bank.  Thompson identified those killed as four women ages 52 to 79 and an 81-year-old man.  "It looked like dummies being thrown in the air," said Nicole Schneiter, who was there with her children and grandchildren. "It took a second to register, like, 'Is that what we really just saw?' And then you looked in the road and there were just people laying in road."  At least nine patients - most of them children - were listed in critical condition Monday at two hospitals, and seven others were reported in serious condition.  According to the chief, police were not pursuing the suspect when he entered the parade route, but an officer did fire a shot to try to stop him but ceased firing because of the danger to others. The driver was not injured.  Brooks has two open criminal cases in Milwaukee County. In one case, filed Nov. 5, he is charged with resisting or obstructing an officer, reckless endangering, disorderly conduct, bail jumping and battery. Records show $1,000 cash bond was posted on Friday.  In the other case, filed in July 2020, Brooks is charged with reckless endangering and illegal possession of a firearm.  In the more recent one, a woman told police that Brooks deliberately ran her over with his vehicle in a gas station parking lot after a fight. She was hospitalized for her injuries.  The horror was recorded by the city's livestream and onlookers' cellphones. One video shows the moment the SUV broke through the barricades and includes the apparent sound of several gunshots.  "It was like a war scene walking through there," said Ken Walter, who had been riding in the parade in a hot air balloon basket along with his wife and youngest son. "There were these piles of blankets with cops standing over them that you just knew were bodies."  Walter said he saw a red SUV careen into view and watched it hit a member of his real estate-agency parade contingent, then barrel straight into members of the Waukesha South High School marching band.  The SUV continued down the parade route. Behind it, people were screaming, running, searching for family and friends and unsure whether they were still in danger, he recalled.  "It was like everything went into slow motion, and I couldn't hear anything," Walter said.  Schneiter said after sheltering in a store, she emerged to see bodies in the street, along with strollers, chairs, candy, random shoes. "Just stuff everywhere," she said. "You can't believe that really happened. It felt like we were in a movie or something. It just felt crazy."  The Milwaukee Dancing Grannies posted on its Facebook page that its members were "doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness."  "Those who died were extremely passionate Grannies. Their eyes gleamed... joy of being a Grannie. They were the glue... held us together," the organization said.  A Roman Catholic priest, parishioners and Waukesha Catholic schoolchildren were among those injured, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee said.  Eighteen children ages 3 to 16 were brought to Children's Wisconsin Hospital, including three sets of siblings, said Dr. Amy Drendel, medical director of the emergency department. They suffered injuries ranging from scrapes on their faces to broken bones and serious head injuries, she said. Six were listed in critical condition.  "This is unique and truly demonstrates the devastating effects of this on our community," said Dr. Michael Meyer, head of the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit.  At the White House, President Joe Biden said that "we don't have all the facts and details yet" but that his administration was closely monitoring the situation.  The Waukesha school district canceled classes Monday and Tuesday and said extra counselors would be on hand for students and staff. The parade's lineup included cheer, dance and band entries associated with district schools.  The parade, held each year on the Sunday before Thanksgiving, is sponsored by the city's Chamber of Commerce. This year's event, the 59th, had the theme of "comfort and joy."  Waukesha is a western suburb of Milwaukee, and about 55 miles (90 kilometers) north of Kenosha, where Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted Friday of charges stemming from the fatal shooting of two men and the wounding of a third during unrest in that city in August 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-us-parade-crash-suspect-was-in-a-domestic-dispute-scene/articleshow/87857483.cms||---
---||India||‘Stir not over yet’: SKM takes farm fight to poll-bound Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Unmoved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Monday unleashed the combined might of 40 farm unions in Lucknow and warned of a prolonged agitation till all its six demands, including a legal guarantee on MSP for crops and Union junior minister Ajay Mishra Teni’s dismissal over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, were met. As hundreds of farmers from across UP and its neighbouring states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, converged on Lucknow’s Eco Garden for the kisan mahapanchayat, Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait declared the yearlong agitation he had been spearheading on the Delhi border was far from over. “Sangharsh vishram ki ghoshna abhi humne nahi ki hai-...humare masle bahut hain abhi (We haven’t stopped our agitation, a lot of issues are yet to be resolved),” he said. The mahapanchayat slogan — “MSP nahi toh andolan wahi (MSP off means agitation on)” — echoed what Tikait said. SKM threatened to take the stir to different parts of the country if the Centre didn’t fulfil its demands. The organisation has convened a meeting on the Delhi border on November 27 to decide its next course of action. SKM's wishlist includes repeal of the 2020 electricity bill, withdrawal of cases filed against farmers for stubble burning, rehabilitation of the families of farmers who died during the stir and a memorial to them at Singhu. Tikait slammed BJP and its allies for allegedly diverting people's attention from the farm protests by raising "communal issues". Picking on PM Modi's reference to "kuch log (some people)" while explaining why the Centre was forced to opt for a repeal of the farm laws, he alleged it was a ploy to divide the farmers. "The PM's apology will not help farmers get the right price for their produce. They will get this price only when MSP is given legal sanctity," Tikait said, pointing out that a committee headed by Modi during his stint as Gujarat CM in 2011 had made the same recommendation. "The report is still there with the PMO and awaits implementation," he said. Jai Kisan Andolan convener Yogendra Yadav accused BJP of shielding junior home minister Teni, whose son allegedly ran over four protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri. "He is the sutradhaar (facilitator) of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence," Yadav said, addressing a gathering of farmers and asking them not to relent till the minister was sacked and jailed. Among the farmers who reached the UP capital from the hinterland was Paramjeet Singh, a Sikh from Mehmoodabad tehsil in Sitapur. He said farmers were being forced to sell paddy for just over Rs 1,100 a quintal against an MSP of Rs 1,940. Another farmer from Pilibhit, Karan Singh, alleged that less than 10% of the total produce purchased from farmers was at MSP rates. SKM's combative move to call the mahapanchayat in Lucknow is seen as hitting BJP where it might potentially hurt the most, especially with assembly elections due early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stir-not-over-yet-skm-takes-farm-fight-to-poll-bound-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/87857595.cms||Pankaj Shah

At least 31 crore doses of Covid vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) are likely to be produced in December, almost four times the 7.9 crore doses made in May, indicating the scale-up in production. With a higher coverage of first dose and scheduled administration of second dose after a prescribed gap, the local requirement of jabs has reduced sharply in November. Around 10.4 crore doses have been given so far, while 21.64 crore unused doses were available with the states and UTs as on Monday morning. Government plans to maximise utilisation of available stocks by end of this month to aim for 100% first dose coverage and jabs for those who are due for the second shot after the prescribed interval, the official said. There will be some inventory from this month (November). We are expecting to administer a total of 22 crore doses in November,” an official said. A total of over 28 crore doses (Covishield and Covaxin) were produced during the current month till November 19. Of this, Covishield accounts for 22.3 crore, whereas the rest 5.6 crore are of Covaxin. While the Centre supplied 15.8 crore doses to states and Union Territories, the private sector procured just about 36,200 doses during the month, official data till November 19 show. While around 30 crore doses are estimated to be procured by the government by end of this month, some of it will also go towards exports. A total of around 117.6 crore doses have been administered till Monday 9 pm. While around 82% of the adult population has received at least first dose, nearly 43% are now fully vaccinated with both doses of the vaccines. In a letter sent to states and UTs on Monday, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “Districts should identify all left-out beneficiaries and mobilise them to get vaccinated on a priority basis.” Suggesting innovative strategies to nudge those who are to be vaccinated, he said local ambassadors can be involved and felicitated for expanding coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-likely-to-utilise-only-half-of-vaccine-produced-in-december/articleshow/87857780.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Winds of change may boost AQI to ‘poor’||NEW DELHI: Strong winds improved Delhi's air quality marginally on Monday, but it continued to remain "very poor". The overall air quality index (AQI) was 311 on Monday in comparison to 349 on Sunday. AQI is likely to touch the "poor" category on Tuesday, but may deteriorate again on Wednesday as wind speeds may slow down. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, "Wind speed reached 15-25kmph. It was mostly westerly winds and visibility also improved to 1,500-3,200m. Track the pollution level in your cityAn analysis of hour-to-hour visibility and wind speed data from November 1 to 22 shows Monday was the only day so far in the month when Palam reported visibility of more than 3,000m and such strong winds." Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead of Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, "While Delhi's air quality remained in the upper end of 'very poor' category for the past one week, it improved marginally on Monday due to relatively stronger surface winds in the afternoon hours, which are favourable for pollutant dispersion." According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting body, the share of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 was just 6% and effective fire count 909. "These strong winds are likely to continue on Tuesday, leading to further improvement of air quality to the 'poor' category. It is likely to improve to 'poor' or 'lower end of very poor' categories for the next two days." From Wednesday, the air quality is predicted to deteriorate as local and transport level winds are likely to slow down, stated SAFAR. It will result in slight deterioration of air quality but expected to be within the "lower end of very poor" range, it added. "Given that meteorology plays a crucial role in influencing the city's air quality, the Delhi government should actively make use of insights from IITM's early warning system to plan and execute pre-emptive measures in advance to keep pollution levels under control," Ganguly said. In the coming days, with declining temperatures, the contribution from local biomass burning for warming needs may see a rise, she pointed out. "Local authorities should take immediate measures to ensure that Delhi's homeless have access to warm clothes and blankets, and that security personnel have access to electric heaters," Ganguly added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-pollution-winds-of-change-may-boost-aqi-to-poor/articleshow/87857823.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

While granting relief to Singh, the court expressed deep concern over the ongoing battle between him and former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who is also being probed by the CBI and the ED on the allegations levelled by the senior IPS officer that the NCP functionary had asked for collection of bribes amounting to Rs 100 crore. It said if a former police chief could not trust the force he had served, where would a common person go for justice. As the court earlier put a condition that he reveal his whereabouts to get a hearing, Singh’s counsel told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh that the officer had not fled abroad and was hiding in the country fearing a threat to his life from Maharashtra Police. The bench granted him a hearing and passed an ex parte order in his favour to grant him protection from arrest. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Param Bir Singh, said the ex-Mumbai top cop was being targeted by state machinery, which lodged six “frivolous” FIRs against him after he wrote a letter to the CM against Deshmukh, who is now facing a CBI probe over the allegations. Bali said his client had no faith in the state police and assured the court that he would appear before the CBI within 48 hours if the probe against him was transferred from Maharashtra Police to the central agency. He also brought to the court’s notice his WhatsApp conversation with Maharashtra DGP Sanjay Pandey in which he was asked to withdraw the letter. Placing the transcript of the conversation before the bench, Bali said Pandey had advised him not to fight against the system and to withdraw the letter sent to the CM and also threatened that consequences would follow if he didn’t fall in line The court didn’t delve deep into the WhatsApp conversation. “We do find the picture very disturbing. An earlier commissioner seems to show lack of faith in police! We wonder what would happen to the common man and what kind of faith would they have in police. The matter has become curiouser and curiouser in the battle between the then home minister and the then police commissioner. The only question which has to be examined is whether in view of the CBI looking into the matter, the other aspects arising are also to be entrusted to the CBI,” it said. “The petitioner shall join the probe but shall not be arrested,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-protects-param-bir-from-arrest-tells-him-to-join-probe/articleshow/87857892.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||US issues 'Do Not Travel' Covid-19 warning for Germany, Denmark||WASHINGTON: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the State Department on Monday advised against travel to Germany and Denmark because of a rising number of Covid-19 cases in those countries. The CDC elevated its travel recommendation to "Level Four: Very High" for the two European countries, telling Americans they should avoid travel there, while the State Department issued parallel "Do Not Travel" advisories for both countries. The CDC currently lists about 75 destinations worldwide at Level Four, with many European countries on the list including Austria, Britain, Belgium, Greece, Norway, Switzerland, Romania, Ireland and the Czech Republic. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel told leaders of her conservative party that measures being taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus in Europe's biggest economy were insufficient and that stronger action needed to be taken, Reuters reported on Monday. Case numbers in Germany have been soaring, especially among the elderly whose first two shots of Covid-19 vaccine were at the start of the year, and among children who are not eligible for inoculation. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said European countries must work harder to prevent the coronavirus spreading further as deaths and new cases surge. Current transmission rates in 53 European countries are of "grave concern" and new cases are nearing record levels, exacerbated by the more transmissible Delta variant of the virus, the WHO's Hans Kluge warned. "We must change our tactics, from reacting to surges of Covid-19, to preventing them from happening in the first place," he said. Germany has already decided to limit large parts of public life in areas where hospitals are filling with Covid-19 patients.

The funding will go to the National Health Service Corps, Nurse Corps and Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery programs, all federal programs that offer scholarship and loan repayments for health care students and workers if they pledge to work in underserved and high-risk communities.  "Our nation must invest in a health care workforce that looks like America, and provide access to equitable health care for all Americans," Harris said.  The money, which includes funds from the American Rescue Plan and other sources, will support more than 22,700 providers, marking the largest number of providers enrolled in these programs in history, according to the White House. It comes in response to recommendations laid out earlier this month by the White House's COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, which issued a report outlining how the administration could address systemic inequality in the health care system.  The COVID-19 pandemic has both highlighted and exacerbated health care disparities for minority and underserved communities. According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, over the course of the pandemic, minority Americans have seen higher numbers of cases and higher rates of death than their white counterparts.  "Covid-19 did not invent health disparities. Just ask any healthcare professional and she will tell you: Health disparities existed long before this virus reached our shores. Health disparities stem from broader systemic inequities," she said.  It's just the latest investment from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, passed in March of this year, aimed at addressing health disparities among minority and underserved communities. Earlier this month, the White House announced an additional $785 million in funding for federal programs aimed at improving diversity in the public health workforce and supporting people with disabilities.  During the Monday event, Harris pushed for passage of President Joe Biden's nearly $2 trillion social safety net and climate change package, which would provide funding to temporarily close the Medicaid coverage gap and expand access to health insurance marketplace subsidies through 2025.  Harris said the package would also make a historic investment in maternal health "to address the tragedy of black maternal mortality in America."  Black women in the US are about three times as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause as others, partly because of racial bias they may experience in getting care and doctors not recognising risk factors such as high blood pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/harris-announces-1-5-billion-investment-in-health-care-workforce/articleshow/87858020.cms||---
---||India||Sunday's all-party meet likely to take up laws' repeal, MSP||NEW DELHI: The repeal of farm laws and demands for a legal guarantee for a minimum support price for crops is expected to figure at discussions at the all- party meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament even as the government is expected to suggest that all issues, including those raised by the agitating farm unions, can be taken up by the committee proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As is the norm, the Prime Minister is expected to participate in the all-party meeting, convened by the parliamentary affairs minister, on Sunday ahead of the winter session beginning on November 29. With the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) writing to Modi on six demands apart from repeal of farm laws, the government is expected to suggest to the unions that they join the discussion proposed by the Prime Minister. Floor leaders of all the political parties from both Houses will participate and underline issues they consider important. The meeting will be preceded by a more informal interaction hosted by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. The meeting apart, the stage may be set for some sharp discussion in Parliament as the government moves to repeal the farm laws. In similar fashion, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu has called a meeting of the floor leaders of the Upper House. With the government and opposition preparing to press their points on the repeal of the laws, both sides are likely to hold meetings to discuss floor coordination. BJP will hold its parliamentary executive meeting, followed by the meeting of the NDA floor leaders. The Cabinet is likely to approve repeal of the three farm laws on Wednesday. On the occasion of Guru Purab last Friday, Modi addressed the Nation and announced repeal of the three farm laws, saying he was apologising to the nation that he had not been able to convince a section of farmers about the benefits of the legislations even as the agitating farm union leaders are now demanding to call off the agitation only when the government gives legal guarantee on MSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sundays-all-party-meet-likely-to-take-up-laws-repeal-msp/articleshow/87858168.cms||---

While the latest data on the matter shows heart attack to be the major cause — accounting for 57% or 28,680 of the 49,925 sudden deaths in 2020 — people also died of brain haemorrhage and other less-common causes of sudden death. A break-up of other causes has not been provided by the government. In 2020, sudden deaths increased by nearly 6% from the previous year, and accounted for a greater percentage of overall accidental deaths compared to 2019. Analysis of past data shows that the increase in 2020 was more than double the rate of increase in 2019, when the number of such deaths rose by 2.8% compared to the previous year. In fact, such cases have been growing consistently since 2016. Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020, nearly 2.3 lakh people died a sudden death, of which 56% or more than 1.2 lakh died of heart attacks. Dr Sunil Karanth, chairman, critical-care services, Manipal Health Enterprises, explained: "Big haemorrhage in the brain, a big stroke, particularly in the brain stem, cardiac arrest because of heart attack or arrhythmia (where the heart rhythm becomes abnormal) are the major causes for sudden death. Other uncommon causes are a tear in the large vessel etc." Data shows 3% of such deaths in 2020 were people below the age of 18 — nearly 2% were below the age of 14 years — and the trend remains the same for a five-year period. Nearly 7,600 or 3.3% of all such deaths between 2016 and 2020 were those aged below 18 years. Not surprisingly, most sudden deaths were reported in the age group of 45-59 years, followed by those aged between 30 and 44 years, and those aged 60 years or more. Of the nearly 2.3 lakh such deaths in the said five years, 35% were aged between 45-59 years, around 29% were in the age group of 30-44 years and 20.5% were aged 60 years or more. "Among very young children, there is a documented phenomenon called crib death (sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS) where the kid suffocates itself by a wrong position. Otherwise, the causes would be the same, barring maybe brain haemorrhage," Karanth said. Analysis of state-wise break-up of such cases since 2016 shows that two-thirds of such cases occurred in just five states: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. In fact, Maharashtra alone accounts for a third (73,144) of all cases, followed by Karnataka (23,020), Kerala (20,693), Madhya Pradesh (18,546) and Gujarat (15,882). Tamil Nadu (12,494) and Rajasthan (11,517) were also among states with a high number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sudden-deaths-claimed-five-lives/hour-in-2020/articleshow/87858188.cms||---

Overflowing storm water drains flooded roads of tech hub Manyata Tech Park. Water level was yet to recede in some areas till late Monday evening. Though entire Bengaluru received rain on Sunday night, it was largely very light to moderate. North Bengaluru received heavy to very heavy rain, with five stations of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre recording over 100mm rain: Vidyaranyapura (148mm), Chowdeshwari ward (138mm), Yelahanka Kempegowda ward (150mm), Jakkur (153mm) and Horamavu (103mm). “The Yelahanka zone alone received 138mm of rainfall in just 3-4 hours. Considering that the average rainfall for November is 30mm, Yelahanka has received more than four times that in a few hours. The flooding and waterlogging didn’t occur until after the Yelahanka lake overflowed,” BBMP chief Gaurav Gupta said. The city is likely to receive light to moderate showers for the next 48 hours. Thunderstorm with lightning is likely over the next 24 hours at isolated places over the state.

Stating that AMR — also termed as ‘Silent Pandemic’ — is the world’s biggest healthcare challenge, C-CAMP said India was one of the most affected geographies, accounting for an estimated 2.5 million or between 20% and 25% of the projected 10 million AMR-related deaths globally.“In this context, C-CAMP has brought together national and global stakeholders in AMR to make an impact and change in India with a common objective — fight against AMR. The vision of IAIH is to reduce AMR burden in India through deeper participation in the national efforts to tackle this global health challenge, thereby contributing to the global fight against AMR,” a C-CAMP statement reads.IAIH will focus on human AMR, Human-Animal interface or one health approach and Neglected Tropical Disease (NTDs). “It will aim to create a globally connected ecosystem that includes an experienced scientific and clinical knowledge base, regulatory expertise, capability and capacity building support such as funding and advanced R&D infrastructure, multi-pronged policy measures for Public Health and improving access, AMR stewardship and public communication for raising public awareness,” the statement read.The new hub partners include national and global AMR stakeholders from public health organisations such as WHO, philanthropic organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, non-profits like CARB-X, FIND, PATH, GARDP, DNDi, academic and research institutes and hospitals like Narayana Health, Cytecare Cancer Hospitals, RxDx Healthcare, ChanRe Rheumatology and Immunology Centre and Research, St John’s Medical College and Hospital).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/c-camp-launches-global-platform-to-combat-antimicrobial-resistance/articleshow/87858209.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Rain impact: When Bengaluru's Manyata Tech Park turned into network of streams||BENGALURU: The campus of one of Bengaluru’s largest technology hubs — Manyata Tech Park near Hebbal — was flooded after Sunday night’s downpour, forcing employees on their way to office on Monday morning to return home. Photos of submerged colonies, waterlogged roads in BengaluruWith its streets under three-four feet water, the tech park campus, located on the banks of Nagawara Lake on Outer Ring Road, resembled a grid of canals. Videos and images of the waterlogging went viral on social media platforms. When some of the administrative and cleaning staff went to the tech park at the crack of dawn to go about their duties, they were shocked to see water everywhere. “There were no roads; it was like a network of rivulets. Luckily, there are no potholes inside and we could wade our way through the water safely. But the condition was horrible,” said a cleaning staffer who was the first to enter the premises at 6.30am. Some roads were under three feet of water in the evening. “This is the second time that something like this has happened, but it’s the first time the water level is not reducing after we tried draining it out,” he added. Another security staffer on night duty said: “Around 3.30am, water level on the road started to rise. Initially, the water was stagnant just like on terraces of houses, but later it just kept rising.” “I called my fellow security guards and we cleaned the drains with sticks to allow the water to flow. But it kept flowing back. In a span of two hours, the roads had become rivulets in spate,” he explained. Shilpa (name changed), techie at a private company in Manyata, was on her way to office when she received a call from her friends who were stuck on the campus. They asked her to go back. “I stay in Hebbal and Manyata is just 3.5 kilometres for me. But after I reached halfway, my colleagues asked me to go back saying the premises were flooded,” she told TOI. Shilpa, however, continued to drive and witness the situation first hand. “I only saw streams of muddy water, no roads. I drove inside the park to help some of my friends who were stuck and got them out safely.” Ram Prasad, founder of Friends of Lakes, said, “The park is built on the stormwater drain of Hebbal valley, and this is bound to happen. A planned outlet is needed, and there is no provision for the same.” Encroachment on SWD; we shouldn’t be blamed: BBMP“About a few years ago, BBMP had complained about Manyata Tech Park encroaching upon the open drain, diverting its natural flow, and building an illegal bridge over it. We should not be blamed, considering it’s an encroachment on the stormwater drain. This will happen every time it rains heavily,” a senior BBMP official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rain-impact-manyata-tech-park-turns-into-network-of-streams/articleshow/87858212.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Heavy rains: Water enters 300 Tatanagar houses in north Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Where are the roads? Residents of Tatanagar, off Sahakarnagar in north Bengaluru, were left wondering this on Monday morning after Doddabommasandra Lake’s retaining walls crumbled due to heavy rain. While around 300 houses in the locality were flooded, 30 streets in Tatanagar and Sahakarnagar were under water. Employees had a tough time accessing the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) office in Tatanagar. “The situation was miserable till Monday noon as we could barely step out of home,” said Anil K Reddy, secretary of Tatanagar resident welfare association. “There’s water everywhere but not a single drop to drink,” he added. Prasad G, another resident, said his two-wheeler and car were completely submerged. “Around 230am, I got a call from neighbours who were in a state of panic. So I rushed out to the balcony to see my street completely flooded,” Prasad said. “I had parked my car on the road but there was no sign of it until 2pm Monday,” he added. There are 11 main roads and nine cross roads in the locality. There was 3-4 feet deep water from 1st Main to 5th Main and 1st Cross to 9th Cross. Employees working in the UIDAI office removed their shoes and socks and took the support of walls of neighbouring buildings to enter the premises, said Ravikumar S, a resident. “It is sad to see the state of affairs of our civic administration. BBMP should understand this is a central government organisation and improve facilities,” he added. Around 1.30pm, BBMP officials reached Tatanagar and assured residents that water would be drained out. “There was a fund crunch, but we are working towards a permanent solution soon. A culvert will be created so that residential areas do not get affected,” said a BBMP official (lakes).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/water-enters-300-tatanagar-houses/articleshow/87858213.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Passengers said water level in the underpass started rising after Allalasandra Lake overflowed due to heavy rainfall. B Sarojamma, a resident of Somashettyhalli in Chikkabanavara, was among the travellers. She said: “We hired three BMTC buses for around 150 passengers to attend a wedding near Devanahalli. After the function, we left Devanahalli by around 10.30pm. When we reached Yelahanka around 11.30pm, water level was increasing in the underpass.” She said passengers got down from the buses and were waiting for the water level to recede. “We had a narrow escape. There were several children with us. None had expected this nightmare while returning home. We were at the spot till around 4am and travelled in the same buses after the water receded. Some people took other transport modes to reach the city,” said Sarojamma. Videos and pictures of the submerged BMTC buses went viral on social media. A senior BMTC official said: “Drivers failed to judge the water level in the underpass. They thought the buses could easily go through; luckily there was no untoward incident. Engine of one bus was damaged after oil mixed with water and we may recover the cost from the driver. There are no issues with other buses. We are conducting an investigation and will take action based on the report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wedding-party-stranded-for-hrs-in-underpass-near-yelahanka/articleshow/87858214.cms||---

This is the first time CBSE is conducting board exams in two stages. The term 1 exams are in multiple-choice format on OMR sheets. While exams began on November 16, most of the major papers are expected to start this week. Schools say consistent preparation over the past few months is helping students. “There were two pre-boards — one by schools and the other by Bangalore Sahodaya, an association of CBSE schools. Students have prepared very well to face the new pattern. There has been a lot of handholding from CBSE as well, and it seems to have worked,” said Manila Carvelho, principal of Delhi Public School East. “Students were being trained since September; they came to school and acclimatised. That they could write the papers in their own institution also helped reduce their anxiety,” said Sharada Chandrashekhar, principal of Whitefield Global School. “The instructions are clear on how to hold the exam. If they are followed completely, it will be smooth sailing.” Jayalakshmi Shastry, principal of Alpine Public School, said, “There are two types of students — ones who are confident and those who are nervous. They had three methodologies to follow while answering the paper, and the second group was concerned about that. Our teachers held a quick counselling session before the exam and it really lifted students’ spirit.” Shanthi Menon, principal of Deens Academy, said students are doing quite well in the exams. “We can see that as OMR sheets are evaluated on the same day,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/training-tests-help-cbse-students-adapt-well-to-new-exam-pattern/articleshow/87858215.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Dr Ranjan Shetty, head of department, consultant interventional cardiology, one of the contributors for the booklet, said lack of exercises, diet dependent largely on carbohydrates and high prevalence of diabetes add to the risk of cardiac issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/guardians-of-the-heart-booklet-launched/articleshow/87858216.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Four lakes in north Bengaluru overflow after Sunday night’s downpour||BENGALURU: Sunday night’s downpour caused lakes in Yelahanka, Allalasandra, Jakkur and Singapura in north Bengaluru to overflow and flood adjacent residential pockets, thanks to the city’s unplanned growth and the resultant impact on its stormwater drain network. Kendriya Vihar in Yelahanka, which houses families of hundreds of central government employees, was fully flooded, as neighbouring Yelahanka Lake overflowed. The apartment complex had water up to four feet. Rajendran SV, division warden, civil defence, Yelahanka said, “Kendriya Vihar has been waterlogged for close to three days now. But Sunday night’s heavy rain led to a stormwater drain and Yelahanka lake overflowing and flooding the apartment.” While several two-wheelers could be seen floating around, many cars too were damaged. “The building has about 603 flats spread across eight blocks. Most of the people residing here are senior citizens and they needed our help as the lifts weren’t functioning due to power failure. We had to use inflatable boats to rescue them and managed to bring out close to 200 people from the apartment,” Rajendran added. Rajendran and his team of around 30 members were at Kendriya Vihar since 8pm on Sunday. “Considering the building was waterlogged for nearly three days, residents hadn’t been able to step out. We managed to distribute food packets and asked them not to panic,” he said. National Disaster Response Force and fire brigade personnel were also part of the rescue operation. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who visited Yelahanka on Monday, said, “Our response team and all other relief squads were on their toes attending to all kinds of complaints. We have assured those residing at Kendriya Vihar that there is nothing to worry about and we will ensure they get supplies...” Jakkur Lake overflowed and flooded JNCASR (Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research) campus closeby. Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a resident of Jakkur, said: “The lakes upstream of Jakkur Lake are Puttenahalli and Yelahanka. Once these are filled, water flow into Jakkur Lake increases. These three lakes are fed by water from STPs, which means that they are 70-80% full most of the times.” When there is rain, the remaining 20% gets filled up, flooding adjacent areas. Water, however, only entered basements in Jakkur and not the houses. “This area mostly has apartments. The basements were flooded causing damage to vehicles, but water didn’t enter the houses,” Sanjeev added. Singapura Lake near Jalahalli too overflowed due to the downpour. H Mohan, a resident of Singapura, said, “Water had been slowly flowing out of Singapura Lake, which is spread over 66 acres. After Sunday’s showers, it overflowed massively.” Up to two feet of water was seen on Singapura roads. Though not houses, some basements got flooded and the water had to be pumped out. Youngsters from the neighbourhood were seen catching fish from the runoff water. Such was the outflow of water from the lake that even the adjacent Simhadri Layout got flooded, pealing off road asphalt. “The stormwater drain that carries water from Singapura to the lake downstream was blocked and caused the water to overflow on to the road. The lake was full following heavy showers,” Mohan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/four-lakes-in-north-bengaluruoverflow-flood-adjacent-areas/articleshow/87858217.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||World||Amnesty flags Pakistan on enforced disappearances||ISLAMABAD: Amnesty International has asked Pakistani authorities to end the practice of enforced disappearances as a tool of state policy, underscoring in a report titled ‘Living Ghosts’ that was released on Monday the mental, physical and socio-economic impact of illegal abductions by security agencies on the “missing” people’s families. Enforced disappearances—known in Pakistan as missing persons—is an act widely used in many countries that allows security agencies to arrest, detain or abduct a person without his will, and deny information about his fate. The refusal to acknowledge an abducted person’s fate is a crime under international law. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s National Assembly passed a bill that, for the first time in the country’s history, defined and criminalised the practice of enforced disappearances. Amnesty International, however, pointed out that the proposed reforms to outlaw and end the practice do not keep to international human rights law and best practices. In its report based on based on interviews with family members of people “whose fate remains unknown after they were abducted by Pakistan’s security services”, Amnesty said the practice violated human rights and had a toll on the mental and physical health of affected families, their financial status, their security, and caused stigma and social isolation. “Enforced disappearance is a cruel practice that has caused indelible pain to hundreds of families in Pakistan over the past two decades,” said Rehab Mahamoor, Amnesty’s acting South Asia researcher. “On top of the untold anguish of losing a loved one and having no idea of their whereabouts or safety, families endure other long-term effects, including ill health and financial problems,” he said. Enforced disappearances have been reported since the mid-1980s in Pakistan, but the tool became more widely used since the “war on terror” that began after the US invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks in 2001. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances said in its monthly October report that it has documented 8,191 cases of enforced disappearances, of which 2,274 remain unresolved, since it was set up in 2011. Some 37 of these cases occurred in October this year alone. Intelligence agencies have been targeting human rights defenders, political activists, students, and journalists, and the fate of hundreds of victims remain unknown, according to Amnesty report. Among the people interviewed by the rights watchdog was Inaam Abbasi, who was held for 10 months following his abduction in August 2017. The physical torture during captivity left him with a host of health issues, including chronic joint pain, high blood pressure and suspected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that often gets triggered by routine things such as the sound of a doorbell. “I believe that someone has come to take me away again,” Inaam was quoted as saying. Zakir Majeed, an ethnic Baloch student activist in the southwestern city of Quetta, was abducted on June 8, 2009, while he was with two friends. Amnesty quoted Majeed’s sister as saying that she was threatened “with the same fate as her brother if she did not stay silent”. In three cases, according to the report, the children of “missing persons” had to drop out of school because of loss of family income. It said family members reported stress-related health issues such as high blood pressure, cardiac ailments, and gastrointestinal illnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/amnesty-flags-pakistan-on-enforced-disappearances/articleshow/87858192.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Bengaluru||Second time in 15 months, SWD woes swamp Bengaluru residents||BENGALURU: A stormwater drain overflowed in Patel Muniswammpa Layout in Horamavu, northeast Bengaluru, sending water gushing into several houses late Sunday midnight. Residents rued this is the second time in 15 months that they are facing such a nightmare. When a similar incident occurred in August last year, several of them had lost their cars. This time, they were cautious enough to park their vehicles on the main road. Given that the locality received about 103mm rain in just three to four hours, things turned out to be worse this time for many residents. Water started entering the houses after 11pm. In fact, several college girls lost their certificates, laptops and other valuables. Swathi Vikraman, an MBA student in a city college, said, “We didn’t realise that water levels had come up to this extent. Our landlord, who lives upstairs, woke us up and asked us to spend the night at their place. Then we suddenly realised that we hadn’t turned off the fridge and rushed down to switch it off to avoid short circuit.” When Swathi and her roommate came down, water stood at two feet inside the house and the gas cylinder was afloat. The girls grabbed a couple of items, including clothes and groceries, and placed them at a height for safety. “My original marks cards and certificates were soaked. Class 10 and 12 marks cards are something I’d need for the rest of my life. Now all of them have got spoilt,” Swathi added. Meanwhile, Swathi’s another roommate’s laptop got damaged too. The device belongs to the company the girl is interning with. Residents living in duplex houses had the privilege of moving upstairs, while others either had to seek shelter at neighbour’s or relatives’ places. “The road has a slope because of which water gushes in. After water entered our house last year, we renovated it and increased the height of the main door and living room by a few inches. As it turns out, even after spending so much, we haven’t been able to prevent water from entering the house.” Residents claimed mucky water brought along insects, mosquitoes and even a snake. Ibraiz Khan, a resident, said, “We don’t know if we should clean our houses considering the forecast, which says it will continue to rain. Authorities need to find a permanent solution.” Locals say the problem can be fixed if BBMP builds a higher retaining wall or increases the width or depth of the stormwater drain. It’s almost impossible to walk in this layout without slipping and falling during rain as roads have no asphalt. “When the weather is damp, silt and sludge don’t dry up for days. We regret buying a house here. We are scared, anxious and frustrated,” said Ozma Veigas, another resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/second-time-in-15-months-swd-woes-swamp-residents/articleshow/87858218.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

The deceased, Madan (name changed) was a security manager with a farm education institute in north Bengaluru and resident of Attur Layout. Madan was from Bihar and married to a Kalaburagi woman. The couple’s elder daughter is a I PU student in Yelahanka and the younger one is a schoolgoing 11-year-old. Madan’s wife had gone to Kalaburagi, leaving her husband and two daughters at home on Sunday night. The incident took place at 12.30am. Around 1.30am, the girl rushed to neighbours, saying her father had been attacked by some people.

---||Bengaluru||Gang of 6 held for abducting student in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Two BCA students are in police custody for kidnapping their classmate for ransom. Four more persons, including two BPO staffers, an engineering student and a cabbie, have been arrested for carrying out the kidnap plot and robbing the victim. Abhishek R of Papareddypalya was kidnapped from his college near Nagarabavi BDA Complex by three men on November 18. Taking him to Devanahalli, they robbed him of Rs 1.2 lakh and forced him to sign on a stamp paper stating he had taken Rs 10 lakh loan from them, before setting him free. The victim lodged a complaint on Sunday. The accused are Anil Kumar, Nishchay, R Prajwal, K Prajwal, all residents of Yelahanka, along with Deepu and Bhuvan of Vijayanagar. Deepu and Bhuvan are classmates of Abhishek. Anil and K Prajwal worked in a BPO and R Prajwal is a cabbie, sources said. Deepu is a friend of Nischay, Anil and K Prajwal. It was Deepu and Bhuvan who hatched the conspiracy, police said. Deepu roped in his three friends and Anil sought the cabbie’s help, an officer said. “Nishay, Anil and K Prajwal went near the college and abducted Abhishek, who had come in his elder brother’s SUV. The duo approached Abhishek near the parking lot saying they had to discuss some real estate-related issues. They gagged him in his car and drove towards Tumakuru. A bit later, Prajwal joined them. They took a diversion in Dobbespet and reached Devanahalli. They took Rs 70,000 from Abhishek. Then, using his ATM card, they drew Rs 27,000. They also made him transfer Rs 25,000 online. Then, they took his signature on a stamp paper saying he had taken a loan from them and would return it in three months. They let him off at 5pm,” a source said. Police arrested the six suspects on Monday. They are in judicial custody now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-of-6-held-for-abducting-student/articleshow/87858220.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||VTU decides fee slabs for skill training in its colleges||Bengaluru: Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), the umbrella varsity for all engineering colleges in the state, released the skill lab fees that its affiliate-colleges can charge for this academic year.As per the list, around eight colleges can charge Rs 20,000 and 15 can charge Rs 15,000. Another 97 colleges can charge either Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000, while 93 colleges have opted out of charging any skill lab fees. In all, there are 213 colleges affiliated to VTU. The colleges that can charge up to Rs 20,000 include Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering, BMS College of Engineering, New Horizon College of Engineering, Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology and MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology. Those in the Rs 15,000 bracket are BNM Institute of Technology, CMR Institute of Technology and PES College of Engineering Mandya, among others. In the Rs 10,000 range are AJ Institute of Engineering and Technology, Mangaluru, AMC College of Engineering and others. Skill lab fees are the additional set of payments colleges can charge depending on the facilities they provide on campus for skill-based training. These are optional fees and students can choose not to pay if they do not want to use these services. “We had constituted an expert committee to decide the optional fees. The committee took into consideration various factors like NAAC accreditation, NBA accreditation, extra facilities, the money invested in it, number of students having benefited from it in the previous years, among other factors,” explained VTU vice-chancellor Karisiddappa. The colleges had to submit the list of facilities they provide to the committee.“Once students opt for the colleges based on their ranks, they can go to the campus, see for themselves the facilities and then decide whether to pay for these facilities or not. Last year, there were several complaints from students on how some colleges were fleecing them. Some of them had more skills fees than tuition fees. That’s why we wanted to bring in a system to streamline the process,” the VC added. Earlier, miscellaneous fees would vary and range between Rs 10,000 and Rs 70,000. Many colleges haven’t applied for optional fees at all. Many of them are struggling to fill the seats and, therefore, haven’t opted to charge any extra fees. This year, students have been asked to pay admission fees at Karnataka Examinations Authority. “These are facilities beyond regular academics. For instance, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things are usually only for computer science students. Students of other branches might want to take them. Similarly, there are courses like robotics or data sciences. Students can opt for the courses they want and pay for them,” said the principal of a top-rated college in Bengaluru.Classes from month-endThe university is hoping to start classes by November 30 and is looking to have at least 40,000 students opting for colleges in the first round of admissions. However, the last date for reporting to colleges as per Karnataka Examinations Authority is December 3. Students will have a 21-day induction programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vtu-decides-fee-slabs-for-skill-training-in-its-colleges/articleshow/87858222.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Limited gates, counters lead to crowding at Metro stations||BENGALURU: With Namma Metro’s daily ridership crossing 3 lakh, many stations are witnessing serpentine queues (in pic), particularly during peak hours, passengers said. This is mainly because of limited entry and exit gates and ticket counters at the stations. In most stations, there is only one gate each for entry and exit after services resumed in September last year. On Monday evening, there was a long queue at Trinity station. Many passengers said the average waiting time for trains has increased now. Sharath Patil, a passenger at Trinity station, said: “I have not seen such a huge crowd in recent times. Many passengers, including senior citizens and pregnant women, were waiting in a long queue for security check. I was told there was only one counter due to a state government holiday. But when there are more passengers, there should be alternative arrangements to reduce crowds.” Crowd-control measureMany passengers urged BMRCL to open more entry and exit gates as the few identified ones are inadequate. However, an official said they have temporarily closed entry and exit points as part of crowd-control measures, especially during weekends and public holidays. “All passengers have to undergo thermal scanning, hand sanitisation and follow other Covid protocols, we cannot enforce this if there are multiple entries and exits. We are opening more points based on demand,” said the official. Statistics show the number of Metro passengers has increased daily. The daily ridership on September 9, 2020 was 14,438, which rose to 50,000 in October 2020, 1 lakh in December 2020, 1.5 lakh in February 2021, 2 lakh in October, 2.5-3 lakh in November. On November 15, daily ridership was 3.1 lakh (1.5 lakh on Purple Line and 1.6 lakh on Green Line). This was the highest ever since services resumed last year post lockdown. Experts said resumption of normal life, including lifting of night curfew, re-introduction of tokens, reopening of educational institutions, extension of timings and expansion of the network (Silk Institute-Yelachenahalli and Mysuru Road-Kengeri) are some reasons for the spike in ridership. Metro at present has a 56km network (Purple Line - 25.6km) and Green Line (30km) compared to 42km before the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/limited-gates-counters-lead-to-crowding-at-metro-stns/articleshow/87858223.cms||---

---||Business||We are obsessed with growth, more agile: Rishad Premji||BENGALURU: Wipro chairman Rishad Premji said the company has made significant changes in the operating model and leadership team and managed this with minimal disruption. “We are obsessed with growth, closer to customers, more local and agile and geographically distributed,” he said at the company's annual investor meet on Friday. The company has made a remarkable turnaround since Thierry Delaporte took over as CEO a little over a year ago.  During this period, Premji has played a significant role in transforming the culture of the company into one where everyone is collaborating a lot more closely. Premji said he has had the opportunity to travel over the last 3-4 weeks meeting customers "and everybody is thinking of themselves as a tech company, increasing efficiency through technology rather than reducing cost.” Delaporte said Wipro will focus on winning large deals worth $200-300 million. Such deals have been at the centre of the company’s growth strategy since the Frenchman came on board. The company said the acquisition of Capco, a UK-based management and tech consultancy firm for about $1 billion earlier this year, is helping make better inroads into the financial services sector. “Firstly, we will continue to accelerate our momentum and ambitions through our continued focus on clients. Our growth will come from large deals and by expanding our market share of more than $200-300 million accounts,” Delaporte said. “The pandemic has accelerated transformation timelines for all industries. Digital technology such as AI, big data, cloud, cyber security are seeing widespread adoption and exponential growth. That means more complexity, more need for expertise and innovation; a place where we want to play,” Delaporte added. Wipro says it won mega deals in its core markets of North America and Europe, with total contract value (TCV) of large deals going up by 80% in the last one year. Its annual revenue run-rate surpassed the $10 billion mark. Cloud revenue now consists of 30% of the topline. Wipro has moved 60% of its leadership team closer to clients, which has helped it understand client problems better. One-third of its global account executives are new.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/we-are-obsessed-with-growth-more-agile-rishad-premji/articleshow/87858225.cms||Avik Das

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, who held a meeting with managements of hotels, lodges and banquet halls on Monday, said DMs and SPs of five other districts under the division – Nalanda, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas and Kaimur – have also been asked to hold similar meetings to ensure that liquor is not served at any venue in the name of hospitality. The meeting was attended by IG Sanjay Singh, Patna DM Dr Chandrashekhar Singh, SSP U K Sharma and other senior officers. Agarwal said DMs and SPs have been asked to form teams for surprise raids in villages and urban areas to check home delivery of liquor. He also asked the SDOs and SDPOs of all sub-divisions of Patna to hold such meetings in their areas and direct hotels and wedding venues to install CCTV cameras at all important corners. While addressing the representatives of hotel and banquet halls, Agarwal directed them to hold training or briefing sessions for their employees so that they could not be lured into the illegal act of delivering banned items, especially liquor, to the guests. Agarwal told this newspaper that action against habitual offenders is being taken. “Authorities of different hotels have assured the administration of full cooperation,” he added. As many banquet halls and restaurants have come up along important highways far from the urban areas in Patna attracting a huge number of people for parties and get togethers, Agrawal asked the SDOs and SDPOs to keep close watch on these venues. Toll-free complaint number has been issued for giving any information. All those in hospitality business have been asked to get declaration from their guests that they will not indulge in any act in violation of total prohibition. “With the beginning of marriage season, all the banquet halls and hotels are witnessing huge rush of guests, including many from other states. These premises will have to ensure installation of CCTV cameras,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/liquor-ban-hotels-dhabas-asked-to-rein-in-their-guests/articleshow/87856252.cms||VK Tripathi

According to it, no member should consume liquor. If anyone is caught consuming liquor, strict action will be taken at the party level,” Singh told mediapersons here. Asked about the police entering the room of a bride in a hotel on the occasion of her marriage, Singh said it was done “in the name of enforcing prohibition which has failed in the state as the liquor mafias are not being caught deliberately”. Singh said a parallel economy worth Rs 20,000 crore annual turnover has developed in the state. “Their fear is that if the mafia elements are caught, it will boomerang on the government itself,” Singh added. Rabri hits out at police for entering bride’s hotel room: Former CM Rabri Devi on Monday criticised the police for entering the room of a bride in a hotel in Patna. “It is akin to violation of the right to privacy. Instead of probing how and why liquor is illegally brought to the state, the police are harassing women. What should people do – arrange marriage functions or not? Time has come for the people to fight against the dictatorial stance of the government,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-leaders-make-contradictory-remarks-on-liquor/articleshow/87856237.cms||---

The CM also visited the newly constructed building of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC) and enquired about every aspect of the new facilities to be provided in the new building from the health department’s officials. He asked the officials to make the new building functional at the earliest. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit, through a presentation, informed the CM about progress in PMCH redevelopment plan. He also informed the CM about the month-wise fixed targets under the phase-1 and their corresponding progress. Amrit told the CM that the facility of 2,021 beds would be available to the people after the completion of phase-1 of the redevelopment plan. “We review the progress of the project on a regular basis,” Pratyaya informed the CM. Health minister Mangal Pandey presented a replica of the proposed master plan of the PMCH’s redevelopment building to the CM on the occasion. Nitish had laid foundation for PMCH redevelopment project on February 8 this year. Once redeveloped, the PMCH will become India’s largest and world’s second largest government-run hospital. “The PMCH is currently the state’s biggest hospital with 1,750 beds. After its redevelopment, the hospital’s capacity will increase to more than 5,460 beds. The CM has asked the officials to complete the project in next five years,” a health department official told TOI on Monday.

---||Business||PMC’s retail depositors face long wait to get full money||MUMBAI: Retail depositors with over Rs 15 lakh in Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank will have to wait for 10 years to get all their money back. The timeline is in terms of a resolution plan drawn up by the RBI, which involves the defunct cooperative lender’s amalgamation with the newly formed Unity Small Finance Bank (SFB). The resolution of PMC Bank through private investment using the SFB licence route is the first time such an exit option has been adopted for stakeholders in a failed bank. Institutional depositors, including cooperative housing societies and cooperative credit societies which have deposits in the bank, will end up taking a haircut. The resolution plan envisages 80% of their funds being converted into perpetual non-cumulative preference shares with a dividend of only 1% per annum. After 10 years, the bank can decide if it wants to increase the dividend or repay investors. The remaining 20% of institutional funds will be converted into equity warrants of Unity SFB at Re 1 per warrant. These warrants will be converted into shares whenever Unity SFB floats a public issue. For retail investors, interest at the rate of 2.75% will be paid on deposits that are outstanding after five years from the date of notification of the scheme. The draft proposals will be finalised and implemented through a government notification after taking into account suggestions and objections up to December 10, 2021. Going by experience, major changes are unlikely under the scheme as there is a huge gap between the assets and liabilities of the bank due to large-scale fraud and there are no other bidders to take over the business. “Given the financial condition of the PMC Bank, and in the absence of proposals for capital infusion, the bank was not viable on its own. In that event, the only course of action could have been the cancellation of its licence and taking it for liquidation, wherein depositors would have received payment up to the insurance ceiling of Rs 5 lakh,” the RBI said. Unity SFB, which has been promoted by Centrum and Bharat Pe, said that 96% of all depositors will get immediate access to their deposits and 99% will get paid in full by the 5th year. It added that the scheme saves the bank from liquidation and protects the interest of stakeholders. “The draft scheme provides much-needed relief and clarity to over 1,100 PMC Bank employees, who will remain employed and continue uninterrupted service to clients,” the statement said. It added that the bank was operationalised in record time after RBI’s approval on October 12, 2021. “Our shareholders have committed capital of over Rs 3,000 crore through cash and warrants which will be used to build a strong foundation for the bank,” the SFB said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pmcs-retail-depositors-face-long-wait-to-get-full-money/articleshow/87857171.cms||---

In a communique from Delhi, Hussain said the Bihar Pavilion at the IITF has been attracting a large number of visitors. During the inaugural functions, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari and the party’s MLC Sanjay Mayukh were also present. While the theme of the 40th IITF is ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, an exhibition of the products from Bihar’s countryside is also being held at Bihar Pavilion in tune with ‘Atmanirbhar Gaon’ as an extension of Atmanirbhar Bihar. “The progress made by the state under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar has been showcased at Bihar Pavilion,” Hussain added. He said 519 industrial units have so far been set up in Bihar and more are in the pipeline. “Investment proposals worth Rs 30,000 crore have been received for ethanol production in the state, he said, adding the remaining proposals have come for investment in food, healthcare, oxygen, tourism, manufacturing and other sectors. “Those who used to say that it is not possible to set up industries in Bihar, we will disappoint them,” he said. The minister said as many as 41 stalls have been put up at Bihar Pavilion, including five by the startup companies. Among the items on display at the exhibition are those related to applique and sujani art, studded work, lacquered bangles, cane and bamboo craft, Madhubani and Manjusha paintings, silk fabrics, handicrafts and textiles made by weavers.

The investment commitment by Tata Group is viewed as “significant”, as it will help the state to showcase itself as an attractive solar power manufacturing location. It is also expected to boost investments to southern states which have not attracted too many till now. The state is already home to Vikram Solar, which inaugurated its factory in July to make panels with 1.2GW capacity in Oragadam. US-based First Solar is breaking ground for its greenfield plant in Pillaipakkam near Chennai on Tuesday. First Solar is investing $684 million in a fully vertically integrated photovoltaic thin-film solar module manufacturing facility with a capacity of 3.3GW and is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023. Solar panel manufacturing is the next hot area for investment flows as the scramble for renewable energy, more specifically solar, gains momentum. More so with the Prime Minister committing to meet 50% of the country’s energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries would build four ‘Giga’ factories in Jamnagar to make solar photovoltaic cells, green hydrogen, batteries and fuel cells for Rs 60,000 crore. These manufacturing units will power Reliance’s dreams to build 100GW of solar energy generation capacity. Adani Group is also getting aggressive on the solar front with plans to manufacture photovoltaic cells for 3.5GW of solar power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-set-up-solar-panel-factory-in-gangaikondan/articleshow/87856393.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Now edible oil, the prices of which have skyrocketed in the market, is criminals’ latest target. The criminals entered the godown of a private agency in Purnia and looted edible oil worth over Rs 8.16 lakh in the wee hours of Sunday. Police said over a dozen criminals wearing masks barged into the godown of Emami Agrotech Private Ltd at Ramraj Chowk under Purnia sadar police station and stolen edible oil stocked for local distribution. The guard of the godown, Mohammad Alam, was taken hostage by the criminals before being taken to an isolated location. The cartons and packets of edible oil were subsequently loaded in a truck parked on the campus of the godown. “The operation continued for about two hours. All the criminals had covered their faces with towel and masks,” the guard told the police. Incharge of the godown and proprietor of Ritesh Store Farm, Ritesh Gungarwal, lodged a complaint with the sadar police station in connection with the loot. “We hope police will crack the case soon,” he told reporters in Purnia. SHO of sadar police station Madhurendra Kumar rushed to the spot and inquired about the incident. SDPO Surendra Kumar Saroj also inquired about the incident and asked the investigating officer to ascertain the identity of the gang. The police have obtained CCTV footage from nearby houses and business establishments at Gulabbagh in the heart of the divisional town. “The soaring prices of edible oil may have attracted the criminals to loot the essential commodity,” an investigating officer said. Earlier, trucks carrying garlic and onion were hijacked by criminals on NH-02 in Kaimur and Rohtas districts. Though FIRs were lodged by the victims, nothing happened in the two cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/edible-oil-worth-over-rs-8l-looted-from-purnia-godown/articleshow/87855625.cms||Ramashankar

Dhavad is credited with making 873 complaints on the AMC’s app over the past year, the highest number logged by a citizen in their individual capacity. He alerts the civic body to crumbling roads, clogged drains, untended rubbish heaps, and street lights on the blink. In fact, assistant engineers of each of the seven zonal offices of the AMC have a list of familiar chief complaining citizens, some of whom have clocked 5,000 entries each against their names over the years. Half of them are Good Samaritans like Dhavad or Balchandra Vadke, 79. The rest are social workers and politicians who need to earn the goodwill of the public. As for Dhavad, his diligence in following up is reflected by the fact that all his 873 complaints have been tackled and the matters closed successfully. Over the past year, he has filed on average three complaints a day. Dhavad said his pet peeve is non-functional street lights and he has made about 450 complaints about them. He said that he never intended to become a civic crusader, but in his line of duty he encountered deficiencies that cried out for citizen action. “Making a complaint is easy. You take a picture, identify the location, and describe the problem. People should take the initiative to get their problems solved,” Dhavad said. “Inactive citizenry breeds apathy, indifference to neighbourhoods and society, and encourages corruption.” Dhavad usually rides his bike to document the city’s failings. But his cycle has become handy after fuel prices started surging. On average, 700-1,100 complaints have been registered daily on the AMC helplines and the app since those services were launched in 2013. Vadke, a Jodhpur retiree, has filed 700 complaints over the past one and a half years. He took up the cause because dusty roads, broken water pipes, and garbage piles troubled him. “People want their rights but do not want to make the effort to secure them,” Vadke said. “Citizens should flag problems and ensure that they are solved by the administration.” Another conscientious citizen, Prabha Sharma, has 650 complaints to her credit. This Khokhra resident, who is in her late fifties, said: “My husband Kishan Sharma was a proactive citizen and brought Amdavadis’ woes to the AMC’s attention.” She added: “He died in April. He had played an active role in providing Covid relief to the community. His spirit is still alive in us.” In the category of social activists and political workers, BJP ex-councillor Kaushik Jain leads the complaint-making brigade with 5,500 interventions. The majority of them relate to drain blockages (1,700) and bad roads (1,000). “People who are not comfortable with smartphones get help in addressing their civic concerns,” said an employee of Jain’s office. Another BJP ex-councillor, Mayur Dave, has made 3,500 complaints. He continues holding problem-resolution meetings with people at Khadia Crossroads from 8am to 10.30am. Mushtaq Khan of Danapith, who recently joined the AIMIM, has lodged 1,500 complaints. “The mission started when women in the neighborhood began complaining about flooding and overflowing drains,” he said. “They did not know how to get help. So it has become a passion to aid people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chief-complaining-citizens-make-city-better-for-all/articleshow/87856788.cms||Paul John
---||Vijayawada||Will come back with new, amended Bills: Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday said the state government will come back with new decentralisation Bills to create multiple capital cities. “While taking into consideration the aspirations of the people of all regions and keeping in mind the questions or objections raised so far, we will come back with a detailed Bill for decentralisation. We are withdrawing the present Bill with a realistic approach,” said Jagan in the state assembly. He was speaking on the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Act 2021 and the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Act 2021. Jagan said the people of Rayalaseema region have sacrificed the capital in Kurnool and accepted Hyderabad as the capital in 1956. However, after bifurcation in 2014, the capital was not given to them nor their feelings were respected and aspirations considered, he alleged. The chief minister also favoured Visakhapatnam which he said was “a developed city having all infrastructure to compete with Hyderabad and Bengaluru.” “I love this place (Amaravati). My house is located here. But it is neither part of Vijayawada nor Guntur. It requires Rs 1 lakh crore to develop, as per the statements of the previous government, which conceived this place for capital. But, Visakhapatnam needs only a facelift and not such a huge amount,” Jagan Mohan Reddy said. He further said that the state government was committed to the decentralisation of development and administration as well. While reiterating his commitment for the three capitals proposal, the chief minister said that the government would re-examine all aspects, consider all objections raised and re-introduce the bills at a later date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-come-back-with-new-amended-bills-cm/articleshow/87856177.cms||Gopi Dara

Recalling his association with the legend, his disciple and Olympian Aslam Sher Khan, who represented India in the Olympics in 1972 and 1976, says Babu had a regal bearing and had varied interests. “Most players in the world of hockey belong to middle class families or hail from poor backgrounds. In those days, people from royal background or elite classused play cricket. I think Babu sahib was the first hockey player from a royal family,” he says. Speaking about Babu’s favourite pastime, Khan recalls: “He would go for hunting every week. I used to accompany him in those outings as I got the opportunity to have more interaction with him. I, along with hockey players Inamur Rahman and Govinda, used to make noise to stir birds. Babu sahib had sharp eyes.” “After Munich Olympics (1972), he called me up and said he has come across a very good gun and is taking one for me as a gift. I still have that priceless gift, a .22 rifle, which is very close to my heart. It is very difficult to find a personality like Babu sahib now.” “We would eat together in the mess and check the quality of food that was served to players. He used to tell us, ‘Whenever you go on the stage to collect your trophy, go like a soldier,” he says. Khan says Babu was a disciplinarian in the true sense and would keep an eye on players. “He would ask us to focus on the game and not to befriend girls. Hefollowed strict discipline and dedication towards the game,” Khan says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/when-the-hockey-top-gungifted-a-rifle-to-his-disciple/articleshow/87851025.cms||Fazal Khan

They apprehend that the production of rabi crops might be drastically hit this year. “The required demand of DAP for the state is 4 lakh MT during the rabi cropping season. There is a short supply of DAP across the country, including in Bihar. The supply of DAP is dependent on import, which has not been fully met this year,” a Bihar agriculture department official said. “The other varieties of fertilisers are adequately available in the state. The problem has arisen because of the fancy of the farmers for DAP, and their general reluctance to switch to its alternative variety like single super phosphate (SSP), which is also equally useful and good,” he added. The official said the department has decided to bring out advertisements in newspapers and through other ways to exhort the farmers to immediately switch to the SSP variety as an alternative to DAP. In fact, the agriculture department was aware of the emerging crisis as far back as mid-October, when the review of the supply of all varieties of fertilisers was done by agriculture minister Amarnedra Pratap Singh, involving the representatives of fertilizer-supplying companies and farmers. At the review meeting, Singh had asked the farmers to switch to the SSP variety because of its additional sulphur content, which was so much needed by soil in the state, and is otherwise not available in DAP, besides being cheap. He had also issued instruction that the retailers be asked to display available stocks of different fertilisers and their respective prices per bag. Overall, the state’s quota of fertilisers for the rabi crops this year was estimated to be 12 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of urea, 4 lakh tonnes of DAP, 1.50 lakh tonnes of potash, 2 lakh tonnes of NPK compound and 1.25 lakh tonnes of SSP. A farmer from Chandwa village in Katihar district, Kumod Kumar alias Tiku Singh, told this newspaper over phone that there was, indeed, scarcity of DAP everywhere in the district. “There is desperation among farmers for DAP and the IIFCO variety of fertiliser. These fertilisers are not available, even though the sowing of wheat, winter maize, pulses and oilseeds has become brisk. During monsoon, the farmers had suffered devastation due to excess rain, floods and waterlogging, and now there is scarcity of fertiliser. The state government should make timely intervention,” CPM state secretary Awadhesh Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dap-fertiliser-shortage-may-hit-farmers-this-rabi-season/articleshow/87855554.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Centre bowed down to farmers’ pressure: Tariq||KATIHAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three controversial farm laws proved that the farmers’agitation on Delhi-Haryana border for the past 11-12 months was ‘justified'. It was a big victory for the relentless protests of farmers, said former Katihar MP and Congress general secretary, Tariq Anwar, before undertaking the party’s ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ and ‘Kisan Vijay Yatra’, here on Monday.  Anwar said, “The Union government had to finally bow down before the agitating farmers and announce the repeal of the three farm bills which were ‘atrocious and dictatorial’. Apprehending defeat in the upcoming assembly elections and the disappointment that BJP had to face in the recently held bypolls in states, compelled PM Modi them to take the decision of repealing the farm laws. The farm laws had been enacted in the Parliament in a 'haste' as well as to 'appease' certain corporate houses.” “Many farmers lost their lives during the protests. But the government was adamant and refused to listen to their demand," the Congress leader said.  “Rahul Gandhi's had tirelessly fought for the farmers’ cause both inside as well as outside the Parliament. He took out tractor rallies and addressed several meetings in the past many months,” said the former MP. “We also demand from the government to provide compensation to the next of kin of more than 700 farmers who died while protesting, take back false cases fabricated against them as well as ensure making a law for the minimum support price (MSP),” Anwar said. On Congress-RJD alliance going haywire in the state, Anwar said, “We have two-and-a half years in hand to strengthen the organisation (party). We don’t want to remain dependent on others. We also expect possible alliance with like-minded parties (those who are secular in nature). Ultimately, the party high-command will take a call on whether we should go alone in the state or not. However, we are ready for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-bowed-down-to-farmers-pressure-tariq/articleshow/87855590.cms||---

Considering this situation, we met regional transport officer of Kolhapur and have asked them to provide details where students are unable to attend their school and colleges. We will provide our buses to them free of cost.” He added, “The bus operators are facing losses and we request state government to allow us to charge double the cost of MSRTC fare. We have even asked reduction in taxes charged by the central and state governments over diesel fuel, if the rates of diesel gets reduced then the ticket rates of the private transport buses will also reduce drastically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pvt-bus-operators-offer-to-give-free-bus-service-to-students/articleshow/87854871.cms||---

The move, according to WDC officials, is aimed at providing better care to the children of women employees of jails in the state. Funds for the establishment of crèches will be provided by the WDC and its maintenance and operation will be the responsibility of the organisation concerned. Children up to five years of age will be taken care of in these crèches. In the first phase, crèches will be made at Model Central Prison (Beur, Patna), Central and Divisional Prison (Buxar), Central Prison (Motihari), Central Prison (Bettiah), Shaheed Khudiram Bose Central Prison (Muzaffarpur), Central Prison (Purnia), Shaheed Jubba Sahni Central Prison and Special Prison (Bhagalpur) and Central Prison (Ara). WDC managing director Harjot Kaur Bumrah said under ‘Mukhyamantri Nari Shakti Yojna’, there is a provision of the establishment of crèches. “If there are 25 or more women working in an organization and they have children with them, such crèches can be established. The commission is dedicated to the cause of women’s empowerment. Many programmes are being run in coordination with WDC and social welfare department in this regard. Crèches would be a positive step towards women’s empowerment as women often have to leave jobs because they have young children to take care of,” she said. Amenities for sleeping and day care of children, pre-school education and training, appropriate nutrition and entertainment will be provided to the children at these crèches. The maximum number of children in such crèches would be 25. According to the guidelines, a worker and a helper would be employed at these crèches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/crches-to-be-opened-for-kids-of-women-employed-at-10-jails/articleshow/87855636.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Capital mired in stalemate, blame game begins||Amaravati: Municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana accused the opposition parties, particularly the TDP, for stalling development in the Amaravati region. “The TDP is chiefly responsible for the government not taking up any project in the area as it spread false information to create mistrust among the farmers. The government is very much committed to the three-capitals model and will go ahead by convincing people,” he said on Monday. He added, “We will consult all stakeholders before bringing the comprehensive bills in the assembly soon. This government is committed to the decentralisation of capital cities.” I&PR minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani) said the government has taken a decision to develop three capital cities to benefit the larger population of the state, and will not take decisions for the sake of some individuals, referring to the repeal of farm laws by the Centre. “That is (Narendra) Modi’s government, this is Jagan Mohan Reddy’s government,” he said. TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu hit back at Botcha’s allegations that TDP hindered development in Amaravati region. “The chief minister has been causing irreparable loss to the state with his foolish decisions, and his latest call will only create further confusion and chaos in the state and would severely impact the revenues of the state. How can a government reverse such key decisions on so many occasions without taking future consequences into consideration?” Naidu wondered, adding that such uncertainty would result in massive unemployment and force the state’s youth to migrate to other places. Srikakulam MP K Rammmohan also found fault with the chief minister for extending the stalemate over the capital city. “It is really unfortunate to see AP without a capital city. While other states are competing with each other to attract investments, AP is strolling without a capital city due to our CM’s inexperience and arrogance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/capital-mired-in-stalemate-blame-game-begins/articleshow/87856185.cms||Samdani MN

The minister said this was no victory for Amaravati farmers as is being claimed. “How many people are participating in the (Amaravati) farmers’ padayatra? How can they claim it is the wish of the entire state?” he asked. Reiterating that the YSRC government is committed to the development of all three regions of the state, he said people have already backed the decision by giving them overwhelming mandate in local bodies elections and the recent by-elections to Lok Sabha and assembly segments. “The government is going ahead with clarity on the issue and not trying to deceive anyone. The TDP adversely campaigned against the three capital cities proposal despite this government’s best efforts to develop all 13 districts of the state with equitable development,” Ramachandra Reddy said, adding that they will go to people and seek their views on the issue (three capital cities) before formulating the new bill. —Samdani MN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/just-an-interval-wait-for-the-climax-says-min/articleshow/87856191.cms||Samdani MN

The high court had earlier directed the CBI director to file an affidavit over the steps that it is taking to arrest one Punch Prabhakar who continues to post abusive videos against the judiciary on social media platforms. Additional solicitor general (ASG), S V Raju, who represented CBI told the high court that the details of the investigation and the steps taken to apprehend Punch Prabhakar have been furnished in the sealed cover.

Raju said they do not have any problem with sharing the report with the petitioner counsel.

Advocate-general S Sriram informed the court about the development amid hearing on a batch of petitions challenging the twin legislations brought in by the state government for trifurcation of the state capital. The high court has taken up daily hearing of the petitions by constituting a special bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra, Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy and Justice DVSS Somayajulu. While senior counsel Jandhyala Ravi Shankar was arguing how the two legislations are constitutionally invalid as they were not passed according to norms and procedures, the advocate-general sought leave of the court and informed that the state cabinet has passed a resolution to repeal both impugned legislations. With the advocate-general’s submission, the marathon hearing on the petitions came to a halt. As the petitions are likely to become infructuous once the twin legislations are repealed, the advocate-general told the high court there is no need for further hearing on the matter. The advocate-general further said he will submit details pertaining to the new legislation about to be introduced in the assembly. The special bench of the high court again sat in the afternoon for hearing the advocate-general. However, Sriram told the bench that the details pertaining to the new draft bills are not yet finalised and he will file a memo once the draft legislation is ready. The counsel for the petitioners expressed doubts saying it was a deliberate attempt to delay the proceedings. The bench observed that it will consider all the apprehensions of the petitioners once the government submits details. The high court further told the advocate-general to file an affidavit instead of memo with the details pertaining to the new legislation and the cabinet decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-asks-govt-to-file-affidavit-on-new-bill/articleshow/87856199.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The high court termed the charging of fees from students under the above two heads as “arbitrary” as no such facility was provided to the students during the period. The order will result in saving of Rs 20,000 (Rs 15,000 facility fee and Rs 5,000 library fee) for each student studying in fifth year of BA LLB (honours) and BBA LLB (honours) courses and Rs 21,000 (Rs 16,000 facility fee and Rs 5,000 library fee) for second, third and fourth-year students of both courses. The CNLU had earlier waived off Rs 16,000 for fifth-year students and Rs 17,000 second, third and fourth-year students of both courses, which included infrastructure development fee, development charges, student welfare fund and electricity charges, due to the pandemic. The direction of not charging annual library and facility fees came from a single bench of Justice PB Bajanthri which simultaneously also disposed of the matter. The bench was hearing a writ petition filed by 29 CNLU students who had challenged the varsity order of August 7 last year, asking them to pay their overall annual fees. The bench however, ordered that the students would have to pay rest of the annual fees as per varsity direction, including tuition fee. Counsels Sumeet Kumar Singh, Shubham Bajaj, Suyash Rawat and others appeared for the students while Dr Anshuman and other assisting counsels appeared for the varsity in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cnlu-pupils-neednt-pay-library-facility-fees-for-online-classes-hc/articleshow/87856258.cms||Debashish Karmakar

But a breakthrough is in sight with MS University researchers developing a new class of anti-obesity agents that will pave the way for drugs that can control food cravings without any side-effect. The result is an outcome of 10 years of rigorous study when researchers from the Faculty of Pharmacy picked up the gauntlet of finding safe compounds that can be used for making drugs to treat obesity without any side-effect. Scientists say that practically there is not a single drug currently available in the market that can be called as an ideal or safe anti-obesity drug. The researchers have bagged a patient for their invention while their work has been acknowledged by the globally reputable journal Scientific Reports. Using virtual screening techniques, the team tirelessly worked on more than four lakh compounds to identify and design novel molecules as anti-obesity agents with no side-effects. The team led by by faculty’s founder dean professor M R Yadav, assistant professor Dr Prashant Murumkar and research scholar Dr Mayank Sharma found a compound that acts on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) as CB1R which is responsible for regulating appetite, pain, emotions among others. These are present in the peripheral tissues as well as the central nervous system. When these receptors are activated, they increase the urge for eating. If these receptors are blocked or inhibited, the craving for the food decreases. “But blocking of central CB1 receptors has many consequences including serious psychiatric side-effects. The main challenge for us was to invent a tight CB1 receptor which would not have any such side-effects,” explained Murumkar. “Restricting the entry of the drug in CNS was one of the strategies that we worked upon to get rid of the CNS side effects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/soon-reduce-extra-flab-without-worrying-about-any-side-effect/articleshow/87856824.cms||Prashant Rupera

The assembly areas have been developed at both Mahavir temple and Karbigahiya ends to safely evacuate or contain passenger rush on the station premises. The idea is to provide a safe passage to passengers in case of any emergency like earthquake, fire and stampede-like situation. According to ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar, “Of late, majority of passengers are using the second exit point of the Karbigahiya end. Thus it has become imperative to develop assembly areas on both sides of Patna Junction.” The RPF men keep the entry of passengers in the assembly areas for a while. Soon after the rush clearance, they are allowed to enter the station premises to board their trains, he said. The assembly areas have the holding capacity of about 500 to 600 passengers with sitting facilities for many of them. The RPF men use megaphones to contain passenger rush during peak hours and provide them safe passage to the platforms, he said Railways’ disaster management team has also worked out a contingency plan to check any untoward incident on station premises, Kumar said, adding railways has decided to develop more such assembly areas at the crowded stations. Medical kiosk is already functional at Patna Junction to provide instant medical assistance or first aid to passengers in needs. Railway doctors are available at short notice in any emergency to cater to the medical emergency of passengers at Patna Junction, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-utilises-assembly-areas-at-patna-junction-to-check-passenger-rush/articleshow/87856305.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Business||Paytm crashes on Day 2 too, down 37% since IPO||MUMBAI: Shares of Paytm fell by 13% on its second trading day, after crashing 27% during their Thursday debut on the stock exchanges. The shares closed at Rs 1,360, 37% below the issue price of Rs 2,150. At Monday’s closing price, the company’s market capitalisation stood at Rs 88,185 crore compared to the valuation of nearly Rs 1.4 lakh crore in its IPO — which means shareholders have lost about Rs 51,000 crore in two trading days. Shares of the payments company opened at Rs 1,500 on Monday, down from its previous close of Rs 1,564. Around noon, when the company hit a low of Rs 1,271 and was inching towards its 20% lower circuit band, there was buying support that lifted it to the closing level of Rs 1,360. Investors who have supported the Rs 18,300-crore IPO include BlackRock and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The dismal performance of the company on the bourses was met with shock from investors. On social media, investors were looking for answers on why a company that received backing from blue-chip institutions and was subscribed 1.8 times tanked upon listing. This happened even as other startups such as Nykaa, Zomato and Policybazaar showed resilience after listing. The issue was managed by top global and Indian investment banks. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group, Axis Capital, ICICI Securities, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and HDFC Bank were the book-running lead managers. The company’s shares tanked even after it released data on Sunday where it said that both the gross merchandise value of transactions and lending activity in the second quarter saw a big jump. Macquarie had initiated research on Paytm, releasing a report on the day of its listing with a target price 40% below the issue price. On Monday, responding to the new business numbers, Macquarie said in a report, “While GMV has grown 112% year-on-year, it is dominated by UPI (66% in FY21, according to our estimates), where Paytm earns zero-MDR (merchant discount rate). We see UPI share climbing up to 85% by FY26E (estimated). Hence, we do not see the strong reported GMV growth materially affecting our P&L estimates. Paytm reported revenues of Rs 890 crore in Q1 in its prospectus, and we maintain our FY22E revenue estimate at Rs 4,500 crore for Paytm. Also, we won’t extrapolate October 2021 numbers because they were influenced by strong festive sales.” It added that Paytm’s loan distribution numbers are below estimates. Veteran banker Uday Kotak quickly corrected a tweet of a social media user accusing Kotak of being part of bankers who, according to the user, mispriced the issue. “Please get your facts right. Kotak did not manage Paytm. Kotak did lead-manage Zomato at issue price Rs 76 (current market price Rs 150), Nykaa at issue price Rs 1,125 (current market price Rs 2,100),” Kotak said in a tweet. Ashneer Grover, founder of Bharat Pe which competes with Paytm for merchant acquisition, said in an interview to an online portal that that company disrupted the market by selling stock of Chinese investors through an IPO to return their money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-crashes-on-day-2-too-down-37-since-ipo/articleshow/87857190.cms||---

Besides being seasonally a strong quarter for consumer tech devices, smartwatches benefited from launches by domestic brands catering to the aspirational ‘Bharat market’, a slew of promotions by vendors, and their focus on providing affordable yet feature-rich devices to first-time buyers. There is a steep decline in average selling prices of smartwatches, almost halving from a year ago, as consumers shift preference from fitness bands to smartwatches that provide all features in one. Given the line-up of launches, the market under Rs 2,000 is expected to witness robust growth in coming months, analysts said. Overall, wrist wear (inclusive of watches & wristbands) crossed the five-million shipments mark in a single quarter, reinforcing acceptance of smartwatches in the country. But wristbands saw a seventh consecutive quarter of YoY decline, data tracking form IDC said. Noise maintained its lead for the sixth straight quarter with a 26% market share in July-September, according to IDC, followed by BoAt with 23.1%. Fire-Boltt’s share jumped to 15.3% in the latest quarter from 5.5% in preceding one, and Realme was in the fourth position backed by its new watches. “Celebrity endorsements are a key tactic for brand recall,” Jaipal Singh, research manager for client devices at IDC India, said. However, to maintain momentum, they must invest more in newer designs and aesthetics, as well as fresh collaborations with existing franchises, he added. Fire-Boltt, for instance, roped in Virat Kohli as its new brand ambassador. Domestic brands captured around 75% of the Indian smartwatch market in July-September 2021 (the highest so far) compared to 38% in the same period in the previous year, according to research firm Counterpoint’s analysis. Counterpoint has also found that more than 90% of the smartwatches market now falls under Rs 10,000 with a majority of the most competitive devices being sold in the Rs 2,500-3,000 range. “The smartwatch market’s average selling price (ASP) declined by more than 50% YoY. At the same time, smart bands’ ASP grew by more than 20%, indicating the clear shift in consumer preference in this segment,” Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain said. “The segment is at that point where the smartphone industry was in 2017 and is seeing huge traction,” Jain added. However, local manufacturing in this space is still low at just about 1% and is expected to go up to around 5% in coming years, analysts said. Noise recently partnered with homegrown manufacturing brand Optiemus Electronics to aid the domestic production of consumer electronics. While the first phase will witness the production of TWS earbuds, Noise said it also intends to launch half a dozen products in the next six months made domestically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/smartwatches-grow-400-yoy-in-sept-qtr/articleshow/87856312.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

It will help in future expansion of the metro corridors and alignments. “The ADB delegates met the PMRC officials to discuss the ongoing metro rail project work and its progress and offered the state to take loan from them instead of somewhere else. But we have already signed the memorandum of understanding with Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) and expecting to get the loan soon. The ADB is ready to extend support for the further expansion in metro lines, stations and alignments and they made an offer in the first round meeting with them. If everything goes well, we can plan for the possible expansion of the metro,” the official said. According to sources at urban development and housing department (UDHD), ADB is already working with the state government on different urban development projects. About 80% of the land required for the project has been acquired as most land belonged to the state government while a large piece of land for construction of ISBT Patna Metro Rail Depot will be acquired in the next couple of months. Land measuring 76 acres in Ranipur and Pahadi area will be used for ISBT metro station and depot. The state government has already sanctioned Rs1,000 for land acquisition. Patna Municipal Corporation has also transferred the land at Mithapur, near Sachivalaya and Akashvani at Fraser Road and Patna Junction while another piece of land near Patna Science College will be given soon. As large asset is already in place, the UDHD officials have already written to JICA to provide the lions share for the metro project. The JICA officials had recently visited the site and met the PMRC officials to discuss the future course of action. “The issues related to land acquisition was already solved and we are expecting to get the funds from JICA soon. Even if it gets delayed, we would have other options for loan,” the officials said. The estimated cost of Patna metro project is Rs13,365.77 crore (excluding land acquisition cost, which is to be borne by the state government). The state and Centre each will bear 20% of the project cost and the remaining 60% will be borrowed as loan from JICA. Work is already in progress on a 6.1km elevated stretch of Corridor II from Malahi Pakri to ISBT, which includes five stations -- Malahi Pakri, Khemnichak (an interchangeable station), Bhootnath, Zero Mile and ISBT. This stretch is also known as priority corridor. According to officials, 112 pillars have been created from Malahi Pakri up to Bhootnath while altogether 210 pillars will be developed for elevated network of Corridor II. Piling work has also commenced from Zero Mile to ISBT, which is likely to be ready by December 2022. Construction of twin tunnels, underground ramp at Rajendra Nagar and six underground stations from Rajendra Nagar to Akashvani, which is also a part of Corridor II, will begin once the funds are allocated. The total length of Corridor II is 14.5km, from Patna Junction to new ISBT, including 7.9km underground network. The Corridor I will be 17.9-km-long, from Danapur to Khemnichack via Mithapur, of which 7.3km will be elevated and 10.5km underground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/adb-keen-to-offer-loan-for-patna-metro-rail-project/articleshow/87856323.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Coimbatore||Five ponds and three canals in Coimbatore to get new lease of life||COIMBATORE: Fifteen years ago, the city corporation desilted a pond at Urumandampalayam with the participation of locals. Today, the same pond is nowhere to be seen. Poor maintenance, rampant encroachments and letting out of sewage water from nearby residential areas have literally vanished the pond. Now, the pond looks like an open ground due to the accumulation of silt over the years. Fortunately, the city corporation has planned to give a new lease of life to the Urumandampalayam pond along with four other ponds and three canals. The Urumandampalayam pond will be restored at a cost of Rs 65 lakh. The restoration work will help improve the groundwater table in nearby areas of the waterbodies. The city corporation has prepared an estimation for Rs 4 crore to restore the waterbodies. “The estimation was prepared based on the instruction received from the director of municipal administration. Works will be initiated after getting the nod from higher officials and required funds,” an official from the city corporation said. The bunds of the waterbodies will be strengthened using the soil desilted from them. Inlets and outlets will be cleaned. Tree plantation will also be carried out, he said. M Devendran, a resident of Urumandampalayam said, “It has been a long pending demand of our people to revive the waterbody. It can help improve the groundwater table if water is stored in it. We thank the civic body for having come forward to revive it. Inlet and outlet areas should also be cleaned,” he said. S Suresh of APJ Abdul Pasumai Iyakkam from Veerakeralam said that the pond proposed to be renovated in their area is now shallow due to the accumulation of silt. The pond is replete with weeds and bushes, he said. S Sivaraja of the Kousika Neerkarangal Team said that there are many waterbodies in the city that need to be restored. They have been turned into dumping yards. Sewage water is also let into the waterbodies. In many areas, shanties are being conducted in the waterbodies. These waterbodies can be used to harvest run-off water during rainy days and to improve groundwater, he said. “The civic body should educate residents not to let sewage water into waterbodies. Cleaning should be done in such a way that run-off water can be collected during rainy days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/five-ponds-and-three-canals-in-city-to-get-a-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/87857201.cms||V Devanathan
---||Amaravati||Legal defects in legislations force Andhra Pradesh govt’s strategic retreat||AMARAVATI: The decision of the government to withdraw the two Acts on the three capital cities may have been prompted by concerns that the laws would not stand up to legal scrutiny, according to experts. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who spoke on the three capital legislation in the Assembly on Monday, said the government would come up with a new Bill on decentralisation of development and power and ensure there are no legal hurdles. The state government is likely to constitute an expert committee to begin consultations with stakeholders from all three regions. “This is no defeat or victory for anyone. The government is committed to overall development of all three region and we will re-introduce the Bills such that they overcome all hurdles,” said municipal administration and urban development minister Botcha Satyanarayana. Faced with tough propositions in the legal battle over the repeal of the CRDA Act and AP Decentralisation and Equitable Development Act in the high court, the state government has made a strategic retreat. The government is reported to have taken the sudden decision following advice from the constitutional experts it had lined up to argue in the high court. The previous government had pooled over 33,000 acres of land from farmers of 29 villages in Thullur, Mangalagiri and Tadepalle mandals in Guntur district. A majority of farmers, particularly from upland areas, voluntarily gave up their land in return of a land compensation announced by the former government as part of a land pooling scheme (LPS). The government roped in farmers with a promise to develop the area and readied an exclusive master plan for development of nine core cities within Amaravati. The repeal of the CRDA Act is being viewed as a breach of trust by farmers as the mere presence of the legislative assembly would not guarantee them the assured premium for the plots allocated under the LPS scheme. “The development of a big city is the soul of the CRDA Act and the promise of the government. Who will purchase the plots if there is no development in the region?” farmers questioned. The state earlier constituted two separate committees to study the issue of equitable development. Both reports backed the chief minister’s proposal to establish three capital cities. However, the government’s decision to rush through the process pushed it into legal trouble as it bypassed certain legislative procedures. The opposition TDP, which had a majority in the Council at the time, had pressed for sending the Bills to a select committee. In January 2020, Legislative Council chairman MA Shariff referred the Bills to a select committee. However, the government routed the bills to the governor and secured his nod. The decision of the legislature secretary to not honour the decision of the chairman is a major issue that came up for scrutiny in the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/legal-defects-in-legislations-force-govts-strategic-retreat/articleshow/87856130.cms||Samdani MN
---||Kozhikode||Muslim outfits want Kerala govt to revoke decision||KOZHIKODE: A meeting of Muslim organizations, held in Kozhikode on Monday, asked the government to revoke its decision to entrust staff appointments at Kerala State Waqf Board to public service commission (PSC). They warned of an agitation if the government refused to withdraw its decision. Addressing the media after a meeting convened under the banner of Muslim Leadership Forum, IUML leader Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal said that the decision was against the provisions of the Central Waqf Act which clearly states that making staff appointments in state bodies were the prerogative of Waqf boards in states. “The main objective of Waqf Board is to protect Waqf properties. As per Islamic norms, Waqf properties belong to God and their protection should be carried out by officials who have religious belief and knowledge,” said Thangal, adding that the forum was also mulling legal recourse in this regard. IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said the government cannot take a decision on the issue violating the central act. “The decision will not stand legally. The meeting has unanimously decided to demand the state government to withdraw the decision, failing which, the organizations would be forced to launch a strong agitation,” he said. The meeting was attended by most major Muslim organizations, except the AP Sunni faction. The meeting was of the view that the decision that only Muslims would be appointed to Waqf board would not materialize if they are made via PSC as it could be challenged by candidates from other communities in court citing equal opportunity. Among those who attended the meeting included MK Muneer, Syed Rasheedali Shihab Thangal, Bahavudheen Mohammed Nadvi, TP Abdulla Koya Madani, Hussain Madavoor, Sheikh Mohammed Karakunnu, MI Abdul Majeed Swalahi, among others. Also, Waqf board members MC Mayin Haji and PV Sainudheen attended the meeting. IUML had earlier taken a strong exception to the decision saying that while the government has set up a special recruitment board for posts in Devaswom boards, it has entrusted the appointment of Waqf Board to PSC. Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema had also called for joint agitation by Muslim organizations against the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/revoke-decision-on-waqf-hirings/articleshow/87857232.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Devendra Fadnavis says BJP will field Sopte from Mandrem||PANAJI: BJP election in-charge for Goa and former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday that the sitting party MLA from Mandrem, Dayanand Sopte, would get the BJP ticket for the upcoming assembly election. His remark put an end to the suspense over the constituency, as former CM Laxmikant Parsekar had also staked claim for the ticket Fadnavis said that when Sopte is doing good work, the party does not have to look elsewhere. He said Sopte’s supporters can start work right away to forge “a victory like never seen before” in Mandrem for BJP. “Dayanand Sopte today is known as a man connected to the soil, who works with the people and who is into politics not for himself, but to work for society,” he said. Sopte was elected on a Congress ticket in the 2017 assembly elections, defeating Parsekar by over 7,000 votes. In October 2018, he, along with Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar (Congress) joined BJP. Since then, Sopte and Parsekar have been at loggerheads. “Earlier, the OBC morcha person was asking, who will get the ticket,” Fadnavis said, speaking about the ticket to Sopte. “One should not have such doubts. BJP has a system in place, a parliamentary board is part of the system. Even the chief minister’s ticket is decided by the board, but does it mean anyone can usurp his rightful ticket? So, some things are not to be asked, you have to understand them. You have such a good MLA, will the party then look elsewhere?” The former Maharashtra CM was speaking at a BJP karyakarta event in Mandrem. Sopte, meanwhile, said that he has proven to be a giant-killer in Mandrem on several occasions, defeating heavyweights. “It is thanks to your affection that I could prove giant-killer. People said publically that they want to finish me. But I never uttered a bad word against anyone. I just told myself time will tell who is finished,” said Sopte. He also said that Mandrem had several leaders in the past who went on to become ministers and even chief minister, but none did anything for the poor before him. Later on Monday evening, Sopte and Parsekar shared the stage for the felicitation event of Himachal Pradesh governor Rajendra Arlekar, at an event organised by Parsekar at his institute. Fadnavis, meanwhile, paid rich tributes to former CM Manohar Parrikar. “This election is in a way our first election after our beloved leader Manohar Parrikar left us,” he said. “But in Goa, Manohar bhai Parrikar introduced politics based on development. He was a creator of Goa’s modern face. And after Parrikar, Pramod Sawant has taken this tradition forward.” He also took potshots at Trinamool Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, comparing them to Siberian migratory birds. “Such Siberian birds have come here — some from Delhi, some from Kolkata. After elections, Siberian birds from Delhi will return to Delhi and those from Kolkata will return to Kolkata. Goa will get a BJP government yet again,” he said. Fadnavis also said that Congress is in a highly-confused state, not even knowing its national president or who is taking the decisions. “Congress is now turning into a nano party like Tata’s Nano. The number of people that fit in a Nano get elected from Congress now,” said Fadnavis. He also said West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee is running a dictatorial government, which has ruined the state’s economy, and that anyone who speaks against the government is either killed or assaulted. In Delhi, the AAP government gets several thousands of crores in grants from the Centre, being the capital, and yet, not a single multispecialty hospital was constructed by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, and people died during the pandemic as a result due to shortage of beds, said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fadnavis-says-bjp-will-field-sopte-from-mandrem/articleshow/87857230.cms||---

Goa are ranked among the favourites to win this season’s title, but up against Mumbai, they seemed completely out of place. For last year’s semi-finalists, knocked out by the same team, almost everything went wrong. “This night is difficult for us, difficult for the players, difficult for the team. Now the important thing is to wake up early and prepare. It’s important for the dressing room to control the emotions,” said coach Ferrando. Ferrando fielded several young players in his starting 11. While they had shown promise in the past, they did not measure up to the challenge trying to extend their 15-match unbeaten run. Assessing the game after the agonising loss, Ferrando said the weak link was in transitions. “When we were playing in attack, we lost control of the areas and then in a lot of transitions, Mumbai had more chances against us. I think it's a big problem for us because when we are in attack, it's important to pay attention to the counter-attacks. “There were a lot of details (that were missing). It's not possible to talk about one point or two points, (we have to do) detail by detail study,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-players-must-control-emotions-says-head-coach-juan-ferrando/articleshow/87876121.cms||---

Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts have conservation reserves as well as national sanctuaries like Radhanagari, Sagreshwar and Koyana that have high number of leopard population. Leopards, who usually stay away from human settlements, are often spotted in the farmlands thanks to the undisturbed shelter they get in sugar cane fields. Last week, a four-year-old boy belonging to the family of sugar cane workers was killed in a leopard attack in Yenke village of Karad when around 20 workers were passing by a sugar cane farm early morning. After the incident, the forest officials have asked the villagers and cane cutters to take extra care while travelling to farmlands, especially at night. Clement Ben, chief conservator of forests, said, “Chances of leopards taking shelter in sugar cane farms is high as they get an undisturbed habitat. Earlier, these animals used to prefer offshoot areas in the forest, but these days, the count in sugar cane farms has increased as well. It is not that the animal attacks everyone, but it’s always better to stay aware and avoid any conflict situation with the animal. Forest officials are making people aware about taking precautions to avoid conflict with leopards.” He added, “Some basic things that the villagers can do is not travel to farmlands at the night as leopards are active then. Cattle and pets should be locked up in closed shelters. People should also avoid sleeping outside their home or play loud music. Always keep a torch and stick handy when moving outside. Garbage should be handled properly as it attracts stray dogs that are easy target of leopards. If a leopard is spotted, one should stay calm and not disturb the animal. One can also call on 1926 — toll free number of forest department — for any assistance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/forest-dept-advisory-keep-an-eye-out-for-leopards-while-working-in-sugar-cane-farms-in-kolhapur-sangli-satara/articleshow/87854887.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Residents complained that the poor condition of stormwater drains and encroachments are the cause for flooding in residential and rural roads.The residents of the locality situated along the Dindigul national highway were taken by surprise as surplus rainwater was flowing on roads connecting them with the rest of the city. Copious rainfall in rural parts bordering Rettaimalai and areas adjoining Viralimalai have filled the tanks in the rural parts. Further, the run-off water that was supposed to drain into the Koraiyar river has inundated Pirattiyur and Cauvery Nagar near the RTO office. “If the stormwater drains were in proper shape, the surplus water would have drained to the Koraiyar without causing any trouble. Encroachments have affected the actual flow, several houses were inundated,” T Murugan, a resident of Pirattiyur said. Locals suspect the flow in the drains has been hindered with pipes and cement slabs in the commercialised localities in Dheeran Nagar and near Koraiyar bridge. Corporation officials said that the state highways was intimated about the encroachments adjoining Dindigul highway. “Highways department has planned to widen the drain in a week and after the process inundation will not happen,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-inundate-pirattiyur/articleshow/87857221.cms||---

A total of 10,879 gram panchayats across Gujarat will go to polls on December 19 to elect sarpanch and members, the SEC announced on Monday. Earlier this year, the BJP reversed its setback of 2016, winning all 31 district panchayats and 196 of the 231 taluka panchayats that went to polls. Interestingly, the poll schedule for gram panchayats was announced a couple of days after the BJP-led state government announced a slew of development projects for villages. During the ‘Atmanirbhar Gram Yatra’ held between November 18 and 20, over 40,000 developmental works worth Rs 1,577 crore were either be dedicated or announced as the entire state cabinet spent three days in villages across the state. “In all, nearly 2.06 crore voters will elect 10,284 sarpanchs and 89,702 panchayat members of these 10,879 gram panchayats. There are some 14,000 gram panchayats and 18,500 villages across the state. The last date of filing nominations is December 4 and that of withdrawal is December 7,” state election commissioner Sanjay Prasad said. “Polling will be held on December 19 between 7am and 6pm in over 27,000 polling booths. Counting of votes will be held on December 21. Due to the very high number of wards, polling will be conducted using ballot boxes instead of EVMs. In all, we will be using over 54,000 ballot boxes for the elections,” said Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/close-to-11k-panchayats-to-go-to-polls-on-december-19/articleshow/87856448.cms||---

Unlike the conventional traffic signals, the LED signal has linear lighting patterns attached to the poles for better visibility.Trichy traffic police sources said that city police commissioner G Karthikeyan had instructed the traffic police wing to streamline the traffic management to avoid congestion and make roads safer. As part of modernising the traffic management infrastructure under public-private partnership, traffic police installed LED traffic signals on all the intersecting national highways, state highways and city roads of the Mannarpuram intersection. City-based VDart technologies sponsored the signals under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative. All the 14 traffic signal poles in the Mannarpuram intersection were equipped with LED boards. The circular traffic signals are still intact. The poles will display green, amber and red lights in a linear inverted L pattern.Traffic police said that from now on road users cannot claim poor visibility of the lights as a reason for jumping the traffic signal. “Vehicles fast approaching the junction on the national highways will realise the need to slow down as the poles will display the signal colours,” A Murugesan, assistant commissioner of police (traffic), said. A trial run of the signal at Mannarpuram is underway to ascertain any modifications needed. Further digital timers are likely to be added. Deputy commissioner of police R Mutharasu told TOI that similar digital LED traffic signals are planned at four other busy intersections in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mannarpuram-junction-gets-digital-led-traffic-lights/articleshow/87857217.cms||Deepak Karthik

The fire is also believed to have destroyed goods worth several lakhs of rupees. It took three hours for the police to douse the fire and recover the charred bodies of the victims. Cops suspect that the fire was caused due to a short-circuit. Mawana SHO Vishnu Kaushik said that a police team rushed to the spot with six fire engines after receiving the alert and managed to rescue two other people who were present inside the shop. “The deceased have been identified as Raja Kumar (25), who was the shop owner Satish Kumar’s son, Shadab (25) and Rohit (26), who were helpers at the shop,” Kaushik said. Eyewitnesses said that the flames coming out of the shop were several meters high and spread so much panic that other shopkeepers shut their establishments within minutes after the fire broke out. As the huge flames of the fire engulfed the three men inside the shop, their families kept screaming and begging for help outside. In a video of the accident recorded by a local person, Raja Kumar’s sister is seen crying and urging cops to save her brother. Similar scenes involving family members of Shadab and Rohit are also seen in the video.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-charred-to-death-in-fire-at-engine-oil-shop/articleshow/87856442.cms||---

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Trichy locals unhappy with bollard work on platforms||TRICHY: The expensive ornamental works carried out by the Trichy Corporation on platforms in Woraiyur Salai under smart cities mission has not gone down well with residents and activists, who questioned the rationale behind establishing them. They claim that the civic body instead of acting against encroachments that hinder pedestrians, has beautified the platforms with steel bollards. The corporation is implementing smart drains in Woraiyur, Chinthamani and West Boulevard Road at a cost of Rs 47.3 crore. With the roads already narrow, the pedestrian platforms have further shrunk the carriageways since vehicles are now parked on the road due to lack of space. Besides, despite complaints from residents, the civic body has not acted on encroachments on the platforms as it affects pedestrian movement. With such issues to address, the civic body has rather involved itself in beautifying the platforms with bollards. Some of them were even vandalised by anti-socials a day after they were erected. “The bollards will be gradually vandalised. Instead of executing such expensive work that has no purpose, the corporation must plan an eviction drive,” S R Kishore Kumar, an advocate with Makkal Needhi Maiam said. Shopkeepers and residents in Woraiyur said that the bollards would only cause hindrance as two-wheeler riders will end up parking their vehicles on the platform. Residents also complained that senior citizens are unable to access the platforms as they were high. “Due to the heavy rain, the encroachment eviction plan was delayed. The bollards were erected to prevent encroachments. Once we lay a new road, the height of the platforms will come down,” a corporation official with said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-locals-unhappy-with-bollard-work-on-platforms/articleshow/87857224.cms||Deepak Karthik

According to a Rajasthan High Court ruling, it is illegal to run dairies within the city limits and has to be shifted outside the city, which is yet to be done. These dairies shelter around 5,000 cows. Ravi Naiyar, president of Raja Park Market Association, said, "Recently, a calf was found roaming on the street. I took it to the nearest Gaushala. But this is such a rampant problem right now and is a major cause of concern in Jaipur." In Walled City, the councillors have filed a complaint with mayor Munesh Gurjar regarding the problem of stray animals. Vimal Aggarwal, councillor from Ward 22 (JMC-Heritage) said, "When the mayor completed one year, we complained about stray animal issue in the city. Officials of the corporation are working in connivance with the illegal dairy owners. Before the vehicles arrive to catch the stray animals, the owners get informed. There is a need to curb this menace." The dairy owners were given land to set shelters outside the city, but due to low business, they sold those lands and came back to their original place. Satish Meena, head of animal husbandry at Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater, said, "The corporation catches the stray animals using their resources and then sends them to Hingonia gaushala. We are working efficiently in the city. If any complaints related to the stray animals are received, we take action against them." TOI tried to contact the animal husbandry head at JMC- Heritage, Devendra Jain, but he did not take calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/stray-cattle-menace-continues-to-haunt-city-as-illegal-dairies-thrive/articleshow/87857227.cms||---

Director of education Bhushan Savaikar said that the broad SOPs will be issued on Tuesday. Last week, the state expert committee, based on recommendations of the Covid task force, had given its approval to start offline classes from Class I to VIII. But CM and education minister Pramod Sawant had said that the government is still examining the proposal. Officials now said that no approval has come from the government about allowing physical classes for Class I to VIII, even though the expert committee doctors were of the view that it is safe to even hold classes for nursery section as the state Covid positivity rate is at an all-time low. As per the task force’s decision, for Class VII and VIII, it will be left to the school managements to take a call on how to go about conducting physical classes based on the schools’ enrolment, infrastructure and other ground conditions. Already, sessions for Class IX to XII are on in the state in hybrid mode — using a combination of online and offline classes. The expert committee has already cautioned that the SOPs issued by the directorate of education should be treated as broad guidelines, and that managements should draw up their own instructions for students to ensure social distancing and other precautions against Covid. As per the expert committee’s suggestions, schools are not to organise assemblies, and are to adopt staggered timings. Schools have been asked to counsel parents to take both doses of vaccination. School staff have already been told to produce a Covid-negative certificate on a weekly basis if they are not vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/classes-vii-viii-can-return-to-school-on-nov-25-goa-govt/articleshow/87857251.cms||---

The operation was conducted by the state’s Pre-conception Pre-natal diagnostic technique (PCPNDT) cell at Sanjeevni hospital in Sirohi. PCPNDT appropriate authority Aruna Rajoria said Dr Sanjeev Jain and his assistant, Krishna Kumari of Udaipur, were arrested. The sonography machine, which was used for sex determination, and some cash were seized, she said.

In the operation, a pregnant woman was sent to the accused doctors by the PCPNDT cell, who expressed willingness to know the sex of the foetus, she said. The doctors, via Kumari, demanded Rs 45,000 for it, said Rajoria. "A woman accompanying the pregnant woman gave Rs 45,000 to Kumari and the accused doctor revealed the sex of the foetus to the pregnant woman. When the pregnant woman (decoy) relayed information to the PCPNDT cell, they raided the hospital and arrested the accused doctor and Kumari," she said.

---||Goa||Documentaries on social issues gain traction at Iffi||PANAJI: From a documentary on a women police unit of Assam created to curb crimes against females, to the tradition of declaring women witches, to exploiting them in rural Gujarat, the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) saw Indian films that tell little known stories on social issues from different corners of the country. Biswajeet Bora’s Assamese film, ‘Boomba Ride’, for instance, is about a school with a single student who has to get to the institution by a canoe. Being fully aware of the desperate situation of the teachers to keep the school operational for their salaries, the mischievous student takes advantage of these circumstances. “In 2003, I saw a news report in Assam about a school with a single student, and thought of making a film during the pandemic. There are a lot of stories in primary education in rural areas, not just in Assam, but across India. The government has given a lot of facilities. But we and the teachers are not taking education seriously, especially in government-run schools,” said Bora. ‘Veerangana’ is another Assamese film made by Kishore Kalita. It is about a female police unit created in Assam to fight the rising crimes against women. The women are trained in motorbike riding, martial arts and handling lethal and non-lethal weapons to effectively deal with any crime. “Nowadays, we talk about women rising in tandem with men in every field, but when the night comes, women are afraid to go out alone due to the fear of eve-teasers and harassers. The fact that women can protect women is what I wanted to show through this documentary”, said Kalita, a lawyer. Similarly, ‘The Spell of Purple’, by Prachee Bajania, features a part of tribal Gujarat where thousands of women are labelled witches with ulterior motives to grab property or sexually harass them. “The movie celebrates the courage but also speaks about the weariness faced by them due to constant harassment,” said Bajania. In the film, ‘Inaas’, the sole owner of a small field in tribal Gujarat is the target of envious neighbours who brand her a ‘witch’. Enveloped in fear, she looks for strength in other women. The opening film of the Indian Panorama section at Iffi 2021 was ‘Semkhor’, directed by Aimee Baruah. It is the first Dimasa language film to be screened at Iffi. The language is not included yet in the Eighth Schedule. The movie covers the story of the Samsa community, who live a life in isolation and revolves around the custom of semkhor in the community, where if a woman dies during childbirth, the infant is buried alive along with the mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/documentaries-on-social-issues-gain-traction-at-iffi/articleshow/87857260.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Vijay Kumar alias Sonu Sethi is accused of allegedly attacking a reporter of a vernacular paper, Sukhwinder Singh Saini and dislocating his turban. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media. Sethi was also arrested in August after he made some women dance to the tunes of Sikh religious hymns at his dhaba during a festival. Refuting allegations, Sonu Sethi, in a message on social media, alleged that Sukhwinder Singh Saini was harassing and blackmailing him over an LCD installed outside his dhaba. He also alleged that the case was registered against him due to Saini's proximity with the SHO of Zirakpur. Late on Sunday evening, Sethi and five others were charged with assaulting and robbing a turbaned Sikh journalist of a vernacular daily, Sukhwinder Singh Saini. SHO, Zirakpur, Onkar Singh Brar said, “We have booked six persons, including the owner of Sethi Dhaba. They have been charged for looting, injuring and taking off the turban of a journalist. They are yet to be arrested,” he said. In his police complaint, Saini alleged that he was at the spot for a report on installation of illegal LCD for advertisement installed in front of Sethi Dhaba, but owners, along with other persons, came and started thrashing him, during which his turban fell off. He informed the police, who came and rescued him. Sethi threatened to kill him and fled from the scene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vernacular-newspaper-scribe-threatened-thrashed-in-zirakpur/articleshow/87856457.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Drive against Sealdah pre-paid taxi refusal||Kolkata: The Sealdah traffic guard on Monday launched a drive to ensure that taxis enter the pre-paid booth adjacent to the railway station. The move came a day after TOI reported that railway passengers were being harassed due to the non-availability of taxis outside Howrah and Sealdah railway stations on weekends. Police said anyone, who is not getting a taxi or is being refused by the driver near the Sealdah station complex, can approach cops to be deployed at strategic points. “All cabs have to enter the pre-paid booth or leave the station complex completely. If a taxi is found parked near the complex, its driver will be prosecuted for illegal parking. We also want passengers to call us directly so that we can take instant action,” said an ACP. Cops said they also monitored social media to check if there was any fresh complaint regarding the non-availability of taxis from Sealdah station complex on Monday. “No fresh complaint has been registered so far. We have decided to keep the vigil even on weekends when maximum complaints pour in,” said an officer. According to Sealdah traffic guard, one of the recurring complaints was about taxis. Not only do they refuse to go by meter but they also park anywhere they wanted to. Pedestrians and vehicles use the same approach road near Sealdah court to access the station. Private taxi touts fleece passengers. There are now five separate channels for vehicles, one each for pre-paid taxis, metered taxis and autos. “Pre-paid taxis will be our main focus in the five lanes,” said the ACP. A Twitter user on Sunday had shared a photograph of taxis parked near the station complex but none moving towards the pre-paid taxi booth that led to TOI highlighting the problem along with similar experiences at the Howrah old station complex. “Look at the pre-paid taxi booth situation in Sealdah. Hundreds of taxis parked inside the station compound but no taxis available for the pre-paid taxi booth !!?! Why are passengers being harassed after their long journeys? Taxis are charging 2-3 times higher fares,” tweeted an user who goes by the name NeoNeandarthal on the Kolkata Traffic Police Twitter page. “In case of taxi refusal please share the details of the vehicles which refused to go on hire or inform us on Control room number (03322505096/22143644) so that we can take action in real time,” the DCP Traffic handle tweeted in reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drive-against-sealdah-pre-paid-taxi-refusal/articleshow/87856463.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Full-fledged physical hearings resume at Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: Lawyers trickled into Delhi high court on Monday after it resumed full-fledged physical functioning, which was restricted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The court has been holding proceedings through videoconferencing since March 2020 following the Covid-19 outbreak. It also experimented briefly with physical hearings before the brutal second wave once again enforced a lockdown. Last week, the court issued its standard operating procedure (SOP) to regulate the entry of lawyers and litigants inside the court building for physical hearings and it came into effect on Monday. According to the protocol, no litigant represented by a lawyer would be permitted entry unless there is a specific direction or permission by the court. Advocates, party-in-person, and registered clerks above the age of 65 years and those suffering from comorbidities may refrain from physically appearing in courts since all courts are functioning in hybrid mode also, allowing access by videoconferencing. “No litigant, who is represented by an advocate, would be permitted entry unless there is specific direction by the court. The advocates, party-in-person, and registered clerks above the age of 65 years and those suffering from comorbidities may refrain from appearing in courts. Persons displaying symptoms of flu, fever, cough, etc., shall not be permitted entry inside the court complex,” the SOP says. Senior counsel engaged by any such advocate, a registered clerk, for the limited purpose of delivering heavy and bulky case files, and any party appearing in person shall also be given entry.

---||Chandigarh||PG caretaker caught with counterfeit currency notes||Mohali: Police claimed to have arrested a man and recovered counterfeit currency from his possession. He was produced in court on Monday and remanded in police custody, said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Singh Mahal. Police have recovered counterfeit currency worth Rs 69,500 and a laptop, colour printer as well as high quality paper from his possession, he added. The accused works as a caretaker at a paying guest accommodation and has been identified Nawab alias Feroz. Balongi Police SHO, inspector Rajpal Singh Gill said following information about the printing of counterfeit currency being printed at a house in Balongi, police raided the premises and found that the information was correct. Inspector Gill said that on searching the house, police recovered the counterfeit currency. During preliminary interrogation of the accused, it came to light that Nawab was a drug addict. He said he learned how to print counterfeit currency from Hisar resident Bijender, who was a resident of Balongi, who has been printing counterfeit currency for the past three months, said the police. Inspector Gill said, “He has been printing counterfeit currency of Rs 100, Rs 200, Rs 500, and Rs 2,000 denomination and used to embed green wire inside the paper to look like real currency. Then he used the currency at the local market to distribute it and get real currency in return.” He said police have booked Nawab and Bijender under sections 489-A, 489-B, 489-C and 489-D of the IPC at Balongi police station.

---||Nagpur||Despite administration push, 45 lakh yet to take first vaccine dose in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: Despite the local administrations going full steam and taking a slew of initiatives two weeks ago to encourage eligible but unvaccinated beneficiaries, the first dose backlog in Vidarbha could be reduced by only about 12 lakh, as per data updated till Monday morning. As on November 7, the 11 districts of Vidarbha had first dose backlog of over 57 lakh. This has come down to 45 lakh now. The region has an estimated 1.81 crore eligible beneficiaries in the 18+ age group. Vidarbha’s total vaccination, including first and second doses, has surpassed 2 crore. It needs 3.62 crore vaccinations to reach status of fully vaccinated eligible population. Nagpur and Amravati divisions covered a whopping 11.74 lakh eligible population with the first dose between November 7 and 22. From November 8, all the districts adopted tough measures as well as lucrative offers to prod unvaccinated eligible beneficiaries to take their first dose at the earliest. Local administrations in Nagpur restricted entry of unvaccinated people in government offices, Chandrapur civic body offered rewards through bumper draw. All the districts are also conducting Har Ghar Dastak drive aggressively and diverted most of the health teams in this drive. Administrations are also reaching out to communities and religious groups to convince people. Then, the region needed on an average one lakh vaccinations per day to achieve state and central governments deadline of vaccinating all the eligible population with the first dose by November 30. This per day target may vary depending on each district’s balance. Both Amravati and Nagpur divisions carried out an average 78,000 vaccinations per day. With just eight days left, the per day required rate has climbed to an unrealistic 3 lakh per day unless the deadline is extended. Some administrations have already conceded that they will not be able to cover first dose of all eligible beneficiaries by November 30 despite putting in all their strength. Vaccine hesitancy and waning fear of Covid-19 are major hurdles before the health workers engaged in door-to-door drive and special camps. Amravati district having largest unvaccinated eligible population improved its performance and jabbed 2.15 lakh people in the fortnight but still tops the backlog chart. Nagpur district jabbed 1.68 unvaccinated people with the first dose during the same period. Bhandara and Gondia, both at bottom of the chart, could manage to vaccinate only 7,518 and 1,3281 eligible persons with first dose. Overall, Amravati division’s first dose coverage increased by 8.91 lakh as compared to Nagpur division where 2.82 lakh first jabs were given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-admn-push-45l-yet-to-take-first-vax-dose-in-vidarbha/articleshow/87857012.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Airport cabs wait for surge, vanish for 1 hour||KOLKATA: No pre-paid taxis are available outside Kolkata airport for an hour between 9.30pm and 10.30pm, thereby forcing people to wait for long before 15% surge in fare starts at night. With no cabs in sight, a serpentine queue of tired and infuriated passengers, who are eager to return home, forms outside the terminal. Many passengers have been complaining about the issue for the last few weeks. TOI checked the situation and found last week that the dip in the number of pre-paid cabs starts between 8.30pm and 9.30pm when many flights land in Kolkata airport. The number of these cabs starts rising after 10.30pm when the pre-paid fares are charged with 15% hike. “I got stuck in traffic at Mumbai and missed my flight. I took a late-evening flight and reached Kolkata. I had been standing in a queue outside the Kolkata airport for nearly 45 minutes as there was no pre-paid cab,” said Ashis Chakraborty, a former state government employee, who was returning to his Salt Lake home from his son’s flat in Mumbai. Avinash Singh had a similar experience while coming back home from a business meeting in Ranchi. He stood behind 16 others in a queue outside the airport. “This is for the third time in this month that I faced problem in getting a cab. The cabs refuse to ply till the night charges kick in. I think this is illegal and proper steps should be taken against the drivers,” said Singh, a Lake Gardens resident. Standing in the queue with two large trolley bags behind many others, Preeti Jain, a resident of Delhi, tried to book an app cab but the drivers continued refusing her, demanding some extra in cash. “Not a single pre-paid taxi is available in the bay, no app cab accepts the booking. Many flyers like me have to suffer once they land in the city. In no other Metro city, I have found this problem,” said Jain, who had come to visit a relative in north Kolkata. Jayanta Kumar Das, a taxi driver, who entered the bay after 10.30pm, confessed that he was delaying intentionally to make some extra money. “Driving at night is a concern as we are often stopped and questioned by cops in the nakas. Considering the amount we have to pay for diesel and other maintenance costs, I don’t find anything wrong on our part to delay and earn some extra money when the night surcharge starts,” said Das. Cops said they are aware of the problem but they are helpless as the drivers in empty taxis either don’t enter the airport premises before 10.30pm or make excuses of taking a break for dinner during this period. TOI found a couple of cops running after taxis and trying to convince the drivers to enter the bay. “We try our best to address the situation and we direct every taxi entering the airport to the pre-paid bay,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-cabs-wait-for-surge-vanish-for-1hr/articleshow/87856467.cms||---

In the first incident, reported in Jalki Bazaar of Sillod rural, under the limits of Ajanta police station, a 17-year-old girl and a 20-year-old boy ended their lives by hanging from a tree. The incident came to light in the morning after the bodies were spotted by a passerby. Ajanta police station’s assistant inspector Ajit Vispute said, “Preliminary probe has revealed that the youngsters were in relationship.” The officer, citing the version of some relatives of the deceased, said about a couple of days ago, the minor girl’s family had learnt about their alleged relationship. “We are trying to verify the events that might have triggered the couple to take the extreme step,” he added. In the second incident, Vaibhav Fapale (19), a pharmacy student, committed suicide at his residence in Mayur Nagar of Hudco in the wee hours of Monday. A case of accidental death has been registered. In the third incident, a 26-year-old man — Pandurang Dake of Nitrud village in Majalgaon of Beed district — committed suicide three days after his wedding. Police said that he got married on Saturday and on Monday morning, there was a Satyanarayan puja that the deceased attended along with his wife and other family members. After all the relatives and family members got busy with the gathering, he left home and reached their farm, where he hanged himself from a tress using a rope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/4-end-life-by-suicide-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87854925.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Centre opposes Delhi’s government's ration at doorstep plan||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday opposed the AAP government’s doorstep ration delivery plan, saying it goes against the “architecture” of the National Food Security Act (NFSA). It also claimed that there is no provision of audit in the state’s plan. Appearing for the Centre before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati maintained that the Centre opposed the plan earlier because it mitigated the NFSA. “The fair price shops are an intrinsic part of NFSA. The targeted public distribution system should be open to audit and vigilance. Also, it is mandatory to have ePoS (electronic point of sale machines) where all transactions are recorded and co-related with Aadhaar accounts. The execution of PDS has to be in a manner NFSA requires,” Bhati submitted, outlining the Centre’s objections. The law officer added that “the state government is free to give benefits higher than the NFS Act but they cannot mitigate the architecture of the NFS Act,” pointing out that unlike the national scheme, the door to door plan entails delivery of packaged ration whose cost may be higher. The high court is hearing a petition filed by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh Delhi challenging Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. The AAP government has defended its scheme, arguing that an overwhelming majority has opted for supply of rations at their doorstep. It wants to curtail supplies to the petitioner associations and supply directly to those who opt for ration at doorsteps. The high court had earlier allowed the Delhi government’s scheme while directing it to first issue communication to each of the fair price shop holders, informing them of the particulars of the ration cardholders who have opted to receive their rations at their doorstep. Once that exercise is done, the ration, to the extent that they are being supplied to such beneficiaries who opt for doorstep delivery, need not be supplied to the fair price shop holders, it had said. The court’s order had prompted the Centre to challenge it before the Supreme Court, which, however, refused to entertain the plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-opposes-delhis-ration-at-doorstep-plan/articleshow/87857300.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Woman falls off flyover after car hits bike, dies||KOLKATA: A 36-year-old woman, who was riding pillion on a bike with her husband, died after being flung off the Nagerbazar flyover in Dum Dum when an SUV collided head-on with the two-wheeler on Monday evening. The accident happened on the flyover near Kazipara when the deceased, Beauty Biswas and her husband, Asim, were returning to their Lake Town home. Both of them were wearing helmets. While the woman succumbed to her injuries at a private hospital, her husband was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital with serious injuries.  Cops have arrested Arafat Ali, driver of the killer vehicle, who will be produced in Barrackpore court on Tuesday. Cops said the SUV was running at a high speed towards the side of Dum Dum Central Jail from Lake Town when the driver lost control and ended up hitting the bike coming from the opposite direction. “The woman, who fell off the flyover and landed on the road, suffered several fractures and was left bleeding profusely. Her husband was also thrown off the bike and received serious injuries on his head, chest and waist. But he fell on the flyover, which saved his life,” said a traffic cop. The couple was rushed to a private hospital near Nagerbazar, where the woman succumbed to her injuries. Her husband was later shifted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after his condition deteriorated. “The man, who was behind the wheels of the SUV, resorted to reckless driving. It hit the bike at a high speed,” said a local trader. Cops suspect that Ali might have been in an inebriated condition. “We have already arrested the driver and seized the car. An investigation is on,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-falls-off-flyover-after-car-hits-bike-dies/articleshow/87856487.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops find man staying with dad’s body at Garfa home for 3 months||KOLKATA: A 40-year-old man was found living with his father’s decomposed body at his Garfa house around 11.30am on Monday. The man, Kaushik Dey, told cops that his father, Sangram (70), a retired employee of the non-scientific wing of a leading atomic research institute in Salt Lake, had passed away almost three months ago. Dey’s mother, who has been paralysed for the last few years, also lives at the house. This incident brings back the memories of the Robinson Street incident in 2015 when a man was found living with the corpse of his sister and the carcasses of two dogs for several months. Cops said they will wait to ascertain the exact time of Sangram’s death. “We have come to know that the man had informed one of his neighbours about the death of his father on November 2. We will wait for the post-mortem report to find the reason behind his death and the time when it took place,” said an officer. Cops recorded the statement of Sangram’s wife and she told cops that her son, who was unemployed, paid no heed to her when she asked for the cremation of her husband’s body. He told her that his father had a “social death” and that in “absolute realism” he was “very much alive and would wake up soon.” Cops suspect that the man is “mentally ill” and said that they would seek an advice from doctors and psychiatrists before making the next move. The DC (SSD), Radhid Munir Khan, said some neighbours claimed not to have seen Sangram since the time of Vishwakarma Puja. “Sangram and his wife used to order roti and cooked vegetables from a local eatery run by Sunil Kar who was paid on a periodic basis. Of late, their son, Kaushik, was visiting the shop and ordering lesser number of rotis. On being asked about his father, he would give vague answers like he remained indoors due to his illness. However, it was from Kar that we received the news and decided to check,” said an officer. DC Khan said that the pension received by Sangram each month had not been withdrawn in the past three months. Cops are checking the banking transactions of both Sangram and Kaushik to check whether there was any foul play. They are checking the life certificate to find if there is any forgery. “So far, we have not found any foul play,” said the officer. “Kaushik told us that his father had withdrawn Rs 30,000 earlier. He and his mother had been living on this money in the past several weeks. Sangram had built the single-storey house in 2001 and he had been residing here for the past 20 years,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-find-man-staying-with-dads-body-at-garfa-home-for-3-months/articleshow/87856498.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||MMC clerk told to furnish RTI info or pay fine||MARGAO: The first appellate authority of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) has by a judgement and order directed the head clerk/store keeper of the municipality to provide information sought under RTI within a period of 10 days, failing which the errant municipal staff will have to pay a fine of Rs 250 per day. Convener of Shadow Council for Margao Savio Coutinho had filed an RTI application on July 16 seeking information with respect to mobile phone sets procured by the MMC during the last three terms of the Council i.e. 2005-10, 2010-15 and 2015-20. Information was also sought on the total expenditure incurred on procurements during each of the three terms, and details of the outgoing councillors who have not handed over their respective mobile phones back to the council. Coutinho had also sought information about the details of returned mobile sets in possession of the council. During the course of the hearing, the first appellate authority had given the head clerk/store keeper several opportunities to furnish the information sought by the applicant. MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes, who is the first appellate authority under the RTI Act, passed the judgement and order on November 16 directing the head clerk/store keeper of the council to provide the information sought under RTI within a period of 10 days, “failing which she will be liable to pay a fine of Rs 250 per day.” “Every time a new council is formed, new mobile sets are purchased, which are to be returned to the council on the expiry of the term,” Coutinho said, explaining the purpose of seeking the RTI information. “Nobody, however, knows whether all the outgoing councillors have returned their mobile sets, and if returned, what happens to these sets thereafter. Whether old or new, the mobile sets are the asset/property of the council, and proper accountability is mandatory in this regard,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mmc-clerk-told-to-furnish-rti-info-or-pay-fine/articleshow/87857406.cms||---

An extra police force was called in to disperse the protesters and clear the highway. The semi-naked body of the girl was found in a cane field in the Barkhera area of Pilibhit district on November 13. Her family had alleged that she was gangraped and then strangled to death. Police had recovered a few beer bottles from the spot. After a week-long investigation, police claimed that the girl was killed by her boyfriend, a student of her school, on the suspicion that she was dating someone else as well. The boy was found in his house when police were searching for the missing girl. Defending the police investigation, Pilibhit SP Dinesh Kumar said, “The accused was booked after a thorough investigation. Our teams had collected scientific and circumstantial evidence which indicated that the boy killed the girl. He used to study with the girl in the same school, but the girl’s family separated them. We have recovered nearly 10 letters written by the girl and messages on the accused’s mobile make it clear that the couple had decided to meet on the fateful day.” “The accused’s coaching friends had told him that the girl was having an affair with someone else, which made him angry. Following which the girl had written a letter to him in a bid to clear the air. We have recovered that letter. When the girl met the accused on November 13, the accused in a fit of rage thrashed her and then strangled her to death. We have sent his mobile phone for a forensic test and will seek permission for the narco test,” he said. The SP added, “The protesters soon withdrew their protest and returned home when we informed them that the accused was arrested after collecting sufficient evidence and the case is still under investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/pilibhit-schoolgirl-rape-murder-ex-classmate-killed-her-claim-cops/articleshow/87856493.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Jaipur||Conman handed over to Mumbai police for extortion attempt on Kurla MLA||Alwar: In a joint operation, Bharatpur police along with Mumbai police on Monday arrested a conman for blackmailing Shiv Sena MLA from Mumbai’s Kurla assembly seat. The accused sent a message to the MLA posing as a woman, and later sent a vulgar and concocted video, which showed the MLA inappropriately. He finally started demanding money from the MLA. The conman threatened that if the MLA won’t pay him, he go public with the video. Senior police officials at Bharatpur said Mumbai police intimated them about the movement of Mausam Den, 28, a native of Sikari police station area, and told them how he had dialled the MLA of Shiv Sena and Mumbai and started blackmailing and extortion. "The conman had sent a message on October 20 to Mangesh Kudalkar, the MLA, and while introducing himself as a woman, he asked for some help from the MLA. Thus, the MLA was ready to help the conman. Thereafter, a woman made a video call to the victim and had a word for 15 seconds. After the call was disconnected, the conman sent a concocted video of the MLA, which was vulgar. Thereafter, the conman demanded Rs 5,000 from the MLA, which the latter deposited. The next day when again Rs 11,000 was demanded, the victim approached the Mumbai police," said Devendra Bishnoi, superintendent of police, Bharatpur told TOI. Thereafter, the cybercrime police in Mumbai and Kurla police station jointly traced down the number of the conman and intimated the Bharatpur police about his movement. "We first took him in custody and later handed him over to the Mumbai police, who arrested him," said a senior official of Sikari police station in Bharatpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/conman-handed-over-to-mumbai-police-for-extortion-attempt-on-kurla-mla/articleshow/87857313.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Kolkata||100% attendance for first ISC paper, students happy with MCQ||Kolkata: More than 2,500-odd students of Class XII took their ISC first-semester exam at nearly 200 schools in Kolkata on Monday, the first physical test held by CISCE after two years. The boards were cancelled last year and the results were drawn up on a formula. Most schools recorded 100% attendance for the English literature paper, with the test being held for one-and-a-half hours from 2pm. Though isolation rooms with nurses and doctors on call had been arranged for in several schools, those remained largely unused, said principals. Candidates wrote the correct options to MCQs in the question-cum-answer booklets that they submitted at the end of the exam. External examiners reached the venues on time to evaluate the scripts and upload the marks. Evaluation started at 4.30pm. Evaluation and uploading of marks went on till late on Monday, with some examiners leaving schools as late as 10pm. The format was new but candidates found the paper easy. “Initially I was nervous but once we got the paper, I could tackle it well. I have one request, can we use the washroom during the exam as it’s winter,” said Yu Chuen Chen, a candidate at AG Church School. “Our seniors could not appear for the board exams last year but we are in a better position,” said Craig David, head boy at St Thomas’ Boys’ School, Kidderpore. In most schools, auditoriums, gymnasiums and big libraries were used to seat candidates. At St Xavier’s Collegiate School, where 220 boys wrote the paper, two gymnasiums were used. Additional fans were used to keep interiors airy and cool. At Don Bosco Park Circus, 178 boys wrote the exam, while parents waited in the auditorium. Most of the 208 candidates at The Heritage School took school buses to the campus. Students felt MCQ made it easy for them. “We prepared according to online teaching. Writing a traditional exam would have been tougher,” said Navneet Varma, a candidate at St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar. Richard Gasper, principal at St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, said there was a possibility that in addition to indicating options in their answer booklets, candidates might write the answers. “They might write the right option but a wrong answer. How do evaluators tackle them?” Gasper said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/100-attendance-for-first-isc-paper-students-happy-with-mcq/articleshow/87856519.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Cops said that the victims, Lata Haldar and her mother Rekha were at home around 8pm when the accused, Somnath Niyogi alias Bappa (28), a wholesale dealer of vegetables, attacked them. The condition of Rekha was stated to be critical. Her husband Rabi, who was a taxi driver earlier, now operates a few vehicles himself. Cops have arrested Niyogi. “It seems that CESC had either not provided or cut off the electricity supply to the residence of the accused for some reason. The accused held the mother-daughter duo responsible for this and started threatening them recently. Though we have not found any relationship link to the case yet, we are yet to rule out that possibility,” said an officer. “The case was recorded on the basis of Rabi’s statement. The accused hit Lata with an iron rod and when her mother tried to save her, the accused also assaulted her on the head and hand with a chopper. After the incident, he fled from the spot.

The second government-approved vehicle scrapping and recycling centre has been set up by automobile major Maruti Suzuki, in collaboration with the Toyota Tsusho Group. It will have an initial capacity to dismantle around 2,000 vehicles per month and will be responsible for procuring and dismantling vehicles unfit to ply. The first facility, set up by Mahindra Accelo and MSTC Ltd, is operational in the city. The new facility by Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India (MSTI) becomes operational barely five months before the government’s voluntary scrapping policy kicks in. The road transport ministry has notified that all government vehicles that are more than 15 years of age will be scrapped. Sources said this will be the first batch of vehicles that will reach the scrapping centre. Subsequently, old and unfit commercial and private vehicles will also be phased out. The government aims to create more such facilities across the country so that people don’t have to travel long distance to find a scrapping centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ncr-to-get-2nd-vehicle-scrapping-facility-in-noida/articleshow/87857336.cms||---

Kumar was miraculously found alive by his kin in a mortuary freezer just seven hours after doctors at a district hospital in Moradabad pronounced him dead. He had been hit by a speeding motorbike. Doctors say Kumar has developed a blood clot in his head and he may require surgery in the future. Dr RC Gupta, principal, LLRM medical college, told TOI, "The condition of the patient is still critical and he is on ventilator support. We have put him under conservative treatment at the moment as it is not safe to operate because of a bleeding disorder." Sreekesh’s elder brother, Satyanand Gautam, a dentist, said, “We also do not want surgery at the moment because his body is still weak as a result of excessive blood loss. He has been given three units of blood so far. His vital organs are functioning normally at the moment and we are all praying for his recovery.” The family is yet to lodge a complaint against the district hospital staff for "negligence". Sreekesh, an electrician, is the youngest of five brothers and is married to one Rani. He was taken to a private hospital for treatment on Thursday night, where doctors said he had suffered an internal head injury. After treatment, doctors gave up and referred him to a higher centre. His kin brought him to the district hospital, where the doctor on duty pronounced him dead. They then bundled him into the mortuary freezer before a post-mortem could be done the next day. Nearly seven hours later, when a "panchnama" -- a document signed by family members after identifying the body and agreeing to an autopsy -- was to be filed, Kumar's sister-in-law, Madhu Bala, noticed that he was showing signs of movement. In a video that has now been widely shared on social media, an astounded Madhu Bala is heard exclaiming, "He's not at all dead, in fact, he's far from it! How did this happen? Look, he wants to say something, he is breathing." Other equally bewildered family members then crowded the body and asked for doctors and the police. His brother, Satyanand, said, “When we call his name, he responds, which is a positive sign that shows that some part of his brain is still responding. The only problem is that he is having a high fever and there is always the risk of an external infection as the body's immunity is low. Therefore, heavy antibiotics are being given to him." Moradabad’s chief medical superintendent, Dr Shiv Singh, had said that it could be a case of "suspended animation", where there is a temporary cessation of many vital organs without death, which could lead to extraordinary situations such as this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dead-man-who-was-found-alive-inside-mortuary-freezer-slips-into-coma/articleshow/87856530.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The money was demanded for clearing pending bills of the complainant involved in publicity work of auction at the council. ASP ACB Bajrang Singh, who headed the Jaipur’s team that had organised the trap said, “One Mohan Lal approached the bureau saying he is involved in the publicity work related to the upcoming auctions to be held at Alwar Nagar Parishad and many of his bills are pending.” Out of Rs 3.50 lakh that was demanded, he had already paid a bribe of Rs 1,10,000 and later handed over another Rs 20,000 at the time of verification of the complaint. “When he failed to cough up the rest of the bribe money, he approached us. First, we verified the complaint and following verification, a trap was laid in which the accused Bina Gupta, the chairperson, and her son Kuldip Gupta, were arrested for accepting a bribe of Rs 80,000,” Singh added. Following the arrests, ACB initiated searches at the residence of the chairperson and her son. “Searches are on to get more incriminating evidence and further recoveries related to the case,” said a senior officer. “It was found that the woman used to sign pending bills at her residence in Alwar and used to ask people to pay the bribe amount at her home,” Singh added. A case under appropriate section of Prevention of Corruption Act has been lodged against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-arrests-chairperson-of-alwars-municipal-council-with-her-son-for-accepting-a-bribe-of-rs-80000/articleshow/87857332.cms||---

Special judge Sunil Chaudhary noted that the conduct of the police officials created fear in the mind of the man about his arrest and forced him to approach the court, incurring expenses. It further noted no case had been registered against the man. The court noted that there was non-compliance with the directions of superior officers. The court said that on an earlier occasion, it had brought to the knowledge of the deputy commissioner of police (northeast) about the visits made by police officials to the houses of people without disclosing the purpose of such visits. The DCP then informed the court that a circular had been issued asking ACPs and SHOs to sensitise police officials. The judge said there was no sign of the compliance of the directions of the notice of the DCP in the reply filed by the police before it. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-no-reason-cited-for-calling-man-to-police-stn/articleshow/87857340.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The lecturer is absconding and police have launched a manhunt to nab him. The woman, who was allegedly sexually assaulted for months after she went to his house with a friend, in her complaint wrote that the lecturer "forces students to take psychotropic substances and have sex with him, and sometimes even with others". She also mentioned the names of other students. The student met the Pilibhit SP on Sunday and an FIR was registered under IPC sections 294 (obscene acts), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Her statement was recorded at the Kotwali police station under section 161 CrPC. She will be sent for medico-legal examination on Tuesday and then produced before a magistrate for her statement under 164 CrPC. Levelling serious allegations against her college lecturer, the woman informed police that he used to call students to his house where he kept obscene literature and sex toys, and force them to smoke narcotic substances. She also alleged that he is on "good terms with the senior management of the college". SHO of Kotwali police station Sadaqat Ali said, “We will contact other students of the college mentioned in the FIR to collect more evidence. The accused is at large and we will seek the magistrate’s permission to take legal steps against him.” SP Dinesh Kumar said, “The allegations were serious and we immediately ordered an FIR. If any other student comes forward with her complaint, we will certainly include it in the investigation.” When contacted, the college principal said, "The student had never made any complaint against the lecturer. I wish she had come to us earlier. We would have taken action. We will talk to other students individually to know the conduct of the lecturer. We have also written to the director to launch a departmental inquiry against him. This is the first such complaint against him since he got transferred to Pilibhit. He did not attend classes on Monday."

The panel, headed by BJP MP P P Chaudhary, did not concede recommendations by some members that the Centre should not have “unbridled powers” to exempt any government agency from the purview of the privacy laws and this remains the case in the draft that was finally adopted.

---||Ahmedabad||Cong leaders meet guv on drug menace||Gandhinagar: Gujarat Congress leaders on Monday met governor Acharya Devvrat at Raj Bhavan in Gandhinagar and demanded strict actions to stop the drug menace in the state even as there have been a number of drug seizures in the past few months in the state. Alleging laxity in the ongoing probe into seizure of drugs at various places in Gujarat, the Congress on Monday demanded setting up of an inquiry commission under a sitting high court judge to investigate these cases, including the seizure of 2,988kg of heroin at the Mundra port. The opposition party handed over a memorandum of its demands to the governor. Congress leaders alleged that although heroin and other contraband worth thousands of crores have been seized from different parts of Gujarat in recent months, the BJP government was not taking any “concrete action” against the entire racket as those in the government are “hand in glove” with the perpetrators. In the memorandum, the opposition party cited the seizure of nearly 3,000kg of heroin worth Rs 21,000 crore at the Mundra port in September, followed by the recovery of heroin and meth worth over Rs 1,000 crore by the Gujarat police and the ATS this month. Congress demanded strict action to “control the drugs network” to save the next generation, claiming that drugs are being sold “openly” on college campuses across Gujarat. Gujarat minister of state for home, Harsh Sanghavi, had refuted these charges claiming that the seizure of such a large quantity of drugs proves that the police and other agencies are doing their work with commitment, as the contraband was unearthed before it reached the masses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-leaders-meet-guv-on-drug-menace/articleshow/87856557.cms||---

He heard the problems of the autorickshaw drivers, who said for the first time any chief minister had come to them. The CM, who was accompanied by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, had tea and mathi with them while sitting on a wooden bench. Addressing the drivers, Channi said, “Today, I have come to meet my family, which includes autorickshaw drivers, rehri and rickshaw-pullers. My father had a tent house and I used to drive his rickshaw. If any rival party doubts my claim, their leader can come and have a rickshaw race with me. I have come here along with others to end the ‘dhakkeshahi’ (atrocities) on you. All your genuine demands will be met.” Channi announced that new registration certificates would be issued to them soon to end all harassment and all the pending challans would be waived. He also asked the autorickshaw drivers to follow traffic rules and work honestly. He accepted their demand to draw a yellow line exclusively for plying autorickshaws.At the venue of Channi’s rally at Dana Mandi, Gill Road, the woman who had filed a rape case against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains tried to meet the CM, but claimed that the police stopped her. She then stood outside the entry gate with a poster, asking for Bains’s arrest. Speaking to the mediapersons, she said, “It has been a year that I am fighting against the atrocities committed by Bains, but no action has been taken against him as the Congress is sheltering him. I am sure that the court will rule in my favour and punish the MLA and his associates. I came here in the hope of meeting the CM and to ask him why Bains was being shielded. But the police did not allow me to meet him.”Slogans against CMSeveral members of PAU contract and DPL association shouted slogans against the CM when his motorcade was passing from the university after he alighted from a helicopter there. In another protest against Channi, dozens of municipal corporation workers, especially sewer cleaners and watchmen, gathered at Ghanta Ghar Chowk and burnt his effigy. The protesters working on a temporary basis demanded permanent jobs. They alleged that they wanted to meet the CM, but were not allowed. President of safai karamchari union Chaudhary Yashpal and Youth Akali Dal district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha were leading this protest and they warned that if by Tuesday their demands were not met, they would lock the gates of the MC office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/channi-sips-tea-with-auto-drivers-hears-their-woes/articleshow/87855783.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BCCI takes away Cricket Association of Uttarakhand’s voting rights after complaints of infighting, reinstates them later||Dehradun: Amid high drama, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday reinstated the Cricket Association of Uttarakhand's (CAU's) voting rights after having initially taken them away for an upcoming election in Mumbai on December 4. The BCCI had earlier removed CAU's name from the electoral list after complaints were made by a CAU member alleging "irregularities" in choosing the state cricket body's representative for the polls. "Nomination by CAU was kept in abeyance for disposal of objections. The scrutiny of objections has been completed and (they) have been disposed of," the BCCI said after reinstating the state cricket body's voting rights. The voting rights are for elections that will take place to choose two members of the IPL Governing Council (IPL GC) who will represent the state associations. Normally, each state association sends a representative to cast a vote. BCCI’s electoral officer, A K Joti, had earlier released a list of the electoral roll on November 21, in which the CAU’s representative was not mentioned. Elaborating about this omission, CAU member, Prithvi Singh Negi, said, “I saw the draft electoral roll on November 18, in which the CAU secretary, Mahim Verma, was mentioned to represent our association in the election for the IPL GC. However, there was no resolution passed by us to make him the CAU representative. Therefore, on November 20, I emailed my objections to the BCCI electoral officer, in which I mentioned this violation of rules,” said Negi, who was earlier the CAU treasurer and is currently fighting a civil suit against the body for having removed him arbitrarily. Responding to allegations, Sanjay Gusain, spokesperson of CAU, said, "It is very sad that some people are not allowing cricket in the state to move forward. The CAU is not the personal property of anybody and we are working for the betterment of the sport. It is important that one of our members represents CAU at the BCCI, otherwise, we won't be able to put our point of view forward." The CAU has found itself involved in several controversies during a very short period. The association was granted affiliation by the BCCI in 2019. Since then, it has had a fair share of controversies. Earlier this year, the then Uttarakhand head coach Wasim Jaffer had resigned, citing ‘undue interference’ of CAU’s top office bearers in the team selection. Jaffer was then accused of communal practices which later led to office-bearers divided into two camps on the issue. Last month, CAU vice-president Sanjay Rawat had alleged malpractices and lack of transparency in the association. Insiders say that it is this spate of infighting among elected office- bearers that had led to the snatching of voting rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bcci-takes-away-cricket-association-of-uttarakhands-voting-rights-after-complaints-of-infighting-reinstates-them-later/articleshow/87855788.cms||Mohammad Anab

Police claimed they have increased security measures and were keeping vigil through CCTV cameras. Ajmer police on Monday arrested three persons for stealing ornaments and purses in crowded places. Police are interrogating them to know about more such crimes. According to DSP Priyanka Raghuvanshi, a case of stealing money from the purse of woman was registered in Civil Lines police station. Acting on the report, police arrested Monu (29), a resident of Alwar, Rakesh (35), a resident of Binauli of Uttar Pradesh, and Suresh (23), a resident of Alwar district. Police also seized Rs 93,000, a mobile and a car from their possession. The gang used to search for victims in crowded places and then steal their purses, money and other things from parked cars. In another incident, Rukhsana, a resident of Ramganj, said she and her sister had gone shopping for their daughter’s marriage with Rs 23,000 and some gold in an auto. When they stepped down and opened her purse to pay, it was empty. The money and ornaments were all gone. Ramganj police registered a case and are investigating. Similarly, Chandresh Verma, a resident of Pancheel and a retired principal, boarded a tempo to purchase items from a market. When she stepped down near Guru Nanak School, she found that her purse containing Rs 20,000 was stolen.

The day's slide was also on the back of Dalal Street's increasing fears about raging inflation globally, selling by foreign funds and rising new Covid-19 infections in some parts of Europe, stoking fears that the same could affect the current economic growth revival process globally. The day's loss was the biggest for the index in over six months. Banking and financial stocks also contributed to the slide while Bharti Airtel rallied to close nearly 4% up after it raised tariffs by up to 25%. Investors, however, are a divided lot if the government's decision to repeal the three farm bills could impact domestic business or not. The sharp sell-off also pushed to the background a report by SBI on GDP growth.  The report by SBI pegged India's GDP growth during the July-September quarter, to be released on November 30, at 8.1% while for fiscal 2022 it's estimated at 9.3% to 9.6%. During the day's session, foreign funds led the slide while domestic funds supported the market. At the close of session, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) recorded a Rs 3,439-crore net selling figure while domestic institutions were net buyers at Rs 2,051 crore, BSE data showed. Of the 30 sensex constituents, 27 ended in the red. The day's sell-off also left investors poorer by nearly Rs 6 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation now at Rs 264 lakh crore. The sell-off also left investors more cautious with the India VIX, the volatility index that's also considered a gauge of fear in the market, rising by 17.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-slides-on-aramco-deal-review-triggers-1170-point-sensex-crash/articleshow/87858384.cms||---

On October 17, a drone was spotted by a patrolling team over the reserve’s Garjiya area. Following the incident, frontline workers and intelligence teams were put on alert as it was felt that unknown drones may compromise the safety of over 230 resident tigers, hundreds of leopards and elephants of the reserve along with its rich timber forests. However, till date, neither could the drone’s owner be traced nor did anyone come forward claiming its ownership. Recently, the authorities even got a notice published in a local newspaper, asking the owner of the drone to come forward but the effort didn’t bear any result. A case has been lodged in the matter against unknown persons under the Wildlife Protection Act and Indian Forest Act. Rahul (who goes by his first name), director, Corbett Tiger Reserve, told TOI, “The guidelines laid down by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) stipulate that flying drones over the tiger reserve is not to be allowed as it compromises the security of wild animals. Instructions have been given to resort owners and locals in and around the reserve to not use drones without permission for filming or movie-making purposes either.” He pointed out that the sound of a drone disturbs the wildlife, which is why the decision was taken to bring down any such unidentified object. “We have specialised instruments that can control the wings of drones and shoot them down. Going by DGCA guidelines and state norms, we will track down such unapproved UAVs hovering over the park,” added Rahul. Notably, another such unclaimed drone was found at Kalagarh Tiger Reserve of Corbett last year as well. The owner of that drone has also not been identified as of yet. The repeated occurrences have aggravated the concerns of wildlife authorities. “For the safety of wildlife, we don’t want any sensitive information going out of Corbett. Today, poachers and smugglers have gone hi-tech. We have to protect the massive biodiversity-rich reserve from them,” added the CTR director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/unidentified-drones-flying-over-corbett-to-be-shot-down-says-park-admin/articleshow/87855799.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Nagpur||Fadnavis hails Bawankule’s nomination, Tawde’s appointment||Nagpur: Leader of opposition in assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, on Monday hailed the new roles awarded by BJP top brass in Delhi to his former state ministers — Vinod Tawde and Chandrashekhar Bawankule. While Tawde was elevated as party’s national general secretary, Bawankule was offered ticket for MLC polls from Nagpur to replace incumbent Girish Vyas. Both were denied ticket by the central leadership during the 2019 assembly polls, creating ripples across the party’s state cadre. They were senior ministers in the Fadnavis cabinet and favourites to retain seats from their respective constituencies. The reasons for their exclusion along with few others, despite strong recommendations from party’s Maharashtra unit, are still a mystery. Speaking to media along with Bawankule outside collector’s office, Fadnavis said he was delighted to see him make a come back to the legislature polls after being away for two years. “He really worked very hard during his tenure as a minister. He actually proved how a public representative should work for the people. He worked wonders as party’s general secretary in the last one year. I think today’s event (of filing nomination papers) is a reward for all his hard work till date.” The former CM and southwest Nagpur MLA further said that under Gadkari’s guidance, the BJP will record a landslide win in the December 10 polls. He, however, refused to comment on senior BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar’s switch to Congress after being sidelined for the MLC polls. Terming Tawde’s elevation as a proud moment for Maharashtra, Fadnavis wished him all the best. “I think he is probably the third person from the state to be appointed on the coveted post after Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde,” said Fadnavis. In October 2019 assembly polls, the BJP central leadership had also denied tickets to seniors like its chief whip in assembly Raj Purohit, formers ministers Eknath Khadse, Prakash Mehta and others. About 19 MLAs were dropped from the list, which the BJP netas blamed for reduction in party’s tally from 122 in 2014 polls to 105 in 2019. According to BJP netas, the rehabilitation of both Tawde and Bawankule was planned keeping an eye on the forthcoming civic elections next year. Former education minister Tawde hails from Maratha community while Bawankule, the former energy and excise minister, is a Teli. Both communities have a sizeable chunk of voters in the state. After denial of tickets, their supporters protested against the then Fadnavis government, thus adversely affecting BJP’s vote bank. After Bawankule was denied ticket, his wife’s name did the rounds, but the party leadership refused to offer her AB form and preferred Tekchand Sawarkar. For Tawde, who was MLA from Borivali in Mumbai, the elevation is important considering the fact the BJP was eyeing a win in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections against its friend-turned-foe Shiv Sena, as per the BJP netas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fadnavis-hails-bawankules-nomination-tawdes-appointment/articleshow/87855820.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Major Dhoundiyal’s wife, Lieutenant Nitika Kaul and mother, Saroj Dhoundiyal, received the award, which is the third in order of precedence of peacetime gallantry awards after Ashoka Chakra and Kirti Chakra, at a ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan. Major Dhoundiyal, who hailed from Dehradun, was commissioned in the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers and was serving with 55 Rashtriya Rifles in Kashmir at the time of the encounter, which happened barely 10 months after his marriage. Lieutenant Nitika, who was working with a multinational company at the time, had vowed to join the Army and serve the country after her husband's death. She was commissioned as an officer after passing out from the Officers Training Academy at Chennai in May last year. Meanwhile, the late Major's friends in Dehradun said that it was a moment of great pride for them. Mayank Khanduri, a city-based businessman, who studied with him at St Joseph’s Academy, said, “We used to look forward to the time when Vibhuti would come home on leave, and tell us about his life in the Army. Today, he may not be physically present with us, but he is there in our hearts.” Recalling the time spent together, he added, "Our families stayed right next to each other at Rajpur road.

---||Ludhiana||‘Will forged’, 5 of family among 7 booked for cheating||Ludhiana: The police on Sunday booked seven people, including five of a family, for cheating and criminal conspiracy. It is alleged that the accused forged a will to grab a property and fraudulently collected Rs 8 lakh as its rent. The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of Balwinder Singh, 61, of Aman Nagar, Salem Tabri, against Avtar Singh, his wife Rajinder Kaur of Ambala, brothers-in-law Bakhshish Singh, Satpal Singh, Keval Singh of Moti Nagar and accomplices Puran Singh of Shimlapuri and Sucha Singh of GK Estate, Chandigarh Road. The complaint was filed on October 17, 2018, and an inquiry was marked to the additional commissioner of police (crime). Balwinder said, “My son Amritpal Singh got married to Maninder Kaur, daughter of Avtar and Rajinder, on September 19, 2010. The couple has a daughter. I purchased a 304 square feet plot in Dhandari Kalan in the name of Amritpal on June 5, 2013, which was given on rent to a factory owner.” On February 26, 2016, Amritpal died a natural death. “Thereafter, Maninder and her daughter were living with us. On November 14, 2016, Maninder died in a road accident. However, her father Avtar got an FIR lodged against me, my wife and daughter for murdering Maninder. He alleged that we killed Maninder to get a share in the plot. Avtar also alleged that we were harassing Maninder to give us a share in the plot,” he added. The police had arrested Balwinder, his wife and daughter in the case and they were lodged in jail. In October 2018, when Balwinder and his wife came out on bail, they found all household goods missing from their home. “Later, we also came to know that the accused have forged the will of Amritpal to grab the plot. The accused also rented out the property and collected Rs 8 lakh in rent,” he said.Balwinder said, “As per the records of the sub-registrar office (east), the accused got Amritpal’s will related to the plot registered on May 23, 2016. We have demanded an FIR against the accused and cancelation of the murder case against us.”Moti Nagar police station sub-inspector Balveer Singh said after the inquiry by ADCP (crime), the police have registered a case against the accused under sections 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. “It is being probed how the will was registered after Amritpal’s death. The family has also accused the staff of revenue office of helping the accused. More sections could be added in the FIR after investigation,” the sub-inspector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/will-forged-5-of-family-among-7-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/87855823.cms||---

And if all goes as per the government plan, there would be one bullet train running at top speed of 300 kmph every hour from Delhi to Agra and Agra to Delhi by 2029-30. The entire corridor will be a mix of elevated stretches and tunnels considering the corridor safety requirement. It would have 12 stations and would link all major religious places including Mathura, Ayodhya, Prayagraj and Varanasi. There would be an underground station at Jewar airport as well. The total project cost is estimated at Rs 2.28 lakh crore and getting finance would be crucial for execution of the mammoth project. According to the DPR prepared by the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHRSCL), which is implementing the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project, the bullet trains would make 63 trips in a day between Delhi and Agra; 43 trips per day between Delhi and Lucknow; 18 trips daily between Delhi and Varanasi. In the case of Ayodhya, the DPR has estimated 11 trips per day. Currently, it takes around 11-12 hours to reach Varanasi from Delhi by train. The proposed bullet train would reduce this journey time to barely three hours. The high speed rail connectivity to Varanasi, the heart of eastern Uttar Pradesh, is crucial considering that the current regime has is focusing on changing the profile of Purvanchal by creating world class infrastructure. This move also gains importance as the government makes efforts to place Ayodhya on the world tourism map and high speed connectivity will be a catalyst to bring tourists to the holy city. TOI on January 16 had reported that the one-way fare to Ayodhya from Delhi by the proposed high speed (bullet) train would cost less than travel by air.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-bullet-train-every-60-mins-from-delhi-agra-by-2029-30/articleshow/87857367.cms||Dipak K Dash

And in case they provide job work to any person not registered under GST, then 18% tax will be applicable. On November 18, the ministry of finance had issued a notification in this regard. At the time it had also issued a notification for an increase in the GST rate on fabrics and garments from 5% to 12%. Enraged, businessmen have given a call to gherao the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 25. Naveen Thaman, a tax professional, said, “In a move to stop refund of accumulated input tax credit (ITC) on account of GST being higher on inputs than finished goods, the GST council increased it on service of job work of dyeing or printing of textile and textile products from January 1. Earlier, all types of job work related to textile and its products attracted 5% GST. Whether it was dyeing of yarn and fabrics or printing of fabrics and garments, the taxpayers were entitled to a refund of accumulated ITC as inputs for these job works—like dyes, chemicals and packing material—had an 18% GST, while these job works attracted 5% GST. Therefore, an ITC of 13% was claimed back. Now, if these job works are performed for assessees registered under GST, then rate will be 12% else 18%.” Thaman said, “From January 1, these job workers will not be entitled for refund of accumulated ITC. However, there will be no change in GST for other job works, like washing, stitching and embroidery, and it will continue to be 5%. Though the GST council has taken these steps to keep rate of tax for one industry same and to discourage fake billing for taking refunds, the charges for dyeing and printing will go up, leading to an increase in rates of garments for consumers.”Industrialist Tarun Jain Bawa, who is national president of Bharatiya Arthik Party (BAP), said, “The decision to increase GST by 7% is a ploy to destroy small units that are already struggling. But we are not going to accept these cruel acts of the Centre and have decided that thousands of businessmen will gherao the residence of PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi on November 25.”Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME Association, said, “We feel cheated and humiliated. We were not consulted by the Centre before going ahead with the decision to increase GST to 12% from 5% on our end products and raw materials. Moreover, the notification has come as a sudden shock as no one knew about it till now. We came to know about it through the Times of India. It is our request to the Centre not to go ahead with this hike.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-shocked-as-dyeing-printing-job-work-gst-hiked-to-12-from-5/articleshow/87855847.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Dehradun||Despite improvement in Swachh Survekshan ranking, Doon residents continue to face poor waste management issue, piles of garbage at several spots in city||Dehradun: In an improvement over its 124th rank last year, Dehradun secured the 82nd rank in the Centre’s Swachh Survekshan index this year. However, several residents and city-based social groups say that the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) is yet to find a solution to issues like littering and garbage accumulation on the road. They add that garbage dumps on roadsides are also a common sight in the state capital. Several areas like Subhash Road, Tibetan market and Old Rajpur have open garbage dumps where strays and monkeys can be seen rummaging through the waste. “Unauthorised waste dumping points at roadsides have become a common sight across the city. Despite the dumpsters, garbage is often found littered around them, making the stretch unhygienic. Both authorities and residents follow a callous approach towards waste management in the city. Similarly, sanitary standards are not maintained at public restrooms around the city,” said Abhishek Vats, a Dalanwala resident. Some experts even believe that an improvement in the Swachh Survekshan ranking doesn’t present the accurate sanitation condition of the city. “The parameters of the survey are very different from what defines a clean city. We have a serious problem because the waste is not being segregated properly. There is so much organic waste that can easily be composted at the level of resident welfare associations but no such initiatives are being taken in the city. If you go towards Maldevta, Thano, or even the Rajpur Road, garbage dumping along the roadside becomes a very common sight,” said Naveen Sadana, member of Waste Warriors, an NGO working in the area of effective waste management. Residents also allege that door-to-door garbage collection is irregular in several localities despite the DMC hiring three private agencies to collect daily household waste. Reacting to the issue, senior health officer, RK Singh, told TOI, “We are working to solve all these problems by taking several new initiatives. We are committed towards making Dehradun more clean and green.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/despite-improvement-in-swachh-survekshan-ranking-doon-residents-continue-to-face-poor-waste-management-issue-piles-of-garbage-at-several-spots-in-city/articleshow/87855867.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Nagpur||Slain top Maoist Milind Teltumbde was keen to surrender but talks failed: Police||NAGPUR: Milind Teltumbde, the slain Central Committee (CC) member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), had a chance to receive a cheque of around Rs25 lakh, a special tailor-made rehabilitation plan and other facilities to join the mainstream had the talks with the police for his surrender materialized. Instead, on November 13, he died in an encounter in the Mardintola forest in Gadchiroli from where his bullet-ridden body was recovered. Earlier this year, negotiations had went on between Teltumbde and police department for a couple of months to adopt Maharashtra government’s ‘surrender policy’. The talks had began with initiative of the then addl SP, Deori (Gondia), Atul Kulkarni. DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil, too had supported the efforts. The plan was to get Teltumbde, also in-charge of the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone, surrender in front of a heavyweight minister in Nagpur. It’s learnt, Teltumbde’s health had started falling and he had some differences with the CPI Maoist’s decision-makers after some of his financial powers were curtailed. This prompted Teltumbde, who was the brain behind pushing the concept of ‘Urban Maoism’, to lay down arms. Sources said Teltumbde’s bodyguards, who are hardcore Maoists from Chhattisgarh, and his close aides were against their senior leader abandoning the movement, said the sources. “Teltumbde was passing through Gondia to reach his den at Kanha national park when we had initiated the talks. After the talks failed, he returned to their base camp at Abhujmadh. It was on his way back from Abhujmadh to Kanha that he was cornered and killed,” said a police source. Patil, who was keen that the senior Maoist cadre surrenders, said every efforts were made to make Teltumbde feel at ease and safe. “Besides the humanitarian angle behind saving a life, there was a thought that eliminating someone also buries secrets, information and other valuable inputs from him or her forever. Police and Teltumbde could have mutually gained so much had he accepted the surrender scheme,” said Patil. The DIG said Teltumbde felt the surrender scheme was a trap to kill him in a fake encounter. “We had asked Teltumbde to surrender before the collector instead of police or even a minister or MLA. A best friend of Teltumbde, whom he trusted the most, was also engaged,” said Patil adding that a forest department personnel was the go-between Teltumbde and police. Addl SP Kulkarni said the negotiators would meet Teltumbde at his dens to discuss the surrender. It’s learnt, Gadchiroli police was closely monitoring Teltumbde’s movements escorted by formations like Vistar platoon, Company 4 and 10 and Gatta local guerilla squad. The close surveillance led to the encounter along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/milind-teltumbde-was-keen-to-surrender-but-talks-failed-police/articleshow/87856599.cms||Soumitra Bose

According to the complainant, he booked the service of the band on August 5, 2017. As per the booking, it was to provide services of band with 16 players and a master as well as eight fancy light, one ghori and a chhatri for the wedding function of his son on September 21, 2017, from 7pm at a marriage palace. The opposite party assured that the band would reach the venue on the given time. The band was to be paid Rs 21,000 for the services. A sum of Rs 6,000 was paid as advance. However, on the scheduled day, it neither provided the services nor intimated the complainant about it. “Due to its irresponsible behaviour, we suffered humiliation as well as tension and agony. The baraat (marriage party) reached the venue without lights, ghori and chhatri. When we sought back the advance of Rs 6,000, the opposite party refused to pay it,” he added. It was requested that the band be directed to refund Rs 6,000 along with interest at 18% per annum and made to pay compensation of Rs 5,00,000 and litigation expenses of Rs 20,000.The opposite party claimed in a written statement that as per the settled terms and conditions, 50% of the amount was to be paid at the time of booking and the remaining when the baraat was to enter the marriage palace and the total amount payable was Rs 26,000.The commission said the plea is contrary to the receipt wherein the total charge is Rs 21,000. “There is further no mention that 50% payment was to be made in advance. Rather in the receipt, as stated above, the advance is mentioned at Rs 6,000 which was duly paid to the opposite party. Therefore, the plea raised by the opposite party that the total amount payable was Rs 26,000 or 50% was to be paid as advance does not appear to be tenable,” the commission observed.The opposite party claimed that 16 persons of the band came at PAU gate, Ferozepur Road, opposite a restaurant in Ludhiana, and were present up to 9.30pm, but neither the complainant nor anybody on his behalf came and contacted them, as a result they had to return empty-handed and the remaining payment of Rs 20,000 was also not paid to them.The commission held that even this plea raised on behalf of opposite party doesn’t sound correct. The commission observed that it is evident from photographs that marriage was solemnised on the appointed date… but the opposite party or his men did not turn up. “Therefore, the plea raised by the opposite party that 16 persons consisting the band remained present opposite PAU gate, Ferozepur Road, Ludhiana, does not appear to be correct,” the commission held.The commission in its order said, “Due to the non-appearance of the opposite party and his men at the marriage function, it can be well imagined how embarrassing and humiliating it would have been for the complainant and his family as the band and ghori did not turn up which are an essential part of the marriage celebrations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-band-baaja-with-baraat-consumer-forum-takes-note/articleshow/87855871.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Dehradun||Repeal of farm laws accelerates pushback against Char Dham Devasthanam Board||Dehradun: Since December 2019, the priests of Char Dham shrines have been on protest mode against the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act, which has brought over 50 temples including the Char Dham shrines, under the state government’s control. The Char Dham priests have a sizable population in 17 assembly seats of Garhwal region. The announcement to withdraw the farm laws has motivated them to accelerate their agitation to repeal the Board. On Monday, the core committee of the Char Dham priests’ association held a meeting in Dehradun to chalk out their strategy. In view of the aggressive attitude of the priests, sources claimed that the ruling BJP would not want to lose a significant chunk of the electorate in the Garhwal seats and therefore, a proposal to repeal the Act may get a nod in the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday. While authorities remained tight-lipped, sources said there was a strong possibility of the cabinet giving a nod to the proposal or a decision was likely in the two-day assembly session commencing December 7. “In a situation similar to the protests over farm laws, the priests have remained adamant and the attempts by the government to convince them fell flat. With elections round the corner, a decision on the issue is likely soon,” a source said. Members of Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hakhakookdhari Mahapanchayat held a meeting at Agrawal Dharmshala on Monday. Sharing the details of the meeting, Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson, said, “As the Uttarakhand cabinet had passed the proposal for the Board on November 27, 2019, the priests have decided to observe it as a black day.” He pointed out that two key decisions were taken in the meeting.  “The first was to hold a protest outside the residence of ministers in the Yamuna Colony area of Dehradun on November 23. Secondly, we will take out an Aakrosh rally in Dehradun on November 27,” Sati said, adding that an assurance had been given by a minister to withdraw the Board by November 30. “If the law is not repealed by November 30, we will be forced to step up our protest. The Board was created without our consent and we will continue to oppose the Act till justice is done to us,” said Sati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/repeal-of-farm-laws-accelerates-pushback-against-char-dham-devasthanam-board/articleshow/87855878.cms||Kautilya Singh

The insolvency proceedings against real estate company Jaypee Infratech was initiated way back in 2017 but it could not be finalised due to various reasons and multiple rounds of litigations in tribunal and SC. The apex court in March directed that fresh proposal be sought to take over the debt ridden company and directed that the proceedings be wrapped up in 45 days. The resolution plan of Suraksha ARC and NBCC were put to vote before the committee of creditors (CoC) on June 23, and the plan of Suraksha was approved. The approved plan was then placed before NCLT on June 07 for its approval but the case got adjourned multiple times and it is still pending before the tribunal. Seeking the SC's interference, a batch of homebuyers approached SC through advocate Shashank Manish and pleaded the bench that the process be expedited as they are suffering for a prolonged period and have been running from pillar to post for a house after investing their life savings. "It is humbly submitted that the delay in disposal of the case by the NCLT is causing serious prejudice to the Applicant/Appellant and is also affecting their rights. The NCLT is acting in a casual manner and is adjourning the matter several times without following the directions given by this Court to take final decision expeditiously in terms of Section 31 of the Code upon submission of report by the IRP," the petition said. Allowing their plea, the court directed the tribunal to decide the issue expeditiously within two months. After holding extensive hearings and considering the plea of all stakeholders, the top court in March had directed the interim resolution professional to complete the proceedings within 45 days.

---||India||Launch of national scheme soon for rehabilitation of beggars||NEW DELHI: Strongly hinged on the idea of dealing with beggary as a social problem and not looking at it as a criminal act, the Centre is now preparing to soon roll out a national scheme for comprehensive rehabilitation of beggars. While a 10-city pilot project is already in progress to create grassroot-level outreach, the ministry of social justice and empowerment's comprehensive scheme on rehab for beggars is part of the "Support for Marginalised Individual Livelihood and Enterprise Scheme" that will also include a separate scheme for welfare of transgender persons. Under the scheme, the ministry will call upon states to share their proposals to support on-ground outreach in select cities and municipal areas to identify and rehabilitate beggars. In a bid to enable a long-term solution, the ministry is also working on a draft bill to make way for a model central legislation that would offer a rehabilitation framework to enable main-streaming of beggars, destitutes and homeless persons. It is learnt that the ministry is working on finalising a draft which can be suitably adapted by states and UTs and will provide a framework for care, protection, shelter, welfare and rehabilitation mechanism. The comprehensive rehab scheme for beggars is the government's way to scale up the outreach on proactive rehabilitation beyond the ongoing 10-city pilot for which Rs 19 crore was allocated. An amount of Rs 100 crore has been earmarked for the project for a 5-year period and the ministry will call for proposals from states and municipal bodies. The components that will be supported under the scheme include a survey to identify those involved in begging, followed by mobilisation, rescue and linkages with available shelter homes, welfare schemes, identity documents and complete resettlement which will be enabled through education for children and skill development and training for adults. The ministry is running pilot projects in Indore, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Delhi, Nagpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. Recently Delhi released survey data under the pilot to say that there are 20,700 people involved in begging and put the estimated numbers to be higher at around 28000. The state government has prepared a skilling and rehab roadmap. Indore too has completed the survey and identified more than 2500 beggars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/launch-of-national-scheme-soon-for-rehabilitation-of-beggars/articleshow/87858414.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Jaipur||Executing budget decisions is Rajasthan new health minister’s priority||JAIPUR: Newly appointed health minister Parsadi Lal Meena is well-aware of the priorities and challenges he may face at the helm of the affairs of his department. Meena replaced Raghu Sharma in the cabinet reshuffle. “My first priority will be to implement and execute the budget announcement in health sector,” Meena told TOI. Meena became the health minister at a time when the department is making efforts to make Chiranjeevi Health Insurance Scheme a major success and also for setting up janta clinics across the state. He said his priorities would be on proper execution of budget announcements, implementation of health schemes, strengthening of healthcare services and on prevention, control and management of Covid. Among the challenges that the new minister might face is Covid containment as the city has now started witnessing marginal spike in cases. It is currently struggling to scale up the vaccination drive, which has lost steam in the recent past. Meena is aware about the fear of the third wave of the pandemic. “Since Covid is a major issue to tackle, I will put efforts to deal with it effectively,” said Meena. Meena is known for bringing transformation and execution and implementation of policies of the state government. Before he got the responsibility of the health department, he was with the industry ministry and for giving impetus to the industry sector, he was working on a plan to set up industrial areas in every block of the state by the end of 2022. Now, he has set his aim for further improving healthcare infrastructure. “My goal will be to ensure people getting proper healthcare facilities,” he said. Over the past few months, the health department has done a progress in improving healthcare facilities including setting up oxygen generation plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/executing-budget-decisions-is-new-health-ministers-priority/articleshow/87857412.cms||---

Some sections of people were vehemently opposed to the flyover, calling it an unscientific project.Ashok Shettar, Vice-Chancellor of KLE Technological University and a member of the experts committee, told TOI that the committee spent more than a month studying the project and interacting with citizens, technicians, and other stakeholders to prepare the report.Following our study, we came to the conclusion that a flyover is required for the city to end the increasing traffic chaos. Three of the seven existing arms are now performing at an over-service level. More than 168 traffic conflict points were found in the seven arms that connect to KC Circle, where accidents are common. It can be reduced by 75% if we build a flyover. The city is currently experiencing traffic congestion, and the situation is expected to worsen over the next five to ten years. During peak hours from 6pm to 7 pm, approximately 16,000 vehicles will pass through KC Circle, which will more than double in the next five years. Taking all of these factors into account, we have recommended constructing a flyover, he added.The committee also recommended that BRTS Hosur, HDMC, and the Old Bus Terminal be relocated to ensure the smooth implementation and operation of the proposed flyover. For the convenience of people commuting between Hubballi and Dharwad, the BRTS Hosur terminal should be relocated near the IT Park. A BRTS terminal can be built 300 metres away from the current location.It was proposed in the previous plan to build a flyover from Ambedkar Circle to KC circle, but our committee has recommended building a flyover from Hosur Junction to Koppikar Road, which will save money spent on acquiring 450 metres and will provide proper connectivity to Koppikar Road and other market areas. We also recommended developing Vijayapura Road, which connects to the KC Circle, and widening service roads at Desai Circle from 3.5 metres to 5.5 metres, as well as beautifying traffic lots, providing parking for KC Circle shopkeepers, and providing electric charging points at Gadag, Vijaypura, and Gokul roads. The district administration will forward this final report to the state government, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/flyover-is-a-must-for-city-says-expert-panel/articleshow/87855129.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

Last month, NMPML, the public transport wing of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), had requested HAL to allow its buses to stop at the airport terminal premises for some time so that air travellers reaching the Nashik Airport can avail the bus service. NMPML has started buses to Mohadi via Nashik Airport with frequency of 30 minutes. Currently, the buses are stopping at the main entrance gate of the airport terminal building. The distance between the main gate and the airport terminal building is about 200 m. It would be inconvenient for the passengers to reach the airport building with luggage if they get down from the bus at the main gate. Hence, NMPML wanted HAL to allow its buses to enter the airport premises. HAL sources said the Nashik Airport comes under the ‘sensitive airport’ category and hence buses cannot be allowed inside the airport premises. Nashik already has air connectivity with cities like Delhi, Indore, Belgavi, Ahmedabad, Surat and Pune. Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, along with other two private airlines are operating flights from Nashik airport. The footfall of Nashik airport has already increased to 7,000 passengers a month amid the pandemic situation. Around 230 passengers are either departing or arriving at the Nashik airport daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/hal-turns-down-nmpml-proposal-to-allow-buses-to-enter-airport-terminal/articleshow/87855133.cms||Tushar Pawar

Instead, it has given birth to myriad unanticipated problems, besides causing a huge revenue loss to the state exchequer, he said in Delhi before leaving for Patna where he has to appear in the CBI court on Tuesday in a fodder scam case. Asked if the prohibition policy should be ended, Lalu said: “Whether it should be ended or not, he (read CM Nitish Kumar) knows. Smuggling of liquor is going on, people are dying, the state is also losing revenue and now the police are also entering the rooms of the women in the name of prohibition. It has failed and we repeat that it should be ended.” When reminded that Nitish has been saying that those who are criticising it today had supported the prohibition policy, Lalu said, “We had asked him to end it, after giving a considerable thought and holding honest discussions.” Interestingly, hours before Lalu’s statement, RJD state president Jagadanand Singh said in Patna that any of his party worker or leader found violating the prohibition law will be suspended. However, Lalu’s stand on the prohibition policy, that is in force since 2016, might add wind to the related demand of other opposition parties, including the Congress, besides the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, who has long been saying that the prohibition policy has militated against the cultural matters of his Musahar caste people. Lalu said after the prohibition policy was announced, Nitish had come to meet him and he had raised the question about the practicality of the policy since Bihar has porous borders with West Bengal, Nepal, UP and Jharkhand. “How will it be implemented? I had told him Bihar is like an island,” Lalu said. As Lalu said, during his discussion with Nitish, he had asked him not to ban toddy on which the livelihood of the Pasi/Chaudhary caste people depended, as they had the tradition of extracting toddy from palm trees for sale. “Nitish broached the idea of preparing ‘neera’ (non-fermented toddy) and ‘neera gud’ (jaggery). Today, even the two propositions have failed,” Lalu said, adding that the Pasi caste people who stealthily climb palm trees to extract toddy, “fall from the trees on seeing the police”. As to the police entering the room of a bride lodged in a hotel on the occasion of her marriage in Patna on Sunday night, Lalu said, “This is happening in the Nitish regime. Some people must have informed the police (about the presence of liquor), but the police should refrain from making such intrusions.” When contacted for the JD(U) reaction, the party spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar said: “The RJD has been working to fail the prohibition policy. It is clear from the statement of Lalu that he is opposed to the prohibition policy. If anyone says that the prohibition has failed, he or she is anti-prohibition. Besides, the RJD leaders have been issuing contradictory statements on the continuance of the prohibition in the state.” Nothing wrong if Tejashwi, Chirag come closer: Lalu Lalu said there was nothing wrong in RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan coming closer and the LJP(R) also getting the legislative council seats to contest in alliance. Lalu added that two dozen vacant legislative council seats from the urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) slated to have elections will be properly shared among the grand alliance partners, including with the Congress. On the recent assertions of the state Congress leaders that their party is not a part of the grand alliance, Lalu said, “No, it is not that. Everything will be worked out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prohibition-policy-has-failed-in-state-should-end-says-lalu/articleshow/87855927.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Hubballi||Rural women get into contract farming; reap a good harvest||Hubballi: On the hunt for a job in the aftermath of the government imposing a lockdown across the country, 15 women, from a cross-section of society came together and settled on an acre of land, which they rented for a year, in Mattigatti village, Kundagol taluk in Dharwad. Contract farming, as this model of agriculture is commonly referred to as, has long been considered the bastion of men, but these women were not only bold enough to start an enterprising venture by themselves, they reaped a good harvest after sowing groundnut and millets in their field. They are continuing to work at the same land, but have expressed a yearning to work on a larger farm and expand their enterprise.The Vinayak Stree Shakti Sangha (VSSS) to which all the 15 women belong, and under the banner of which they undertook the agrarian enterprise, was founded in 2000. “Back then, we were engaged in crushing chillies to make chilli powder, which we used to sell. But we started thinking of expanding our enterprise after interacting with members of Bengaluru-based NGO Sahaja Samruddha in 2019. In April, we leased an acre, and with our kharif crop, reaped a yield of seven quintals of groundnut, while we had also sown eight to ten kg of foxtail millet along the border. We did not sell the groundnut since the price for the crop has fallen. We are storing the crop for now, while the foxtail millet we have grown, we will use at home,” said VSSS convener Ratna Hosalli.Paravva Alagawadi, also a member of VSSS, said that they had rented the land for a year. “We spent money for seeds, used very little fertiliser, and are certain that our income will cover up our expenses. Whatever money we make from our rabi crop will add to our profit. We decided to sow gram, and sorghum in the rabi season,” Paravva said.Paravva’s fellow worker Sarojavva Arali said that they would have had to shell out a further Rs 8,500 for the labourers to pluck the groundnut off the ground. “Instead of this, we decided to work in the field ourselves, and even worked while shelling groundnuts in the machine. We resolved that, should one of the sangha members miss a day’s labour, she would have to pay for her labour on said day, or send someone from her family to do the job. This helped save a considerable sum of money,” Sarojavva said.The trio said that there were plans to lease the agricultural land for two more years. “We are trying to obtain an interest-free loan from the government, and if we get it, we will scale up our operations,” the three women said.Cluster coordinator for Sahaja Samruddha Mrutyunjay Ramani lauded the enthusiasm of the VSSS members, particularly when it involved learning something new. “We were inspired to provide them with all possible help including training them after seeing their enthusiasm,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rural-women-get-into-contract-farming-reap-a-good-harvest/articleshow/87855145.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Nashik||Increase tax collection: NMC chief||Nashik: After the rise in administrative cost from 29% to 38% during Covid pandemic, municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Monday directed the civic officials to focus on increasing property and water tax collection. Jadhav also directed the officials to conduct surveys and bring the properties that are without building and construction certificate (BCC) under the tax net. The revenue of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), through various taxes in the first half of the current financial year, has declined by Rs 300 crore. The NMC had expected Rs 1,050 crore revenue during the first half, but could collect only Rs 750 crore. Moreover, the NMC had set a target of collecting Rs 450 crore revenue through various taxes of the town planning department for the current financial year, but so far managed to collect only Rs 90 crore. The NMC could not do better on the property and water tax fronts as well. While the NMC had set a target of Rs 160 crore property tax collection for 2021-22, it could collect only Rs 87 crore so far despite introducing an amnesty scheme for the defaulters. An NMC official said the civic chief has directed to bring new properties that are under utilisation sans BCCs under the tax ambit. “Jadhav has directed the civic officials to conduct surveys across six divisions and find out such properties. The civic body has already brought 20,000 such properties under the tax net and collected Rs 24 crore revenue including dues of last two-three years,” the civic official said. Apart from this, the water tax collection has also been affected with the civic body managing to collect only Rs 25 crore from the set target of Rs 150 crore. “The municipal commissioner has also directed us to visit the houses of the big water tax defaulters with dues over Rs 25,000,” the official said. The higher administrative cost has made the civic administration worried as it won’t be able to make recruitments on the vacant posts. As per rule, the NMC can recruit new or contractual employees only if the administrative cost is below 35%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/increase-tax-collection-nmc-chief/articleshow/87855148.cms||Tushar Pawar

He said that the protesting farmers can hold dialogue with the government regarding their other demands, including guarantee being sought on minimum support price (MSP). On his Republican Party of India’s (RPI) prospects in the 2022 UP election, Athawale said, “The alliance with RPI is beneficial for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). My party is preparing a list of 25-30 assembly areas where we are strong in UP.” “I have already met BJP chief JP Naddda, Union home minister Amit Shah and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and expect that RPI would be given a minimum 10 seats to contest in UP,” he added. Claiming that there was anger among Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supporters against party supremo Mayawati, Athawale said, “The opposition is misleading people by claiming that the BJP will change the Constitution to abolish quota for Dalits.” He said that the rights of Dalits are secure in the BJP rule. “Before making false claims, the BSP chief should make it clear that if BJP had a plan to change the Constitution, then why did she enjoy its support for becoming CM of UP in the past,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/agitating-farmers-should-end-protest-says-athawale/articleshow/87855925.cms||---

The HC appointed advocate Nausher Kohli as amicus curiae to assist the court in its endeavour. It also appointed him an amicus in another matter raising similar issues. At a hearing last week before the bench of Justice Kathawalla and Justice Jadhav, Kohli informed the court that the best way forward to prevent the on-going mischief is by the extensive use of information technology to transform the process of notarizing documents. Kohli cited a decision of the Delhi high court wherein, the notary was unable to produce his notary register as the same was eaten by “termites”. He said that the Delhi HC also had recommended to the Union of India to consider the use of Information Technology which recommendation is under consideration. Kohli also cited developments in the United States of America, wherein, due to Covid-19, new legislation has been passed permitting remote online notarisation whereby documents can be notarised remotely through video conferences and concluded that the way forward has to be via use of Information Technology and that the Notaries Act which is now approximately 70 years old, requires the assistance of Information Technology to digitize the entire process of notarising documents and maintenance of records. The Notaries Act was enacted in 1952. Since then, there have been no major reforms or developments to the Act. Various courts across the country are faced with similar issues frequently. The matter is next listed before the HC on December 2, 2021. An advocate is appointed as a ‘notary’ under the Notaries Act 1952 and his or her functions include to “verify, authenticate, certify or attest the execution of any instrument—document.’’ A notary can also administer oath to, or take affidavit from, any person among other functions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-appoints-amicus-curiae-for-reforms-in-70-yr-old-notaries-act/articleshow/87857890.cms||Swati Deshpande

However, the officials from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said the increase in active cases is not alarming and this increase is due to the overcrowding during Diwali and other social functions. The officials reiterated the need for people to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour. Of the 198 active patients, 27 have been in home isolation, while 171 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals. A total of 30 patients are on oxygen, but no one is on a ventilator, said NMC officials. There had been a huge rush of people at markets during Diwali. The wedding functions have also begun, which are witnessing people crowding particularly in rural areas, said NMC officials. “Our observation is that a section of people is not wearing masks at public places. We want the city residents to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said the officials. Meanwhile, NMC has decided to conduct a survey of 198 active Covid patients to find out how many of them were vaccinated fully or partially. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of NMC, said the decision to this effect has been taken following the government directive in this connection. The government wants to study the effects of vaccination on the pandemic. He said the instructions have been given to the officials concerned to contact all the patients and find out how many of them had taken either the first or second dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marginal-rise-in-active-covid-cases-in-city/articleshow/87855154.cms||Tushar Pawar

Joseph ‘Joe’ D’Souza, who lives next to the church, has been arrested. A large crowd gathered later at the police station demanding justice for the priest. Rodrigues’ complaint stated that he was in Mapusa when he received a call at 12.06pm from D’Souza regarding waterlogging in the field due to a blocked drain and was told to come to the spot. He arrived at 12.37pm and got into an argument with D’Souza who was abusing him with foul language. When he walked away, D’Souza pulled him back, slapped him and threw him down. “I got up to defend myself from further assault and as I moved away he came running after me and threatened me,” said Rodrigues in his complaint, adding that this was witnessed by a church employee. After hearing about the assault, Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo rushed to Saligao police station and demanded that the accused be arrested. “The parish priest always told me that this person would come and disturb him. If the trucks carrying mud for the beautification work touched his compound wall, he would fight with the parish priest,” said Salgaonkar. “When I learnt of the incident, I called up the SP and he told me that he has been taken for medical examination and has been arrested,” Salgaonkar said. Another local Tulio de Souza said that the accused had trespassed on church property and assaulted the priest. “The beautification work has been going on for many days and this person has been blocking all the trucks to the church,” said Tulio.  Lobo demanded that the compound wall built by Joseph be demolished by the panchayat and called for a chargesheet soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/neighbour-held-for-assault-on-saligao-parish-priest/articleshow/87857424.cms||---

The aim of offering the bridge course is to fill the learning gap of nearly two years that resulted from the campus shutdown during the Covid pandemic. Books for the bridge course for classes IX and X—nine for each class— will be ready by the end of this month and distributed before the next session. Classes XI and XII will get their after this HS exam. Thirty-six books will be given to XI and XII. Around Rs 100 crore has been allotted for the project that will cover around 43 lakh students. The study materials will offer learning for three months and will include key parts of the syllabuses from previous years, which usually act as the linking portions of curriculums of different classes. Evaluation materials are also attached with each book and summative exams will be held on the matters taught. Bridge and foundation are the two important parts of the new learning process. Explaining the process, an official said, students who were in Class VIII before the pandemic will be promoted to Class X in the new academic session in January 2022. The bridge course will revise the syllabuses of classes VIII and IX in a nutshell for them. The new learning materials will work as foundation learning for the subjects to be taught for the first time in the Higher Secondary level such as economic, politicial science and statistics. Hundreds of students’ education witnessed a setback due to the past two years’ campus shutdown, largely because a majority of them could not attend online classes. Many of them did not have smart devices and for many, internet connections were weak. Department officials admitted despite various online programmes, not all students would be reached out to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/experts-ready-with-bridge-course-books-for-ix-xii-in-state-schools/articleshow/87856670.cms||---

The NMC has, so far, got back 40 oxygen concentrators from some of the corporators. The tough stand taken by civic chief Kailas Jadhav — of not issuing no-objection certificate (NoC) to corporators before the civic polls if they do not return the concentrators — has started yielding results. The civic body had procured 1,200 oxygen concentrators under the corporators’ funds during the second wave of Covid. Of them, 600 concentrators were given to the corporators to help the patients in their areas. Each corporator was given five oxygen concentrators in two phases so they could be provided to Covid patients undergoing treatment at home. The remaining 600 oxygen concentrators were sent to the various Covid care centres and Covid hospitals of the civic body for those in need Around three weeks ago, Jadhav had sent a letter to all the corporators asking them to return oxygen concentrators. But even after three weeks, none of the corporators had returned the oxygen concentrators. Jadhav on Thursday warned all the corporators that the corporators, who do not return oxygen concentrators will not be given NOC for the coming civic elections. Nashik Municipal Corporation officials said they have started receiving oxygen concentrators. NMC corporator Sangita Gaikwad said she had received oxygen concentrators and we provided them to many Covid patients during the pandemic. “NMC administration procured oxygen very late in July when the daily cases had started reducing and the major spike in the cases was in March and April,” said Gaikwad. “I had received a letter from the Nashik Municipal Corporation commissioner about returning oxygen concentrators to the health department. Accordingly, I have returned all the oxygen concentrators I,” she said. Committee formed to probe TDR scam Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has formed a six-member committee led by additional commissioner Suresh Khade to probe into the alleged Transfer of Development Right (TDR) scam. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had acquired land reserved for the stadium in Panchavati against the TDR around two years ago. As per the norms, the title of the land should be clear and there should not be any encroachment while acquiring the land against TDR.

Police said that a few weeks back the accused Arvind alias Naka Dabhi had asked the sadhvi Rekha Mer to give the ownership of the ashram to him. As the monk refused, a heated argument ensued between them. After the fight, Dabhi did not raise the issue again. However, on Sunday evening at around 7 pm when Mer was milking a cow, Dabhi stabbed her with a knife. Mer’s sister Madhu Makwana, who had come to collect milk, rushed to rescue her and hit a brick on Dabhi’s head. Realizing that Dabhi would try to stab her too, Makwana ran out of the ashram towards a nearby farm. She told about the attack to a farmer named Ghanshyam Kalsariya, who along with other farmers went to the ashram. Dabhi had, however, fled the spot by then. Mer was taken to a hospital, but she was declared dead before admission. Later, based on Makwana’s complaint, police booked Dabhi for murder. Cops said that they are searching for him at his native place in Gariyadhar taluka of Bhavnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sadhvi-killed-by-helper-over-ashram-land/articleshow/87855958.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The proposed trip will consist of public rallies, condolence meets and meeting party leaders. The former CM will try to create a buzz in political circles about being firmly in control. The official tour plan says she will be attending nine condolence meetings including two of sitting MLAs – Kiran Maheshwari and Gautam Lal Meena. “The visit in the heart of Mewar without taking BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria, who is considered a strongman of the party, indicates that all is not well between the two. The recent criticism of Raje by Kataria in a public space has opened the fault lines. The visit is going to put the spotlight on the issue again,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity. She will be holding roadshows Banswara, where she will be travelling by road, while at all places the mode of transport will be a helicopter. She will be meeting party workers and former MLAs in the six districts aiming to revive the connections. Raje’s close aides former transport minister Yunus Khan, former BJP state president Ashok Parnami and a battery of leaders are camping in the areas of her visit to ensure it echoes across the state in the political spectrum. It is likely that several present MLAs will join her during her travel. She will conclude the visit in Ajmer by holding prayers in Pushkar Raj and Dargah Shareef while meeting former education minister Vasudev Devnani. The state unit is sceptical over the four-day yatra of Raje, which is being seen as yet another step to run a parallel organisation.

A decision to contest the MLC polls despite not having enough numbers was taken after the local leadership insisted on fighting the elections to not only activate the cadre in respective districts but also to keep the flock together from being poached by the ruling TRS. While Nirmala Jagga Reddy, wife of TPCC working president and Sangareddy MLA T Jagga Reddy, will be contesting the MLC seat from Medak district, Rayala Nageswara Rao has been finalised for the Khammam MLC seat.

---||Delhi||Two patients die of new strain of fungus in AIIMS-Delhi||NEW DELHI: Doctors at the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences have confirmed the presence of a drug resistant pathogen called Aspergillus lentulus in two patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to the hospital recently. Both died during treatment. Aspergillus lentulus is a species of the Aspergillus fungus that is known to cause infection in the lungs. It was first described in medical literature in 2005. Since then, several countries have confirmed infections in humans. However, this is the first time that this species of Aspergillus has been reported to have infected patients in India, according to doctors. According to a case report published in Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology (IJMM), one of the patients was in his late 50s, the other in his early 40s. Both had COPD. The first man was referred to AIIMS from a private hospital when the infection did not subside despite treatment, including the administration of antibiotics and antifungals, in addition to supplemental oxygen therapy. The IJMM report said the patient was administered Amphotericin B and oral Voriconazole injections at AIIMS. There was no improvement in his clinical condition for over a month before he succumbed to the fungal infection. Read AlsoHospital-acquired infections are the biggest challengeDisease-causing fungi are present everywhere, including in hospital settings. Active surveillance, hand hygiene and adequate sterilisation of instruments can go a long way in preventing fungal infection of immune-compromised patients. Healthcare workers do everything to prevent hospital-acquiredThe second patient was rushed to the AIIMS emergency with fever, cough and shortness of breath. He was also administered Amphotericin B, but there was no improvement in his condition and he died after a week of multi-organ failure. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from India of cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a COPD patient caused by Aspergillus lentulus,” states the IJMM report authored by Jaweed Ahmed, Gagandeep Singh, Immaculata Xess and Mragnayani Pandey from the microbiology department of AIIMS and Anant Mohan, Janya Sachdev, Prashant Mani and Bhaskar Rama from the department of pulmonology there. There are over a million species of fungi in the environment. Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, who heads the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Fungi of Medical Importance, told TOI that till about a decade ago, 200-300 of them were known to cause disease. “But now, there are more than 700 identified fungal species that are known to cause diseases. Some of them are resistant to available drugs,” he said. Chakrabarti, who heads the department of medical microbiology at PGI Chandigarh, said he had been raising the issue of rising fungal infections and measures needed to prevent the morbidity and mortality caused by it for 37 years, but it hadn’t caught the attention of experts. “Then the Covid-19 pandemic occurred and mucormycosis — another fungal infection — emerged as a major cause of death in seriously ill Covid patients. That made policymakers sit up and think about the importance of creating infrastructure for timely diagnosis and management of fungal infections,” said Chakrabarti. Fungal infections are a group of diseases caused by fungi, organisms found freely in the environment, according to Dr Chand Wattal, chairperson, Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He added that most infections caused by fungi were treatable, for example, ringworm or nail infections. “But there are infections caused by species of fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus and Mucor that can cause systemic illness in persons with weaker immunity and co-morbidities like diabetes. The infection can easily spread in the bloodstream and can get lodged in different parts of the body which is difficult to eradicate,” added Wattal. There are only three classes of antifungal drugs. Infection caused by Candida auris is untreatable by most of them, which is another challenge. “Till around 15 years ago, only 30% of infections caused by Candida were drug resistant. Now, almost 70% of these infections are drug resistant. This poses a serious problem in treating patients,” said Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family Hospital. The high cost of antifungal drugs was another major impediment in saving lives, he added. With increase in longevity as well as the incidence of co-morbidities such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease, doctors say the incidence of life-threatening fungal infections was likely to go up. “One of the major reasons for the rise in fungal infections is excessive use of antibiotics in India. It kills both the bad and the good bacteria, thus creating favourable conditions for the growth of funguses that are known to cause diseases,” explained a senior doctor. Overuse of steroids is another key factor. “Steroids suppress the body’s immune system, thus reducing its ability to fight against fungal infections. In many cases of Covid, we saw how the overuse of steroids in treatment led to an epidemic of mucormycosis,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fungi-fight-off-drugs-pose-huge-risk-to-lives/articleshow/87856694.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Pune||Active Covid cases dip but protocol laxity a concern: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said violation of Covid-19 protocols across all districts in the state continued to be a concern despite active cases dropping below 10,000, the lowest since the pandemic outbreak. Though active cases have dipped, there should be no laxity in following the Covid-19 protocols, he told TOI. “Cases decreasing is a good sign but one cannot be callous,” he said. According to the public health department, on Monday, active cases in the state dipped to 9,678, the lowest tally so far, with 656 daily new cases. The recovery rate was 97.68%. Mumbai was at the top of the active cases list with 2,632 cases followed by Pune at 2,125. Last time active cases were around 10,311 was at the start of the pandemic on May 3, 2020. “Despite being told to continue wearing masks, and follow all Covid-19 protocols, people are violating these rules. While the state has relaxed all curbs, it is up to the people to ensure that all protocols are followed. We are keeping a close watch on sudden rise in cases in any cluster,” the minister said. He had earlier told TOI that the health department would be keeping a watch on sudden rise in cases from Diwali. According to the public health department, in the last three weeks, daily new cases continued to be in the range of 800-1,000, while active cases in the last fortnight have been around 11,000-14,000. Data show there has been a gradual decrease in active cases post Diwali. On November 7, active cases were at 14,526, which dipped to 11,732 on November 18, 11,704 on November 19, 10,249 on November 20 and 9,799 on November 21. Tope said the state will continue with the existing relaxations but will review the situation weekly in cabinet meetings. “We shall continue with the same system and shall not introduce any further curbs,” he said. State surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate told TOI that the waning of the second wave was noticed across districts. He said in most districts we are reaching an endemic stage. “A close watch on any sudden rise is essential,” he said. Chairman of state task force Dr Sanjay Oak said we must not forget that abroad several countries are seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases. “Germany has registered 60,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day with 200 deaths. This is alarming,” Oak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-active-cases-dip-but-protocol-laxity-a-concern/articleshow/87856685.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The arrival of the summer onions at Lasalgaon APMC have almost exhausted and the arrival of late kharif onions is yet to pick up. According to APMC officials, the arrival of summer onions have reduced to 4,500 quintal per day as against 10,000 quintal/day before Diwali. The summer onions have a shelf life of over six months and farmers prefer storing them with a hope of getting better price. These onions are harvested in March and April and there is no new crop for the next six months till October-end — until arrival of fresh kharif onions. Hence, the summer onions stored by the farmers cater to the market until the fresh kharif onions arrive. This year, the onion crops have been badly damaged due to rains. Also, the arrival of late kharif onions have begun, but in very low quantity — around 500 quintal per day. APMC officials said the arrival of fresh late kharif onions is expected to increase in the next two-three weeks and the price will be in the range between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 per quintal during the next fortnight. On Monday, the minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon were recorded at Rs 900 and Rs 2,555 per quintal respectively. Around 5,600 quintal of onions were auctioned at the APMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/average-wholesale-price-of-onions-up-15/articleshow/87855171.cms||Tushar Pawar

Some locals who saw burn injuries on the child’s body informed the police and got her admitted to a hospital, said police. The minor is stable now. The arrested aunt, Safiya Shaikh, is currently in judicial custody. The matter came to light on November 15. A local resident, requesting anonymity, told TOI that his landlord informed him about a girl who was scared and didn’t want to return to her aunt’s home. “When we inquired with the girl, she showed her injuries. There were burn injuries on her right shoulder, ears, neck and leg. We were shocked to see it. How can someone do this?” the local said, adding that he called the police control room after which two constables came to the spot. After seeing the girl’s injuries, the two police personnel called women personnel and the girl was taken to a hospital. When police spoke to the girl, she told them that her aunt had poured hot water over her since she couldn’t wash clothes properly. The girl’s mother is mentally ill, so the minor was kept in the aunt’s custody. “We have arrested the aunt and the girl is at Nair Hospital, but stable,” said SI Shekar Bhalerao. The girl is likely to be handed over to her elder brother once discharged. Police have arrested Shaikh under IPC section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-angry-aunt-pours-boiling-hot-water-on-9-yr-old-held/articleshow/87857912.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Rains push up tomato prices in Andhra Pradesh, pay more at least till January||VISAKHAPATNAM: Even as the commoners feel the pinch of skyrocketing tomato prices, the crisis is likely to continue for some more months. The recent incessant rains caused massive damage to tomato and other crops in Rayalaseema region, particularly in Chittoor district. Tomatoes are being sold at Rs 100 per kg in cities like Vizag,and Vijayawada, and in other towns in state. Traders predict that tomato prices will touch Rs 150 per kg as the heavy rains destroyed standing crops in Kurnool and a few parts of Karnataka. Tomato prices have been soaring during July and September for the past few years. The prices rise three times the usual rates during these months. But this year, the prices shot up to Rs 100 in November due to gap between demand and supply on account of crop damage. Andhra Pradesh tops in the country in cultivation of tomato with a production of 26.67 lakh metric tonnes from an area of 58,199 hectares with an average productivity of 36 to 40 metric tonnes per hectare. Though farmers in eight districts grow tomatoes, Chittoor and Anantapur districts produce the lion’s share of tomatoes produced in the state. Officials of the horticulture department said Madanapalle in Chittoor district is the biggest tomato market, followed by Pimpalgaon, around 15 km from Nashik in Maharashtra. Chittoor district is the largest producer of tomatoes in the country. It houses Asia’s biggest tomato market. The yard in the Madanapalle division, that can contain 800 tonnes of tomatoes a day, often has to keep 1,684 tonnes of the vegetable. The production reaches its peak during October-November. Speaking to TOI, deputy director (horticulture), Vizag, K Gopi Kumar said heavy rains in Rayalaseema region destroyed the standing tomato crops. “The prices of tomato will further increase to over Rs 120 per kg in the coming days. It seems prices will stabilise only after January,” he added. “Prices of onion (Rs 50/kg), potato, capsicum and tomato make our pockets pinch. We cut down on purchase of expensive vegetables,” said D Sudhakar, a resident of MVP Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rains-push-up-tomato-prices-pay-more-at-least-till-january/articleshow/87855955.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Delhi||At its executive meet, Delhi BJP aims at ‘triple-engine govt’||NEW DELHI: Union minister Piyush Goyal on Monday said that Delhi needed a triple-engine government — BJP in the corporations, Delhi government and the Centre — for faster growth. Inaugurating Delhi BJP’s executive committee meeting, Goyal hoped that the party won the polls in all three corporations next year and also the assembly elections, besides returning to power for a third time at the Centre. He asked party workers to strive hard in a planned manner towards this objective. Delhi BJP in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda said only those with a clean image, available to the public and having winnability would get tickets for the polls. He added that those desirous of tickets should stop lobbying and start serving people. Marking the beginning of the day-long session, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta announced that the party would sharpen its protests against the policies of the AAP government. Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri moved a resolution thanking PM Narendra Modi for all welfare policies and administering free vaccines to 116 crore people. He underlined that due to the 20 lakh crore economic package, the country’s economy was able to come back on track. BJP also sought chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation and claimed that his government had failed in all areas. Sharing the “winning” formula with BJP functionaries, Goyal said, “If we explain to people the welfare policies of the Modi government along with the work done by the corporations, no power can stop us from winning Delhi. Many central government schemes like PM Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Yojana have not been implemented by the AAP government. If we can take these policies to the beneficiaries, people will show the exit door to Kejriwal.” Gupta claimed Delhi BJP had forced the AAP government to bow down on several occasions. The issues of air and Yamuna pollution, the condition of the public transport system and the new excise policy were also discussed. “The Kejriwal government talked about reducing pollution in Delhi, but to hide its shortcomings it put the blame on Haryana and Punjab,” he added. “When the Kejriwal government came to power, there were 6,000 DTC buses. The number has now come down to 3,000 due to which people are having great difficulty in commuting. Besides, the shabby public transport system is the main cause of pollution,” claimed Gupta. BJP’s resolution stated while 25 states had cut VAT on fuel after the Centre cut excise duty, the AAP government was yet to do so. Over 370 members of the executive committee participated in the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-its-exec-meet-delhi-bjp-aims-at-triple-engine-govt/articleshow/87857432.cms||AlokKNMishra

The seers had complained that the saffron attire of the waiters was an insult to Hindu religion and its seers. They had opposed the waiters donning saffron attire with a sadhu-like headgear and wearing rudraksha malas (necklaces). "We have changed the dress code and now there is no issue. There was no intention to hurt the sentiment of anyone," a railway ministry official said. Photo: ANIThe country's first Ramayan circuit train had started off on a 17-day tour from Safdarjung railway station on November 7. This train visits 15 places associated with the life of Lord Ram. It covers more than 7,500 km, taking the pilgrims to Ayodhya, Prayag, Nandigram, Janakpur, Chitrakoot, Sitamarhi, Nasik, Hampi and Rameshwaram.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Private hospitals want vaccine dose replacement to stop waste||PUNE: Private hospitals want the government to replace doses with long expiry for averting wastages of their about-to-be expired anti-Covid vaccine stock. Close to 54 lakh doses of anti-Covid vaccines are almost lying idle with the private hospitals in Maharashtra. A significant portion of this stock has an expiry within the next two-three months. The hospital authorities want the government to take up their stock and utilize it in the country’s vaccination programme. In turn, the hospitals want the government to provide them with the equal number of replacement doses having an extended or long expiry date as the footfall at the private health hubs for Covid vaccination have drastically gone down. TimesViewPrivate hospitals in the state have sounded an alarm that a significant portion of 54 lakh doses of Covid vaccines may expire in the next two to three months. The state wants guidelines from the Centre to replace the private stock with the fresh vaccines. Experts have suggested measures that include a policy decision on allowing a booster dose, reducing the gap between two Covisheld doses and more intense drives to reach out to the unvaccinated population in the state. Indian Medical Association members have rightly argued that it will be criminal to waste vaccines when many citizens in poor nations do not have access to it.The improved vaccine supply in government centres has made it easy for people to get a free-of-cost shot. Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director of city-based Bharati hospital, said, “We want the government to take our stock which has a February 28 expiry and use them at their vaccination sites. We are ready to take the replacement doses of the same number having a long expiry date. This will prevent the wastage of these doses, as vaccination in private hospitals is going on at a snail’s pace. We are unlikely to use all the 3, 500 doses we have by February 28.” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, said, “At a time when citizens in many poor countries do not have access to Covid vaccines, it will be a criminal loss to let the stock in private go waste. The Centre should implement the replacement policy to prevent the wastages.” State immunisation officer Sachin Desai, said, “We can not take such a decision of allowing replacement of doses at our level. However, we will inform the Union government about such a demand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hosps-want-vax-dose-replacement-to-stop-waste/articleshow/87856711.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The 94th Akhil Bharitya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan will be inaugurated by renowned novelist Vishwas Patil, as announced by the organizing committee. The Brahman Mahasangh members have now said that as long as the organisers invite litterateurs to inaugurate the programme, they do not have any issue with the literary festival. “We had written to the organizing committee of the Akhil Bharitya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, Nashik, in October that any move to invite Javed Akhtar to inaugurate the sammelan would not be tolerated as he is not a Marathi litterateur. In fact, he is not a litterateur in the first place. He has made no contribution to the language or even literature,” Bhagwant Pathak, the president of the mahasangh, said. Japrakash Jategaonkar, the convener and chief executive of the sahitya sammelan being held on December 3, 4 and 5, said the mahaasangh had written to the organising committee about its reservations, and denied that the demand had any impact on the committee’s decisions. “The organizing committee finalised the names, and communicated with the people to seek their confirmation and dates. After we received the confirmations, the names were finalised. The decision taken by the organising committee is final,” Jategaonkar said. He added that the committee, from the beginning, had planned to have litterateurs inaugurate the event. Many senior litterateurs expressed their inability to attend the event against the backdrop of the pandemic and their own health conditions. “Of the few that had agreed, we finalised Vishwas Patil’s name. Also, we had a separate list of personalities who could be among the chief guests and Javed Akhtar assured us that he would be available. So we invited him,” Jategaonkar added. Pathak said the mahasangh had no objection to the choice of the chief guest. “Our objection was only limited to the person who inaugurates the sammelan, and not the attendees,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/novelist-vishwas-patil-to-inaugurate-marathi-lit-fest/articleshow/87855201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Investigations further revealed the name of his accomplice and both the two main accused had committed three other crimes. All four have been remanded in police custody till Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-4-held-in-chain-snatching-cases/articleshow/87855190.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Kavitha to file nomination as Nizamabad MLC today||HYDERABAD: After dilly-dallying over his daughter Kavitha’s nomination to the upper house, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has finally decided to field her from Nizamabad local authority constituency. Kavitha will file her nomination at 1.45 pm on Tuesday in Nizamabad. KCR announced some names for the 12 MLC seats on Sunday afternoon itself before leaving for Delhi. But, he kept Kavitha’s candidature in abeyance as there was dilemma whether to send her to the Rajya Sabha in place of Banda Prakash, who had been nominated as an MLC under MLA quota or field her from Nizamabad LAC. Party sources said Kavitha preferred to continue as MLC instead of going to Rajya Sabha as she wanted to contest as MP from Nizamabad Lok Sabha in the next general elections. Former MP from Nizamabad got elected to state legislative council in October 2020 following disqualification of sitting MLC Bhupathi Reddy on defection charges. Her present term ends on January 4, 2022, along with 11 other MLCs, who were elected from various local authorities constituencies. In past one year, Kavitha has been maintaining good relations with elected representatives of local bodies and developmental works such as roads were sanctioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kavitha-to-file-nomination-as-nizamabad-mlc-today/articleshow/87856708.cms||Koride Mahesh

Three persons, including two models were killed in the accident on Nov 1. But, the search near Kannangattu Bridge did not yield results. Six officials, led by station officer Prem Nath PV from the Institute for Advanced Training in Water Rescue; Fort Kochi, conducted the search. “Six divers conducted the search in a 100m by 20m area at the spot in the lake where the hard disk was reportedly thrown. The water was murky and underwater visibility was low. Also, the bottom of the lake was covered in mud and it was difficult to step on it,” said an official with the fire and rescue department. He added that the search which began at 1pm concluded by 5pm and further searches will be held as per the directive from the police. Police suspect that the hard disk from a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) of the CCTV system at the hotel– where the victims attended a party before the accident – contain visuals that could turn out to be crucial evidence in the case. The missing visuals from the party and the mysterious pursuit of the ill-fated car by another person in an Audi car had forced the family of both models to approach the police seeking an enquiry. On Monday, two among the accused – who allegedly threw the hard disk into the lake – were also brought to the location to identify the spot. Even if the hard disk is found, the chances of retrieving data is slim since the hard disk would have been damaged after being submerged for three weeks. Sources said the data is stored in a magnetic strip and there is a slight chance of data recovery. Police said the accused removed the hard disk from DVR and a blank one was installed in its place. Later the removed hard disk was thrown into the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vytilla-accident-scuba-diving-team-scours-lake-for-hard-disk/articleshow/87856741.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Floods continue to wreak havoc in Rayalaseema, Nellore districts||TIRUPATI: Following chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s call to the elected representatives and ministers to reach out to the flood-affected people across the Rayalaseema and Nellore districts, relief and rehabilitation measures have been expedited across Chittoor, Nellore, Kadapa and Anantapur districts which were completely ravaged by the recent floods. Waters have not completely receded in many districts yet. While floodwaters continued to inundate several low-lying colonies in the temple city of Tirupati on Monday, one more threat loomed large in the form of breach to Rayalacheruvu lake which has been continuously receiving heavy inflows. Water level reached almost double the volume of its full capacity. The damage in the even of the 500-year-old minor irrigation tank breaching could be very severe. Officials of the district administration led by special officer PS Pradyumna IAS, Chittoor district collector M Hari Narayana and Tirupati SP CH Venkata Appala Naidu were busy initiating measures to avoid a breach to the Rayalacheruvu. Nearly 15,000 people living in and around Rayalacheruvu have already been evacuated and moved to relief camps as a precautionary measure. Panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy, govt whip Dr Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy and others inspected the Rayalacheruvu on Monday. Meanwhile, pilgrim turnout remained poor at the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara with only a few thousands reaching the temple city which remains cut-off in terms of road and rail connectivity. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) additional executive officer AV Dharma Reddy said the temple body will make alternative darshan and accommodation arrangements for those devotees who made advance reservations but could not visit the temple between November 18-30 due to the flood situation.  In Kadapa, relief and rehabilitation works have been put on fast track across the flood-affected constituencies. Rajampet MP PV Midhun Reddy extended Rs 50 lakh from his personal funds to the flood-affected in the constituency on Monday. Accompanied by district in-charge minister Adimoolapu Suresh and Rajampet MLA Meda Mallikarjuna Reddy, the MP inspected the flood-affected villages and handed over relief materials to the victims. Traffic on the Jammalamadugu-Muddanur route was diverted as the Muddanur bridge over the Penna river got damaged and on the verge of collapse. Flood situation in Nellore district remained grim though the inflow into the Somasila project reduced on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/floods-continue-to-wreak-havoc-in-rayalaseema-nellore-districts/articleshow/87855995.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Nagpur||RSS man & sitting BJP corporator Bhoyar joins Congress, gets ticket||Nagpur: Sitting BJP corporator and staunch RSS man, Ravindra Bhoyar, on Monday formally joined Congress, and was given ticket for MLC polls (local bodies). While Bhoyar’s unhappiness with the BJP was an open secret for long, his last-moment entry in Congress and jumping the queue for MLC ticket was definitely a surprise. But it was a suprise which suited the political interests of certain groups in the faction-ridden Nagpur Congress unit and also gave a message to the BJP that their civic body fortress in the city having the Sangh headquarters can be breached. It all started when search for MLC candidate for Congress gathered steam and the party’s rural unit chief Rajendra Mulak emerged as the frontrunner. Mulak, who heads one of the four powerful groups in district Congress unit, was unable to secure a consensus with the remaining leaders. Cabinet ministers Nitin Raut and Sunil Kedar and city unit president Vikas Thakre continued to brainstorm and, as fate would have it, the timing was perfect for Bhoyar. Satyajeet Dasture, a Congressman and close friend of Bhoyar, said, “We had first got in touch with MPCC president Nana Patole some time back, but it was in the last one month that things really started moving ahead.” Once Kedar backed Bhoyar’s candidacy, the deal was considered final. After the resounding victory in the recently conculuded local body bypolls and APMC elections, Kedar’s hold over the district Congress is increasing. It was under Kedar that the recent AICC orientation camp was held in Wardha, in which party leader Rahul Gandhi made the trending statement about “Hinduism vs Hindutva”.Kedar had already promised his party to ensure votes even from the opposition when Bhoyar fights MLC polls. On Sunday, Kedar welcomed Bhoyar to Congress saying, “He will be an asset to the party and it will strengthen our claim for the civic polls.” Ultimately, Raut too threw his weight behind Bhoyar but not without leaving certain words open to interpretation. In the party event to formalize Bhoyar’s induction, Raut said, “We will always speak our mind when discussions are on, but when the decision has been made then nobody will challenge it. I am very happy that Bhoyar, who comes from a RSS background, has accepted Gandhian ideology and joined the Congress.” Bhoyar too was well prepared for the RSS barbs and said he’s following what he learnt there. “RSS taught me that I should never allow injustice to happen, and that is what’s happening in BJP. I look forward to working in Congress and BJP’s countdown in the civic body has begun,” said Bhoyar. MLA Thakre, who has been associated with Bhoyar during the former’s civic body politics days, said, “Bhoyar has deep understanding of local issues and knows the people’s pulse. Congress welcomes all those who want to work for the benefit of common people.” Mulak too joined in the others in putting up a united front at the Congress event on Monday morning. “Every Congress worker’s efforts will only be focussed on making the party stronger, and we are confident that Bhoyar’s presence will do the same,” said Mulak. As official announcement for Nagpur MLC candidate’s name got delayed, Mulak told TOI, “It’s just a procedural thing. The local unit recommends it to the state office, which in turn sends it to Delhi. After approval from Delhi, we shall announce the name publically.” Tuesday is the last day for filing nominations for MLC polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-man-sitting-bjp-corporator-bhoyar-joins-congress-gets-ticket/articleshow/87855203.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nagpur||BJP’s Bawankule files nomination in Gadkari and Fadnavis’ presence||Nagpur: After filing nomination papers for the forthcoming MLC elections from the BJP, former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said he never had any resentment against the party’s leadership in Delhi for denying him the ticket for 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls. “I am absolutely not upset with the party after being denied ticket, as speculated. In nearly three decades of my career, the party has given me everything — Six years as Zilla Parishad member and 15 years as legislator. Sometimes, the party gives you a legislator’s role while other times, it wants you to work to strengthen it,” an elated Bawankule told the media. In the morning, he took blessings from union minister Nitin Gadkari and his wife with his family members at the former’s home. He then reached Samvidhan Square where he garlanded Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue. The entire top brass from the saffron party, including MP Dr Vikas Mahatme, MLAs Krushna Khopde and Vikas Kumbhare, and mayor Dayashankar Tiwari accompanied him. The BJP activists then rallied all the way with flags to the collector’s office to file his nomination papers. Gadkari, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, former minister Sulekha Kumbhare, former MP Ajay Sancheti, and BJP city president Pravin Datke and others joined him in submitting nomination papers to collector R Vimala, in her capacity as the returning officer for December 10 elections. Flanked by both top leaders, Bawankule thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda along with central and state parliamentary boards, for reposing trust in him and bestowing him with the opportunity. “I will continue to raise various issues pertaining to the people of Maharashtra in general, and Vidarbha and Nagpur in particular, in the upper house. I will strive hard to ensure the justice to last man. As the party has granted me a big responsibility, I will fulfill all their expectations under the able guidance of Gadkari, Fadnavis and state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil,” he said. Exuberating confidence that the BJP was 100% going to win the election, Bawankule, who is currently looking after general secretary’s charge in the party, said he had never demanded a ticket to their leadership. “I worked in whichever position the party asked me to do. I believe in working sincerely, complete the given tasks and move ahead. I would continue to do the social work for the people,” he said. Hailing from a farmer’s family, Bawankule fought on various issues during his youth days in 1990s by forming the Chhatrapati Sena. Impressed by the BJP, he had joined it in 1995 in presence of former minister Gopinath Munde and Gadkari. He was immediately entrusted with the responsibility of Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) vice president. Based on his good performance, he was offered Zilla Parishad ticket in 1997, which was the start of his political journey. After twice winning the ZP seat, he was offered MLA’s ticket from Kamptee in 2004 by defeating favourite Kumbhare. He repeated his success in 2009 and 2014, after which he was made energy minister in Fadnavis government on December 6, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjps-bawankule-files-nomination-in-gadkari-and-fadnavis-presence/articleshow/87855206.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Won’t pay pending bills to private hospitals: ZP||Pune: The Pune ZP has decided not to pay any medical bills submitted by private hospitals under the Dr Rakhmabai Raut medical scheme, which was launched in 2020 to provide medical aid to Covid-19 patients in private hospitals of rural Pune. The ZP had tabled a proposal to disburse Rs50 lakh to four private hospitals in its general body for approval. But ZP members, including deputy president Ranjit Shivtare, opposed it. They said several hospitals are now submitting backdated “fake” Covid bills. Shivtare said, “The sums in these bills amount to lakhs of rupees. No bill should be approved without verification — but these bills are old, so it is difficult to verify their authenticity. Approving the high amounts this way will be inappropriate.” At the time this scheme was launched, Rs5 crore was approved to fund it. The programme ended up getting Rs45.76 lakh in funding. A representative of a private hospital, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “The bills have been pending with the ZP for over a year. We have submitted all necessary documents. Still, we are getting no response for some reason.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wont-pay-pending-bills-to-private-hospitals-zp/articleshow/87856714.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Delhi||Hospital-acquired infections are the biggest challenge||NEW DELHI: Disease-causing fungi are present everywhere, including in hospital settings. Active surveillance, hand hygiene and adequate sterilisation of instruments can go a long way in preventing fungal infection of immune-compromised patients. Healthcare workers do everything to prevent hospital-acquired infections, but despite this, the efforts sometimes are in vain. Recently, AIIMS published a study in Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene analysing fungal carriage on healthcare workers’ hands, clothes and stethoscopes. It revealed that out of 60 healthcare workers, 20 (33%) showed fungal carriage. Aprons/hospital scrubs were contaminated in 17 (28%) and hands in 3 workers (5%). The aprons and scrubs mainly carried moulds belonging to the Aspergillus species, while hands were contaminated with Candida species. Electronic devices and stethoscopes had no fungal contamination, the study noted. Dr Arvind Kumar, corresponding author of the study, said they did not assess whether the fungal carriage on healthcare workers’ hands or aprons had any correlation with infection among the patients. He said, “AIIMS has one of the most intense infection control programmes, including regular monitoring of hand hygiene, sterilisation of instruments and overall hygiene in hospital settings.” While a healthy person is not affected by fungi, a person with a weakened immunity can develop serious infection on exposure to the disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization recommends sterilisation and disinfection of the equipment used by multiple patients (tracheal tubes, ventilators) and of the ventilation system to prevent spread of fungal infection in hospitals. Additionally, doctors said, overuse of antibiotics must stop because the anti-bacterial drugs also end up killing the good bacteria that prevent fungal infections. The last resort drugs should be used sparingly, they added. Fungal infections are a serious problem among hospitalised patients and cause increasing morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs, according to the AIIMS study. It reported that a study at a tertiary care centre in India had 15% invasive fungal infections in the ICU, including invasive aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis and mucormycosis. Fungi naturally live on human skin and on healthcare workers’ hands, says the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The fungi can enter the body through cuts and wounds and cause infection during a hospital stay, especially if the wounds are severe, CDC says. “Fungi are difficult to avoid because they are a natural part of the environment. Fungi live outdoors in soil, on plants, trees, and other vegetation. They are also on many indoor surfaces and on your skin. However, there may be some ways for you to lower your chances of getting a serious fungal infection. This includes timely diagnosis and treatment and maintaining hand hygiene,” said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospital-acquired-infections-are-the-biggest-challenge/articleshow/87856738.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The incident had occurred in Punjapur village of Bayad taluka. Several teams were formed for a thorough probe in the case, and, after detailed questioning of several villagers, police got to know that the minor had killed the boy, who happens to be his cousin. Both studies in the same school, police said. The boy, who studies in Class XI, was extremely angry with his cousin for having illicit relationship with his mother. Investigating officer Unnati Patel said that the boy had earlier seen his cousin in a compromising position with his mother. On November 18, the victim came to meet his mother again. When he left, the boy followed him to a field with an axe and dealt severe blows on his head. The victim died on the spot and the boy dumped his body behind the well. Deputy superintendent of police Bharat Basiya said the boy confessed to the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/class-xi-boy-kills-mothers-teen-lover/articleshow/87856002.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Present DGP advised Param Bir Singh not to fight system, says his lawyer||NEW DELHI: As the Supreme Court had put a condition that he reveal his whereabouts, Param Bir Singh’s counsel at the outset told a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh that the officer had not fled abroad and was hiding in the country fearing a threat to his life from Maharashtra Police. The bench thereafter granted him a hearing and passed an ex parte order in his favour to grant him protection from arrest. Senior advocate Puneet Bali, appearing for Singh, said he was being targeted by the state machinery which lodged six “frivolous” FIRs against him after he wrote a letter to the chief minister against Deshmukh. Bali said his client had no faith in the state police and assured the court that he would appear before CBI within 48 hours if a probe against him was transferred from Maharashtra police to the central agency. He also brought to the court’s notice his WhatsApp conversation with Maharashtra DGP Sanjay Pandey in which he was asked to withdraw the letter. Placing the transcript of the conversation before the bench, Bali said Pandey had advised him not to fight against the system and to withdraw the letter sent to the CM and also threatened that consequences would follow if he did not fall in line. The court did not delve deep into the WhatsApp conversation but said the picture emerging was “very disturbing. An earlier Commissioner seems to show a lack of faith in police! We wonder what would happen to the common man and what kind of faith they would have in the police. The matter has become curiouser and curiouser in the battle between the then home minister and the then police commissioner. The only question which has to be examined is whether in view of the CBI looking into the matter, the other aspects arising are also to be entrusted to CBI”, it said. The bench noted that Singh’s plea against the state was rejected by the HC which asked him to approach the Central Administrative Tribunal without asking for the stand of the state and CBI. It has issued notice to the state and CBI seeking their response whether cases against Singh be referred to the central agency. “In the meantime, the petitioner shall join the investigation but shall not be arrested,” the bench said in its order. A magistrate court in Mumb-ai had on last Wednesday declar-ed Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered ag-ainst him and other police officers in the city. Singh had last atte-nded office in May after which he went on leave. The state police had told Bombay HC last month that his whereabouts were not known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/present-dgp-advised-singh-not-to-fight-system-says-his-lawyer/articleshow/87856729.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune district crosses 80L milestone of first Covid-19 vaccine shot||PUNE: The Pune district crossed the milestone of administering 80 lakh first doses of the Covid-19 vaccine on Monday. The total target for the district is 83.42 lakh beneficiaries. Monday also recorded the highest single day vaccination in November with 54,734 jabs. The district now has administered 1.27 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Of them, 80.02 lakh are first doses and 47.17 lakh are second doses. The public health services department officials said that even though there was a drop in the vaccination in the past few weeks, the drive was picking up pace with the ‘Har ghar dastak’ initiative. “The daily vaccination target under it is around 60,000 jabs per day and we are getting close to achieving it with each passing day,” said an official from the public health services department. According to the officials, the health department has reset the deadline from November 30 to December 15 to achieve 100% vaccination with the first dose in the district. Meanwhile, under the CSR activity in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, 3M India, Vaccine On Wheels, and United Way Bengaluru are supporting PCMC with their immunization drive since August this year. In less than 3 months, under this initiative, over 15,000 vaccinations were conducted for the underprivileged population, using two mobile vaccination units from Vaccine On Wheels. Following the success of the public private partnership, 3M decided to extend the initiative with a fresh target of giving 50,000 vaccines. With this, the support for both mobile vaccination units would be renewed for another three months in the PCMC area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-crosses-80l-milestone-of-first-shot/articleshow/87856744.cms||---
---||Nashik||Pvt hosps worried about unused vaccines||Nashik: The private hospitals in the city are worried about the unused Covid vaccines lying with them as the footfall of beneficiaries has drastically reduced.  Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice president of the Hospital Owners Association of Nashik. said that vaccine doses available in private hospitals are in large numbers and the trend of saying ‘no’ to the vaccine is increasing across the country. “At the time, when the vaccine is the only ‘preventive’ measure against Covid, for some reason the people are still not taking the second dose of vaccine. This is leading to the vaccines left unused with the private hospitals,” he said. While there is vaccine hesitancy among the people, who are not taking even the first dose, but for the larger part, this has been overcome. The new issue that is coming forth is that the people are not taking their second dose. The number of Covid cases and deaths has dropped. “The people at the most are now taking the second dose only if they have to travel abroad or travel frequently requiring vaccination certificate or similar cases. The number of people completing their doses without any kind of pressure is considerably low,” said Dr Rajesh Patil, one of the directors of a private hospital. He also said another reason for the vaccines lying unused is that the number of vaccine doses is freely available in the government hospitals. There is no rush at the centres and most of the people, who can afford to pay for the shots, have already taken them. The hospitals now hope the government gives the nod for third or the booster dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pvt-hosps-worried-about-unused-vaccines/articleshow/87855248.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||Bhoyar’s induction breach in BJP’s bastion, Congress eyes NMC fortress||Nagpur: While the entire focus is now on upcoming MLC polls in December, the Congress is looking beyond that, to the 2022 civic polls. Party leaders say BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar’s induction into the party on Sunday is part of a well thought out strategy, for which the MLC poll arena is nothing more than a “practice match”. City president and MLA Vikas Thakre said, “Our state president Nana Patole has shown that BJP’s citadel can be breached. Today’s event shows that the process of making inroads has begun and the scale of it will now increase.”Patole has been vocal about his plans to go solo for civic polls and his aggressive style of politics is now taking the fight to the BJP’s backyard. A Congress leader, whose relative is a corporator, said, “Try and understand the psychological impact of this. It’s not just that Bhoyar, a corporator, has joined but someone who is a staunch RSS man. That’s the level of discontent brewing in BJP, and such people are looking at Congress as an option. Bhoyar, with his strong RSS credentials, is now a benchmark for others to follow and a big problem for BJP, who consider themselves invincible.” Thakre said, “Patole has a clear vision about what needs to be done in both the short and long term. He’s focussing on making the party stronger at the grassroots level and pushing forward towards electoral success.” But will Bhoyar’s entry actually make a difference? The man himself believes so. “Many BJP corporators are in touch with me and you will soon see them walking out of BJP. In fact, today itself quite a few BJP corporators congratulated me saying that I took the right decision by not suffering injustice anymore,” said Bhoyar. As BJP’s electoral success rose, those from the grassroots too aspired for higher posts. But an expected demand-supply mismatch is now the chink in the armour which Congress looks to attack. A senior office bearer of the Congress party said, “By offering MLC candidature to Bhoyar, the message is clear. Here you will get what you are worthy of. Now you see how many BJP corporators will start sending out feelers ahead of the civic polls.” But the civic polls aren’t due till February, which means Congress’ theory of breaching the citadel will undergo a litmus test in December itself, during MLC polls. On paper, Congress can’t win, but party leaders are confident of snatching votes from the opposition. If successful, it will be a big jolt to the BJP’s electoral confidence. Guardian minister Nitin Raut said, “Don’t ever go by what the numbers on papers say. In politics we have seen the most unexpected things happen. You will see on December 14, when the counting takes place, that there will be big surprise in place.”At least two different party sources confirmed to TOI that Bhoyar has the immediate support of eight BJP corporators with “dozens” of others in line. Bhoyar too knows that the hoopla over MLC candidacy is just part of a small electoral battle, the war is what the Congress is preparing for. “Abki baar, 100 ke paar,” shouted Bhoyar while addressing Congress workers on Sunday and laying out his plans for the NMC polls. “Just wait till December, and then you will see the countdown for BJP’s downfall begins,” said Bhoyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bhoyars-induction-breach-in-bjps-bastion-congress-eyes-nmc-fortress/articleshow/87855240.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Nashik||MSRTC staff strike affects attendance in rural schools||Nashik: Though the physical classes for the students of Classes VIII to XII resumed on Monday after the Diwali vacation, the strike by the employees of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) meant many children missed school. The education officials, however, did not have the exact number of students who came to school, especially in the rural areas, and said that absence of bus services had affected at least 40% of the total 3.2 lakh students. In the rural areas, the secondary and higher secondary schools are generally at taluka places or in villages that are important business locations. Most of the schools are either government or government-aided private schools in the rural areas. Students in the villages depend on MSRTC buses to reach their schools that can be more than 5 to 10km away. “There are 56 Manav Vikas Mission dedicated buses that carry 3,500 children to school and bring them back home. Moreover, some students also travel by other buses to schools. Since most of these buses did not ply on Monday, the students preferred to stay at home,” Machchindra Kadam, the educational officer (secondary_, Nashik Zilla Parishad, said. While this affected about 40% of the students, the number of absentees is likely to go up from Tuesday if the MSRTC staff strike continues. “I had to take my daughter to the school as the online studies had affected her education.

---||Nagpur||Haven’t told my mother yet: Bhoyar on joining Congress||The reason that BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar’s induction in the Congress has garnered so much interest is because of his RSS background. A committed Sangh worker and long-time BJP politician, that too from the city of RSS headquarters, crossing over to the most unlikeliest of choices is a story that many find intriguing. In a free-flowing conversation with TOI, Bhoyar, a qualified homeopath, talks about his decision. Excerpts from the interview...You are from a family which is considered to be in the inner circle of Sangh ecosystem, hence your choice to walk out of BJP is shocking.My family has been associated with RSS since 1952, but I do not consider that to be prerequisite for a BJP member. Whether you believe it or not, both things are different. The RSS came decades before BJP was born, so we all need to make that distinction. In fact, it is what I learnt at RSS that made me take the decision of walking out of BJP. We were taught never to tolerate injustice and that’s what was happening in BJP. Were you being targetted there?There are subtle ways of targetting someone, not necessary that it has to be in some harsh way. Not recognizing people for decades of hard work, social work and full dedication to the party is also that only. In BJP there is a rule, “one man, one post”. But I see so many people in BJP who are occupying multiple chairs and nobody says anything. But the moment Bhoyar seeks the same, they start reading me the rule book. Is this justice? But you have been there for years, when did this start?Ever since BJP came to power with a majority in the Centre, things started changing. Their continued electoral success made them blind to the hard work of local party workers. I understand that not everyone can be made a corporator, MLA or MP. But then one person should not also be occupying multiple posts. Your maternal uncle Vilas Dangre is a legendary homeopath, and also a staunch RSS man. How did he react to your decision?Very few people know that since last seven years, when my mamaji lost his eyesight due to health issues, I have been staying with him and taking care of him. We share a very special relationship, like father-son. Just hours before joining the Congress on Sunday, I told him of my decision. He asked me to think over it, but then I told him what all has happened with me in the party. In the end, he was convinced that I have taken the right decision. How about your spouse, children and mother?I haven’t told my mother yet, but obviously now she will come to know. My mother comes from a staunch RSS background and was a corporator herself. I don’t think she will immediately understand this decision of mine. As far as my wife and children are concerned, their perspective will be different because they have seen what happened with me in the party. Your family is so close to top BJP netas, no one called to stop you?Nobody. I think some of them are happy to see me go (laughs). It was only yesterday that a few people called, but not from those whom you would expect.Some people wonder if you will go back to BJP later.Till the day I die, I shall not leave Congress. That’s a promise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/havent-told-my-mother-yet-bhoyar-on-joining-congress/articleshow/87855251.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

In the complaint to the police, the woman’s elder daughter Kumari Anuj Yadav stated that two of the masked miscreants entered their house on Monday afternoon and shot the woman. The miscreants’ pictures have been captured in CCTV installed on the road near the house. Police have launched a search for the miscreants. As per reports, Pushpa Yadav wife of late Dayanand Yadav lived in Sidhuapar of Badhalganj area. Four years ago her husband died of cardiac arrest after which she was looking after her husband’s business in Thailand. During Covid pandemic she came to her ancestral house in Gorakhpur. On Monday morning she had returned from Delhi after renewal of her passport. At around 12 o’clock Pushpa was at home with her teenage daughter Preeti when three persons knocked at her door. As soon as she opened the door, two of the miscreants entered the house. One of them placed a packet of fruits on a bed while the other shot at her head with his pistol killing her on the spot. Hearing the gun shot Preeti came out of her room and found her mother soaked in blood. She raised an alarm but by that time the miscreants had escaped. The neighbours informed the police. The police reached the spot along with the forensic team. Kumari Anuj told the police that she was in school with her sister Puja and brother Ritik at the time of incident. She claimed involvement of her father’s brother in the murder due to property dispute. On the basis of the complaint police have registered a case under sections 302 (muder), 120b (criminal conspiracy), 452 (house trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) IPC against five named and three unidentified persons. “The picture of the assailants has been captured in CCTV in which they are seen going on a motorcycle but their face is covered with a mask. Police are searching for them and have started the investigation,” said SP South Arun Kumar Singh. The woman is survived by four children, Kumari Anuj (16), Puja (14), Rtitik (13) and Preeti (10).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/woman-shot-by-three-men-police-launch-search/articleshow/87856013.cms||---
---||Kochi||SIA report recommends rehabilitation of people||Thiruvananthapuram: The district administration has published the social impact assessment (SIA) study as part of the land acquisition for realignment of Parvathy Puthanar at Panathara. The study by the institute of rural development has recommended rehabilitation of people who will be evicted from Panathura, Koonamthuruthu and Kilayantemudumbu. As much as 54.105 ares of land belonging to 16 individuals will be acquired for the project. Besides a weighing bridge, a KSEB transformer, a tea shop and a coconut extract processing unit will also be affected. Opening the filled-up portion and setting up a lifting bridge at Panathura and constructing a new road bridge at Vazhamuttom are the two options which were put forward for implementing the scheme. A portion of the land of Panathura Sree Subrahmaniya Swamy Temple will also be affected. The administrative committee has already communicated that once the land is acquired, there won’t be sufficient plot to undertake any developmental activities. As per the report, there won’t be any environmental issues arising out of this project. The land has to be acquired from families who are dependent on the coir sector and this would affect their livelihood. The deadlock at Panathura has posed complex hurdles ahead of the ambitious government project to re-establish the navigational channel along Parvathy Puthanar and waterway connecting Kovalam to Akkulam. On either side of the stretch lies the canal, stagnant and clogged. For the project to make a headway, the canal will have to cut through the road, necessitating acquisition of a portion of land to attain the desired width for the navigational channel. While the original idea was to cut the road and connect two ends of the canal, the residents had opposed the move saying that it would affect religious festivities related to nearby Panathura temple and access for residents. The residents had raised an objection by citing a parallel path connecting Koonamthuruthu and Chenthilakkari by which ends of the canal could be connected. The officials estimate that going by this route would mean covering 800m and acquiring 7.5 acres of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sia-report-recommends-rehabilitation-of-people/articleshow/87856022.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Justice Chandiwal heads the commission probing charges of corruption against Deshmukh. Palande is in jail after his arrest by the ED in a money laundering case. Chawdhari argued that Singh has been declared a proclaimed offender and that the power of attorney submitted by Singh lacks relevant details. Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino said notwithstanding the former Mumbai CP’s contention, it can’t be treated as a bar for her right to cross-examine the witness. On October 27, Singh had submitted an affidavit saying since he does not intend to cross examine or make fresh submissions, his personal presence is not necessary. She drew the attention of the Commission to Singh’s signature on a cheque and the purported signature on the power of attorney file to show there was a difference. Singh’s counsel Abhinav Chandrachud said he will take instructions from his client to file a clear affidavit withdrawing certain paragraphs from the earlier affidavit. The commission kept in abeyance the application for issuance of a non-bailable warrant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-secys-counsel-urges-chandiwal-panel-to-issue-warrant/articleshow/87856740.cms||---

While praising the CM, Nadda said when Yogi came to power in 2017, he gave all the rights including revenue status to Vantangia villages. “Please tell your elders about the work done by BJP so that they can give blessings to the BJP government for a long time in the future,” Nadda said. While attacking the opposition and Congress party Nadda said, “When leaders like Yogi Baba come to power, all kinds of facilities reach the people. Planting trees is a work of welfare but you can see the difference in governments. Earlier when you planted trees, Congress party tried to oust you from the forest in Maharajganj, but when Yogi came to power, your life improved.” The party president said he is fortunate to see how development has taken place with the right leader, right party and right people. When wrong people come to power, the development turns into a disaster. People must try to understand who stopped them from building pucca houses,” he added. He also appealed to people to press the right button. While speaking on the occasion CM said, “The president of the biggest party in the country has come to meet you. It is the same party that brought a new light of independence in your life.” “Before 2017, you were not able to get basic amenities and the houses were of mud and hay. Around 17-18 years ago, I opened a school in Jungle Tinkonia number 3 Vantangia village and had to face a court case.” CM said the welfare of poor can’t be done with mere speeches but with work and now the villagers have got pucca houses in place of mud and hay houses. “Today you have got facilities like pucca house, ration, approval for land, potable water, health care and school. Independence came to you in real sense now. PM Modi is making the idea of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’ true,” CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/when-leaders-like-yogi-baba-come-to-power-all-facilities-reach-people-nadda/articleshow/87856020.cms||---

He already has two advisors, retired IAS DB Gupta and Arvind Mayaram,” said Rathore, who called Gehlot the weakest CM who needs eight advisors to run the government. He called the appointment ‘post of profit’ which the elected representative cannot hold while quoting decision of the high court of Sikkim. He questioned the expenses which will be borne on them by the state as they will be treated as equivalent to the state ministers. “Every minister is entitled to receive certain privileges which cost the exchequer Rs 20 lakh per month. It includes house rent, vehicles, staff etc. Gehlot has hired six white elephants which are unconstitutional,” said Rathore. He added that the position of ‘advisor’ and ‘parliamentary secretaries’ doesn’t exist in any law. He also shot a letter to governor Kalraj Mishra demanding his office to raise objection on the appointment of advisors. “These appointments are purely done out of political compulsion and it will only promote the corruption in the state,” said Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-neta-rathore-calls-appointment-of-advisors-to-cm-unconstitutional/articleshow/87857490.cms||---

Shivangi Bagthariya, all decked up in a shimmering red sari and bridal jewellery, added a welcome change to the usual tension-filled atmosphere of the examination hall.

Later, talking to reporters Bagthariya told reporters that both the families supported her decision. “When the date of my marriage was finalized, the examination schedule wasn’t declared. As luck would have it, the date as well as the morning muhurat of marriage clashed with my examination,” Bagthariya said. “I asked my parents as well my would-be husband’s family to tweak the muhurat so I can take the exam,” she added. The two families too supported Bagthariya’s decision. “Education is a must for all, including women. Parents and girls should give importance to education,” Bagthariya added.

Even handover notes are being prepared without the involvement of the sub-committee members,” Telangana engineer-in-chief (irrigation) C Muralidhar said. Muralidhar dashed off a letter to GRMB chairman J Chandrashekhar Iyer on Monday, raising objections over taking over of the projects by the board as per the gazette notification issued by the Union ministry of water resources without following the norms. “The Telangana government would facilitate the visit of any personnel of the board’s secretariat but shall not accept view of such officers’ visits without any direction from the board,” he said. The state government said it had requested the GRMB to take over the projects in a phased manner initially to establish the implementation procedures and protocols. “We have also brought to the notice of the chairman that handing over or taking over of the projects during the period of water regulation would adversely affect the function of water regulation,” he said. Muralidhar said there were no common projects in Godavari basin except Peddavagu medium irrigation project catering to both states. It was also categorically stated that the cross regulator on Kakatiya Canal near Geesukonda town under Sriram Sagar Project and cross regulator on canal from Kondapochamma Sagar and cross regulator after bifurcation point towards Gandhamalla reservoir under Kaleshwaram project were serving exclusively for Telangana territory. “Drawals are being monitored at the canal headworks.

Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said on Monday, “On PK’s tip-off, the cops on Monday arrested Kanhaiya Lal Singh, the kingpin of a Chandauli-based gang of solvers. Kanhaiya was operating with PK’s help in this region along with his accomplice Kranti Kaushal for several years. Both Kanhaiya and Kranti were arrested on Monday.” Kanhaiya, a native of Baretha village under Chunar police station of Mirzapur district, is employed as a technician in the small irrigation department in Chandauli while Kranti runs a cyber café in Chaitaipur area of Varanasi,” the CP said, adding, “Both were arrested from Singhpur by-pass road. An SUV besides original marksheets and other documents of five women, many fake documents and admit cards of different competitive exams were also recovered from their possession.” “They fell in police net after ‘PK’ divulged the names of kingpins of the solvers’ gangs being run parallel to his own gang with his help in different parts of the country,” the CP said, adding that after lodging a separate case against Kanhaiya and Kranti, the Sarnath police produced them before court. Police also applied to get Kanhaiya in police custody. Accepting the plea, the court ordered a five-day police remand for interrogation. Kanhaiya was in ‘PK’s’ contact for over six years. He was supporting many gangs in different parts of the country, including Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow, in running parallel gangs of solvers. These gangs were involved in NEET besides other competitive exams of recruitment of teachers, ANM and even those conducted by the Public Service Commission after getting contracts from aspirants, police said. Police added, following ‘PK’s’ arrest along with his accomplice Ritesh on November 18, a local court had on November 20 ordered to send him on a seven-day police custody for detailed investigation. With the beginning of detailed interrogation, ‘PK’ started revealing how his network was operating in different parts of the country with the help of parallelly running gangs of solvers. Police are expecting exposure of more gangs in contact with ‘PK’ in the next couple of days. The Patna-based solvers’ gang of ‘PK’ was busted during NEET (UG)-2021 here on September 12. He and close aide Ritesh were arrested by the Sarnath police, a few hours after the announcement of a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh on him. Both of them were sent to jail after producing before the court. Before ‘PK’, other members of his gang, including a medico of KGMU Osama Shahid, Abhay Kumar Mehta, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia, Raju Kumar of Jehanabad in Bihar and father of an aspirant Tapan Saha from Tripura had been arrested. The arrests started after the gang was busted by the police with the arrest of one Juli Kumari and her mother Babita Devi of Patna on September 12 from a NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under the limits of Sarnath police station in Varanasi. During a police investigation, it came to light that 25 aspirants of NEET 2021 were in contact with this gang and 16 of them had appeared in it at different centres while nine skipped the exam.

The overall air quality index (AQI) was 311 on Monday in comparison to 349 on Sunday. AQI is likely to touch the “poor” category on Tuesday, but may deteriorate again on Wednesday as wind speeds may slow down. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “Wind speed reached 15-25kmph. It was mostly westerly winds and visibility also improved to 1,500-3,200m. An analysis of hour-to-hour visibility and wind speed data from November 1 to 22 shows Monday was the only day so far in the month when Palam reported visibility of more than 3,000m and such strong winds.” Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead of Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “While Delhi’s air quality remained in the upper end of ‘very poor’ category for the past one week, it improved marginally on Monday due to relatively stronger surface winds in the afternoon hours, which are favourable for pollutant dispersion.” According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting body, the share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 was just 6% and effective fire count 909. “These strong winds are likely to continue on Tuesday, leading to further improvement of AQI air quality to the ‘poor’ category. It is likely to improve to ‘poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’ categories for the next two days.” From Wednesday, the air quality is predicted to deteriorate as local and transport level winds are likely to slow down, stated SAFAR. It will result in slight deterioration of air quality but expected to be within the “lower end of very poor” range, it added. “Given that meteorology plays a crucial role in influencing the city’s air quality, the Delhi government should actively make use of insights from IITM’s early warning system to plan and execute pre-emptive measures in advance to keep pollution levels under control,” Ganguly said. In the coming days, with declining temperatures, the contribution from local biomass burning for warming needs may see a rise, she pointed out. “Local authorities should take immediate measures to ensure that Delhi’s homeless have access to warm clothes and blankets, and that security personnel have access to electric heaters,” Ganguly added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winds-of-change-may-boost-aqi-to-poor/articleshow/87856782.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The marriage of Michael, one of the family members, is scheduled to be held in January. “One fine morning, we lost our house and we are now shuttling between relatives’ house and relief camp. A week ago, we were busy planning for the marriage. We have talked to the bride’s family and they understand what we are going through,” Mary Shyja, the eldest daughter of Peter who owns the house. Michael is the son of Peter. The 12-member family of Peter at Kottapuram had a narrow escape last week as the compound wall and flight of steps of their house caved in, leaving the house precariously perched on the edge. Six children, including twins aged 2.5-years old, were in the house when the incident happened. “ It was 21 years ago that we managed to build a house. The debts are still being paid for this house. The studies of the children have also been affected,” said Mary Shyja. The family says that they need a permanent residence . Revenue authorities have promised the family that sufficient aid would be given. At the onset of rains, they had kept their certificates and identity cards in a separate file. A few months ago, cracks had developed in the house and renovation was done recently. Officials with the revenue and corporation are planning of ways to provide housing to a few families who live in locations prone to such dangers. The family, however, said that while evacuation often happens fast, rehabilitation remains a distant dream.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rehab-a-distant-dream-for-this-12-member-family/articleshow/87856034.cms||---

DEFB is an export incentive scheme. The main accused, Krishan Kumar Gupta, and others had committed a fraud of Rs 2 crore. Special judge SU Wadgaonkar also convicted and sentenced Sudhir B Mandal, accused of helping Gupta, to three years in jail and imposed a fine of Rs 2 Lakh on him. Two others, dismissed Bank of India employees Vasant M Parkhe, the then cashier in charge, and Sunil B Jadhav, the then cashier clerk, were sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 1 lakh each. The duo were removed from service in 2002. The other accused are all in their 60s. The CBI economic offences wing’s (EOW) special public prosecutor Jitendra Kumar Sharma cited the evidence of 51 witnesses to seek conviction of the accused. All accused were out on bail. In March 2003, the CBI (EOW) had registered an FIR under sections of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act on the basis of information against 11 fictitious companies, Gupta, Mandal and other unknown officials of customs, Mumbai, and Bank of India, Cotton Exchange branch. It was alleged that Gupta and Mandal, along with the customs and bank officials, entered into criminal conspiracy, the object of which was to cheat the government by dishonestly claiming “customs duty drawback” from the customs department by submitting forged export documents. The probe agency further alleged the 11 fictitious firms were used to prepare false export documents in their names and by submitting such documents to the customs department, 26 customs duty drawback cheques aggregating to more than Rs 2 crore were obtained. It was alleged these cheques, drawn in the names of the firms, were deposited in Bank of India, Cotton Exchange branch, in the account of Vijay Trading Co., Mandal’s proprietary firm, on Gupta’s instructions. The investigating agency further alleged that the “duty drawback” amount fraudulently obtained has been utilized by Gupta and Mandal for their wrongful gains. It was further alleged Bank of India officials colluded with Gupta and Mandal by accepting account payee duty drawback cheques issued in the names of 11 fictitious firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spl-cbi-court-fines-bizman-rs-10-2cr-in-export-sops-scam/articleshow/87857939.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kochi||Kerala: Isolated heavy rains in six districts on Thursday||KOCHI: The India meteorological department (IMD) has said that there will be an increase in rainfall activity over south peninsular India from Thursday. It has issued alerts for isolated heavy rainfall for Thursday and Friday. Isolated heavy rainfall is expected in six districts on Thursday. They include Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam and Idukki. More districts are on yellow alert on Friday, including Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad. This is due to the influence of a couple of weather systems. A cyclonic circulation lies over southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhoods in lower tropospheric levels. It is very likely to move west-northwestwards towards Tamil Nadu coast during next 4-5 days. Similarly, a trough runs from the cyclonic circulation southeast Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood to Tamil Nadu coast in lower tropospheric levels. Due to these conditions, thunderstorms with lightning are very likely to occur at one or two places over Kerala from Wednesday to Friday. Strong winds (speed reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60 kmph) are very likely over east central and adjoining the west central Arabian Sea. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/isolated-heavy-rains-in-six-districts-on-thursday/articleshow/87856774.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 13 months after youth’s death, dad succeeds in filing FIR against road contractor||NAGPUR: After a struggle of 13 months, retired banker Bhanudas Jiwane, 68, has succeeded in filing an FIR against road contractor Rajesh Godhani in the death of his only son on September 22, 2020. But with cops having registered only a bailable offence against the contractor, Jiwane said his fight against “injustice” isn’t over yet. Bhanudas’s son Pratik, who was 32, sustained serious head injuries after his bike skidded on pebbles and gravel lying on an under-construction stretch of Besa-Ghogli Road on September 16 last year. Pratik’s helmet had slipped off his head during the fall. He died six days later. The family had a harrowing time ensuring the best treatment for Pratik amid the Covid-19 pandemic. They had to spend days and nights outside the hospital on the road. Even after Pratik’s death, the family was made to run from one police station to another. Dhantoli police station, refusing to register offence under zero FIR, asked the family to approach Hudkeshwar or Beltarodi cops but both refused to register offence. Though Beltarodi police had recovered Pratik’s bike and tiffin from the spot, they were unwilling to take a complaint, said the Jiwanes. It was only after Bhanudas refused to conduct the last rites of his son that Beltarodi police “reluctantly” registered accidental death. Bhanudas repeatedly sent correspondence to Beltarodi police to register an offence but each time they rejected it on some or the other pretext. “I filed an RTI query seeking details of investigations by the Beltarodi police. Shockingly, they claimed to have missed out on some important formalities at the accident spot,” he said. “There was no signboard warning about diversion or work underway. There was no light or reflectors. My son misjudged it to be a smooth road and likely drove on the pebbles or gravel leading to the accident,” said Bhanudas. A letter to the commissioner of police too did not yield any positive outcome. Bhanudas said he sought intervention of the Lokayukt after which the police department might have started taking his complaints seriously. “On Saturday, we got a call from the ACP office to record statement for registration of offence,” said Bhanudas. Bhanudas was egged on in his fight for justice by wife Nirmala and daughter Wrucha. “There seemed to have been more accidents at the spots, as some broken number plates were found,” said Wrucha. When it was mentioned to him that offence registered under section 304 A of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for causing death due to negligence is bailable, Bhanudas said he wasn’t surprised. “Police are shielding the road contractor,” he said and added even the government engineers and department heads concerned, who were supposed to oversee the work, cannot escape liability. Additional commissioner, NMC, Ram Joshi said Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) has been instructed to take action on violators for keeping or stocking building or construction materials on carriageways. “We issue notices to violators and also seize materials. Even police can take action as leaving such building or construction materials on the roads is a crime of obstruction to traffic and also public nuisance,” said Joshi. He adds NDS teams also have to focus on other priorities too. Senior inspector Chandrashekhar Yadav of Beltarodi police station said there was delay in registering the offence due to the prolonged inquiry. “The aggrieved family had approached the human rights body,” he said, adding the case would be taken to its logical end. Additional public prosecutor Prashant Sakhare said section 304A of IPC is bailable. “If convicted, the court can sentence the guilty to imprisonment, which may extend to two years or fine or both,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-months-after-youths-death-dad-succeeds-in-filing-fir-against-road-contractor/articleshow/87856754.cms||Soumitra Bose

This was jointly organised by Bruit du Frigo — a non-profit organisation based out of Bordeaux, France — and Alliance Francaise. This team of adventure sports enthusiasts, cutting across ages — right from mid-20s to the 80s — covered a distance of 52 km in four days and unearthed places that have, so far, been known very few locals. “This trail was a revelation for me. Despite staying in Hyderabad all my life, I have never seen such places,” said Krishna Murthy, who took part in the trail on all four days. Describing their walk through a path, from Durgam Cheruvu to Khajaguda, with mountains on both sides, Murthy said it was “mesmerising”. “It made me realise that Hyderabad is not just about Charminar, Golconda, or other such well-known places. It is also about natural formations that are unexplored,” he added. The four trails comprised — Quarry lake trail (Gajularamaram - Quarry), Old city lake trail (Pahadi Shareef - Umda Sagar), Boulder trail (Jubilee hills- Khajaguda), and Dargah trail (Moula Ali - Kohe Imam Zamin. On Tuesday, a workshop will be conducted with the participants to map the trails and discuss the main points of interest. On November 26, a public exhibition will be held to display the content produced during the expedition. Participants said they walked through slums, dump yards and interacted with locals as part of the trail. The ‘secret’ lake they discovered in Kukatpally, they shared, is only five minutes from the Pragathi Nagar lake and is unnamed and unexplored. Speaking about the the reason for organising urban trails in Hyderabad, Hocine Aliouane-Shaw, founding member of the non-profit, said that it was to reveal another side of Hyderabad, which consists of endangered heritage that is not seen, not valued and not protected. “We want to create a network of trails around Hyderabad, bring them to the notice of public and politicians to get them acquainted to these places and rally for preserving the heritage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/walkers-discover-citys-hidden-gems-through-their-urban-trails/articleshow/87857250.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The carcass of the five-year-old lion was found by the forest department near Goradka bus stand in Savarkundla on Monday morning. Forest officials said that the lion was hit by a heavy vehicle probably a truck or a tanker. Chief conservator of forest (wildlife) D T Vasavda said, “The postmortem report confirmed that the lion died due to injuries suffered in a road accident.” An eye witness claimed that the lion was dragged for about 10-feet after it came under the wheels of a heavy vehicle. The lion activists have been contending that the movement of heavy vehicles on highways in Amreli and Gir Somnath districts was posing a bigger threat to the lions which are now moving out of the forest areas. Also, the increased frequency of trucks and trailers on highways due to activities at Pipavav Port in Amreli has added to the concerns. Amreli district alone has about 130 lions, as per the forest department. In March, A lioness was killed after being hit by a truck near the Pipavav Port. A lion died after being hit by a goods train in February in the same district, while in August, a five-year old lion was mowed to death by a goods train near Khadkala village of Amreli. Bhushan Pandya, a wildlife activist said, “The forest department should identify the lion’s corridors and build bridges to avoid such accidents. It should also put speed breakers and fix the speed limit for vehicles on certain roads where there they find a higher movement of lions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-crushed-to-death-by-heavy-vehicle-in-amreli/articleshow/87856066.cms||---

Through the course conducted by the Kerala state literacy mission (KSLM), eight transgender students from the district have passed the exams this year. Nakshatra A C, one of the students, had dropped out of her studies due to teasing from her classmates. She had to leave home as her family did not approve her gender identity. “I was born as Kichu, but I did not want to remain as him. I wanted to live as a woman. I’m disappointed that society has failed to accept the transgender people. I would like to express my gratitude to KSLM for providing us with this opportunity. We have a stitching centre in partnership, which is the primary source of my income. I am not ready to give up anything and my efforts will continue until I get a government job,” said Nakshatra. Shiju S, a 26-year-old Navaikulam native who passed the 10th level equivalency exam, had to stop his education when his parents disapproved of his gender identity. He was abandoned by his family when they came to know about his gender identity. His grandmother looked after him. After her death, he was forced to stop studying and went to work for survival. He has worked in a few houses as a servant. After the results came out, one of his neighbours has offered to look after his tuition fees. “I need to continue my education and want to earn a government job,” said Shiju The experiences of Keerthi Kishore and Biju Kunjatta were no different. Both want to continue learning. They have decided to continue their studies after realizing that they did not get good jobs due to lack of education. Continuous support from teachers made them study well. Kunjatta’s all-time dream is to get a job as a Malayalam teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/equivalency-exam-results-bring-cheers-to-transgender-community/articleshow/87856073.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy heard advocate general BS Prasad, who briefed the court on the steps taken by the government and Rachakonda commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat till now. As per the direction by the court, CBI SP Cephas Kalyan and Bhagwat appeared before it. AG Prasad said that the Rachakonda police commissioner oversaw the inquiry into the Mariamma death case and dismissed three policemen — a sub-inspector and two constables, who were found responsible for the death of the woman.  “Not only dismissal from service, we had even booked criminal cases against the accused cops both under the provisions of the IPC and also certain sections of the SC/STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. We have also provided a job to the kin of Mariamma,” the AG said and urged the court to retain the probe with the state police. “If this bench still feels that a separate agency should look into it, the matter may please be entrusted to CID,” the AG appealed. The state police had registered spectacular progress in matters of policing with its friendly police methods and at this stage, it would be better to keep the probe within the purview of the state police to instil a sense of confidence in them, the AG said. “We will not spare anyone whose involvement is found in the incident,” BS Prasad said. To a query from the bench on the workload the CBI has now, assistant solicitor general N Rajeswara Rao informed the bench that both CBI counsel K Surender and CBI SP Kalyan were before the court. Surender said that they were ready to probe the matter if the court entrusts them with the task. The bench said it would soon pass appropriate orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/let-t-cops-probe-mariamma-case-ag-to-t-high-court/articleshow/87856795.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: At Rs 100/kg, tomatoes a luxury as staples become specialities||HYDERABAD: Rasam, sambar and other dishes have become expensive with tomato prices skyrocketing to Rs 100 per kg in city markets. Incessant rains that lashed neighbouring states, including Andhra Pradesh, have resulted in massive crop loss, triggering a rise in tomato prices. The November rains have also affected the quality of all vegetables. People have to deal with rotten inner layers, smaller size, lack of colour and taste. According to the agricultural marketing department, Hyderabad gets most of its tomatoes from Kurnool, Anantapur and Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh; Solapur in Maharashtra; and Chikbullapur in Karnataka. In fact, Andhra Pradesh, from where the city gets a lion’s share, is the largest producer in the country. Due to rains in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, tomato now costs as much as petrol in the city. “The tomato prices have been on the rise for the past few weeks. Only a month ago, it cost less than Rs 50 per kg. Now, I am able to buy barely half kg of tomatoes for that price,” said Vidya Jyoti, a resident of West Marredpally. Many Telugu households are instead using tamarind as a substitute for tomato. “Tomato is a very key ingredient in Telugu cuisine. From rasam and sambar to dal, Telugu households extensively use tomatoes. Many are now using tamarind as a substitute for tomato,” said Leela Vattipally, a cook. “For the cost that we are paying, the quality of vegetables is poor. Some vegetables such as cauliflower, brinjal are full of worms. In some cases, the size and colour of the vegetables is not up to the mark,” said one consumer. Even vendors are saying that in a box of one quintal of tomatoes, almost five to six kg get wasted due to poor quality of vegetable. “We are buying the vegetable for Rs 80 per kg from Rythu Bazar and are selling it for Rs 100 to be able to get some margin,” said a vendor at Mehdipatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-rs-100/kg-tomatoes-a-luxury-as-staples-become-specialities/articleshow/87857182.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Hyderabad||Telugu-to-French dictionary next on Paris scholar’s agenda||When Daniel Negers travels to Hyderabad next month, high on his agenda will be a series of meetings with Telugu academics. The objective: To accelerate the process of compiling a 1,500-page Telugu to French dictionary, for the European reader base. He is also hoping for an audience with Telangana’s IT minister, K T Rama Rao. In October, Negers made headlines after meeting KTR in Paris and winning the latter’s appreciation for his love and exhaustive knowledge of Telugu. When in the city, Negers wants to discuss with the minister the possibility of organising a Telugu cultural celebration in Paris, in 2023. “It is a very rich Indian language with great historical significance. Yet, unfortunately, not many in European countries are familiar with Telugu. They know about Hindi, Tamil, Bengali and even Urdu to an extent, but not Telugu. I want this to change,” said the professor over telephone from Paris where is associated with the Department of South Asia and Himalayan Studies at the National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilisations. While Negers conducts an introductory module on Telugu at the institute – it teaches over 100 languages from across the globe -- defining the basic aspects of Indian culture and society, it still does not have many takers. “The handful that sign up for it every year are mostly advanced students already familiar with Indian culture and history, sometimes Indian themselves or those with some ancestral connection. At times, we have overseas French speaking students from Mauritius, Finland or Italy, apart from mainland France, who show interest in the language,” he said, sharing a string of ideas he has in mind to popularise the language that first piqued his interest in the 1980s. It was when he stayed with family in Peddapuram, East Godavari, for a field study on language and culture. The Burrakatha (an oral storytelling form) narrative, Negers recalls, was “a crucial element in understanding various aspects of folk culture”. Hours of education and scores of translations later, the French professor now wants to dedicate himself to propagating the language he has loved for about four decades. He has another interesting proposition: To document the temples of Telangana and AP, in the wake of Ramappa winning the world heritage tag status. “I am already doing some work on the Leepakshi temple (Anantapur). So, when I visit in December I will try and speak to authorities to see if we can compile a broader text in French including Ramappa, Bhadrachalam and other temples. That will not only help in educating people about culture of the land but also boost temple tourism in the two states,” Negers added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-to-french-dictionary-next-on-paris-scholars-agenda/articleshow/87857151.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

As part of the plan, AMR stakeholders have been identified as departments of health and family welfare (hospitals & medical colleges), animal husbandry, dairy development, fisheries (veterinary hospitals, food institutes/labs) and environment and forests (TSPCB). The agriculture, food, civil supplies, drug administration, higher education, public health, municipal and universities and research institutes (all sectors) would have a role too. “So far, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have come up with plans. Antimicrobial resistance and strategies to address it are now a global and national priority and has also been identified as a priority by Telangana government,” Infection Control Academy of India president Dr Ranga Reddy Burri said. “Antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective as drug-resistance spreads globally, leading to more difficulties in treating infections,” he added. Infection Control Academy of India along with WHO country office, UNICEF, ReACT Asis Pacific, University of Hyderabad and several other stakeholders are currently working on the issue. While increase in antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide issue, cases are seen on a daily basis in big hospitals in the city. Citing the example of a 45-year-old who had come for treatment after remaining hospitalised for 15 days, Dr Monalisa Sahu, consultant infectious diseases, Yashoda Hospitals said, “An MDR bug was isolated from the patient’s blood. He succumbed after two days of isolation of the bacteria despite the administration of available antibiotics.” “Indiscriminate use of antibiotics and sometimes without appropriate indications, in acute care settings, contributes largely to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms.... The drug resistance among fungi is also increasing,” the specialist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-putting-in-place-action-plan-to-tackle-amr/articleshow/87857226.cms||Amrita Didyala

The committee, following its inspection wherein it found several buildings to be unauthorised, also recommended action against officials who permitted such constructions. “Local bodies or gram panchayats do not have power to approve layout plan. As per the Act, HMDA is the competent authority for approval of any layout plan. After approval of layout plan, the same will be sent to local body for release to layout owners on collection of local body charges,” the committee said. A joint inspection was conducted by revenue and irrigation officials along the nine-metre buffer zone on either side of Pandena Vagu. Structures constructed in Puppalaguda and Neknampur were identified. “Some of the buildings are unauthorised and some were permitted by the then Puppalaguda gram panchayat on assumption of the draft layout plan approved by HMDA in 1990. The draft layout plan was cancelled in 1997 by HMDA,” said the committee. “In case of unauthorised buildings and building constructed encroaching nala and its buffer zone, the Manikonda municipal commissioner has to take immediate action for demolition of encroached portion by following due procedure under the Act,” the joint committee went on to say. The committee said that in the case of buildings permitted by the Puppalaguda gram panchayat in open spaces of HMDA-approved draft layout, the municipal commissioner should revoke building permissions by issuing show-cause notices to building owners. “After revocation of building permission granted earlier the municipal commissioner shall take further action for demolition of buildings by following due process of law,” the committee report said. The committee had members from the Telangana State Leven Impact Assessment Authority, state pollution control board, HDMA and Gandipet revenue department. “Action should be initiated on the persons responsible for granting building permissions in the layout open space and nalas, buffer zone. District collector Rangareddy shall be asked to take action,” recommended the committee. The NGT joint committee recommeded the issuing of show-cause notices to building owners who had previously gotten permissions to construct buildings on the nala area||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/demolish-illegal-bldgs-on-musi-nalas-ngt-committee/articleshow/87857267.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

He also recounted what he termed as ‘sacrifices’ he had made for the sake of the SP. “We are ready to merge with the SP. If this does not happen within a week, we will hold a conference in Lucknow and take a decision after consulting our people,” Shivpal said while addressing a gathering during the ‘dangal’ (wrestling comptition) held at Chandgiram Stadium in Saifai to mark his elder brother’s birthday. “Our priority is to forge an alliance with the SP. On Netaji’s (Mulayam’s) birthday, the people of the entire state were hoping for an alliance. Whatever happens, it should be quick,” he added. Shivpal further said, “Netaji’ has not only taught us, but has also taught us the stakes of wrestling and the tricks of politics too. There is strength in unity. If there is division in the family, then there are many drawbacks. We want 100 seats for our supporters, but now we have backed down. We bowed down. It has been two years today saying this, but nothing has been finalized yet.” “Along with the alliance, give tickets to those who are in a win-win situation, we are ready for a merger. Samajwadi Party should contest on 303 seats. If PSPL wins only 50 seats given to it, the government will be formed in 2022 only. It is getting late now for an alliance or merger.” The PSPL chief said that he has always made sacrifices. “If I wanted, I could have become the chief minister in the year 2003, but I had called Netaji from Delhi and made him the chief minister. Nearly 40 MLAs from other parties were gathered. At that time, 25 MLAs of BJP were also with us. Ajit Singh, Kalyan Singh were also with us.” Shivpal did not stop here, he said, “When Mayawati was the chief minister and our people were being oppressed, I was the leader of the opposition, how much we had opposed them and did many agitations, due to the struggle of us and the workers, the government of the year 2012 was formed.” Earlier, people used to call our party a small party, but after the ‘Samajik Parivartan Yatra’ rolled out from Mathura, people have come to know that we are no longer a small party. Even today, our priority is the Samajwadi Party, he said. Taking a jibe at the Centre, he said that the condition of the country is not good at this time. “Farmers, labourers, youth, weavers are all troubled under the BJP government. Inflation is at its peak. If strength comes in our hands, a son or daughter will get a government job in every family. There will be no shortage of fertilizers for the farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-pspl-merger-or-alliance-should-happen-within-a-week-says-shivpal/articleshow/87856052.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Nizam’s kin lays claim on five royal palaces||HYDERABAD: A grandson of Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad on Monday filed a civil suit in a city court seeking a share in five royal palaces including the iconic Falaknuma Palace, now in the possession of Nizam’s another grandson Mukarram Jah. Najaf Ali Khan, one of the grandsons of Mir Osman Ali Khan, alleged that Mukarram Jah, the titular Nizam VIII of Hyderabad, had executed a document informing their grandfather that he (Jah) came to know about the execution of the gift deeds in his favour and expressed his unwillingness to accept the gift. Hence, Mukarram Jah, who allegedly rejected the gift of Mir Osman Ali Khan, has no right to claim sole ownership of the five palaces - Falaknuma Palace, King Kothi Palace, Chow Mahalla Palace and Purani Haveli in Hyderabad and Harewood and Cedars Bungalow in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. In his case filed before the city civil court, Hyderabad, Najaf Ali Khan through his advocates Mohammad Adnan Shaheed and others stated that after Hyderabad State was integrated into India on January 25, 1950 an Instrument of Accession was entered into between the Government of India and Osman Ali Khan, Nizam VII, for merger of Hyderabad into Union of India “By virtue of this agreement the listed private and personal properties belonging to the Nizam VII were approved, declared and acknowledged by the Union of India to be the private and personal properties of Nizam VII. The properties which were entered in the said list were still in existence at the time of the death of the Nizam VII on February 24, 1967. After his death it was supposed to devolve upon his 16 sons and 18 daughters,” Najaf Ali said alleging that instead the properties are now controlled by Mukarram Jah. He said in the suit that in 1957 the Nizam VII gifted the properties to Mukarram Jah through gift deeds. At that time he was not present in India. “In reference to the said gifts Mukarram Jah executed a document informing the Nizam VII that he came to know about the execution of the gift deeds in his favour. He expressed his unwillingness to accept the gift for the reasons that he was unsure of his future and considered himself incapable to maintain the gifted properties with the meagre income that he had,” Najaf Ali claimed in his petition. He alleged that Mukarram Jah orally gifted the properties back to the Nizam VII and he himself executed a memorandum acknowledging the oral gift. He said with great difficulties he brought to light the existence of the gift refusal letter and memorandum of oral gift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizams-kin-lays-claim-on-five-royal-palaces/articleshow/87856787.cms||Syed Akbar

The couple, identified as K Murali and his wife Rani, alleged that they were abused and insulted by Gudivada circle inspector Durga Rao after they filed a complaint related to a family dispute. According to Gudivada police, the couple filed a complaint claiming that their daughter-in-law was restricting them from meeting their grandson ever since their son died a few months ago. Their son had ended his life over some marital dispute. Around three weeks ago, their daughter-in-law gave birth to a baby boy but they weren’t allowed to see him. Cops tried to counsel the family by holding a meeting between the couple and their daughter-in-law and later suggested to approach the court as the matter is a civil issue. The couple alleged that Durga behaved rudely and abused them, which forced them to decide to end their lives. Fortunately, their family members rushed them to Vijayawada government general hospital at the right time. Their condition is said to be stable now. A departmental inquiry by a DSP-rank officer has been initiated based on Murali and Rani’s claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/elderly-couple-blame-police-attempt-suicide/articleshow/87856038.cms||---

Students of classes X and XII will attend school from the campus three days a week school. Last week, students of IX to XII followed staggered timings to attend school from Tuesday to Saturday, as earlier announced by the education department. “We could have either continued with the staggered timings for all IX to XII so that they could attend school five days a week or it could have been three days a week for he four classes. Only two days a week at school could be a problem for IX and XI in completing the syllabus,” said the headmaster of a state-funded school. Taltala High School headmaster Rittick Kundu said teachers were ready to take classes on Saturdays. “Students have suffered a lot due to the prolonged shutdown. It is now time to make up. We are following alternate-day routine for XI and XII and regular classes for IX and X,” he said. When schools reopened, the education department had asked classes IX and XI to work from 9.30am to 3.30pm and X and XII from 10.30am to 4.30pm. The class schedule was changed as several teachers had complained to district inspectors about long teaching hours. But teachers in Kolkata schools said it did not make sense to keep schools open on Saturdays for awareness programmes, guardians’ feedback and orientation programmes but not hold academic classes. Following the weekend review, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education issued a notice on Sunday, saying all classes would have the same timing though IX and XI classes would be on days alternate to that of X and XII. Some schools are still struggling to reshuffle the routine as per the new order. City schools, like Scottish Church Collegiate School, which are currently holding offline classes for X and XII don’t have a problem as the other classes, including IX and XI, are being held online. “We need to modify the routine of classes X and XII to follow the new directive. That will take a couple of days to implement,” school principal Bibhas Sanyal said. At Jadavpur Vidyapith, the new routine will be discussed with teachers. “Gaps caused by the Covid restrictions have to be made up,” said headmaster Parimal Bhattacharyya. Science teachers also want practical classes to continue, according to the earlier schedule so that students don’t have a problem while appearing for the boards. Collegium of Assistant Headmasters’ secretary Sudipto Das felt the government could have continued the method followed during the brief reopening in February. “Schools had the freedom to schedule the academics. This time, the government has specified class timings, which is creating confusion,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/difficult-to-finish-ix-xi-syllabi-in-tweaked-schedule/articleshow/87856843.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||No doubt all four accused were major: IO’s advocate||HYDERABAD: Disha rape and murder case investigating officer (IO) V Surender’s advocate has argued before the SC-appointed inquiry commission that there was no doubt about the age of the four accused either at the time of their arrest or during their remand. He cited Aadhaar details of the accused and the prison record as proof to indicate that they were all major and stated that the age mentioned in school records of the accused can’t be trusted as whitener was used at multiple places in the registers to make corrections. Arguing for the IO, advocate Keerthi Kiran Kota stated that the forensic record suggests that rape had taken place. He argued that DNA of the accused was present on the stole (chunni) and the inner-wear of Disha. The advocate argued that the juvenility of the four never came into question till their families filed affidavits before the Commission of Inquiry. He also stated that the accused were majors as per prison records and medical examination record by the doctor at the time of remand. Commission chairman VS Sirpurkar asked the advocate why he did not ask a single question to the doctor, who performed the post-mortem examination, about the age of the four deceased as there were conflicting records of age. The chairman was referring to the school records of the accused, whose entries indicate that three of them were juveniles at the time of the alleged encounter. Kota reiterated that as per Aadhaar cards, the four accused had attained majority. When the chairman pointed out that ACP V Surender had requested the superintendent of Cherlapally prison to accept the four accused in judicial remand without ID proofs on November 30, 2019, advocate Keerthi Kiran Kota argued that the officer had obtained Aadhar copies of the accused on November 29, but due to the law and order situation at the Shadnagar police station, where an angry mob surrounded the station, he could not locate the copies. He further stated that his client was merely discharging his duties on December 6, 2019, and none of the eye-witnesses, including the police party members and the panch witnesses, has disputed that.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Adoption row: Experts collect DNA samples||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A team of medical experts collected the DNA samples of the child – who is involved in the adoption row– from the foster care at Nirmala Bhavan on Monday. The samples of Anupama S Chandran and her partner Ajith, who claimed the baby as theirs, were collected for the matching test at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology. As government refused to accept Anupama’s demand that she should be allowed to see the child, Anupama raised doubts over the possibility of foul play. “How can we believe that the DNA sample was collected from my child? In some previous cases, the samples of child and parents were taken together. When those who created all this chaos are given the responsibility to manage sample collection, they may behave with a vengeance. Authorities should clarify why samples were not collected at one place and at the same time,” she said. Health minister Veena George said government had brought the child here for speedy delivery of justice. “To ensure transparency, the DNA test was not done in Andhra Pradesh. If Anupama is the mother of this child, let her unite with the child at the earliest,” she said. On Anupama’s complaint that authorities refused to let her see the child, George said such permissions could be granted only according to laws. Earlier in the day, Anupama fell unconscious at the protest venue in front of the Child Welfare Council and was given medical aid. Later, she told a TV channel that the minister’s private secretary VN Sajeevan had asked her not to make trouble for the government by seeking action against those responsible for facilitating the ‘forced adoption’. Anupama said Sajeevan spoke in an intimidating tone when she called the minister seeking action against child welfare council general secretary Shiju Khan. This happened three days before she started the protest in front of the council office, she added. The council had given the child to an Andhra couple for foster care on Aug 6. Meanwhile, Khan said that there was no truth in the rumours that the council had no valid licence for facilitating adoption. The court had recently criticized the council for submitting a non-attested copy of its licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/adoption-row-experts-collect-dna-samples/articleshow/87856833.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Evuri Gaurish (16), a first year student. According to Nuzvid police, the incident came to light in the evening after roommates went to check on him in his room. Cops explained that Gaurish, a native of Guntur town, was not responding to his mother’s calls. Hence, she contacted his roommates who went to his place to check on him and found him dead. After the hostel warden alerted the cops, they reached the spot and examined the scene.

---||Hyderabad||After Om Prakash Rajbhar snub, Asaduddin Owaisi looks for new alliances in UP||HYDERABAD: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi’s efforts to stitch up a formidable alliance of non-BJP parties ahead of elections to Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly had suffered a setback after Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) joined hands with Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party recently. The AIMIM was part of Bhagedari Sankalp Morcha, an alliance of nine smaller parties led by Rajbhar. After being dumped mid-way by Rajbhar, Owaisi’s party is now desperately in search of new alliance partners. However, the pre-poll alliance of SBSP with SP is being viewed by political observers as the end of the road for AIMIM’s mission to cobble up a strong alliance to defeat chief minister Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. The three main parties of SP, BSP and Congress are maintaining a safe distance from AIMIM in their bid to not give scope for the saffron party of alleging Muslim appeasement and polarisation of votes. Defending his party’s tie-up with SP, Rajbhar said: “Our intention is to defeat BJP and all the like-minded parties should join hands with them.” Owaisi has been attacking the SP in his speeches during his public meetings in UP. “Muslims have suffered the most during the SP government,” Owaisi was often heard saying at the meetings. AIMIM UP state president Shaukath Ali said without the Majlis party being part of any alliance, the BJP cannot be stopped from storming back to power in UP. Substantiating his claim, he said the SP-BSP alliance could not stop the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Earlier, the SP-Congress alliance was no match to the saffron party in 2017 assembly polls. “Akhilesh does not want to join hands with AIMIM for UP 2022 polls because our party is led by a Muslim leader,” he said. Nevertheless, he said the AIMIM will continue its efforts to form a strong alliance to stop the BJP from regaining power. “If needed, we will contest the polls alone. All the communities which are against the BJP should realise that SP agrees for an alliance with political parties representing Rajbhar community which has 3 per cent population, Maurya Samaj having 2 per cent and Chauhan community 1.5 per cent.” He further said: “Akhilesh does not want to tie up with AIMIM which has the backing of Muslims who comprise 20 percent of the population in UP.” Watch Our support can turn the tables in UP polls 2022, says SBSP chief OP Rajbhar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-rajbhar-snub-owaisi-looks-for-new-alliances-in-up/articleshow/87856830.cms||Roushan Ali

The state's cultural diversity and history remains unexplored in the cinematic world," said Vats, a Haryana native. Talking about his recent movie, 'Gadera', Vats added, "It is set in 1913 and focuses on a guerrilla conflict between the Garhwali and Kumaoni people with the British. It shows the youth of today how their forefathers chased the colonisers out of their forests.” The team is in the finalising stages and in talks with several OTT platforms for the movie release, he added. “It has become easy to reach the target audience through OTT. Even if it’s an unconventional movie, it is easy to have access to it now. For me it’s a matter of pride that more and more filmmakers are now reaching out to explore the state,” said Dev Singh Gariya, an actor from Chamoli. Several filmmakers believe that the state's tourism boost in the last couple of decades is a major reason why the place is chosen for it’s locale. “Many off beat places in the state depend on tourism activities and when we approach these locations for a shoot, the support that we get from locals is amazing. For my last project we shot in both Garhwal and Kumaon. I am now working on a script which will be based in Uttarakhand and focus on historical events,” said Billu Paul, a writer and director. Filmmakers are also showcasing their content at art shows and festivals. Another Uttarakhand-based movie, 'Sunpat', will be showcased at the 52nd International film festival in Goa. The movie cast is locally selected and it is made in the local language. Established artists from the state also believe that filmmaking opportunities in Uttarakhand are numerous. given its rich cultural traditions and centuries-old customs and locations which offer much scope for filmmakers.“Bollywood has a strong presence of Uttarakhand natives in different roles of technicians, camera crew etc. I think, in 10 years, we would be able to have our own industry,” said Jubin Nautiyal, singer. “The state has a friendly movie policy and it’s easy to get shooting permissions. Several movies are being shot here and many others are also in the works. We have become a popular shooting destination,” said KS Chauhan, nodal officer, Uttarakhand film development board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-a-go-to-destination-for-young-filmmakers/articleshow/87856088.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The accused — Mohammad Faim Shaikh (24), Mohammad Yusuf Shaikh (45) and Arun Mahadik (37) were arrested for their alleged involvement in the drugs racket. A team of detection of crime branch in Surat, based on specific information, had stopped a truck with Maharashtra registration near Niyol check-post on Monday.

The traders have been complaining about the lack of facilities at the alternative facility. Amicus curiae K Vinay Kumar, who studied the situation at Bata Singaram, said that though the state has provided some facilities, some more need to be provided. To a query from the bench, Vinay opined that it was better to have a public sector super-specialty hospital built on an urgent basis in view of the impending third wave of Covid-19. The bench heard the concerns of the traders and the efforts of the state to mitigate the same and reserved its judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-reserves-verdict-in-fruit-market-case/articleshow/87856834.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An environmental damage compensation of Rs 49,000 has been imposed on the violators. Delhi Pollution Control Committee has issued closure notices to six industries as well for using unapproved fuel. Also, 4,200 vehicles have been booked in the past five days for causing pollution. According to latest data compiled by the environment department, a total of 611 sites having diesel generator sets were inspected from November 17 and of these, eight were found to be using DG sets despite a ban in place. “Our random inspection drive will continue,” said an official of the department. A report compiled by the environment department stated that Delhi Police and the transport department acted against 4,293 vehicles for causing pollution since November 17. These were visibly polluting vehicles or vehicles without PUC. Besides, the agencies impounded 342 vehicles of more than 10 and 15 years old using diesel and petrol, respectively, in the past five days. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said, “Till now, around 4,000 people have been issued a penalty of Rs 10,000 each to encourage everyone to renew their PUC certificates. This is another angle through which vehicle pollution can be curbed. The industries in Delhi running on polluted fuel are also banned, and most industries have been shifted to operate on PNG. But any industry violating this fuel ban will have strict action taken against them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-49000-fine-imposed-for-violating-ban-on-diesel-generator-sets/articleshow/87856849.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Magistrate, medical officer taken to PS due to mob: State counsel||HYDERABAD: State counsel E Uma Maheswara Rao argued that the unprecedented mob situation at Shadnagar police station subsequent to the arrest of the four Disha rape and murder case accused had forced police to call the magistrate and the medical officer to the police station to ensure that the accused are safely shifted to prison in judicial remand. He said that on December 6 at Chattanpally, police had no option but to open fire to defend themselves and in result of the exchange of fire, the four accused were killed. The state counsel mentioned that after the Disha rape and murder case, there was a furore and the extraordinary challenging situation where police had to manage the crowd while also conducting the investigation, was unique to the case. To ensure the safety of the accused from the mob, police urged the medical expert and executive magistrate to come to the police station. The commission members asked what was the necessity to take the accused into police custody, move them to a safe house, record a second confessional statement and take them to Chattanpally at 3.30 am on December 6, 2019, when the recovery of Disha’s articles could have been made based on the first confession recorded at Shadnagar PS after the arrest on November 29, 2019. The state counsel answered that the accused were shifted to a safe house as the investigating officer wanted to interrogate and recover the material objects at one go, especially in such a situation of public mood against the accused. He said that the mob continued to follow the accused and even in front of Cherlapally prison, protests were staged. The members of the commission pointed out that the family members have stated that the accused were picked up during the early hours of November 29, 2019 and in the remand case diary it is mentioned that lorry owner P Srinivas Reddy had brought the accused to Shadnagar PS while the police continue to maintain that the accused were apprehended from their villages by SHO Sridhar Kumar in the afternoon. When the state counsel said that the said content in remand case diary was a ‘copy paste mistake’ while referring to the deposition of ACP V Surender, the chairman of the panel said, “this mistake will not hold good.” He also said that it was a false answer by the witness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/magistrate-med-officer-taken-to-ps-due-to-mob-state-counsel/articleshow/87856828.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Mohammed Azam Ali Khan, the complainant, said that he had availed the internet services from ACT by paying a sum of Rs 10,619 on September 30, 2019 for 1000 MBPS speed. He alleged that ACT provided him only 100 to 200 MBPS, which costs only Rs 700 and that the same was not rectified even after bringing the issue to the notice of the firm. Khan said that he asked ACT to disconnect the service and refund his money. Khan claimed that though ACT promised to refund the money and sent a confirmation message and e-mail, it failed to refund the amount. Claiming that he had lost his livelihood and he couldn’t do various online transactions, he filed this complaint seeking compensation. The opposite party admitted the amount paid by the complainant but denied that the speed of the internet was low and pleaded that the complaint is false. They claimed that immediately after receipt of the subscription amount the internet services were provided to the complainant on September 30 and that he used the same without any interruption and complaint till October 17. They said that only for two to three days after the said date due to upgradation of work all the customers’ internet connections were disrupted. They claimed that they asked the complainant to send his bank details to enable the refund, but that Khan did not share the details. The bench noticed that ACT had expressed its willingness to refund the amount but rather than depositing the amount after the first hearing, it continued to contest the matter for two years. Apart from costs, ACT was asked to refund the amount paid, but no compensation was awarded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forum-directs-net-provider-to-pay-over-rs-20k-to-consumer-for-deficient-service/articleshow/87856840.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||‘I did not join politics for power or post’||Former Siddipet district collector P Venkatrama Reddy, who joined the TRS after taking voluntary retirement, says no legal cases are pending against him. Terming KCR as a ‘visionary’, the ex-bureaucrat talks to Koride Mahesh on his decision to join politics and recent controversy over his nomination as an MLC. Why did you decide to join politics after resigning from the collector’s post? In my career, right from revenue divisional officer to collector spanning over 26 years, I have served the people. Even in Siddipet, I have completed land acquisition, 2BHK houses and developmental programmes under the guidance of CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. But being a collector, you have certain limitations but for a politician sky is the limit and can get along closely with the people. Secondly, collector or any other officer can implement only government schemes and execute developmental works. But, being an elected representative, you also get involved in policy making and exchange your ideas with the government. An elected representative acts as a bridge between the people and the government and people and party also. Was it an impulsive decision or a well through out one? Why did you choose TRS for your political career?It was not a sudden decision and I was thinking about joining politics for quite some time now. Having worked in Siddipet and closely watched the CM, I took the decision to take a plunge into politics. KCR introduced popular schemes and not populist schemes as he understands the needs and problems of the people. I can say we have only a handful of such leaders in the country. TRS is a party that realised the dreams of crores of people to achieve a separate state of Telangana. TRS is a party that belongs to Telangana. KCR knows the pulse of the people and has delivered in the past seven-and-a-half years — whether in irrigation, power and land reforms. BJP and Congress are national parties which have failed the country in all the fields. Some political parties have complained to the Election Commission not to consider your nomination as there were cases pending against you? It is true that cases were pending against Siddipet collector. They are not my personal cases. Generally, complaints are filed making the officers as party to the cases. We face several such cases. All the 52 cases pertain to land acquisition for Mallannasagar reservoir and relief and rehabilitation issues. How can they attribute those cases to me personally? The other issue raised by opposition parties is that the state government has accepted your resignation as soon as you sent it.This is a misleading statement by the opposition parties. It wasn’t a special case where the resignation was accepted on the same day. There were several such instances. For instance, former IPS office RS Praveen Kumar’s resignation was accepted immediately. But none of the parties raised objection to that. Why on me? Have you been assured of any cabinet berth by the TRS leadership?I did not join politics for any power or post. Whatever my party boss KCR asks me to do, I will do. Even nomination to the legislative council, I didn’t seek or aspired for that. The party chief decided and I have accepted it. There is a speculation that you will be fielded from Dubbak assembly constituency in the next general elections. What do you say on this?I have good connections with Dubbak people as I worked as a collector and implemented many developmental works. I have no idea about my candidature from Dubbak in the next election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-did-not-join-politics-for-power-or-post/articleshow/87856844.cms||Koride Mahesh

Till the beginning of November, as many as 32,537 pregnant women had received one dose of the vaccine. This number increased to 68,991 after the completion of the data update exercise. As against 1,026 fully vaccinated pregnant women till the beginning of November, the figure has now increased to 3,471. Having said that, the vaccination numbers are miniscule, considering nearly 10-20 lakh pregnant women are there in the state. State immunization officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI, “Several districts had earlier not updated their data on the number of pregnant women they had vaccinated. They were then instructed in the recent online meetings to update the numbers at the earliest.” Desai said as per private doctors, vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women was reducing. “CoWIN, however, does not have a separate category of pregnant women. Therefore, while government sites are reporting vaccination of expectant mothers separately, private sites are clubbing the jabs given to this group with those given to general population under the age-wise categories,” he said. Dr Rajshree Patil, medical officer at Kamala Nehru Hospital, said, “There is a steady number of pregnant women coming to take the jabs. Our site has been inoculating at least two to three expectant mothers every week, which wasn’t the case when jabs for this category were opened up a few months ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inoculated-expecting-moms-count-doubles-after-update/articleshow/87856856.cms||Neha Madaan

After inaugurating a people’s meeting conducted by NCP over the Mullaperiyar issue at Upputhara, Premachandran spoke to media persons where he questioned chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s silence on the dam issue. “The reason for the Mullaperiyar dam case failure was the change of stand. Justice KT Thomas betrayed the state by changing his stand, thus resulting in the failure of the case. The government did not think that Thomas would change his stand while appointing him to the panel,” said Premachandran. “On what basis is Thomas assuring that the present dam will remain intact for 999 years?” he asked. “In Mullaperiyar dam issue, the earlier UDF and LDF governments’ stand was to construct a new dam. But Pinarayi Vijayan changed his stand and his silence about the baby dam tree felling issue shows behind-the-curtain dealings. In the baby dam tree cutting issue, the government showed its willingness to fell trees in the SC affidavit. However, the state ministers claimed to be unaware of the issue. It is needed to find out the backroom DMK-CPM or Pinarayi-Stalin dealings,” he added. Earlier, the state government denied permission to Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose and Premachandran to visit Mullaperiyar dam. They submitted a letter to state chief secretary for the visit but didn’t get a reply, said Kuriakose. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu closed the last opened shutter of Mullaperiyar dam on Monday morning. The water level in Mullaperiyar dam was 141ft at 4pm. There was an average inflow of 1,094cusecs of water while the tunnel discharge was 467cusecs. Water level at Idukki dam was almost steady at 2400.08ft at 4pm on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-lost-case-due-to-change-in-stand/articleshow/87856867.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The reason: many have developed hesitancy after taking the first shot due to some misconceptions, reveals an assessment by district health officers, released on Monday. According to the health department, of the 37.4 lakh population eligible, 17.1 lakh (45%) have been fully vaccinated, while 15.1 lakh (41%) are partially vaccinated with one shot. Of these first dose beneficiaries, about 19% (4 lakh) have not turned up for the second shot, though their 12-16-week gap period is over. “Our analysis shows that 20.9 lakh people should have been fully vaccinated by November 22. However, only 17.1 lakh have completed the course. This leaves 4 lakh people who have taken the first dose, but have not reported for the second one despite completing the gap,” said district immunization officer Dr M K Singh. The health department took feedback through health staff deployed for door-to-door survey. “We have learnt that several misconceptions have developed among first-dose beneficiaries. For instance, some who developed fever after taking the first jab started believing that they had got infected with novel coronavirus. Fever is the most common harmless side-effect of any vaccination, still myths have been generated around it,” said Dr Singh. “There was also a section which felt that only a dose was enough. A few first-dose beneficiary women, who conceived a few weeks after, had a notion that a shot during pregnancy can harm the baby,” he added. “There was also a group which developed some or other health issue after inoculation due to different reasons, but without consulting any expert, assumed it was because of vaccination,” he said. Now, in the door-to-door campaign, the health department is motivating such first-dose beneficiaries to complete their course at the earliest. Service for bedridden people : Bedridden people can get bedside inoculation service. However, to avail of the service, the family of the candidate will have to ensure that there are nine other people to take the vaccine at the same time. “A vaccine vial has 10 doses, hence, once opened, it has to be utilised fully. That’s why we have put the condition of minimum 10 people including the bedridden one. If people can fulfil the condition, they need to simply call at 0522-4523000 and give their address. A mobile vaccination van will be sent to their home for inoculation,” said district immunization officer Dr MK Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/scepticism-hesitancy-keep-2nd-dose-candidates-away/articleshow/87857548.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||ED opposes Hrishikesh’s pre-arrest bail plea, says he participated in laundering||MUMBAI: Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh in the special PMLA court, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) submitted that the latter was an active participant in the laundering of the proceeds of crime. In its reply on Monday, the ED said with the help of Delhi-based shell companies, Hrishikesh (34) assisted his father in laundering tainted money and projected it as untainted by showing it as donation received by the family-owned Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha. It said in February and March this year this amount was Rs.1.7 crore. It said earlier, too, the same modus operandi was adopted by the Deshmukh family and in total Rs 4.18 crore was transferred in the trust in the garb of donation since 2013. Arguments on the plea will be heard on December 4. The ED had said a total of six summons were issued to Hrishikesh but he failed to appear. “Since 2013, the applicant has involved himself in arranging the hawala entries from the shell companies. This fact was also corroborated by a CA (chartered accountant), namely Sudhir Behati,” the ED said. Meanwhile, the ED said accused dismissed cop Sachin Waze had stated he was collecting money on behalf of and on instructions of Anil Deshmukh. “A statement or deposition by a person with bad repute does not end the admissibility of that statement. Further, the fact...is also corroborated by two police officials in their statements,” the ED reply said. The ED alleged Hrishikesh was instrumental in appointing various dummy directors without their knowledge through accused CAs Vishal Khatwani And Vinod Hassani. The ED also alleged Hrishikesh purchased three companies at an undervalued price. “Thus, purchase of these companies appears to be a vehicle for conversion for cash into cheques through these benami gains and in all these activities was done by the applicant (Hrishikesh),” the ED said in its reply submitted through special public prosecutors Shriram Shirsat and Arvind Aghav. Seeking pre-arrest bail through advocates Inderpal B Singh and Aniket Nikam, Hrishikesh’s plea had said the transactions cited by the ED, including an asset created by Anil Deshmukh, relate to about 15 years ago when he was a teenager. It said the predicate offence, the CBI’s case, relates to alleged abuse of position by Deshmukh as home minister but the ED’s probes span several years prior to that tenure. The ED argued money laundering begins the day a property is posed as untainted. “The fact that the applicant had full knowledge that the alleged transaction is from the ‘proceeds of crime’, still he continued to remain beneficiary of the property post maturity clearly establishes his liability retrospectively,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-opposes-hrishikeshs-pre-arrest-bail-plea-says-he-participated-in-laundering/articleshow/87856852.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Constable Sapna Golkar, 25, was seated on a bench when she noticed a commuter, Rashida Khan, losing her balance and getting dragged by a train late on Sunday. Golkar instantly ran towards Khan and pulled her away before she could get seriously injured. Golkar, who was recruited only this year, and she keeps an eagle eye on the ladies compartment while patrolling platforms. “Some travellers are inexperienced and may try to get into a moving train,” she said. This is just what happened at Byculla station around 8 pm on Monday. Khan and her acquaintance tried to board a down Badlapur local just as it started to move. “Khan had come to Byculla to meet an ailing relative who had been hospitalised. Her acquaintance managed to get into the coach but Khan slipped and was dragged by the train,” said an officer. Golkar and a male passenger rushed towards her and pulled her to safety. Exactly one month before this incident, Golkar had been patrolling at Sandhurst Road station when another woman commuter tried to get into a down Badlapur local just as it started to move around 2.15 pm. “I instinctively ran towards the woman traveller before she lost her footing and fell. Seconds after I had pulled her away to safety, the train halted and other travellers gathered to find out if she was hurt. She had no major injury,” said Golkar. Reacting to all the praise that she was getting, the constable said she was only doing her job. “It was my dream to don a uniform as nobody in my family has worked with the police or paramilitary forces,” she said.

Only one of the BSP MLAs who joined the Congress, Rajendra Singh Ghuda, could make it to the ministry. Talking to TOI, he said Pilot was against the merger of BSP into the Congress and independents. Pilot was angry as it was because of them the Gehlot government was saved during his rebellion. He said that it seemed Pilot was able to mislead the high command due to which the independents supporting the government could not make it to the ministry in the reshuffle. He said most of the independent MLAs were Congressmen who contested as independents after they were denied tickets by then PCC president Pilot. The former Congressman alleged that the party could have got more than 150 seats in the assembly election in 2018 had he not denied ticket to winning candidates.

He also added that if the Congress wanted to repeat its government in 2023, Pilot should be kept away and Gehlot should be given a free hand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-advisor-blames-pilot-for-not-giving-ind-mlas-ministries/articleshow/87857552.cms||---

They will not appear in the lentil-based vegetable stew anytime soon with prices of the culinary vegetable hovering at Rs 240 per kg. The price of drumstick has more than doubled from last fortnight to 400% in a month holds no surprise with yield going down drastically with inclement weather in vegetable growing areas that supply to the coastal districts. The prices have seen an upward trend since the beginning of Dasara and never come down even after festivities. The unseasonal rains have seen to that after Deepavali prices have gone further north and not down. The irony is that tomato, which gets thrown by farmers during distress sale, is fetching a princely sum of Rs 110 per kg, that too for inferior variety here. So much so that one hardly gets even skin of the tomato, which lends that tangy taste to the sambar and instead populated with the cheaper varieties of vegetables like ash gourd (Rs 22 per kg), pumpkin (Rs 20 per kg) and yam (Rs 33 per kg) in restaurant sambar. While tomato has breached the century mark, so has capsicum (Rs 112 per kg), carrots (Rs 100 per kg) with other contenders nearing the century mark being double beans and cowpea, ridge gourd, cauliflower, ivy gourd, ladies finger, all in excess of Rs 75 per kg. However, prices of potato and onion have been steady at Rs 32 and Rs 38 respectively. HOPCOMS secretary Ravichandra Shetty says that a fortnight after weather stabilizes there may be some parity, lest this situation will continue with demand outstripping supply, with middlemen cornering profits. “The situation on Monday is such that we got only three tons of vegetables for a five-ton indent. On Tuesday, the indent is for 3-4 tons, and we hope to get at least half of it,” he said. HOPCOMS, which procures vegetables from Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Bengaluru for local distribution, has eight outlets in the city and seven in the other taluks of Dakshina Kannada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/buying-vegetables-turns-expensive-as-prices-soar-above-rs-100-per-kg/articleshow/87856747.cms||Stanley Pinto

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: On Day 3, Khar & Bandra pay double for tankers as pipe repairs continue||MUMBAI: For the third day, parts of Khar and Bandra faced water problems. While repairs were taken up on Monday again, local residents said they had no water or very low pressure for the weekend. Officials said work would be completed by Monday night and supply would be restored on Tuesday. A hydraulic department official said supply may take time to stabilise. “Emergency repairs were taken up on Monday again. While on Saturday we worked on a war-footing and arrested the leakages, there was a need for repairs to be taken up again due to a leakage in the Tansa east main water line, which was done on Monday,” said a civic official, adding that dewatering and assessment of damage was in progress and that repairs/welding will begin soon. Residents continued to pay double for private tankers. Khar resident Anandani Thakoor said they were paying over Rs3,000 for a tanker, which came with muddy water. “We had to purchase mineral water for drinking. There was not a drop of water on the full stretch of 17th Road, Khar, and even getting a tanker meant a long queue. On Saturday evening, we were assured supply would be restored,” said Thakoor. Khar corporator Swapna Mhatre said most tankers charge Rs2,000 and agreed that locals were being overcharged. “In areas which are located at a height water wasn’t available. We are trying to provide tankers to such areas, but it is not adequate,” said Mhatre. BJP corporator Alka Kerkar said BMC should have thought about replacing old and corroded pipes long back by diverting supply. “Almost 25% of the ward I represent has been affected. High time BMC start planing replacement of these old pipelines,” said Kerkar. BMC in a tweet put out on its H west ward handle said, “Emergency repair of major leak of Tansa east water main at Mahim creek is undertaken. Water supply to entire H/W ward continues at low pressure. Supply will be restored to normal pressure after repair completed & Pali hill reservoir is filled again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-day-3-khar-bandra-pay-double-for-tankers-as-pipe-repairs-continue/articleshow/87856862.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Jaipur||‘Never regret, do what you believe, and stand by it’||Be it in social circles, industry gatherings, art and culture forums or startup arena, it’s hard to miss the presence of Mahavir Sharma. Perhaps, he knows how to run his businesses with minimum interference, saving him the time to pursue his passion for networking and startup mentoring. The introvert of the school days says from running his mother’s carpet business to head TiE Global as chairman in 2020 (first Asian to hold the post), the journey owes in good measure to his style of networking. “For me, networking is something very enriching and fulfilling. I don’t do it for monetary gains. I enjoy being a friend to many in my circles, a go to person in emergencies and a believer in win-win deals or projects. Of course, like anything good in life pays off, networking has helped me indirectly,” says Mahavir. From carpet, fashion jewellery, events, to co-founding Rajasthan Angel Investors Network in 2013, to investing in early stage startups, Mahavir straddles a range of sectors and businesses. But he says if India were to become a $5 trillion economy, technology is going to lead the charge. “Technology is the future. That’s why I am planning to launch a Rs 100 crore angel fund by next year. I have invested in 26 startups and am looking to exit from couple of investments as I want to put in 25% of the fund corpus. The rest I will mobilise from TiE fraternity,” says Mahavir. . Mahavir says he is not very optimistic on the carpet business. “My mother was a bold lady. She set up the business in 1973 when people might have expected her to continue as the principal of the girls’ school. She ran the manufacturing unit that employed 500 people. After she passed away in 1994, I did my best. It is surviving because I made a couple of smart decisions. Labour is a big issue. The industry is getting mechanized. So, the space for smaller players is shrinking. Only the big ones will survive,” says Mahavir. After a couple of buyers in the US defaulted on payment, Mahavir took equity in them. He says today 70% of the exports are going to them. “That business is in autopilot mode. During the subprime crisis, some of us got stuck with merchandise. That’s when the three of us decided to serve the domestic market. We opened a showroom in Bangalore,” says Mahavir, who served as chairman of the Carpet Export Promotion Council. After Mahavir lost his brother in 1999, who was looking after manufacturing, he brought his cousin and gave him equity to manage the backend. In jewellery too, he roped in a partner offering 50% equity. “That’s how I am able to find time for mentoring startups and investing in them. The more you teach, the more you learn, the more you give, the more you get, the more you invest the more you earn,” says Mahavir, who heads TiE India Angel Fund. Mahavir says being a founding member of Jaipur Virasat Foundation, JJS and TiE Rajasthan, he was able to hone his networking skills. But more than that he got to learn new things including technology which has become his mainstay now. He says he owes his events business to his networking capabilities. “I don’t have any employees. I have a network of people who could put up any kind of show at any short notice. When JJS started the show, I was entrusted with some of the event work. When TiE Global wanted to do its annual retreat in Jaipur in 2009, I organized it. Till today, I remain the convener of TiE retreat. Then weddings came, though I offer niche services to high-end events,” says Mahavir. Mahavir, who never regrets, says “Do not care about what anyone says, and never regret; do what you believe in at the time and stand by it, always.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/never-regret-do-what-you-believe-and-stand-by-it/articleshow/87857565.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Delhi||Delhi: Ban on construction lifted, but supply remains an issue||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s order to lift the ban on construction activities might benefit only a few because the entry of trucks into the city is still not allowed. Trucks are the lifeline of any construction work as materials are brought by them from the neighbouring states. As construction material can’t be stored in large quantities at most sites, a steady supply is needed to begin work after the week-long ban. Inder Kohli, a resident of Kalkaji and a builder, said the ban had a ripple effect not only on realtors, but also the unorganised sector associated with construction activities. “We support the government’s initiatives to mitigate air pollution, but there are multiple factors contributing to the cause. Just banning construction activities at the last moment or in times of crisis will not serve the purpose in the long term. On the contrary, it will lead to major financial losses to developers, delay completion of projects and affect the economy,” added Kohli. The realtor said his community was thankful that construction was now allowed, but entry of trucks was still prohibited. “We can’t store construction materials as it will lead to pollution. This will automatically increase the cost of projects,” he added. Contractors said if labourers again sat idle, they could disperse or return to their hometowns. Bablu Chaudhary, a contractor from Jawahar Nagar, said construction material was available in some local markets, but at a higher price. “Now that the ban has been lifted, we have decided to start construction work after buying materials at a higher cost. It will lead to financial losses, but we don’t want the labourers to disperse. If they do not get paid regularly or have no work, then they will leave the site. Finding them again in sufficient numbers will lead to further losses,” added Chaudhary. Civic officials said they had forwarded the government order to contractors and asked them to resume work with the materials available. “Except for minor repair works, such as painting, fixing sanitary items and repair of walls, it won’t be possible to start work at major construction sites in a full-fledged manner. Though cement and steel can be procured as it is brought on trains, there’s a shortage of other materials in the local market due to the ban imposed a week ago,” said a North Delhi Municipal Corporation official. “It has become difficult for even contractors working on large projects to procure materials, which is why we have asked them to carry out limited construction activities until the ban is lifted completely,” added the official. A senior South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said the ban was likely to be lifted by the end of this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ban-on-construction-lifted-but-supply-remains-an-issue/articleshow/87856873.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||Ahead of UP assembly polls, seat sharing with smaller parties a big dilemma for Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: To be or not to be, this is the dilemma that Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav faces when it comes to finalising an amicable seat-sharing formula with smaller parties ahead of the state assembly polls. The SP chief has been claiming that the party would win 400 seats. However, the question as to how many seats he can spare and still maintain the confidence of winning 400 seats has apparently put Akhilesh in a Catch-22 situation. As of now, he has announced an alliance with the Bhagidari Morcha, led by the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) of former cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar. According to SP insiders, talks are also in the final stage with Jayant Chaudhary-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia (PSP-L). Other members of Bhagidari Morcha include Rashtriya Uday Party (led by Baburam Pal), Prem Chand Prajapati’s Bhaagidari Party (P), Anil Singh Chauhan’s Rashtra Unnati Party, Satish Chandra Banjara’s Banjara Mahasabha, Khangaar Mahasabha of Gulab Singh Khangaar, Sunil Arkvanshi’s Arkvanshi Mahasangh, Heera Paswan-led Dalit Mahasangh, Prem Chandra Kashyap’s Kashyap Sena Mahasangh and Upekshit Samaj Party, led by Rajkumar Bari. Talking to TOI, a SBSP leader said his party was seeking 22 seats while the Morcha was demanding 35 seats. He said the seat-sharing formula was likely to be finalised by the end of December. However, SBSP national general secretary and son of former OP Rajbhar, Arun Rajbhar, said seat-sharing formula was not an issue. “Even if the Morcha doesn’t get any seat, it would stand with the Samajwadi Party as we all aim to defeat the BJP in the coming elections. SP’s alliance partners will work according to the common minimum programme,” he said. “Come what may, SBSP will not forge an alliance with BJP this time. Not even if they offer us 100 seats,” he said. SBSP got eight seats in an alliance with the BJP in 2017 assembly elections and won four. Rashtriya Lok Dal leaders, on condition of anonymity, said the alliance with the SP was on but for seat-sharing formula. According to them, RLD has put forth the demand for 50 seats while SP is ready to give 35 as of now. RLD national secretary Anil Dubey said, “Our party already has an ideological alliance with the SP. We are in the final stages of political alliance. We have the common goal to defeat the BJP.” “Seat-sharing is not an issue as talks with the SP are in the final stage and RLD is expecting an announcement of alliance with the SP soon,” Dubey said. So far as SP’s ties with Shivpal Yadav’s party is concerned, a PSP-L leader said it was not a matter of two parties but of “meeting of two hearts”. “If the uncle-nephew duo (Shivpal and Akhilesh) agree to join hands, seat-sharing would not be an issue. For now, we have sought 50 seats from the Samajwadi Party,” he said. “Put together, the total seats demanded by the smaller parties comes to 135. At a time when Akhilesh has hit the streets giving a call for change in the 2022 assembly seats, sparing such a huge number of seats could be a Herculean task,” a SP leader said However, senior SP leader Rajendra Chaudhary said there was no dilemma as in-principle alliance with RLD was on. “Talks are on and an alliance would be announced shortly,” he said. About alliance with PSP-L, Chaudhary said, “The intricacies are not known to me but Akhilesh ji has already said that PSP-L would be adjusted in a respectful manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ahead-of-poll-seat-sharing-with-smaller-parties-a-big-dilemma-for-akhilesh/articleshow/87857575.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cong’s Satav elected unopposed to council; contest on cards in Nagpur||Mumbai: Pradnya Satav, widow of senior Congress leader Rajiv Satav, has been elected unopposed to the state legislature council. The byelection was necessitated following the death of Congress’s Sharad Ranpise.Earlier, she was in the zone of consideration for nomination to the Rajya Sabha, of which her husband was earlier a member. However, the Congress then nominated Rajani Patil. In both cases, the elections were unopposed following a decision taken by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. State Congress president Nana Patole and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat had called on Fadnavis and urged unopposed elections, and Fadnavis quickly agreed. The withdrawal of candidature by BJP candidate Sunil Kenekar set the stage for the election of Pragnya Satav unopposed. The last date for withdrawal was November 29, and the bypoll was to be held on December 6. Tuesday is the last day for filing nominations for six seats from the local self-government constituencies. Two seats are from BMC and one each from Dhule-Nandurbar, Kolhapur, Akola and Nagpur. From Mumbai, the elections will most probably be unopposed; as of now, only two candidates, Shiv Sena’s Sachin Shinde and BJP’s Rajhans Singh, have filed their nominations. From Kolhapur, Congress has nominated minister of state for home Satej Patil against BJP’s Amal Mahadik, while from Dhule, BJP has fielded Amrish Patil against Congress nominee Gaurav Wani, and from Akola, Sena has fielded Gopikishan Bajoria against BJP’s Vikas Khandelwal. The Nagpur election is set to be interesting as BJP has fielded former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, while Congress is likely to nominate veteran RSS and BJP activist Chotu Bhoyar who joined Congress on Monday. Bhoyar has been associated with BJP and RSS for well over three decades and was promised nomination from Nagpur, but at the last moment, the BJP nominated Bawankule, prompting Bhoyar to resign from BJP and join the Congress in the presence of city Congress president and MLA Vikas Thakre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congs-satav-elected-unopposed-to-council-contest-on-cards-in-nagpur/articleshow/87857616.cms||---

As per data obtained from regional EPFO, recovery certificates amounting to Rs 17.94 crore were pending. Currently, the EPF office is on a recovery spree. In the last week of October, by freezing the bank account of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, the EPFO recovered outstanding PF dues of Rs 4.18 crore. This was the highest recovery made by the EPFO’s regional commissionerate headquarered at Aurangabad, and also a recovery made from the University after a span of 27 years. PF regional commissioner Jagdish Tambe said the total outstanding amount includes Rs 9.31 crore in outstanding PF, Rs 5.67 crore in penal damages and interest of Rs 2.96 crore. He said the EPFO has decided to recover all the outstanding dues so that employees are not deprived of their rightful share and benefit. The officer said his department has already started working on ways to initiate coercive action, including attachment of properties and even arrest and detention of major defaulters. “In cases involving alleged criminal acts, the Employee Provident Fund Organizatiojn will not hesitate to register police complaints against such employers as well as the organisations, and the next few days will witness some major action against defaulting emplpoyers and organizations ,” he said. Echoing him, Profident Fund inspector Mukteshwar Vyas said notices were being issued. “Due to Covid and the situation arising from the lockdown, the employers’ plea and requests were considered by the department. But now, as things have returned to normalcy, they are expected to pay the provident fund at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-epfo-cracks-down-on-defaulting-employers-plans-to-recover-rs-18-crore-in-dues/articleshow/87855365.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Vadodara||Bite proof: 10 times more potent weapon||Vadodara: Egyptian queen Cleopatra was said to sleep surrounded by a mosquito net. The Romans used vinegar mixtures while Mississippians looked at the American beautyberry plant to protect themselves from the mosquito bites.  In current times, DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toulamide) is widely used as mosquito repellent. Yet, mosquito-borne diseases have time and again raised their ugly heads.  At a time when dengue and chikungunya are on the rise across the country, researchers at M S University have stumbled upon chemical compounds that have superior mosquito repelling property compared with the existing commercial products.  These compounds are much less toxic to the human body compared to the traditional ones which have their own side effects. In fact, they have even got a patent for this compound named lactol. Interestingly, lactol was an accidental discovery while studying plants that animals rub their skin on to keep insects away. “The peculiar structure of lactol created curiosity in our minds. Its structural resemblance was with nepetalic acid, which is a natural product present in catnip oil,” said professor Pradeep Deota from Department of Applied Chemistry of MSU’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering. Interestingly, cats love catnip because it protects them from mosquitoes. Nepetalactone, the essential oil in catnip that gives the plant its characteristic odour, is about 10 times more effective at repelling mosquitoes than DEET – the compound used in most of the commercial insect repellents. “DEET which is the most widely used mosquito repellent has slight toxicity and causes sideeffects such as seizures,” he said. Deota and his PhD student Gautam Patel have prepared a series of chemical compounds lactol (formula-II) and its derivatives (formula-I) that have superior mosquitocidal activity compared with the existing commercial products.  Nepetalic acid and related natural products have insect repellent properties. “Nepetalactones and nepetalactols repel some disease-causing insects. For example, nepetalactols are able to repel Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito or forest mosquito). Felidae (cats) typically hunt other animals by stalking them. This requires being still or slow movements, which allow insects to bite cats more easily. But Felidae (cats) have developed a natural instinct. They keep insects away by licking or rubbing their fur with plants containing nepetalactones,” he said.  “The compounds developed by us possess much lesser cytotoxicity (toxicity to humans) as against existing commercial products such as pyrethroids, organochlorine and organophosphorus compounds,” he said.  The researchers evaluated the mosquitocidal activity of these compounds on Anopheles Culicifacies (one of the major vectors of malaria in Indian subcontinent) using standard WHO-specified adult susceptibility test and tunnel test.  “All the compounds exhibited excellent mosquito repelling activity. Further all these compounds when tested for their cytotoxicity on human lung cell line were found to be much less toxic to human body than existing ones,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bite-proof-10-times-more-potent-weapon/articleshow/87856174.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Delhi||Meet on Nov 24 to review truck entry, reopening of city schools||New Delhi: The Delhi government will conduct a review meeting on Wedensday to decide on reopening schools and allowing entry of CNG trucks, environment minister Gopal Rai said on Monday. The ban on construction sites has been lifted to help labourers, he added. “The ban on trucks from entering Delhi from other states, barring essential services, has been extended till November 26. However, given the improving conditions of the air quality in Delhi, we are considering giving entry to CNG trucks,” Rai said. The joint meeting of the departments concerned will also take up the work from home provision for government employees and the issue of reopening of schools, colleges, training centres and other institutes that have been ordered to remain shut until further notice, the minister said. “All these bans and extensions will be re-evaluated in the joint meeting.” Rai clarified that the ban on construction activities had been lifted due to improvement in air quality and as laborers and daily wage workers were suffering. All sites will have to follow the 14-point guidelines and strict action will be taken against violators, he said. The minister also pointed out that Delhi Disaster Management Authority had allowed standing travel for up to 17 people in DTC and cluster buses and for up to 30 people per Metro coach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/meet-on-nov-24-to-review-truck-entry-reopening-of-city-schools/articleshow/87856903.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Justice MM Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani have ordered the state government to submit a report in this regard within a week. Even after declaring black fungus disease as an epidemic, the public interest litigation regarding lack of proper treatment of patients and shortage of essential medicines will now be heard on November 29. Advocate Siddharth Jain Muntha had filed a PIL saying that the state government had declared black fungus disease epidemic but hospitals did not provide proper treatment.The petitioenr had claimed that injection liposomal amphotericin used in the treatment of the disease was not available in the market whereas doctors issued slips to relatives of patients to bring 40 to 50 injections. In such a situation, patients were dying. The petitioenr also demanded that the state government should give compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the relatives of the patients who died due to black fungus in the absence treatment. During the hearing, ASG RD Rastogi representing the central government informed that the matter of compensation to the dependents of people who died of black fungus is pending in the Supreme Court. He said the issue of arranging medicines was of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/inform-how-many-people-died-of-black-fungus-hc/articleshow/87857594.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu on mission to retrieve education lost in pandemic||CHENNAI: Two children try to blow plastic balls through funnels in their mouths. They try hard and then one of them checks whether the ball is pasted onto the funnel. Another one, not ready to give up yet, blows with all his might. But, the small plastic ball sticks to the funnel. This is no child’s play. The children were doing Bernoulli’s principle experiment under the supervision of R Kaviyarasi, a volunteer, who starts to explain that higher pressure air around the funnel pushes the ball down and keeps it from rising. "Isn’t it fun learning with experiments?" she says to her audience of more than 50 children at Dharkast hamlet on the outskirts of Chennai. Her question is met with a resounding "yes". For children out of the classroom for one-and-a-half years this was a teaser of a lesson that they miss. For the state government, this is a novel attempt to remind students that education goes beyond exams and report cards. Kaviyarasi is among the folk artists who have volunteered to spread the word about the ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ scheme, an ambitious project to not only bridge the learning gap, but also bring back dropouts and strengthen school-level management committees. The government’s target is to reach out to 34 lakh children from Classes I to VIII from 92,297 hamlets across the state. Between August and October, a school education department survey found that around 1.8 lakh students had dropped out during the pandemic. So far, 1.4 lakh students have been identified and enrolled again from Classes I to XII. The remaining 40,000-odd students are yet to be brought back. One of the objectives of ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ scheme is to bring these students back to school again in the next six months with the help of local volunteers. The scheme has been introduced on a pilot basis in 12 districts including Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Dindigul and Erode. Volunteers who have studied till Class XII can teach children studying from Class I to V and graduates can teach children from Class VI to VIII. The ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ scheme is based on the successful Arivoli Iyakkam in the 1990s that was introduced primarily as an adult literacy programme. The pandemic has called for a similar programme that requires state intervention beyond the school curriculum. The scheme also faced its share of criticism after some politicians said it was part of the new education policy and a brainchild of the RSS. R Kaleeswaran, a part-time coordinator of arts and literary unit of Loyola College, says the objective of the ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ is to retrieve education that was lost during the pandemic. "This is an updated and more efficient version of Arivoli Iyakkam, which is focusing on young children studying in government and government-aided schools," says Kaleeswaran, who is also working for the scheme. Hemalatha, a Class V student from Shakti Nagar near Dharkast who could not attend online classes and stayed in touch with studies through weekly assignments from her teachers, is happy that such a programme will help her catch up in school. "My school was closed when I was in Class III. I am looking forward to the additional help," says the daughter of daily wagers. The state plans to have ‘Illam Thedi Kalvi’ centres where children will be taught after school through experiments and other activities. Real-life experiments and the informal nature of the programme will allow students to raise doubts that are otherwise left unasked. A school education official says, "Volunteers under the ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ scheme will not be part of schools. They will complement what is taught in class." The centres under the scheme are expected to start functioning from the first week of December, and the volunteers will be selected after thorough background checks. The word about the ‘Illam thedi kalvi’ scheme is being spread in an innovative way. The government has created 413 folk arts groups who will start an awareness campaign among students from November 23 across the state. The districts where the pilot project has begun, the campaign style is like a surprise show of laughter and learning. For instance, at Naduveerapattu, a village 7km from Tambaram, volunteers performed a dance and drama at the local bus stand. A few of them with drums made their way through the bylanes with a banner to announce the street play about the new scheme to gather a crowd for the final announcement about the scheme. The street play sends out the message through songs and jokes about the loss of learning during the pandemic, addiction to gadgets and touch upon innovative learning methods in which students learn by counting stars. Sister Josephine, headmistress of RCM primary school in Tharkkas near Dharkast, says many of her students could not afford smartphones. "More than 90% of them have basic phones. So, it was not possible to conduct online classes. We gave them weekly assignments and asked them to watch Kalvi TV," she says. K Kurinji, a teacher working at a government school near Guduvanchery, said, a statewide government intervention programme is mandatory as some students have forgotten to read and write in the past 18 months. "If the learning gap is not bridged now, these students will be the potential dropouts in future as they may not be able to cope. So, having someone to help them with their lessons would be ideal," she says, especially since two-teacher schools cannot ensure individual attention to students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/state-on-a-mission-to-retrieve-education-lost-in-the-pandemic/articleshow/87856897.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh board: Around 28,000 apply to reappear in class 10 & 12 exams||PRAYAGRAJ: Following the UP board's decision to give a second chance to the students of class 10th and 12th (academies session 2020-21) to reappear along with the main exam that the board would be conducting next year, around 28,000 students have applied to appear in the exam. These are students who were not satisfied with the board's evaluation process and the marks awarded to them for promotion to the next class because of the pandemic. Such students would be appearing in the exams along with the main exams of class 10th and 12th board conducted by the board in 2022. The board had given one more chance to the dissatisfied students and fixed the last date for online registration of classes 9 and 11 and online filling of 10 and 12 examination forms till November 20. Earlier, till November 8, a total of 51,27,743 students had applied for class 10th-12th exams and 58,40,608 had registered for classes 9 and 11. After the extended last date (November 20), about 58.53 lakh students have filled the form for classes 9 and 11 and 51.55 lakh for classes 10 and 12. It is clear that about 13,000 applications have increased in classes 9 and 11 and about 28,000 for appearing in the second chance exam for improving their marks. This also means that 3,132 students of high school and 7,690 students of inter have again filled the form for the 2022 examination, who failed in the marks correction examination held from September 18 to October 6. Even then, 17,000 such students have applied for class 10th-12th, who were dissatisfied with the result declared on July 31 but could not apply for the marks improvement examination. Earlier, last week, taking a big decision in the interest of students, the state government has given one more chance to the students, who were promoted in high school and intermediate without examination in 2021 during the Covid pandemic, to appear in the board examination of 2022 free of cost, if they were unhappy with their results. The certificate-cum-mark sheet of 2021 will be provided only to those registered students from 2021 who opt to appear in the 2022 edition of the high school and intermediate exams. Many students of high school and intermediate have already availed their chance at the marks improvement examination held from September 18 to October 6, 2021. All the promoted students, except those who have passed the marks improvement examination-2021, will be allowed to appear in class 10 and class 12 examinations of 2022 free of cost. In the board exam results of 2021, as many as 1,44,744 students, including 82,238 students of high school and 62,506 students of intermediate do not have marks on their mark sheets but were promoted. These students had been running to their schools as well approaching district inspectors of schools (DIOSs), regional offices of the UP Board and also UP Board headquarters demanding a solution. The decision by the state and the board was a major relief for the students. It is worth noting that earlier, the last date for advance registration of classes 9 and 11, as well as for filling up the forms for classes 10 and 12 examinations-2022 was November 8, following two extensions already provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/around-28k-apply-to-appear-in-class-10-12-examsafter-up-boards-second-chance-to-students-of-20-21/articleshow/87856178.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Balbeer Giri visiting temples in Prayagraj to pray for justice for his guru||Prayagraj: The newly anointed Mahant of Baghambari Gadhi Math, Balbeer Giri, has been visiting the various temples of Prayagraj and neighbouring districts since the day he was anointed as the Mahant of Baghamabri Math, to express his gratitude for the opportunity given to him to serve the people of Prayagraj and is praying for justice for his departed guru Mahant Narendra Giri. Balbeer Giri also said that Prayagraj is replete with historical and religious places and sites and that he wants to visit the many temples in Prayagraj and offer prayers in memory of his departed Guru Mahant Narendra Giri. “From the very next day when I was given the task of succeeding my Guru (Mahant Narendra Giri), I have been visiting several of the temples and religious places in Prayagraj. The Mahabharat mentions that there are many religious sites in the holy land of Prayagraj. Unfortunately, we have forgotten our age-old traditions and treasures and hardly any people visit the many prominent pilgrimage sites apart from the very well known places in Prayagraj that most have been to. I aim to not miss any big or small religious site in and around Prayagraj to thank the gods and goddesses," said Mahant Balbeer Giri while talking to TOI on Monday. Giri further said that apart from peace to the soul of his guru, the visits to the temples, Abhishekam and other rituals are being practised by him with the wish that the culprits of his departed guru are punished. "Whoever is guilty, should be punished and that is why I am visiting temples of Lord Shiva continuously”, he added. In the sequence, Giri has worshipped several of the Shiva temples including Dashashmedh Temple, Someshwar Mahadev Temple, Padila Mahadev etc. Last week, he was in Varanasi to visit the Kashi Vishvanath temple. “Seven ‘Vedpathi’ brahmins are always by my side while performing Abhishekem for the peace of my departed guru’s soul”, said Giri. “If the religious gurus give speeches from place to place, then the younger generation will learn to give speeches. But at the same time, if religious leaders promote the rich culture and believe in their righteous Karma, the younger generation will also learn to believe in Karma rather than just preaching and that is what I am doing”, said Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/balbeer-giri-visiting-temples-in-prayagraj-to-pray-for-justice-for-his-guru/articleshow/87856184.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Protest against order sealing petrol pump||Aurangabad: A day after a fuel station was sealed for failing to check vaccination certificates of customers and ensuring they wore masks before dispensing fuel, the Petrol Dealers’ Association (PDA) of Aurangabad on Monday demanded that the order be rescinded. The association held a long meeting with its members on Monday and later said it would approach the high court if the order sealing the petrol pump is not withdrawn. The district collector, Sunil Chavan, on Sunday night spotted the alleged violations of his orders – to sell fuel only to customers wearing masks and carrying vaccination certificates – at Baba Petrol Pump. He issued an order to the district supply office and got it sealed. The action did not go down well with the PDA, which has been opposing Chavan’s order asking the petrol pumps to sell fuel only to those customers who are masked and carrying vaccination certificates. PDA president Aqil Abbas told TOI, “We have been saying that all fuel stations have enough space to accommodate a team of health workers who can not only check vaccination certificates of the customers, but also vaccinate those who have not been vaccinated so far.” He said the fuel station staffers, who have been trying to enforce such orders, have got into heated arguments with the customers. In addition to this, the PDA, pointing out a “major loophole” in the collector’s order, said that when they insist that customers display vaccination certificates, they were found getting them from their family members and friends, and claiming they were theirs. PDA’s Hiten Patel said that on Monday, after making it mandatory to display the vaccination certificate, barely anyone returned due to lack of certificate, as all the customers showed the certificates to staffers. Another fuel station owner said, “Many customers are in a hurry and if our staffers ask them to show their vaccination certificates, people get upset and even abusive with staffers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/protest-against-order-sealing-petrol-pump/articleshow/87855374.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Javed Akhtar is the chief guest at the inauguration, and the Mahasangh said it had no objection to the choice of the chief guest. The 94th Sammelan will be inaugurated by noted novelist Vishwas Patil. “We had said any move to invite Akhtar to inaugurate would not be tolerated as he is not a Marathi litterateur.

---||Delhi||How construction sites are causing congestion, adding to pollution load||NEW DELHI: The laying of a 220KV power cable by Delhi Transco Ltd opposite Alaknanda market has badly affected the movement of traffic there. The excavated soil on the site lies unevenly covered against the prevailing anti-pollution imperative to prevent dust from blowing. Vehicular emissions due to their slowing down of traffic on the blocked road are adding to the pollution load in the area. Though Delhi government has lifted the ban on construction sites, digging work has impacted the smooth movement of vehicles. When TOI visited the site on Monday, it found that the ongoing work was the cause of congestion most of the time, with the condition aggravating during the peak traffic hours. A parking attendant at Alaknanda market said, “Due to the ongoing construction work, the traffic moves at a snail’s pace during the peak hours in the morning and evening. In those hours, it becomes difficult for vehicles to move from the parking lane because of the lack of space.” Bishwadev Majumdar, a bank employee, said there were dust clouds almost all the time and traffic snarls on the route every day. Similarly, the work of laying power cables by Delhi Transco Ltd on Outer Ring Road near Munirka causes congestion on the stretch during the rush hours. The construction site was following all guidelines issued by the environment department to control dust pollution, but traffic pollution wasn’t under check. Experts said a proper strategy was required at large construction sites that impede traffic flow. Amit Bhatt, executive director, Integrated Transport, World Resources Institute-India, said, “When someone is outdoors, the individual is exposed to pollutants higher than the overall air quality of the city as that person is in direct contact with emissions from vehicles. If their travel time increases due to congestion, the commuter is exposed to poor air for additional time. Hence, it is necessary for authorities to ensure smooth flow of traffic and reduced travel times.” Bhatt added, “The big projects should come up with a strategy to manage the mobility during construction activities, especially when the air quality is in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ categories. Proper traffic management measures are needed, such as deployment of additional traffic marshals or diversion of the traffic to different routes.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, concurred that large-scale construction and road work need to be better timed to avoid the peak winter pollution period. “From the past trends and forecasts, we now know how winter pollution behaves and the need to avoid certain things,” she said. “Moreover, such works not only contribute to local pollution, but also aggravate congestion and, so vehicular emissions that increase the particulate load during bad air days.” Responding to queries, a Delhi Transco official claimed, “The work of laying power cables was halted after the ban on construction activity. However, all guidelines to control dust, like covering the soil and sprinkling water on it are being followed. The deadline to complete the project is April next year, but we have targeted a completion date of March 31. However, we will finish the work on the stretch between Tughlakabad extension and Masjid Moth within a month.” The official added, “The work at a site begins after coordination with land-owning agencies and Delhi police. The contractor of the project deploys its own marshal to help people for proper flow of traffic.” According to the Decision Support System, which has been developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, to forecast the sources of local and regional pollution that can impact Delhi’s air, the contribution of transport to the city’s PM2.5 load was likely around 25.5% and that of construction around 3.5% on Tuesday at 8.30pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-construction-sites-are-causing-congestion-adding-to-pollution-load/articleshow/87856910.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

In an open inquiry, the ACB gives an opportunity to a public servant to debunk allegations. If the team finds substance in the charges, the ACB can register an FIR. The open inquiries are being held after complaints by police inspectors Anup Dange and Bhimrao Ghadge. Dange, attached to the D B Marg police station, has alleged that Singh suspended him and ordered a departmental inquiry in 2020 to shield a Mumbai pub owner in a criminal case.

---||Chennai||Beware of highs and lows of online diabetes treatment||By Dr A RamachandranHealthcare has not been the same since pandemic. With restricted movement and hospital resources focusing on Covid, other illnesses had taken a back seat. Against this backdrop, the migration of healthcare to online alternatives has been seamless. A proliferation of health apps, however raises the question, whether they are safe and scientific? The explosive growth of the internet has facilitated fast and heavy flow of information. Many online apps disseminate second-hand information available online, without consulting experts. As there is no audit on health information available on the internet, it is important to screen apps before taking advice from them. These apps are popular because of their advertisement strategies rather than their medical expertise. These apps deliver advice, mostly from machines which use computer algorithms to send generic information. Diabetes, being a lifelong disorder, people seek different kinds of remedies, some of them even promising a cure. However, it needs the attention of doctors on a case-to-case basis. The control of diabetes is to be accompanied by maintenance of appropriate body weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This is called a multifactorial approach and goes a long way in preventing complications. The barrier to management is the high dropout rates from periodical assessment. This is common, especially in India, where there is no structured healthcare system for non-communicable diseases. The International Diabetes Federation has proposed ‘Access to diabetes care’, as its theme for the next two years, as millions of people with diabetes, especially in low and middle income countries do not have access to any sort of diabetes care. A hospital visit involves time, travel and expenditure. A person with diabetes has to go to a crowded laboratory facility to get blood tests done. This for many is becoming an issue at a time when we are battling with Covid-19. All these hassles can be eliminated through online consultation. The frequency of consultations can be enhanced and continuous follow-up can be ensured. Recently the Union ministry of health and family welfare facilitated telemedicine. The ministry also has put out regulations for online treatment platforms. Diabetes can be effectively treated with a hybrid model. In this scenario, the periodical checks such as blood tests, checks for body weight and blood pressure can be performed in the comfort of the patient’s home with the help of an expert laboratory technician. The results can be made available online and an online appointment fixed with a diabetologist for a prescription. This is called a hybrid model as it involves physical visit by a technician and provides total diabetes care including delivery of medicines. The diabetes team can offer care along with a dietitian and a diabetes educator on an online platform. Therefore, people with diabetes have to choose the right apps which can deliver reliable medical advice. Choose one which is supported by professionals and treatment for diabetes treatment is delivered by qualified experts on the field. This model also saves cost and encourages regular assessment. The power of the internet in expanding reach is exponential. But it is on the user to select a reliable app to ensure diabetes care is efficient and effective.

The committee comprising three paediatricians, two doctors of AIIMS-Jodhpur, was directed to submit its report in a month. The court order followed a PIL by Dr Mithilesh Kumar Gautam. The petition pointed out that in December 2019, about 109 newborn babies died in Kota's JK Lon Hospital. The government hospital lacked adequate medical facilities for infants. Necessary infrastructure like ventilators and warmers were not working or lacking. The children were also exposed to cold due to the broken glass of the ICU windows which led to the deaths. AAG Ganesh Parihar, on behalf of the state government, said most of the children who died were earlier being treated in private hospitals. Their families had admitted the children to JK Lon only when their condition worsened. There was no shortage of resources in the hospital, but the children could not be saved as they were admitted in critical condition. On this, Justice MM Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani constituted a committee of five doctors and ordered its report within a month. After the incident, the state government had formed a committee of four doctors which gave a clean chit to the hospital and denied any medical negligence. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/doc-team-to-probe-newborn-deaths-in-kota-hosp-in-2019/articleshow/87857596.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many informal workers yet to get state govt Covid-19 aid||Mumbai: Six months after MVA government announced a one-time aid of Rs1,500 to construction and domestic workers and auto drivers, it is still to reach all beneficiaries. Lack of Aadhaar cards, bank details and lapsed registrations are some hurdles in disbursing aid, officials said. The aid was announced in May in light of hardships faced by those in the informal sector due to Covid. The state transport department wants to return the balance as applications have ceased to come in. “We received Rs 108 crore from state government to be disbursed and so far have disbursed Rs 38 crore. We received 4.13 lakh applications and have paid 2.54 lakh applicants. There are around 62,000 applications pending for want of bank details,” transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said. Dhakne said the department set up kiosks at RTO offices for Aadhaar card enrollment, coordinated with post offices to enable opening of zero balance accounts. The department is not receiving more applications though there are 7.15 lakh registered auto drivers. “Auto drivers want us to disburse money offline. We cannot do it as there is likelihood of bogus beneficiaries. We asked the government if we can return the money after keeping aside some for pending 62,000 applications,” Dhakne said.  In the case of 1.05 lakh domestic workers registered with government, 45,000 received aid. Many registration lapsed, said officials. Registration needs to be renewed annually or it lapses. The government has directed the labour department to give aid to all registered. “We only have bank details of those registered post-2014. We asked domestic workers’ union to register workers online at https://public.mlwb.in/public,” said Suneeta Mhaikar, deputy commissioner. Around 11.79 lakh of 13 lakh registered construction workers received aid. Incorrect bank account details, inoperative accounts are reasons for others being unable to get the amount, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-informal-workers-yet-to-get-state-govt-covid-19-aid/articleshow/87856914.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nagpur||Soon, 14 new sniffers to join India’s wildlife dog force||Nagpur: India’s fight against wildlife crime got further boost when 14 young wildlife sniffer dogs, also known as ‘Super Sniffers, along with their 28 handlers will join the force after completing a seven-month-long training course in Haryana. Since 2008, Maharashtra has received 10 sniffers and will get three more for Amravati, Gondia, and Pandharkawda forest divisions, two each will join Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Odisha forests, and one each will be for Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu forest departments. Two sniffers will join Railway Protection Force (RPF). The latest unit of wildlife sniffer dogs passed out from the Basic Training Centre Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (BTC-ITBP) camp in Panchkula (Haryana), and is the ninth batch to be trained since the launch of TRAFFIC and WWF India’s pioneering wildlife sniffer dog training programme in 2008. To date, 88 wildlife sniffer dog squads have been trained. This programme was carefully designed to accommodate both basic obedience and detection skills specifically to combat the illegal wildlife trade. The dogs were taught to detect tiger and leopard skin, elephant tusk, skin, and antlers of spotted deer and sambar at the training institute. The trainers used small-sized wildlife articles to accustom the dogs to find targets with low scent concentration in these complex environments. TRAFFIC’s India office head Dr Saket Badola said, “The sniffer dogs trained under the programme are working relentlessly in tough terrains and have so far assisted the agencies in over 400 wildlife crime cases. The response from the forest departments to deploy and use ‘Super Sniffers’ to control wildlife crime has been overwhelming.” Badola said, “Other agencies such as the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Customs are also interested in deploying wildlife sniffer dogs. We hope that in the coming years, wildlife sniffer dogs will be used by more enforcement agencies, who are mandated to protect and conserve India’s wildlife.” The two dog squads will be deployed by the Southern and West Central regions of Indian Railways under TRAFFIC’s newly formed alliance with the RPF. Last year, the RPF deployed two specialized wildlife sniffer dog squads for the first time in India to curb the smuggling of wildlife contraband through the extensive railway network. Ravi Singh, secretary-general & CEO, WWF India, said, “Starting with just two wildlife sniffer dogs in 2008, today that number has grown to 88. The dedication and commitment of the wildlife sniffer dog squads are admirable, and the dogs have been a game-changer in the efforts against wildlife crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soon-14-new-sniffers-to-join-indias-wildlife-dog-force/articleshow/87854619.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Pune||Maharashtra govt schools roll out self-evaluation this week||PUNE: Over one lakh state government schools will begin the self-evaluation programme under the Union government’s Shaala Siddhi programme from this week. The training to school teachers for this year’s programme will be conducted by the MSCERT from Tuesday. Experts in the field have said there has been a three-year gap on external evaluation of schools under the same scheme. The education officials said that the external evaluation would begin only when they receive approval from the Union government. Joint director at MSCERT, Vikas Garad, said, “Self-evaluation is considered as the nucleus of the school evaluation process. It facilitates the school to evaluate its critical performance areas. Each school needs to follow the guidelines to make accurate professional judgement.” The duration of the self-evaluation process may range from two to six months according to the context, size and need of the school. All the schools are expected to complete the self-evaluation process and upload the dashboard as and when they are ready. However, all the schools need to comply with the deadline for the self-evaluation process as decided by the state. As part of the SSEF, a school evaluation dashboard, e-Samiksha has been developed to facilitate each school to provide a consolidated evaluation report, including areas prioritized for improvement. The dashboard is developed both in print and digitized format. Garad said, “The dashboard obtained from each school will be consolidated at cluster, block, district, state and national level for identifying school-specific needs and common areas of intervention to improve school performance. A web-portal and cellphone app on school standards and evaluation are in the process of development.” Founder of Shikshan Hakka, Matin Mujawar, said, “The self-evaluation by the schools will have meaning only when external evaluators cross-check the facts during the second phase of this programme which has not happened for three years.” The self-evaluation intends to empower the school to recognize its strengths and areas of improvement in a planned and guided manner. It also aims at creating a collaborative culture with participation of all stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-govt-schools-roll-out-self-evaluation-this-week/articleshow/87856913.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Justice MM Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani issued the order on a petition by Specially abled Persons Welfare and Rehabilitation Committee's advocate Anil Kumar Sharma. It has been said in the petition that specially trained teachers were needed for the education of specially abled people, including disabled, blind, deaf and dumb and mentally challenged. As per rules, there should be one teacher for every five children, but in Sikar district itself , there is only one teacher for 193 children. There are about 70,000 children in the entire state for whom only about 250 teachers are available. Even in private schools, there is no arrangement for the education of such children, due to which they have to drop out. It was pointed out that in the Right to Education Act too, such children were being ignored. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/specially-abled-children-ignored-hc-seeks-reply/articleshow/87857610.cms||---

The development has not gone down well with AIMIM state president and MP Imtiaz Jaleel, who called the police decision discriminatory and resulting from bias towards his party. BKC police station’s senior inspector Sachin Mane, while turning down the request seeking permission for a mega rally at the MMRDA ground, cited three reasons. The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, has cited fresh surge in Covid cases, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s letter on the restrictions on holding of gatherings and programmes at its open place, and the recent violence in Amaravati and Malegaon, as the grounds for denying permission. AIMIM, as a show of strength, on November 27 had decided to hold a mega gathering at the MMRDA ground and was to be addressed by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, his brother and MLA Akbar Owaisi, MP and Maharashtra president Imtiaz Jaleel. As a preparation for the gathering, AIMIM had lined up a series of programmes in each district of Maharashtra, so that party workers from across the state were roped in. Upset, Jaleel asked when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray can hold a Dasara melava, why is the AIMIM not allowed to organise a gathering. “The state government is well aware that we are set to raise important issues of Muslim reservation and encroachment and usurping of waqf properties. As people in government want to deny the rights of Muslim and backward communities, permission is denied.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aimim-fumes-as-mumbai-cops-deny-rally-permission/articleshow/87855398.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In his two-minute address to thousands of party workers who had gathered at the SP headquarters to wish the party founder on his 83rd birthday, Mulayam started with thanking the young workers for their enthusiasm with which they were celebrating his birthday. As young party workers raised the slogan of Mulayam Singh Yadav Zindabad (Hail Mulayam), he waved at the workers and said, “Aap ne jis tarah se humara samman kiya hai, swagat kiya hai … iske liye main apka bahut aabhaari rahunga. Aapko vishwas dilata hoon, jo asha humse karte ho, main asha poori kar ke dikhaunga (I am thankful for the manner in which you have welcomed me. I assure you that I will fulfil the expectations you have from me).” Praising young workers for their enthusiasm on the political front, he said, “In naujawano mein kitna utsah hai, josh hai. Ye naujawan humare desh mein ab pariwartan ki rajneeti jo chal rahi hai, us pariwartan ki rajneeti ko aap kamyab banayenge (Look at the enthusiasm of these youths. They will take forward the politics of change prevailing in the country).” As Mulayam’s visit to the party office was unscheduled given his health concerns, his appearance came as an added encouragement to the excited party workers who had arranged for a 83kg laddoo and a cake, which were cut by Mulayam and distributed among party workers and the poor. Party leaders had even arranged for a horse-driven buggy to ferry Mulayam from his residence to the party headquarters but Mulayam reached the party office lawns in an SUV due to security reasons. As Mulayam got on to the stage, his son Akhilesh touched his feet to seek his blessings and then helped him to the podium. Party’s principal general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav welcomed the SP patriarch by offering him a shawl as Mulayam made himself comfortable on a chair flanked by his teacher Udai Pratap Singh and son Akhilesh Yadav. Senior politicians, including leader of the opposition in the state assembly, Ram Govind Chaudhary, and in the council, Ahmed Hasan, were also present. Samajwadi Party leader Arman Khan organised a special camp outside the party headquarters and distributed sweets and lunch packets to the poor and the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/youth-will-make-politics-of-change-successful-says-mulayam-on-bday/articleshow/87857606.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

These prototypes are part of the 300 low-floor buses that were approved by the Delhi cabinet in March. “The 300 buses that are being engaged are from two different bus manufacturers and three prototype buses out of these will arrive this week. After inspection and necessary approvals, these will be deployed for trial runs,” said an official who didn’t wish to be identified. “The buses and drivers will be provided by private entities and DTC will operate these on its routes and deploy its conductors. The rest of 297 electric buses will arrive in different batches and have a separate colour scheme,” he said. The electric buses shall be parked at depots in Rohini, Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Rajghat and Mundela Kalan. The two bus depots at Rohini and the one at Mundela Kalan are ready and have been provided power connectivity through transformers for charging of the buses. According to the schedule, 118 buses were to arrive in October, 100 by November and 60 buses by December 2021. The remaining 20 buses were scheduled to arrive by January 2022. The devastating second wave of Covid-19 cases, however, affected the delivery of electric buses and the creation of supporting infrastructure such as charging stations at designated bus depots. The private entities, which would maintain the e-buses, will be paid operating cost per kilometre under ‘Operating Expenses’ model. The bus depots with most of the primary infrastructure and power connectivity have been created separately for electric buses and will be handed over to the private entities, who will bring the required paraphernalia. The replacement of the battery will be the obligation of the private entity, which is generally done after 5 years, and the cost of electricity consumption will be borne by DTC. While the Delhi government plans to induct total 1,000 e-buses under the Cluster Scheme too, the DTC Board approved the induction of 1,015 electric buses and 230 CNG-run buses in the financial year 2021-22 in a recent meeting chaired by Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot, who is also the DTC chairman. The Delhi government plans to eventually replace all CNG-run buses in the national capital’s public transport fleet with electric buses as part of a shift towards cleaner fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-get-its-first-lot-of-electric-ac-buses-this-wk/articleshow/87856929.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The high court had in July said “that the malpractice and illegality committed by the home minister was only to be investigated and there was no direction to investigation generally in transfer and postings’’ and yet the State was by seeking a special investigation team (SIT) now to impede and delay its valid probe against Anil Deshmukh.

Mamata, before leaving for Delhi on Monday, said the Tripura issue "cannot remain confined to Tripura". "It will be raised in Delhi, Mumbai and elsewhere," she added. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, too, reached Delhi on Monday after meeting party leaders in Agartala. TMC national spokesperson Saket Gokhale wrote to National Human Rights Commission chairperson Arun Mishra for a fact-finding committee to be sent to Tripura like it was done for Bengal. A few hours after these developments in Agartala and Delhi, a chief judicial magistrate's court granted bail to Trinamool Youth Congress president and actor Saayoni Ghosh. Cops had slapped Ghosh with cases relating to attempted murder, attacking religion, trying to instigate riots and criminal conspiracy. "Only two of the sections slapped on her were non-bailable. The court found no ingredients that could have led to these penal sections," Ghosh's lawyer said. Monday's developments started with 17 TMC MPs calling on Shah at his residence after a four-hour dharna seeking central intervention to stop the violence on TMC leaders and workers in Tripura. "The Union home minister assured us that there would be no violence (against TMC workers)," TMC's Kalyan Banerjee said after the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-mps-meet-amit-shah-on-tripura-mamata-to-call-on-pm/articleshow/87858478.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

With this plan there will be no water shortage for the next 30 years and an additional 1,000 cusec water will be available at these reservoirs which are to be built in the four districts. Each reservoir may get an additional 300 cusec additional water. Apart from this, a scheme worth Rs. 8,137 crore has been approved under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in which 76 lakh houses will get drinking water. This scheme will be completed in 2023-24. Pant held meetings with officers and visited the villages & PHED region. He said that in the main canal area of IGNP, four escape reservoirs will be made worth Rs 12,444.26 crore. With these reservoirs, more than 20.87 lakh families in 6,707 villages will be benefited. Pant said that the proposal of construction of four escape reservoirs in IGNP area was made after the discussion in the meeting between union Jal Shakti minister and PHED minister of the state after which the scheme was approved. These escape reservoirs will be made near 507 RD near Sattasar and at 750 RD near Gajner lift project in Bikaner district, at 1356 RD in Jaisalmer and 1121 RD in Jodhpur. With the construction of these reservoirs, additional water for 43 large drinking water schemes under JJM will be available. The government land is available for construction so a huge amount of money and time will be saved. He said that at present 1,031 cusec water is allotted to the waterworks department for drinking water whereas the demand is of 1,100 cusec water in IGNP system. With these reservoirs, the surplus water that flows from the IGNP main canal during the rainy season (around 300 cusec) can be stored. . Discussing in regard to Jaisalmer and Barmer he said that many villages in Barmer, Nagaur, Jalore, Jodhpur etc. are being connected with distributaries of Narmada canal which will resolve the water problem in these villages. Similarly, the work of the incomplete Pokaran Phalsoond lift canal has been restarted. With this water problem hundreds of villages will be solved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/plan-to-end-drinking-water-woes-in-desert-dists-phed-official/articleshow/87857625.cms||---

The bypoll for the MLC seat was held after the seat fell vacant following the death of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) vice-president Sharad Ranpise. After being elected, Pradnya Satav took to Twitter and thanked Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, apart from the party’s state leadership for giving her an opportunity. Pradnya is the wife of late All-India Congress Committee secretary Rajeev Satav, a close aide of the Gandhi family who was in-charge of Gujarat. Rajeev Satav had tested positive for Covid on April 22 and he died on May 16 while undergoing treatment for post-Covid complications. Soon after his death, Pradnya Satav was appointed the party’s state vice-president. This was followed by her name making rounds for a Rajya Sabha ticket, but it was eventually given to Rajani Patil. After the bypoll announcement, the Congress declared Pradnya Satav’s name as the party’s official candidate and even got the backing of other allies. After Satav was elected unopposed, Congress functionaries in the region said it was a victory of the party’s inclusive ideology that gave opportunity to an OBC woman to represent as an MLC. When contacted, BJP’s Kenekar said, “The decision to withdraw my candidature was taken to keep alive our party’s culture of sympathising with the family members of a deceased political leader, and also as a mark of our large-heartedness.” He said that this time, the polling was scheduled to be held through a secret ballot and he was confident of winning. Echoing him, one BJP spokesperson from the region said the party withdrew its candidature on request of the Congress leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pradnya-elected-mlc-as-bjp-candidate-withdraws/articleshow/87855410.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Kolhapur||Chandrakant Patil says BJP will return to power in Maharashtra||KOLHAPUR: BJP state president Chandrakant Patil on Monday expressed confidence that the party would be back in power in the state “soon”. Patil made the remarks against the backdrop of the upcoming legislative council elections. He said voters are aware that the BJP would come back to power and that they will elect BJP candidates to the council. On Monday, BJP candidate Amal Mahadik submitted his nomination papers for the Kolhapur Local Body constituency. He is contesting against Congress candidate and sitting MLC, district guardian minister Satej Patil. Patil claimed that Mahadik has the “clear support” of 165 electors and needs the support of 46 more. The members of local bodies are voters in the MLC election. The constituency has a total of 416 voter. The Congress has staked claim to the support of 253 voters. “Those who are on the fence clearly know that the future belongs to BJP. We will come back into power in the state. At the Centre, Modi will continue to rule. We will work hard to get back in power in the state, which we lost due to treachery,” said Patil. Patil was trying to woo the fringe voters and those who are not aligned with any party or loyal to any functionaries. Patil said during the 2015 election, BJP did not have support of Vinay Kore and Prakash Awade, both independent MLAs, but said both support them this time. Dhananjay Mahadik, former MP and BJP state vice-president, said, “The guardian minister made many people unhappy and therefore, such unhappy voters will elect our candidate. He will have to pay the price for his mean politics.”So far, four candidates have filed their nomination for the election. It is likely that only two – Satej Patil and Amal Mahadik – will remain in the fray. The voting for the election is on December 10, while counting is on December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/chandrakant-patil-says-bjp-will-return-to-power-in-maha/articleshow/87855422.cms||---

The accused had approached the teacher Shripad Sarpotdar by creating a fake Facebook profile.

---||Kanpur||Nadda kicks off booth campaign, fires salvo at Akhilesh over Jinnah & BJP vax remarks||Gorakhpur/Lucknow: BJP national president, J P Nadda on Monday fired a salvo at the Opposition, accusing it of speaking on Pakistan and its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, just when UP elections were around the corner. “Woh Pakistan aur Jinnah ki baat karte hain aur hum Mahatma Gandhi aur Sardar Patel ki (They speak about Pakistan and Jinnah, while we speak of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel),” Nadda said, while speaking at the booth-level convention in Gorakhpur. Nadda’s offensive comes days after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav compared Gandhi, Nehru and Patel with Jinnah, sparking a controversy. The BJP ranks, including CM Yogi Adityanath quickly latched onto the remark to blast the SP boss, accusing him of “minority appeasement”. The BJP chief’s comment also came a day after Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Siddhu reportedly called Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan a “Bada Bhai” (big brother), triggering sharp reactions from the BJP brass. Nadda’s acerbic reference to the “Jinnah remark” was seen as BJP’s attempt to lend a stunning blow to SP, which has been positioning itself aggressively against the saffron dispensation in the run-up to polls early next year. His statement held much political pertinence, especially in east UP, which is offers a contrast to the communally restive west UP region. The BJP president maintained while his party stood for “sanskritik rashtravad” (cultural nationalism) the opposition favoured “parivaarwad” (nepotism). Nadda also slammed the opposition for calling corona vaccine as “BJP’s vaccine”. “When Modi ji was saying he will give two vaccines, some people began saying that was a BJP vaccine or a Modi vaccine. Now, they are going around after getting inoculated with the same vaccine,” he said. The remark was also seen as a pointed reference to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had initially refused to get inoculated. Nadda scaled up the attack saying “after some time the red topis (caps) will also turn saffron”. The BJP chief also flayed the opposition for “posing” as farmer leaders. “They forget what PM Modi did for farmers. Before 2014, the agriculture budget was Rs20,000 crore. Under leadership of PM Modi, it has gone up to Rs 1.23 lakh crore,” he said. Nadda’s charge at the opposition comes four days after PM Modi announced his government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws which were at the centre of farmer protest. This also marked BJP’s counter charge at the opposition, amid farmers’ associations upping the ante while demanding legal guarantee for MSP and sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son, Ashish, is an accused in Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which eight persons were killed. Nadda also lauded CM Yogi for bringing much-needed changes in the law and order front. “Earlier women were unsafe, but now criminals appeal in court to go to jail. Earlier, the mafia and rioters were powerful, but now they have forgotten gundai or fled the state,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/nadda-kicks-off-booth-campaign-fires-salvo-at-akhilesh-over-jinnah-bjp-vax-remarks/articleshow/87856213.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Pune||Poor attendance may lead to school mergers||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) during a general body meeting on Monday decided to merge 12 civic schools because of poor attendance. The schools fall within the agency’s periphery. Opposition parties raised concerns, saying the decision should not be taken till the next session starts, as the number of students attending the civic schools might go up after they reopen. The municipal corporation runs over 180 schools across the civic area imparting education to nearly 80,000 students. The PMC operates Marathi, English, Hindi and Urdu medium schools. “Financial condition of several parents have taken a major hit because of the pandemic. They have now decided to shift their children from private to government-run schools. This is a new trend, which the PMC can tap. Thus, the decision should be taken accordingly,” said one of the corporators opposing the move. BJP corporators, however, supported the merger of the schools saying it is necessary for better management of the available manpower. “Some PMC schools have excess teachers, while other institutions do not have enough teaching staff. This disparity can be resolved by merging the schools witnessing poor attendance with the nearby ones,” said leader of House Ganesh Bidkar. Civic officials said a teacher can be assigned to a classroom with minimum 30 students, but there are around 12 PMC schools, which have only five to 17 students per class. These are slated to be merged. PMC runs 265 schools from 180 buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/poor-attendance-may-lead-to-school-mergers/articleshow/87856936.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Four dupe finance firm of over Rs 1 crore||Vadodara: Four persons including two employees of finance company IIFL were arrested for allegedly duping the firm of Rs 1.29 crore. The accused were booked for cheating the company by replacing the mortgaged gold ornaments with dummy ones. Three other accused are yet to be arrested. The accused were identified as Kiran Purushwani, manager of the Warasia branch; Vishal Od, manager of Dabhoi branch; Vikas Jhinjhuwadia, owner of a jewellery showroom; and Ramesh Shitalwani, a financier. The police said that the firm had learnt about the fraud while conducting audit at its branch in Warasia. The company realised that some of the firm’s employees had replaced the original gold ornaments weighing three kilograms with dummy ones. The accused then mortgaged the ornaments elsewhere to earn quick money. The firm then approached the police and filed a complaint of cheating following which the cops began investigations.

All industries officers from each district should be connected with these meetings through the Udyam Saarthi app so that all issues can be addressed on the spot, he said. Sehgal said that a webinar should be organised each week on the ‘one district-one product’ scheme and linked with the e-marketplace. Reviewing the Udyam Saarthi app in a meeting on Monday, Sehgal said that the app has been downloaded more than 50,000 times. Currently there are more than 100 project reports available on it but this figure should be increased. A special awareness drive should be held to link all industrialists with this app, Sehgal directed officials. A department official said that the app was launched to give a boost to industries and make information pertaining to manufacturing available to them easily. The app has information on the ODOP scheme and programmes on industrial development. Other than this, stories of success, project reports and other important information about establishing industries have been uploaded on the app. Details of all ODOP products have been uploaded on the app and it will also provide youth the opportunity to find avenues of employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/industrialists-linked-with-app-day-fixed-to-address-concerns/articleshow/87857631.cms||---

State election commissioner UPS Madan told TOI on Monday that citizens should register before November 30 to ensure that they can vote in the civic elections. “Those who want to vote in the upcoming civic elections should register before November 30 to find their names in the voter list. Those who will turn 18 in January next year can also register as voters,” Madan told TOI on Monday. He urged voters to check their names on the portal and have their queries addressed through the Maha chatbot or through the True Voter application on the mobile phone. As of now, the state has 8.9crore voters and the updated list will be published on January 5 ahead of the civic polls. Voters can now check their names with photo IDs as well as the polling stations. On Monday, the state election commissioner launched the Mahavoter Chatbot, a facility for voter registration, as well as to check their names on the voter list. “Those who have not registered as a voter can use this facility to register and can even check their names and addresses of polling stations,” added officials.

---||Delhi||Another set of DU freshers misses out on newness as it’s all online||NEW DELHI: The first day of college used to be about new things: new campus, new friends, new experiences. But when the new semester began in Delhi University on Monday, yet another batch of students missed out on that experience. All learning, interactions and activities will continue to be online for the time being — no fresher’s party, no idling in the canteen, no romantic dates and no bunking classes to catch a movie. Why, even the orientation was conducted online over the weekend. Hitakshi Bedi was saddened not to be on campus at St Stephen’s College on Monday. “We had a couple of online classes and were informed about the semester flow and so on,” said the economics (H) student. “During the orientation, we introduced ourselves to the others, but disappointingly only in online mode. I have never been inside St Stephen’s compound and it was something I was looking forward to.” Auroghni Chakravarthy too wanted to spend hours on the lawns of Maitreyi College having heard of students doing so there. She will have to wait longer for that now. “Nothing can beat campus life and the atmosphere. There is the hustle and bustle, the endless and meaningless gossip sessions and I am missing all of these,” said Chakravarthy, an English (H) student. Because they are not attending colleges in person, many students are depending on impromptu Zoom calls to get acquainted with each other. “It is a difficult process to make friends online. We rely on online meetings, but not everyone can come together at all times,” said Bedi. Chakravarthy added, “We are trying to establish bonds on Zoom, learning about each other in terms of interests, hobbies and so on.” At the orientation in Hindu College, besides the introductions, there was also a talent performance, said Arijit Ray, a history (H) student. “Apart from being asked to showcase our talent in front of everyone, there were also various questions for us, such as who we would choose to be if we had the chance of being a Navratna in Emperor Akbar's court,” said Ray. “While the first day online was generally okay, the reality of campus life cannot be experienced on the digital platform. All that is connecting us with our friends these days is social media.” Apart from missing the campus air, the students now worry about coping with online classes at the college level. Ray said, “I wanted to join the music society. Not only is that as disappointing as not being able to attend classes in person, but online lectures will be difficult to cope with too.” Ray is trying to be stoic about it, knowing the pandemic has disrupted modern life like nothing else. College now appears only an extension of the ultimate year in school for many students. Sanjana Samajpati, who has joined Maitreyi College, said, “From our point of view, the last year of school wasn’t something we had foreseen and was unexpectedly difficult because we had to accomplish everything without attending actual classes. When school life came to an end, I sat in front of the laptop thinking it was the last time I was online and that college would be normal.” Many students like Samajpati can only imagine what daily life in college can be like. But they are also missing the college societies, festivals and extra-curricular activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-set-of-du-freshers-misses-out-on-newness-as-its-all-online/articleshow/87856959.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Admit dalit boy into IIT-Bombay, seats not just for city students: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday exercised its omnibus powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct IIT-Bombay to admit a Dalit student from the hinterland in Uttar Pradesh within 48 hours after narrating his travails in arranging fees and unconcerned authorities refusing to help him. “If you do not admit such students, then IIT seats would be reserved only for those from metropolitan cities,” said a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna, while directing IIT-Bombay to admit the student in the four-year civil engineering BTech course on or before Wednesday. The court said many students from the hinterland may face difficulties in making fee-payment online because of internet connectivity issues, but because of this they cannot be deprived of their hard-earned seats in prestigious institutions, secured by successfully competing in tough multi-tier entrance examinations. Prince Jaibir Singh, presently studying in Allahabad, had qualified in the IIT-JEE (Advanced) and secured an all-India rank of 25,864 and a rank of 864 among successful Scheduled Caste candidates. He was allotted civil engineering seat on October 27. IIT-Bombay’s portal was open till October 31, for completion of online admissions. On October 29, Jaibir logged into the portal and uploaded the required documents. Unfortunately, he could not pay the fee on that day as he was short of funds. He borrowed the shortfall from his sister on October 30. He then made 10 to 12 attempts to complete payment of fees, but could not succeed due to a technical error on the portal. On October 31, he made similar attempts from a cyber cafe, where the same set of errors appeared. He unsuccessfully made calls to the admission authorities and then followed this with emails till November 1. Failing to elicit any response and staring at the prospect of losing the valued seat, the Dalit student again borrowed money to travel from Allahabad to Kharagpur. The office of admission at Kharagpur expressed inability to assist him. He then travelled to Mumbai and moved the Bombay HC seeking a direction to the authorities to admit him against the allotted seat in BTech course. But, the HC refused to pass any such direction. Justice Chandrachud-led bench narrated the travails of the Dalit aspirant. “This court has before it a young Dalit student who is on the verge of losing a valued seat. The travail of the appellant has taken him from Allahabad, to Kharagpur and then to Mumbai and eventually to the national capital.” “It would be a great travesty of justice if a young Dalit student has to move this court for the difficulties he faced in arranging funds for paying the admission fees and thereafter in ensuring that the payment is processed online... We direct the Centre and IIT to ensure the seat allocated to appellant shall be allotted to him at IIT-Bombay,” the bench ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-admit-dalit-boy-into-iit-b-seats-not-just-for-city-students/articleshow/87856951.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Police, who recovered four motorcycles from him worth Rs 1.05 lakh, said he had taken to stealing them after losing his job. A police team headed by senior police inspector Sunil Zavare, inspector Anita Hiwarkar, assistant inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar and police constable Tanaji Sagar nabbed Shaikh on Friday evening near Bibvewadi bus depot. Shaikh, a casual worker, confessed to stealing four bikes from Bibvewadi, Sahakarnagar and Koregaon Park. He also gave the locations of the four bikes that the police later recovered. Zavare said, “Shaikh had lost his job and his wife was pregnant and he needed money to support his family. He then decided to steal motorcycles and sell them in rural parts.” The Bund Garden police recovered 13 motorcycles from construction site worker Akhtar Chand Mujawar (44) of Banwadi in Satara. Mujawar had stolen them from the premises of Sassoon General Hospital. A police team arrested Mujawar from his village on Saturday. “The police scanned 200 CCTV cameras’ footage near Sassoon hospital and realised that one man was stealing motorcycles,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Sagar Patil. A source informed Bund Garden police about Mujawar’s presence in Satara. He could not sell them as he did not have any documents, so he kept them at home and at a dhaba. Patil said, “Since January, 17 motorcycles have been reported stolen from the Sassoon hospital area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-recover-17-motorcycles-from-thieves-in-separate-cases/articleshow/87856969.cms||---

Corporators had demanded that the civic administration pay these staffers at Monday’s general body meeting. In response, civic officials said technical issues causing the delay were being resolved and that the payments will be completed by Wednesday. Elected members across party lines criticized the delay in payments, saying the affected employees were in a severe financial crisis. “These staffers members could not celebrate Diwali due as they did not get salaries,” a corporator said. Civic officials said there were doubts on the authenticity of some employees – cases fake documents and recruitment had come to light, so the payments were stopped, an official stopped. The district administration had given a list of 1,122 employees for absorption, but a fresh list will be issued on Wednesday by the collectorate. “Payments to staffers whose details are in doubt can be held back but using this as a reason to not pay all staffers was an injustice,” said corporators. “The district administration has assured us it would provide authentic data. The list will be crossverified and the absorption process will take place accordingly,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-staffers-in-23-merged-villages-to-finally-get-salary/articleshow/87856970.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Safety concerns up as CCTV cameras elude PCMC areas||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A 66-year-old woman sustained injuries on her neck after she resisted a man, who tried to snatch her gold chain at Wakad earlier this year in September; another 25-year-old woman was molested by an unidentified food delivery person when she was walking to her home in Wakad in the same month. However, the rapid detection of the culprits in these and various other police investigations is still facing hurdles, due to various reasons — and primary among them is the utter lack of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras across key locations in the Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, leading to no footage being available to probe several cases. Both the Pimpri Chinchwad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (PCSCDCL) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) are yet to install this CCTV network, citing delays in laying optical fibre cables. On several occasions, officials had blamed the Covid-19 pandemic for the delay, claiming that workers were either in shortage or otherwise occupied. But now, there has been a delay of over 16 months in the task. Pushed to the brink amid rising concerns over crime, civic officials now say that it will be done by December-end this year itself. PCMC executive engineer Thomas Noronha told TOI, “The work of installation of CCTVs is lagging due to the fact that first, the optical fibre cable network needs to be laid down at the earliest. The underground cable networking will cover around 700km in the twin towns, of which currently around 545km is completed, while the remaining kilometres are likely to be covered by the end of next month.” Noronha, when asked about how many CCTVs are already functional, also said that he does not have the figures ready. However, he admitted that the number of such functional CCTVs is low. Civic activist Maruti Bhapkar said that the Smart City body should install the cameras at the earliest, especially due to the fact that safety concerns are on the rise amid citizens in the twin towns’ civic limits. “An inquiry should also be conducted to assess why the work is getting so delayed just in the name of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Bhapkar. Denizens of residential areas and visitors to crowded commercial areas across Shagun Chowk, Pimpri Market, Wakad, Sangvi, Pimple Gurav, Pimple Saudagar, Bhumkar Chowk, Nigdi and more have made repeated demands to be well protected with a surveillance system. Resident Bharati Shah of Pimple Saudagar said, “When gated societies have good internal CCTV coverage, it is high time streets and crowded bazaars were also covered. Such surveillance will hopefully deter goons from creating a menace or reduce such incidents, which is the need of the hour.” Harshad Jadhav, a resident of Sangvi, echoed that lack of surveillance gives miscreants chance to roam free and partake in antisocial activities. “CCTVs need to be placed at traffic lights, schools, colleges and more. The civic body should consider citizens’ complaints about spots where crime takes place and give that the priority for installation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/safety-concerns-up-as-cctv-cameras-elude-pcmc-areas/articleshow/87856964.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Name of the new district president will soon be announced by the party chief,” read the news published on Monday. Though he confirmed the development, Khande claimed innocence. “I am a frontrunner to become the party’s official candidate in the next assembly elections. To spoil my chances, I have been framed in this case,” he said and added that things would become clear after a probe in the case is completed. The development comes within days of Khande, along with Aaba Muley and others, being named as one of the accused in the gutka trading case registered with the Kej police station. One of Shiv Sena’s key office-bearer said the incident did not go down well with the party’s leadership, which decided to initiate disciplinary action against Khande. Another party functionary, however, said that they want a detailed probe into the case to ascertain if Khande’ is actually involved in the case or is being framed The offence was registered on the basis of multiple raids carried out by probationary IPS officer Pankaj Kumawat, who has recently been posted as assistant superintendent of police in the Kej division. Police claimed that after the raids, the arrested accused revealed the name of Khande and Muley. Moreover, a purported video, in which Khande can be seen speaking to a person on phone and asking him (the person on the phone) to tell the police that the seized goods belong to him (Khande), also went viral on social media. Kumawat could not be reached for his comments, while superintendent of police R Raja said the investigation is underway and “Depending on the findings, appropriate action will be taken against the suspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sena-beed-dist-chief-named-in-gutka-case-post-put-on-hold/articleshow/87855437.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Goa||Paperless Iffi: Organisers mull over e-invites in future||Panaji: The 52nd edition of Iffi is a paperless edition with no physical tickets being issued, no festival catalogue or literature being given to delegates in hard copy format and only limited number of schedules being printed. Soon, even the Iffi invites may be in digital format. “We are trying to assimilate with the changing technology by making best use of the digital format to avoid waste. The idea is to make the Iffi venue a plastic-free, paper-free and sound pollution-free zone for the delegates,” said Subhash Faldesai, vice chairman of the entertainment society of Goa (ESG). “In coming years, we will try to send e-invites of the festival. Most of the older generation are yet to get accustomed to this system. But we are already circulating our agenda for the day online instead of printing them,” he said. During the 50th edition of the festival, the ESG had decided to ban plastic bottles from the venue and started supplying glass bottles for delegates with containers of mineral water to refill them. A similar kiosk has been set up for this edition as well, urging delegates to leave their plastic bottles behind and use glass bottles instead. Soon after, the ticketing process was revamped as well with no hardcopy tickets for any show being issued and delegates instead receiving an e-ticket on their registered mobile number. The distribution of Iffi kits this edition was also devoid of the thousands of festival catalogues, pamphlets and directories that were printed. Instead, delegates have been asked to download the necessary information online. “This is a slow change and will not happen overnight. But as and when there is a change in technology, we will see to it that we are equipped to handle those changes.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/paperless-iffi-organisers-mull-over-e-invites-in-future/articleshow/87856972.cms||Nida Sayed

The NWR has issued guidelines to the departments of engineering, signal and telecommunication, electrical, mechanical, operational, and safety for the safe operation of railways, especially in the Bikaner and Jaipur divisions. A total of 27 railway sections have been identified as fog-prone areas and Visibility Test Objects (VTOs) are being fixed at all fog-affected stations. According to captain Shashi Kiran, chief public relations officer of NWR, special arrangements have been made given the safety and security in train operation during heavy fog in the winter season. Vijay Sharma, NWR general manager directed all departments heads to work with special vigilance during the winter season and ensure regular checks. Fog safety devices are being provided to the loco pilot crews of all railway services running in dense foggy rail sections, an official said. On NWR routes, 712 fog safety devices have been made available in the crew lobby and the process of providing 175 more fog safety devices is in progress. The Fog Safety Device is mounted on the engine which, after being turned on, keeps the loco pilot informed in advance about the position of all the signals located in that section by the GPS. Which helps the loco pilot ensure safety by controlling the speed of his vehicle. Safety seminars will be also held for all staffers of fog-prone divisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nwr-gears-up-to-fight-fog-in-winter/articleshow/87856966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government has planned to give special attention to all those industries, and lift them,” he said.As part of the efforts, Stalin said a host of MoUs would be signed at an industrial conference scheduled in Coimbatore on Tuesday. “Investments worth several crores of rupees would be attracted through such MoUs and lakhs of jobs would be created. Such industrial conference would be held regularly.” “We will certainly make TN top industrial state in India. Coimbatore would play an important role in the process.’Stalin said that the government would meanwhile make Coimbatore an ideal district with all required infrastructure. Listing out the development projects initiated by the government, he said Rs 1,000 crore has been allotted for Coimbatore airport expansion which has been stuck for 10 years. “Land acquisition would be done, and the project would commence soon,” he said. Stalin said that the government keeping its promise has issued an order for setting up a Coimbatore Urban Development Authority for overall development of the city. He said Rs 200 crore has been earmarked for laying five scheme roads in the city. “No scheme roads were developed in the previous regime. I have instructed the officials to speed up the road projects now,’’ Stalin said.Stalin then reiterated the government’s commitment to implement two projects – shifting of Coimbatore Central Prison to city outskirts and creation of a Semoozhi Poonga - announced by the DMK years ago. “Semmozhi Poonga would be established in Gandhipuram at a cost of Rs 200 crore. It will be done in two phases,” he said. He said that places like Vellakinar and Chinnavedampatti, which were added to the city corporation a decade ago, would also get underground drainage pipelines at a cost of Rs 309 crore. This apart, 63 health centres would be set up at an outlay of Rs 16 crore and additional streetlights would be installed in developing areas. “Government orders for all these projects would be issued soon,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stalin-inaugurates-projects-worth-rs-587-crore-in-district/articleshow/87856971.cms||Mayilvaganan
---||Delhi||Court frames charges against man, son in eight cases of rioting||New Delhi: A city court has framed charges against a man and his son in eight cases of rioting, arson and vandalism of houses and a mosque during the northeast Delhi riots. The complainants stated that accused Mithan Singh and his son Jony Kumar were allegedly part of the violent mob who were raising slogans on February 15, 2020 near their houses and then set ablaze their houses. They further alleged that they climbed upon the roof of the mosque to save their life, from where they saw that the mob started damaging the mosque and setting it on fire. They alleged that Mithan brought a small gas cylinder from his house that he gave to his son and exhorted him to throw it into the mosque. The complainants alleged that Jony threw the cylinder into the mosque and thereafter, the accused and other persons in the mob started throwing bottles containing inflammable material upon the houses belonging to a particular community. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges for the offences of rioting, unlawful assembly, abetment, mischief by fire or explosive substance, robbery against Mithan. The court framed charges of rioting, unlawful assembly, mischief by fire or explosive substance, and robbery against Jony. It said that the manner in which the witnesses have narrated the incident of rioting, stone pelting and setting ablaze the properties by the mob nowhere indicates at this stage that these witnesses were the planted witnesses. It noted that it was true that these witnesses had not come forward to lodge a complaint with the police or to get their statements recorded soon after the incident, but there was an atmosphere of terror and trauma that prevailed in the area for several days even after the riots. “In these circumstances, the delay of about one week in reporting the incident to police would appear justified to any prudent person and can not be considered fatal to the prosecution case at this stage,” the court said in similar orders in the cases on November 20. The court further said that “it can not be said that the delay in recording the statements of these witnesses was intentional or contumacious and therefore, the accused can not claim discharge in this case merely on this score.” The accused had claimed they were falsely implicated in the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-frames-charges-against-man-son-in-eight-cases-of-rioting/articleshow/87856999.cms||Usha Das

After being introduced through Facebook, the two had been friends, but later the woman had started distancing herself, leaving the accused angry. City police formed six teams to search for the man, identified as Vickey Chakole, immediately after the victim landed up at Ajni police station. Senior police officials, including crime branch officials, rushed to GMCH immediately after the incident. Chakole, who had introduced himself as a coal businessman to befriend the woman, was reportedly away from home for the last few months. Police said he did not have any permanent work or career. Chakole, a school drop out, is learnt to have reached GMCH in an autorickshaw. He intercepted the victim, a native of Wardha, near the parking lot and started forcing her to go along with him. When she refused with strong words, an enraged Chakole brandished a firearm and tried to fire at her. The victim’s screams alerted her friends, who rushed to intervene. Chakole pointed the firearm towards the friends and tried to fire at them too, which created more ruckus. As the crowd of medicos and interns started swelling, Chakole ran away from the place. Police said Chakole even left behind his bag in the melee, as he fled on foot. Senior inspector Vijay Talware of Ajni police station said Chakole has been charged with attempt to life and molestation too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/jilted-lover-tries-to-shoot-intern-in-gmch-campus/articleshow/87856958.cms||Soumitra Bose

Shivajinagar police have registered a case of accidental death. Sub-inspector Vinod Mahangude of Shivajinagar police station told TOI, “The student, a native of Jalgaon, had secured admission in standard XI (science) in a junior college on Tilak Road. He was staying with six other students in the flat.” “The incident occurred sometime between 8am and 9am on Sunday. We have recorded the statements of his father, who is a farmer, and his roommates. We have studied the circumstances and prima facie we believe it to be a case of suicide. We searched the room and checked his belongings,but did not find any suicide note.” Mahangude said, “The student got admission in college and came to Pune on Wednesday. He also attended some classes wanted to join private coaching.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/18-year-old-commits-suicide/articleshow/87856976.cms||---
---||Pune||Dog regains normal body functions after surgery||Pune: Till last year, Deepika, the seven-year-old Indie crossbreed, pet to a family in Pune, had to be assisted to stand on its legs. Deepika had put on weight, had difficulty in walking, could barely stand, and would pant heavily all the while. The excess body weight caused her a host of ailments related to liver, kidney, heart, blood pressure, and thyroid. "Deepika has bounced back after surgery. All her bodily functions have become normal and her medications have reduced significantly," said Deepika's owner Daisy Daruwalla. Deepika — the first animal in India to have successfully undergone weight-loss surgery medically termed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy — has lost 18kg of bodyweight ever since the surgery on June 16 this year. “Deepika weighed 50kg prior to surgery. Today, she weighs 31.5kg. Her thyroid drug dose has been reduced to half. Her blood pressure has become normal now. Her cardiac medicines have been reduced, too. Her activity has improved a lot,” Daruwalla said. Weight loss patterns in animals are not yet known since this is the first such surgery reported. “However, the pattern looks similar if you compare Deepika’s progress. Probably it is the same hormonal change based on Ghrelin, which improves metabolism,” said Pune-based bariatric surgeon Shashank Shah, who performed the weight loss surgery on Deepika. “It can be stated that Deepika’s hunger has reduced drastically, and she has become more active despite less intake,” Shah said. Body mass index (BMI), a defining measure to calculate obesity, is calculated in animals with the help of a special formula based on age, gender, type of breed, shoulder height, and body circumference (equivalent to waist circumference in humans). “The weight is assessed using the standard formulae or certain software available. We have seen such obesity in certain pets like cats, small animals like hamsters,” Shah said. But what should be the ideal body weight in Deepika's case post-surgery? “She should be between 15kg to 20kg, which is generally the maximum weight for dogs of Deepika’s breed,” Shah said. The initial weight loss of 18-kilogram post-surgery in five months is quite impressive. "That is almost 45 percent to 50 percent excess weight loss and is excellent. I believe that the dietary compliance is entirely controlled by the owner and hence it may be true that the results in animals may be as good as in humans," Shah said. Deepika's owner has been advised to take a slew of measures to ensure that she does not regain the lost weight. "She should not be caged or tied for long and allowed to move freely. Besides, she should be given fewer carbohydrates and more proteins in the diet," Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dog-regains-normal-body-functions-after-surgery/articleshow/87856977.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The GAD, led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, has promulgated a three-page order, laying down stringent norms for receiving an award from a private organization. According to the order, rules have been prescribed under Section 12 of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968. As per the revised rules, a bureaucrat who has been selected for an award will have to seek permission from the state government at least 15 days in advance. “The bureaucrat will have to submit the application in the prescribed format,” stated under-secretary S G Gangarkar, who issued the order. It has been made clear that the organization which has constituted the award should be apolitical and non-sectarian, it should be of national repute and its activities should be in accordance with the policies of the state government. Before the government accepts the proposal, the bureaucrat will have to examine if the organization is registered, its reputation, its office bearers and its background, if it has a criminal background, then the entire information, including the financial situation, the source of funds and the names of persons who have been selected for the awards in the past. The award should be in the form of a certificate of honour and under no circumstances should the bureaucrat accept the award in the form of cash, gold or silver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-babus-need-state-nod-before-accepting-pvt-awards/articleshow/87857980.cms||---

A large number of farmers from across the state will gather at the protest site. On November 27, there will be a meeting of the SKM. We will take a decision on the future course of action after the centre’s cabinet meeting on November 24. Our proposed tractor march to New Delhi on November 29 (during Parliament session) will be held if they (Centre) go back on their promise to repeal the three farm laws,” said Himmat Singh, a farmer leader from Rajasthan. The farmer unions had earlier welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three farm laws. However, they had stated the protest would continue till the farm laws were formally repealed in Parliament and a law was passed to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce. With the Centre preparing to get cabinet approval of its decision to repeal the farm laws in its next meeting on Wednesday, the SKM on Sunday wrote to Modi urging him to immediately resume talks on farmers’ six demands including legal guarantee to procurement of crops at MSP. Besides legal guarantee to MSP, the other five demands of the SKM include withdrawal of electricity amendment Bill, scrapping of provisions of fines for stubble burning in the Commission for Air Quality Management law, withdrawal of cases against farmers registered during the protests in different states, sacking and arrest of junior home minister Ajay Kumar Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, and compensation to kin of around 700 farmers who died during the protests and allotment of a site at Singhu Border to set up a memorial for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-to-stage-big-demonstration-on-friday/articleshow/87856996.cms||---
---||Pune||IISER Pune team wins gold at synthetic biology competition||Pune: A team of 12 students from IISER Pune won a gold medal at the 2021 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) synthetic biology competition. The aim of the project was to develop a sustainable model for synthesising chemical compounds using a co-culture of two bacterial strains, avoiding methods that involve carbon emitting petrochemicals or resource-intensive plant biomass. The team titled this approach as “Synbactory”. As a proof of concept, the team designed the bacterial co-culture to produce butanol, a chemical with applications as a fuel. The results were announced during iGEM’s annual jamboree held from November 4-14. Ashwin Uday, a team member, said, “Synbactory is a sustainable model for chemical synthesis through a cod-culture of cyanobacteria, synechoccus elongates, and e. coli that can convert light and carbon dioxide into useful compounds, which are otherwise synthesised through carbon emitting petrochemicals or resource-intensive plant biomass.” According to the students, this solution will capture the existing carbon emission in the atmosphere and prevent new emissions from being generated at the source by reducing current reliance on carbon emitting petrochemical feedstocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iiser-pune-team-wins-gold-at-synthetic-biology-competition/articleshow/87856987.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Govt taking efforts to revive SHGs: Stalin||Tirupur: The state government is making concerted efforts to revive self-help groups (SHG), chief minister M K Stalin said here on Monday. Giving away financial assistance worth Rs 25 crore to SHGs, the CM said the groups were pushed to pathetic state in the last 10 years. SHGs were inaugurated by late chief minister M Karunanidhi in 1989 to facilitate independent financial growth of women, he said. Recalling the prominence given to SHGs when he was the local administration minister, Stalin said that banks used to provide financial assistance to SHG members during the DMK regime. “But in the last 10 years, SHGs were ruined. I want to renew them and hence Rs 25 crore worth financial assistance is being given to them today,’’ he said.Stalin noted that in the last six months, Rs 230 crore was given as loan to 5,420 SHGs in Tirupur district. “The government is working to uplift women. As part of that objective, the government offered free bus rides for women and waived loans obtained by SHGs from cooperative banks. We will implement more schemes for women.”In the last six months since DMK came to power, the government has come up with lot of welfare measures for the benefit of people from all walks of life, the CM said. “Imagine how many more programmes we will bring in the remaining 4.5 years of our rule.”Later, the CM met representatives of the garment sector at a meeting organised by the Apparel Export Promotion Council and assured that the doors of the chief minister’s office is always open for them. “You can contact this government anytime, whether it is to discuss about current issues, newer ones or long-pending problems,” he told them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-taking-efforts-to-revive-shgs-stalin/articleshow/87856980.cms||---

When she fell unconscious, school authorities took her to a nearby private hospital where doctors confirmed that she had consumed poison. After treatment, her condition is stable,” a police officer said. The girl told police that she decided to take the extreme step after her neighbour, a native of Sivakasi in Virudhunagar working as a loadman in Coimbatore, molested her several times.The Karumathampatti police registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and detained the man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/molested-girl-student-tries-to-kill-self/articleshow/87856978.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Nadda fires salvo at Akhilesh over Jinnah & BJP vax remarks||Gorakhpur/Lucknow: BJP national president, J P Nadda on Monday fired a salvo at the Opposition, accusing it of speaking on Pakistan and its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, just when Uttar Pradesh elections were around the corner. “Woh Pakistan aur Jinnah ki baat karte hain aur hum Mahatma Gandhi aur Sardar Patel ki (They speak about Pakistan and Jinnah, while we speak of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel),” Nadda said, while Jspeaking at the booth-level convention in Gorakhpur. Nadda’s offensive comes days after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav compared Gandhi, Nehru and Patel with Jinnah, sparking a controversy. Nadda’s offensive comes days after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav compared Gandhi, Nehru and Patel with Jinnah, sparking a controversy. The BJP ranks, including CM Yogi Adityanath quickly latched onto the remark to blast the SP boss, accusing him of “minority appeasement”. The BJP chief’s comment also came a day after Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Siddhu reportedly called Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan a “Bada Bhai” (big brother), triggering sharp reactions from the BJP brass. Nadda’s acerbic reference to the “Jinnah remark” was seen as BJP’s attempt to lend a stunning blow to SP, which has been positioning itself aggressively against the saffron dispensation in the run-up to polls early next year. His statement held much political pertinence, especially in east UP, which is offers a contrast to the communally restive west UP region. The BJP president maintained while his party stood for “sanskritik rashtravad” (cultural nationalism) the opposition favoured “parivaarwad” (nepotism). Nadda also slammed the opposition for calling corona vaccine as “BJP’s vaccine”. “When Modi ji was saying he will give two vaccines, some people began saying that was a BJP vaccine or a Modi vaccine. Now, they are going around after getting inoculated with the same vaccine,” he said. The remark was also seen as a pointed reference to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had initially refused to get inoculated. Nadda scaled up the attack saying “after some time the red topis (caps) will also turn saffron”. The BJP chief also flayed the opposition for “posing” as farmer leaders. “They forget what PM Modi did for farmers. Before 2014, the agriculture budget was Rs20,000 crore. Under leadership of PM Modi, it has gone up to Rs 1.23 lakh crore,” he said. Nadda’s charge at the opposition comes four days after PM Modi announced his government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws which were at the centre of farmer protest. This also marked BJP’s counter charge at the opposition, amid farmers’ associations upping the ante while demanding legal guarantee for MSP and sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son, Ashish, is an accused in Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which eight persons were killed. Nadda also lauded CM Yogi for bringing much-needed changes in the law and order front. “Earlier women were unsafe, but now criminals appeal in court to go to jail. Earlier, the mafia and rioters were powerful, but now they have forgotten gundai or fled the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-fires-salvo-at-akhilesh-over-jinnah-bjp-vax-remarks/articleshow/87857652.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Jaipur||Bhandari sees a global future for NeuroEquilibrium||Serial entrepreneur Rajneesh Bhandari says he is more of an innovator. Maybe that’s the reason he has built businesses in varied domains, from telcom infra services to synthetic gemstones, and the latest being medical technology. Over the 20 years , he has evolved to wear many hats, as angel investor, author and painter. “Technology is fast disrupting the way businesses are built and run. Domain expertise can be a liability, limiting us to do things in the same way as has been done in the past,” says Rajneesh. After passing out from IIT-Delhi, Rajneesh, son of a retired IAS officer, worked in the corporate world starting with Reliance Industries. But he had to relocate to Jaipur because of a family compulsion. Not finding a job matching his expertise and education, he set up his first company Cosmo InfraSolutions in 2000, along with his uncle. The initial years were tough as there was no capital to grow the business. Yet, riding on the telcom growth story then, he scaled up the venture to deliver project management services across India. About a decade ago, he saw that despite Jaipur being a global gemstones hub, there was no focus on developing new technologies in the field. So he started his research in the treatment and synthesis of gems. He developed technologies, which have been granted patents in India and the US, to create lab-grown diamonds and gemstones. With the shift in consumer behavior for lab-grown gems, the venture grew exponentially. He has even written a book on “The Science of Gemstone Enhancement,” which was released last year. Five years ago, he started his third venture with his wife, Dr. Anita, an ENT surgeon who is a global authority on vertigo and dizziness. “Vertigo and dizziness affects 180 million people in our country. We saw this as a unique opportunity to help millions of people as there were almost no centres to treat the patients in Asia. This led to the birth of NeuroEquilibrium, the world’s first chain of vertigo, dizziness, and balance disorder clinics. We have developed world-class technologies for vertigo diagnosis and treatment and have two US and six Indian patents,” explains Rajneesh. In the last 10 years, technologies have been developed in Europe and USA but they are very expensive and there are very few trained doctors in this field to interpret the reports and prescribe treatment. “The NeuroEquilibrium deep tech remote diagnosis platform integrates artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearable devices etc. Today, NeuroEquilibrium has over 150 dizziness clinics in leading hospitals in India with an innovative clinic-in-clinic revenue share business model,” says Rajneesh. Having started the first clinic in Europe, NeuroEquilibrium nurtures a grand global vision. “The mission is to treat 100 million patients globally in the next 10 years. The company is now raising funding for its international expansion,” says Rajneesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bhandari-sees-a-global-future-for-neuroequilibrium/articleshow/87857664.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

A petition filed by Haindaveeyam Foundation alleged that a cartoon that was selected for an award by the academy insults the country as it depicts a cow wearing a saffron shawl attending ‘Covid-19 Global Medical Summit’ representing India. The petitioner is seeking a court directive to prevent presenting the award to the cartoonist, Anoop Radhakrishnan. Considering the petition during admission hearing, Justice N Nagaresh has sought the views of the central and state governments. As per the plea, the cartoon was selected for an award for ‘honourable mention’. It is pointed out in the petition that the academy had landed in trouble earlier too when it decided to present an award to a cartoon that depicted bishop Franco Mulakkal, who is facing rape charges, as a rooster. The state government had then directed the academy to reconsider its decision, it is alleged. The petitioner has demanded to oust the governing council of the academy for selecting a cartoon that insults the nation for the award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-centre-states-views-on-plea/articleshow/87856981.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Nawab Malik's tweets malicious, but can’t say totally false: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Monday said NCP minister Nawab Malik’s tweets against NCB officer Sameer Wankhede are “actuated by malice and or personal animosity”, but a blanket relief to restrain him and others working under him from posting publicly any defamatory content against the officer’s family cannot be granted at this stage as sought by his father. “At this prima facie stage and on the basis of material on record, it cannot be said that allegations made by him are totally false,” the HC said. In the ad-interim order —urgent initial order—Justice Madhav Jamdar said though the tweets—the few that he perused—raised important issues concerning the acts and conduct of Wankhede, a public official, there has to be a balancing of right to privacy of the NCB officer’s family with Malik’s freedom of speech, as both are fundamental rights. Verify facts before publishing or speaking, HC tells MalikIn its ad-interim order on a plea by NCB official Sameer Wankhede’s father Dhyandev Wankhede against NCP minister Nawab Malik over his “defamatory” tweets and content, the Bombay high court said on Monday, “The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21. A citizen has right to safeguard his privacy, however, the defendant has made allegations against the plaintiff’s son Sameer Wankhede, who is presently posted as zonal director of Narcotics Control Bureau, and therefore, he is (a) public officer. The public has the right to examine and comment on the actions of public officials.However, as held by the Supreme Court, it has to be done after reasonable verification of facts.” The HC said, “It cannot be said that (Malik) acted after reasonable verification of the facts.” “It is necessary to direct the defendant (Malik) that he should conduct reasonable verification of the facts before publishing, writing, speaking in media including electronic media and the social media or publishing in any manner whatsoever any content/material which amounts to defamatory (sic) of plaintiff or his family members,” said Justice Jamdar in a 50-page order. He sought a reply from Malik to Wankhede’s plea within two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on December 20. Malik, through senior counsel Atul Damle, had argued that Sameer Wankhede was a “Muslim” at birth and that the defamation suit is not maintainable. Senior counsel Arshad Shaikh, for Wankhede, said Malik has not done due verification before tweeting “defamatory” content. The HC also said “it is very important to note that” Wankhede produced several documents to substantiate his contention that his “name is Dnyandeo and he belongs to “Mahar” caste, recognised as Scheduled Caste.” “Prima facie there is substance” in Shaikh’s contention that Malik did not act after reasonable verification of facts. The HC also said, “In the present case it is true that (Wankhede) has come up with the case that his family consisting of his daughter, son and daughter-in-law is defamed, but he has also come up with (a) positive case that he himself has been defamed.” Prima facie, the suit filed by Wankhede appears to be maintainable, said the HC. The HC went into the concepts of privacy, right to speech and reputation and said, “Reputation being an inherent component of Article 21 (right to life), it should not be allowed to be sullied solely because another individual can have its freedom. Therefore, the balance between the two rights needs to be struck. “Reputation” of one cannot be allowed to be crucified at the altar of the other’s right of free speech.” The HC said, “Right to privacy is implicit in the right to life”, and it is a “right to be let alone”. But when records are public and include court records, “right to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press, media and others.” “In case of public officials right to privacy or for that matter remedy of action for damages is not available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to discharge of official duties. It is to be established that such publication is totally false and that the same has been done without reasonable verification of the facts,” the HC noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-verify-facts-before-publishing-or-speaking-hc-tells-malik/articleshow/87856995.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Construction work at Civil Court metro station halfway complete||PUNE: The work at Civil Court Metro station hub has progressed the halfway mark. The Civil Court station will be a key facility for Metro commuters as it is the sole station where two existing Metro routes — PCMC-Swaragte and Vanaz-Ramwadi lines — will meet. MahaMetro official said that there would be two stations, one will be on underground track (PCMC-Swargate) and another will be placed on elevated viaduct (Vanaz-Ramwadi). The work of both stations was underway at full capacity. The work of underground station had reached up to 50% while the elevated station was around 60% complete. The MahaMetro has prepared a detailed plan so that commuters will be able to switch both lines without hassle. “There will be channels, lifts, staircases, escalators so that the commuters — after getting out at the elevated station — will be able to reach the underground station and vice-versa,” an official said. For instance, if a commuter travelling by Metro from Pimpri wants to travel to Vanaz, s/he will be able to switch the line at the Civil court station hub. MahaMetro said that the work had been pushed ahead at Civil Court Metro site as it was a crucial junction, despite not being a part of priority stretches that were expected to be ready by December-end. Works have progressed significantly and the staff is working at maximum capacity for the last few days. The underground tunneling work had already progressed ahead of the Civil Court station while the plan was to expedite the work on elevated route in next few months. The work was still on slow track as MahaMetro was yet to get possession of some portion of the land in the area. Meanwhile, the services of Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro line were likely to be extended up till the Civil Court hub area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/construction-work-at-civil-court-metro-station-halfway-complete/articleshow/87856974.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Kolkata||Go-to Covid gadget now saves patients with many other diseases||Kolkata: During the pandemic, the ECMO machine — meant for prolonged cardiac and respiratory support — turned into a saviour for many critically ill Covid patients who were successfully resuscitated by it. Now, with Covid transmission slowing down, ECMO is increasingly being used for non-Covid patients, especially those suffering from heart and lung ailments. Prior to the pandemic, only a handful of non-medical people had heard about ECMO. But many are now enquiring about it at hospitals, say doctors. Recently, a 73-year-old patient from Hooghly with a severely compromised lung condition could undergo a life-saving angioplasty, thanks to ECMO that allowed the procedure to be conducted on the patient despite a chronic lung fibrosis. The patient could be discharged from hospital on the fourth day of the procedure. When the septuagenarian was brought to the EM Bypass hospital, doctors found the patient had a major artery blockage that had caused a heart attack. Even as cardiologist Arindam Pandey and his team knew angioplasty was the rescue, the patient’s compromised lung condition posed a huge risk. That is when the ECMO team led by doctors Dipanjan Chatterjee and Arpan Chakraborty was roped in. The patient’s condition was first stabilized with ECMO support. Then angioplasty was conducted while he was on cardiac and respiratory support via the ECMO machine. The angioplasty procedure went smoothly. But the patient was kept under ECMO support and close monitoring for the 24 hours. He was then put off the support and was sent home three days post the angioplasty. Doctors said that it was a high-risk angioplasty. The patient had been suffering from lung ailment for the past one decade. The heart blockage was severe and he was not suitable for bypass surgery. Conducting the angioplasty under ventilation was tough as the patient could either suffer a heart attack or his chances of coming out of ventilation post the procedure was slim. The ECMO came as a blessing for the doctors as well as the patient. “The whole procedure was done while keeping the patient awake. Before the pandemic, we did use ECMO on few patients with advanced heart and lung ailment. But the machine came to prominence during the pandemic as we deployed it on Covid-infected patients with acute respiratory failure. This is the first time an angioplasty has been done while keeping the patient on ECMO support,” said ECMO specialist Arpan Chakraborty. The patient is recuperating well at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/go-to-covid-gadget-now-saves-patients-with-many-other-diseases/articleshow/87856238.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Students fidgety in class after long campus break||Kolkata: Students who have walked back into campuses are not the same as those who had left school after writing their final exams in February-March 2020, feel principals and teachers. The kids of classes IX to XII, for whom the campuses have started, seemed to have grown by years and look weary, falling off to sleep, unable to pay attention, are fidgety in class and glassy-eyed. While most used to interact in virtual classrooms, they have now turned shy. Schools are arranging for “break out” and counselling sessions to put the kids at ease. Many teachers found that students were unable to sit straight in class for long. The slouching posture, teachers felt, was an indication that they had lounged on sofa or even bed while attending online classes. “After writing mock exams, I found class X and XII students dozing off. This is because for all these months, they were used to a relaxed routine and didn’t need to follow class decorum. So getting back to the school groove is putting additional pressure on them. We have decided not to be too strict and give them space to catch up,” said South City International School principal John Bagul. Keeping masks on for long, not being allowed to leave the desk and move about freely, not being able to share tiffin or play around are playing negatively on their minds and are giving the impression that they are under constant surveillance. At La Martiniere for Girls, additional time of at least 10 minutes is being kept after every class so that teachers are able to chat informally with those who are physically present in the class to break the ice. Principal Rupkatha Sarkar said it was impossible to expect children who had been away for 20 months to immediately get into the school mode. “They are teenagers whose movements and urge to interact have been forcefully curbed by Covid and they have been separated from their peers. The fact that they are stiff and unresponsive now is a fallout of that separation. Our counsellors will soften the edges again,” said Rammohan Mission principal Sujoy Biswas. The Heritage School principal Seema Sapru insisted that school, too, hasn’t remained the same for children and so the stiffness is expected. “We are expecting a lot from these children too soon perhaps. We have to give them time. They fear that they are being judged. In the virtual mode, that fear was not there. It will take some counselling sessions to help them overcome that fear,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-fidgety-in-class-after-long-campus-break/articleshow/87856243.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Vadodara||Vacation for councillors ahead of civic prez polls||Vadodara: After months of musical chairs for the post of president of Chhota Udepur municipality, councillors of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress have suddenly gone for a vacation at the same time. Sources close to the development said that the holiday has been orchestrated ahead of general board meeting on November 24 where the new president will be elected. If murmurs in Chhota Udepur town are to be believed, the holiday was planned so that neither of the councillors can be made to change their votes. Chances are high that Sangramsinh Rathwa, son of former junior railway minister Naran Rathwa, will be elected as president during the general board meeting on November 24. Currently, the municipality does not have any head as the motion of no-confidence was passed against the incumbent president Naren Jaiswal. Jaiswal, a member of BSP, did not receive support from his own party members. Jaiswal was elected as president with support from BJP councillors. However, later he sought support from Congress and continued to hold the post. Around six months ago, Congress pulled the plug and Jaiswal had to step down. The post remained vacant for a long time until a few months back, Congress again extended support to Jaiswal. But last month, again no-confidence motion was passed against him. Having a hold on Congress party in Chhota Udepur town, Sangramsinh had called the shots when it came to extending the support or pulling out. Insiders said that the disappearance of 20 councillors could also be a move planned by him and the councillors will turn up just before the general board meeting will begin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vacation-for-councillors-ahead-of-civic-prez-polls/articleshow/87856250.cms||---

The medical team had visited the Ganga Jamuna society in Sector-15 on Sunday afternoon to conduct rapid antigen tests on all residents of the society, after a resident tested positive for Covid-19.  Milind Phadtare, assistant police inspector of Nerul police station said that the team had taken permission from the society’s vice-chairman to conduct the tests. The accused, Vipin Kumar Bhola, a resident of the society, first quarrelled with the vice-chairman for permitting the team to conduct Covid tests and then allegedly manhandled him. “Bhola asked the team to show their NMMC ID cards and started video recording them on his phone, which the women staffers objected to. When Dr Rohit Khatik (27) told Bhola that they were on official duty, he argued and manhandled him,” Phadtare said. The police were summoned and Bhola was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-man-assaults-civic-medical-team-on-covid-test-duty-held/articleshow/87857007.cms||George Mendonca

Sources at the airport said while operations slowly resumed and five flights landed after 7:30pm, the work on the runway lights was being carried out by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The runway and the air traffic control of the airport is managed by the IAF. “After the runway recarpeting, the IAF is currently working on the lights of the runway. One of the circuits of the runway-edge lights developed a snag, which led to the diversions and delays,” a source at the airport told TOI. Between 6pm and 9pm, 12 arrivals and 10 departures were delayed by over an hour because of the snag. An Air India flight coming to Pune from Delhi was diverted to Hyderabad, while a SpiceJet flight from Kolkata was diverted to Mumbai. An Indigo flight from Pune to Bengaluru was diverted to Mumbai. Flights from cities such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Mumbai were delayed. Similarly, flights taking off for destinations such as Nagpur, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata were delayed. Marhatta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture president Sudhir Mehta, who was flying in an Air India flight, told TOI, “We are at the Hyderabad airport and airline officials said that the flight will take off for Pune in around half-an-hour. The pilot announced the diversion of the flight on the ground that there was a problem with the runway lights at the Pune airport. These incidents show how badly the city needs a new airport.” Tania Roy, whose parents were supposed to fly to Kolkata at 7pm, told TOI, “The flight was rescheduled many times and it was finally diverted. My parents, who are senior citizens, had to wait at the airport for a long duration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/runway-light-glitch-sparks-flight-delays-diversions/articleshow/87857001.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||To film enthusiasts’ delight, seating capacity goes from 50% to 100%||PANAJI: A day after TOI reported that many delegates were unable to get tickets for their choice of screening due to rapid booking of online tickets and the 50% seating capacity SOP being implemented, the organisers of the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi) have allowed to accommodate 100% seating capacity at each of the screens at Inox Panaji and Porvorim, following relaxation of social distancing norms inside the venue. The festival now has a combined strength of about 2,400 seating capacity, which came down to roughly 1,200 seats on day one due to the 50% capacity rule being imposed as a precaution. “The decision has been taken for the benefit of all film lovers. The auditoria are now packed, and this reflects the popularity of the films that are being showcased. The despair and angst that delegates felt are no longer there since we were able to address their concerns,” Chaitanya Prasad told TOI. He further added that delegates, however, need to be conscious about themselves since the pandemic is still prevalent. “Delegates need to wear a mask, sanitise their hands and follow protocol self-consciously,” he said. Besides the 50% capacity rule which was observed on the first day, the unavailability of the DMK auditorium at Kala Academy led to one less screen for the festival. The Kala Academy also accommodated a jury lounge and had activities like exhibits and installations for delegates. To make up for the lack of the 900-seater auditorium where the festival films were usually screened, Inox’s Porvorim screens were roped in. However, delegates didn’t seem too keen to make the commute. “In view of it being under repairs this year, we decided to have screenings at the Inox multiplex at Porvorim and with the distance of six kms from the main venue, we have arranged Kadamba buses and rickshaws to be used as Iffi ferries for delegates to travel to Porvorim,” said vice-chairman of the Entertainment Society of Goa, Subhash Faldesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-film-enthusiasts-delight-seating-capacity-goes-from-50-to-100/articleshow/87857002.cms||Nida Sayed

A bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh said the application does not deserve to be entertained and that as and when the appeal will be listed, it will be heard. “Every day so many matters are listed before this court and are heard. There is nothing special in this matter. The application is dismissed,” the bench said. The application was filed in a pending appeal challenging a single judge’s March 5 order that dismissed the plea challenging the VC’s appointment saying there was no merit in the petition. The appeal was filed by M Ethesham-Ul-Haque, an alumnus of the Faculty of Law at JMI, challenging the appointment claiming that there has been violation of regulations issued by University Grants Commission (UGC) and JMI Act. Advocate R K Saini, appearing for Haque, sought direction that the appeal be heard for final disposal on the next date of hearing, that is, December 3, and in case it is not possible to do so for any reason, then the application for stay or interim orders be heard and disposed on that day. The plea said the appeal has already been listed for hearing before this court four times and it cannot be said with certainty that even on the next date of hearing on December 3, it be finally heard and disposed of. It said the total tenure of the VC is of five years and she is already continuing on the post for the last more than two and a half years, since April 11, 2019, and as such half of her tenure for the post is already over. The division bench of the high court had earlier issued notices to the Centre, Central Vigilance Commission, JMI, UGC and Akhtar on the petition.

CAIT Rajasthan president Subhash Goyal said the central as well as the state governments should frame rules to prevent such contraband transactions on its platform which is damaging the future of the youth in the country. “There have been cases of selling illegal substances such as marijuana on Amazon platform and FIR have also been lodged against the company. The government should probe deeply into the matter and punish the culprit. There should not be any laxity for powerful multinational companies,” he said. He said ecommerce companies have eaten into the markets of traditional traders and CAIT is geared up to take up the challenge posed by them. “But we can’t let Amazon and other ecommerce companies to play with the health of our youth. We can’t let Rajasthan become ‘Udta Punjab’, he said. Goyal demanded that the government should develop a mechanism to keep a track on online transactions. “Any business transaction in shop is verified. But transactions through online platform has no credibility. You order for a shoe and you get delivery of a brick. People are duped over online.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cop study to ease flow of pedestrians||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police has begun a pedestrian movement study at important pedestrian crossover points. Kicking off with the Chingrighata, the study is aimed at ascertaining the extent of footfall, the specific times when pressure is at its maximum, the specific time when more women and children use the crossing and the pressure on slow-moving vehicles on pedestrians. The study will help cops decide whether signal cycles need to be tweaked or whether pedestrian islands will be necessary. An ACP said: “Chingrighata sees the highest movement of two-wheelers among all crossings. It sees a lot of women and children movement in the morning and between 2.30pm and 4pm. There is a suggestion that we can increase the signal crossover time.” Similar assessments have led Kolkata Police to propose a pedestrian island at the Phoolbagan Metro station crossing. Lalbazar sources said that plans are afloat to develop these islands on important and wide roads like EM Bypass, APC Road and JL Nehru Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-study-to-ease-flow-of-pedestrians/articleshow/87856260.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Lucknow||No end to stir without MSP law and Teni’s sacking: SKM||Lucknow: Unmoved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to annul three farm laws, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Monday unleashed its show of strength away from its epicentre on UP border to the state capital, Lucknow, warning of a prolonged agitation till all its six demands, including legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops and dismissal of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni are met. The minister’s son was allegedly involved in ploughing his SUV through protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri in which eight persons, including four farmers were killed. The aggressive stance of SKM, which comprises 40 farmer unions, came even as hundreds of farmers from across UP and neighbouring states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan swamped Eco Garden in Lucknow for the kisan mahapanchayat. Many rallyists held red flags of Left parties and others were backed All-India Kisan Sangathan (AIKS). The morcha, in fact, sharpened focus on MSP while giving a unanimous call — “MSP nahi toh andolan wahi (The stir will remain the same if legal guarantee for MSP is not given).” The association also threatened to take the stir to different parts of the country if their demands were not met. The morcha has called its next meeting on the Delhi border on November 27 to take a decision on future course of action.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, who spearheaded the farmers’ protest on the Delhi border for the past one year, maintained: “Sangharsh vishram ki ghoshna abhi humne nahi ki hai...humare masle bahut hain abhi... (We have not stopped our agitation. A lot of issues are yet to be resolved)“. The other issues which SKM seeks to get addressed include, repeal of electricity 2020 bill, annulment of cases against farmers for stubble burning, rehabilitation of families of farmers who died during farmers’ protest and constructing a memorial in their name at Singhu border.Tikait slammed BJP and its right-wing arms for diverting people’s attention with communal issues like Jinnah, which BJP has been oft repeating after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav invoked the Pakistan founder. He also alleged PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of getting farm laws repealed was loaded with the “remark” of “kuch log”, allegedly to divide farmers. He said the “PM’s apology” would not help farmers get the price of their produce. “They will get the price only when MSP is given legal sanctity,” he said, pointing out that the committee headed by Narendra Modi during his stint as Gujarat CM in 2011 had recommended a legal guarantee on MSP. “The report is still there with PMO and awaits implementation,” he said. Convener of Jai Kisan Andolan, Yogendra Yadav sharpened the attack on the BJP dispensation, accusing it of shielding junior home minister Teni. “He is a ‘sutradhaar’ (facilitator) of Lakhimpur Kheri violence,” he said, while addressing a gathering of farmers and asking them not to relent till the minister is sacked and sent to prison. SKM’s move to call the ‘mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow marked its combative positioning to lend a riveting punch at BJP, ahead of UP assembly elections due in next few months. Hundreds of farmers, not surprisingly, reached the state capital from different districts. Paramjeet Singh, a Sikh farmer from Mehmoodabad tehsil in Sitapur, said farmers are forced to sell paddy at a price of just over Rs 1,100 per quintal as against a MSP of Rs 1940 per quintal. Another farmer from Pilibhit, Karan Singh, alleged less than 10% of total produce is purchased at MSP from farmers. “Farmers also face a perpetual shortage of fertilizers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-end-to-stir-without-msp-law-and-tenis-sacking-skm/articleshow/87857660.cms||Pankaj Shah

The recipient Dr Tapan Parikh is a child psychologist who has worked extensively during the Covid-19 pandemic with children. Parikh, who pursued MBBS at the Pramukh Swami Medical College in Karamsad, was born and brought up in the walled city of Vadodara. He passed his Class 12 exam from the Bright School in Karelibaug. He moved to the US in 2008 and did internships before pursuing a masters degree in public health. He also worked on cancer research at Cornell University before doing a residency in general psychiatry from the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University and then a child and adolescent psychiatry fellowship at Northwestern University. Parikh is presently an assistant professor at the Fienberg School of Medicine at the Northwestern University, Chicago and a medical director of the acute care services of the psychiatry and behaviour health department of the hospital at the Ann and Rober H Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago. He has published or presented over 50 research papers. “The award is a recognition of the struggle one has to go through to settle as a medical professional. It is a recognition of this long journey. It will keep me motivated to continue working in the future,” said Parikh. He added that he believes that the award also recognised the work done to help children who were affected psychologically during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Children had a really tough time during the pandemic. They had to come to us instead of going to school. Some even needed medication besides psychotherapy,” he said. He added that he was also involved with various activities of the IAMA throughout the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-doc-bags-iamas-award/articleshow/87856274.cms||---
---||Goa||Work on national highway at Agasaim piles traffic onto narrow Goa Velha road||PANAJI: If the existing traffic congestion on either side of the Zuari bridge wasn’t enough, closure of a single lane of the Agasaim bypass road on NH 66 for concretisation is compounding the traffic problem, which is only expected to worsen during the festive and peak tourist season. The lane closure has been notified till December 15. All vehicular movement from Panaji to Margao is currently being diverted via the old and narrow Goa Velha-Pilar village road, choking traffic movement between the two districts. Only on Thursday last week were a few vehicles being permitted despite the lane closure, on the under construction road. The PWD issued the notification for temporary single-lane closure between October 27 and December 15 to facilitate construction of the national highway. Only a narrow and extremely bumpy shoulder of the under construction highway is open for vehicles plying between the Zuari bridge and Bambolim. Vehicles travelling from North Goa towards Vasco and Margao have consequently been left with no option but to take the Goa Velha-Pilar road. This narrow two-lane road has been seeing bumper-to-bumper traffic ever since the bypass road was closed. When KTC buses, especially the broad electric buses, halt for passengers along this route even for a few seconds, traffic piles up as there’s no alternative on the two-lane road. The congestion is seen from Siridao right up to the bridge during peak hours. PWD officials told TOI that Dilip Buildcon, the contractor for the Zuari bridge, is expected to complete laying the concrete pavements by Tuesday, following which the concrete will require another 28 days for curing. Quality could suffer with mounting pressure to open the road, PWD said. There are plans to open a wing of the bridge on December 19 to mark 60 years of Goa’s liberation. “Technically, 28 days are required for curing of the concrete and for it to be strengthened. But we can’t afford that much time. Considering the traffic situation, we may have to open the road before that. A service road to let part of the traffic has already been opened and there are plans to open the entire road by December 10,” the PWD told TOI. An engineer and regular commuter on the route said the concretisation work could have been taken up in the slack season. “They wasted that time. This is nothing but bad project management. Other options could have been worked out,” he said. The traffic situation is likely to get more chaotic with the International Film Festival of India, the novena and feast of St Francis Xavier, long weekends, Christmas, and New Year. Mariano Pinto, an office-goer who travels between Margao and Porvorim, told TOI that he has begun taking his two-wheeler instead of his car to work. “It’s not easy riding on the unpaved and dusty road on the Agasaim bypass with a two-wheeler, but if I take my car, the entire journey is much longer and it takes a toll on me. The potholes and uneven road stretches are also responsible for slowing down traffic,” he told TOI. He suggested that taxis from North Goa proceeding to the airport be diverted via the Verna road instead of being permitted to turn in at the Cortalim circle, which is where congestion is also seen. DySP traffic (North) Salim Shaikh, told TOI that 50 traffic police personnel have been deployed between Bambolim and Cortalim as well as on the internal Pilar road. “We are doing our best to ensure that traffic keeps moving,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-on-national-highway-at-agasaim-piles-traffic-onto-narrow-goa-velha-road/articleshow/87857020.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Every day, two kiosk operators will sit on hunger strike between 9.30am and 5pm until their demand is met. A kiosk operator Inacio Pereira said even after several meetings with chief minister Pramod Sawant and others, and even after assurances of rehabilitation, the actual work of erecting kiosks is yet to start. “We were promised that work will start by November 10, but no movement has been seen, so we have no other way than to resume protests,” Pereira said. In July, the government had demolished kiosks and removed the fruit and vegetable vendors that operated outside the premises of Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital along the highway encroaching public space. After a much hue and cry, and with the intervention of Santa Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes and St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira, it was agreed upon to rehabilitate genuine operators. While a plan was drawn, it had to be modified as five kiosk owners, who operated under the government’s Deen Dayal scheme, went to the high court. Following the high court order, the five kiosks had to be rehabilitated first. The plan for rehabilitation of the remaining kiosks was drawn afresh and it is yet to take shape on ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kiosk-operators-outside-gmc-begin-chain-hunger-strike/articleshow/87857009.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Fully vaxxed shouldn’t ignore Covid, must test & treat early’||MUMBAI: A Malad doctor who lost his fully vaccinated brother to Covid has urged the government to spread awareness about the possibility of severity and death in a small percentage of people despite taking both doses of vaccine. Dr Satishchandra Shenoy said his 63-year-old brother Sharad delayed seeing a doctor for four to five days thinking he was fully protected by the vaccine. “He had a history of diabetes and hypertension and yet he didn’t feel the urgency to consult a doctor after developing fever. That’s because enough is not done to educate people about the possibility of getting Covid inspite of vaccination,” said Shenoy. The doctor recalled that his brother had travelled to their native place, Vengurla in Sindhudurg, and Kolhapur in the first week of October. He developed fever on October 1 and took some over-the-counter medicines the next day. Shenoy said by the time he had returned to Mumbai on October 5, he had 103-degree fever. His sugar level had jumped to 380. A rapid antigen test at Shenoy’s clinic showed he had Covid. Shenoy said they rushed him to Kokilaben Hospital, where doctors said 80% of his lungs were damaged. “He had also missed the window to get monoclonal antibodies,” said the doctor-brother, adding that he succumbed to Covid pneumonia on October 17 after staying on high-flow oxygen and ventilator for nearly two weeks. “We must collate the data of deaths of fully vaccinated individuals and try to understand what’s causing them,” he said. In Mumbai, the share of senior citizens in Covid deaths has started to rise again to reach pre-vaccination levels, giving rise to concerns about waning immunity of vaccines. Also, it’s important to remember that vaccines don’t provide 100% protection against the virus and there will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick, are hospitalised, or die from the viral disease, said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee. “It is, therefore, important to continue taking precautions such as wearing mask and maintaining social distancing despite vaccination,” he added. Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious diseases expert and member of the Covid task force, said doctors are witnessing criticality in vaccinated patients too, but the number is miniscule and far fewer in comparison to unvaccinated people. “The vast majority of vaccinated people won’t have severe Covid. But a small percentage suffer because of immune response and genetic factors, among other reasons,” he said. People must consult doctors at the earliest as emerging therapies such as monoclonal antibodies work optimally when administered early, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fully-vaxxed-shouldnt-ignore-covid-must-test-treat-early/articleshow/87857018.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kochi||No anti-national acts by 12 Rohingya refugees in state: Kerala tells SC||NEW DELHI: The Kerala government has told the Supreme Court that at present there are 12 Rohingya refugees present in the state and no anti-national activities including their association with Pakistan’s ISI or the Islamic State or Caliphate (ISIS) has been reported so far. The state made the submission in response to a PIL filed by BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay seeking directions to the Centre and the states to identify, detain and deport all the illegal migrants and infiltrators including Bangladeshis and Rohingya. Kerala government in an affidavit said the refugees present in the state comprise two families, including two newborn babies, who are residing at Muttil in the Wayanad district. It said, “So far, no instances of Rohingyas being associated with ISI or ISIS were reported in the state.” Kerala government also submitted that during the last five years, no case under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956, has been reported against Rohingyas or illegal Bangladesh immigrants in the state. The affidavit further submitted that in 2015, Wayanad Muslim Orphanage authorities (WMO), an NGO, brought the Rohingyan Refugees to Bafaqi Home, Mananthavady, Wayanad. As per the standard operating procedure issued by MHA on “infiltration of Rohihyans into the Country”, their biometric and biographic details were uploaded in the government e-portal except one new baby born in December 2019, it said. At the time of the arrival of these Rohingyas in Kerala, they possessed UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) cards, it said, adding that renewal of cards of four Rohingyans, belonging to one family, however, are pending as they are unable to go to Chennai, due to financial hardships and Covid-19 pandemic situation. The affidavit said that instructions have been given to district police chief, Wayanad to maintain a close watch on Rohingyan refugees. About illegal migrants, the state is taking concrete steps to detect the overstaying foreigners who used forged travel documents or surreptitiously entered into the country and a committee has been constituted to detect foreigners who have been illegally overstaying in India since January 1, 2011, it added. Earlier, the Karnataka government had told the Supreme Court that it would "scrupulously" follow the orders to be passed on the PIL. Upadhyay, in his PIL, has sought a direction to the Centre and the states to "amend respective laws to make illegal immigration and infiltration a cognizable, non-bailable and con-compoundable offence". "The large-scale illegal migrants, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, have not only threatened the demographic structure of bordering districts but seriously impaired security and national integration," the plea said. Upadhyay's plea alleged there was an organised influx of illegal migrants from Myanmar through agents and touts via West Bengal, Tripura, and Guwahati. "This situation is seriously harming the national security of the country," the plea said. Earlier, the apex court, on April 8, had made it clear that Rohingyas, who have been detained in Jammu, shall not be deported to Myanmar unless the procedure prescribed for such deportation is followed by the authorities. The bench had said it is true that rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution are available to all the persons who may or may not be citizens but the right not to be deported is "ancillary or concomitant" to the right to reside or settle in any part of India. While Article 14 deals with equality before the law, Article 21 deals with the protection of life and personal liberty. The order was passed on an application seeking the release of detained Rohingya refugees and also a direction to the Centre not to deport those who have been detained in the sub-jail in Jammu. The Centre had earlier opposed the plea saying the country cannot be the "capital" for illegal immigrants. Violent attacks allegedly by the Myanmar army have led to an exodus of Rohingya tribals from the western Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh. Many of them, who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, have settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR, and Rajasthan. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-anti-national-acts-by-12-rohingya-refugees-in-state-kerala-tells-sc/articleshow/87857013.cms||---

Representing the Sneha Self Help Group of Samagra Sanjeevani Okkota, the women were trained at a programme organised by the Bharatiya Vikas Trust, NABARD and College of Fisheries in the last week of August. Savithri HS, Shaheeda Begum, Naseema and Harshiya have sold about 150 kgs of fish chaklis and sandiges since the launch, with the support of the fisheries department. This is probably the first successful product under the ‘One District, One Product’ (ODOP) scheme to promote the micro food processing industry. Savithri HS told TOI, “The fisheries department has given us the opportunity to put up stalls at events. At the Krishi Mela in Bengaluru, we sold fish ‘Kodubale’. We are noticing a good demand for these products from North Karnataka districts, including Chitradurga, Davangere and Kalaburagi. Currently, we prepare about 25 kgs per day. Under the PM Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PM FME), we hope to procure machinery and increase production,” said Savithri. They sell fish chaklis in pepper, chilli, ginger, garlic, mango and palak flavours. They also sell fish chutney and fish biryani masala. The team is in talks with the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation for marketing the products, she said. Dr Sushmitha Rao, deputy director, fisheries department, said that under the ODOP scheme to promote the micro food processing industry in the state, marine products has been selected for Dakshina Kannada and Udupi based on the prevalence in the district and considering the scope in the market for them. The department is currently focusing on training women to produce value added products so that individual enterprises will get support under the PMFME scheme through credit linked capital grant at 35% of the eligible capital expenditure with a maximum ceiling of Rs 10 lakh per unit. Beneficiary contribution should be minimum of 10% of the capital expenditure with balance being loan from the bank, she said. “Currently there are about three SHGs that have been identified and selling various value added marine products. While the sales for the products are good, the focus should now be on marketing and branding,” Sushmitha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pink-perch-fish-chaklis-4-women-sell-150kg-since-sept/articleshow/87856812.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

This September, Congress and BJP members had slammed Shiv Sena-ruled civic body for floating a tender at an estimated Rs 15.26 crore for maintenance of seven penguins for 36 months. The opposition, alleging that the cost was too much, questioned the civic body why the birds could not be maintained by in-house staff. The civic body, which had promised to review the cost, has not lowered it.

---||Jaipur||‘Oil business revenue much larger, but tech is the future’||With a thriving edible oil family business and a recently acquired ceramic crockery manufacturing factory in Jaipur, Ajay Data had all reasons not to look outside for an entrepreneurial journey. Even though he did a two-year MBA course in computer application, system analysis & design in 1994, PhD in electronic data processing, those were a bit of a hobby for him and he was sure he would go back to the family business. After his studies he had joined his uncle in streamlining operations of the ceramic factory, but he never lost sight of what was happening in the tech world in the late 1990s. One day in 1999, an advertisement for appointing a licensee for providing Internet Service Provider (ISP) caught his eye. “I applied for the licence and subsequently got selected. Since the private company said it wanted a partner in Jaipur, I took it literally. They were looking for a kind of dealership. I was after them to do it together. ISP was a new thing and I wanted handholding. They got a bit irritated and said ‘ye teliyon ka dhanda nahin hai’,” recalls Ajay. But that demeaning statement spurred him. He managed to set up the business. “On the very first day I got back the Rs 80 lakh I had invested in the business. People had bought connections immediately as I announced a date to start the service,” says Ajay. Soon Data realized that the prices of ISP connections falling faster than the cost reduction in lease lines. He needed more products to support the IT business. “I identified that enterprise email service is going to be a big segment. With a three-man team, I started Xgen. The product found good traction. Even today, it remains a big part of our product portfolio along with software services that we design for enterprises and e-governance,” says Ajay. The family had a business separation in 2008 with his uncle retaining the ceramic business, while oil, ghee and IT business came to Ajay’s family. Since the split, edible oil business & IT has grown from a revenue of about Rs 170 crore in 2008 to Rs 1,900 crore in 2020-21. “Of course, the IT business revenue is small. But it is strategic for us. It is more profitable, futuristic, and has long-term visibility. Also, the logic of revenue pales when you innovate to solve problems of the society and the satisfaction you get,” explains Ajay. In 2016, Ajay brought in innovations that were never done in the world. He created emails with local language domain names. For example, he is offering emails in Chinese, Russian, Korean, and Sri Lankan languages. “The world has taken note of the innovations coming from Jaipur,” says Ajay. In fact, Ajay, co-founder of TIE Rajasthan and Entrepreneur Organisation, became the first person in India to represent in ccNSO (a body of 170 countries) of ICANN in 2016. He even chaired ICANN’s Universal Acceptance Steering Group. While IT takes much of his time, he plays a key part in strategic decision making for the oil business. Ajay’s brother Deepak, who manages the edibles business, supports IT passively while their father Babulal Data charts out the vision for the group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oil-business-revenue-much-larger-but-tech-is-the-future/articleshow/87857688.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: JP Nadda fires salvo at Akhilesh Yadav over Jinnah, BJP vaccine remarks||GORAKHPUR/LUCKNOW: BJP national president, J P Nadda on Monday fired a salvo at the Opposition, accusing it of speaking on Pakistan and its founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, just when UP elections were around the corner. “Woh Pakistan aur Jinnah ki baat karte hain aur hum Mahatma Gandhi aur Sardar Patel ki (They speak about Pakistan and Jinnah, while we speak of Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel),” Nadda said, while speaking at the booth-level convention in Gorakhpur. Nadda’s offensive comes days after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav compared Gandhi, Nehru and Patel with Jinnah, sparking a controversy. The BJP ranks, including CM Yogi Adityanath quickly latched onto the remark to blast the SP boss, accusing him of “minority appeasement”. The BJP chief’s comment also came a day after Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Siddhu reportedly called Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan a “Bada Bhai” (big brother), triggering sharp reactions from the BJP brass. Nadda’s acerbic reference to the “Jinnah remark” was seen as BJP’s attempt to lend a stunning blow to SP, which has been positioning itself aggressively against the saffron dispensation in the run-up to polls early next year. His statement held much political pertinence, especially in east UP, which is offers a contrast to the communally restive west UP region. The BJP president maintained while his party stood for “sanskritik rashtravad” (cultural nationalism) the opposition favoured “parivaarwad” (nepotism).Nadda also slammed the opposition for calling corona vaccine as “BJP’s vaccine”. “When Modi ji was saying he will give two vaccines, some people began saying that was a BJP vaccine or a Modi vaccine. Now, they are going around after getting inoculated with the same vaccine,” he said. The remark was also seen as a pointed reference to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, who had initially refused to get inoculated. Nadda scaled up the attack saying “after some time the red topis (caps) will also turn saffron”. The BJP chief also flayed the opposition for “posing” as farmer leaders. “They forget what PM Modi did for farmers. Before 2014, the agriculture budget was Rs20,000 crore. Under leadership of PM Modi, it has gone up to Rs 1.23 lakh crore,” he said. Nadda’s charge at the opposition comes four days after PM Modi announced his government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws which were at the centre of farmer protest. This also marked BJP’s counter charge at the opposition, amid farmers’ associations upping the ante while demanding legal guarantee for MSP and sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son, Ashish, is an accused in Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which eight persons were killed. Nadda also lauded CM Yogi for bringing much-needed changes in the law and order front. “Earlier women were unsafe, but now criminals appeal in court to go to jail. Earlier, the mafia and rioters were powerful, but now they have forgotten gundai or fled the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-fires-salvo-at-akhilesh-over-jinnah-bjp-vax-remarks/articleshow/87857686.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Mumbai||Only 24% of Rs 799 crore in Maharashtra chief minister’s Covid fund has been used: RTI||MUMBAI: The corpus under the Maharashtra Chief Minister Covid-19 Relief Fund has ballooned to Rs 799 crore, almost double of what it was six months ago. Of that, the state government’s fund disbursal remains poor at Rs 192 crore or 24%, said activist Anil Galgali who sought details of the total amount deposited into the fund and spent under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. Galgali said his RTI query has revealed that Rs 606.3 crore was lying unutilised. The lion’s share at Rs 82.4 crore was spent on the fare of migrant labourers from 36 districts. Then the second highest donation, at Rs 49.8 crore, was given to sex workers for Covid care. “The state should stop taking fresh donations now,” said Galgali, who had filed multiple RTIs seeking details of the Maharashtra CM Covid-19 Relief Fund. Earlier, in May 2021, Galgali received a response stating the fare of migrant labourers located across various districts was pegged at Rs 55.2 crore. The amount spent towards migrant labourers was transferred to the respective collectors of the state so that the railway fare could be paid. Galgali has written to CM Uddhav Thackeray demanding that Covid funds be used to improve the healthcare services being offered in the BMC and other government hospitals. When TOI contacted the Chief Minister’s Office, the officials said they were unable to currently comment on whether accepting fresh donations would be stopped. Also, it was unclear if there were any plans on how the remaining Rs 606 crore would be utilised. The state set up the CM’s Covid relief fund to help the government tackle the impact of the pandemic and appealed to people to donate money into it. The donations get an income-tax waiver under Section 80(G).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-24-of-rs-799cr-in-cms-covid-fund-has-been-used-rti/articleshow/87857043.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kisan credit card scheme will be extended to fishermen, says Union minister||KOCHI: The Kisan credit card scheme will be extended to fishermen to provide them loans at low interest rates, said Union fisheries and animal husbandry minister L Murugan in Kochi on Monday. Speaking at the inauguration of the ‘Fishermen Convention’ organized by Kerala pradesh fishermen group (BMS) at Munambam before concluding his day visit to the city, the minister said that the Union government had earmarked Rs 7.5 crore to set up integrated fishermen villages with schools, healthcare facilities, etc. The Centre’s commitment to fishermen was evident in the fact that it had created a separate department for fisheries and set apart Rs 20,000 crore for the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Campaign. He added that fuel subsidies for fishermen will continue. Earlier, during the day, he visited the Kochi fishing harbour, MPEDA’s quality control laboratory and an accelerated freeze-drying facility company in Alappuzha. “More fishing harbours in the country will be upgraded to international standards. Five fishing harbours in the country, including Kochi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam and Paradeep will be upgraded to international standards. As part of this, ice plants and processing facilities will be arranged at the harbour itself,” he said. He said that through the modernization of ports, fishermen will be able to get better prices for their products. The Centre aimed at increasing the value of fish exports to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2024-25. A detailed project report of the seaweed processing centre to be set up in the special economic zone in Tamil Nadu is being prepared. It will ensure employment opportunities and economic empowerment for women in the fisheries sector, the minister added. He also visited the Accelerated Freeze-Drying Company (AFDC) at Ezhupunna in Alappuzha district. AFDC Ezhupunna is one of the few prawn processing-exporting companies in the country with accelerated freeze and drying systems. The minister also held discussions with AFDC MD Abraham J Tharakan and inspected the operation of the seafood processing systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kisan-credit-card-scheme-will-be-extended-to-fishermen-says-union-min/articleshow/87857041.cms||---
---||Agra||Undertrial found hanging from tree in Aligarh jail, kin allege foul play||Agra: A 52-year-old undertrial prisoner, who was arrested on charges of theft, was found hanging from a tree in Aligarh district jail around 6.15 am on Monday. While jail authorities termed it a case of suicide, the victim’s family alleged foul play, saying he was looking forward to the hearing of his case on December 4. A judicial inquiry will be conducted into the matter, which is mandatory under the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). According to jail authorities, Omkar Singh was brought to the jail on September 24 in a cylinder theft case. “Omkar was arrested on September 9, too, after he was booked under section 151 of CrPC (prevention of commission of cognizable offences) but he managed to get bail and was released on September 18. A week later he was arrested again on September 24,” said jailor Pramod Kumar Singh. Singh’s brother Veeram said that the family learnt about the death from police. Veeram added, "Omkar, who worked as a driver, had called us family a few days ago to inform us that his case would be heard on December 4. How could he kill himself when he was looking forward to the hearing of his case? He might have been killed inside the prison.” Jail superintendent Vipin Kumar Mishra refuted the allegations and said there was no callousness on the part of prison authorities. He said none of his family members visited the prison to meet Omkar during his two months’ stay in jail. “We provide counselling sessions to prisoners every day and make all efforts to ensure that inmates do not suffer from depression,” claimed Mishra. After postmortem, the prisoner’s body was handed over to the family following which it was cremated in the evening. According to jail authorities, 4,000 prisoners, including 550 convicted ones, are lodged in the district jail at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/undertrial-found-hanging-from-tree-in-aligarh-jail-kin-allege-foul-play/articleshow/87856299.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi: Woman stabbed to death with scissors in Okhla||NEW DELHI: Outraged with his female colleague being friendly with another co-worker, a 26-year-old man stabbed her with a pair of scissors in the neck, killing her on the spot. The accused, Chand Alam, a resident of Okhla Phase-I, has been arrested. The deceased, Jharna (37), worked at a factory in Pul Prahladpur in southeast Delhi. The incident took place on Saturday. Police found the woman’s body on Sunday morning and call detail records showed she was with a friend, Alam, the night before. Subsequently, Alam was arrested from Indira Kalyan Vihar in Okhla. During interrogation, the accused told police that he started working in an export company at Pul Prahladpur in 2015 where he came in contact with Jharna. They became friends and started spending time with each other. He also allegedly used to give her Rs 6,000 every month, police said. In February, Alam came to know that Jharna was also friends with another person, Suraj. They fought over this and he stopped giving her money. But as he was upset, he made a plan to kill her. On Saturday, Alam met her at Badarpur bus stop and took her to an abandoned quarter near the railway tracks in Tehkhand, Okhla. An argument ensued and he took out a pair of scissors from Jharna’s bag and stabbed her in the neck. He covered her body with a plastic bag and smashed her mobile phone. He disposed of the scissors and bloodstained clothes in a drain. Police have recovered the clothes and the victim’s mobile phone. The woman was married and had two children. Alam is also married. A chargesheet would soon be filed against the accused, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-stabbed-to-death-with-scissors/articleshow/87857056.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Traffic logjam near CGO complex to persist||NEW DELHI: Commuters will have to bear with the diversion near CGO Complex for a few more days. PWD, which is carrying out the repair work on a cave-in, was scheduled to complete the work by Sunday, but it has been unable to do so. As a result, traffic has been affected near Ashram, Lodhi Road and Moolchand. Last Friday, traffic police had issued an advisory asking commuters to plan their journey in advance. Commuters travelling to south Delhi or heading towards Central Delhi via Ashram were getting stuck not just during rush hour, but even during the day owing to the heavy load of vehicles. During the morning and evening hours, traffic moved at a snail’s pace from Barapullah towards Lodhi Road and even at Ashram because of construction of the underpass. Heavy traffic was also reported at Kalindi Kunj and Chirag Dilli. Due to the ban on heavy vehicles, the borders witnessed slow moving traffic as trucks were parked there. A senior traffic officer told TOI that the work was scheduled to be over by Sunday. “We had issued an advisory on Sunday and asked commuters to plan their journey in advance. Even on weekends, our men are on ground to regulate traffic as there is heavy rush. People have been visiting the trade fair too. We are updating commuters through our Twitter handle also,” added the officer. On Friday, a Delhi Jal Board pipeline burst and created excess pressure, which resulted in the road caving in. “It will take three more days for the work to be completed. We are looking at ways to close the pipe. As of now, some sand bags have been placed to control the flow of water. Such issues can occur anytime and one can’t be prepared for it,” said a PWD official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-logjam-near-cgo-complex-to-persist/articleshow/87857062.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid cases, deaths lowest in Maharashtra since April 2020||MUMBAI: The state reported its lowest daily cases and deaths since April 2020 in a likely effect of the drop in testing over the weekend. After nearly 70,000 tests, 656 person tested positive; eight deaths were reported on Monday. The state’s daily cases are the lowest since April 30, 2020, (583) and daily deaths the fewest since April 17, 2020, when seven casualties were reported. This is the first time this year that the state has reported deaths in single digits. Although the city tally (174) on Monday was less than 200 for the fourth time this month, its death toll rose, accounting for half of the state’s eight deaths. For all of last week, the city had one or two daily deaths. Only 24,798 tests were conducted in Mumbai due to staff holiday on Sunday, resulting in the test positivity rate rising to 0.7%. However, a BMC official said active cases were dropping in the city and fewer buildings were sealed. There have been no containment zones (mainly in slum and slum-like areas) since mid-August. State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said violation of Covid protocols across all districts continued to be a concern despite active cases dropping below 10,000 on Sunday, the lowest since the early days of the pandemic. “The state has relaxed all curbs, now it is up to the people to ensure that all Covid protocols are followed. We are keeping a close watch on sudden rise in cases in any cluster,” the minister said, demanding booster doses for health workers and senior citizens with comorbidities. State task force chairman Dr Sanjay Oak said we must not forget that several countries are seeing a rise in cases. “In our country, too, we are seeing a slow and steady rise in paediatric cases. It would be preposterous to think the pandemic is over,” said Oak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-deaths-lowest-in-state-since-april-2020/articleshow/87857054.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Poor response stalls Covid vaccine trials on kids at PGI-Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Response for Covovax trials on children under the age of 12 at PGI, Chandigarh has been poor. Researchers will go to schools and talk to parents as well as teachers so that the vaccine against Covid for children can be tested. “We need some 40 to 45 volunteers for age groups between 2 and 12 years of age. We have completed registration for children between 12 and 17 years of age,” said Prof Madhu Gupta, principal investigator of the study at the PGI site for trials. This time, enrolment of children is difficult as they do not come to immunisation clinics in the institute. Researchers have conducted trials on children as small as 1.5 months for rotavirus and pentavalent vaccines. “These children used to come for routine immunisation to clinics. As the vaccination schedule is until 1.5 years and after five years, we need to find children for trials in the community,” said Prof Madhu. There have been studies and common observations that parents are reluctant to get their children vaccinated against Covid. “The same happened for the adult population and now we have seen its impact on reduction of transmission and severity of infection. To protect our children, we need to inoculate them and for this, trials are important,” said Prof Madhu. She added, “There is no need to worry about the safety of participants as we have not seen any adverse event in those 12 years and 17 years of age in this trial.” PGI is one of the trial centres for the Covovax, which shall be phase 2/3 observer blind randomised control study to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Covovax in children aged between 2 years and 17 years. The study is sponsored by the Serum Institute of India (SII). There will be 100 participants in the trial study. The children will be followed up for six months after they are jabbed with two shots of Covovax after a gap of 21 days. SII has partnered with Novovax, which is branded as Covovax in India. The vaccine is expected to be launched by the year- end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/researchers-stalled-by-poor-response-to-vaccine-trials-on-kids/articleshow/87856303.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Rape charge added to murder of 30-year-old woman by minor||NEW DELHI: A rape charge has been added by police in the murder case of a 30-year-old woman whose body was found near a canal on November 15. The accused, who is a juvenile, was apprehended and booked for rape, murder and destruction of evidence. The 17-year-old accused allegedly told police that he tied the hands of the woman and sexually assaulted her. Fearing that he would be caught for the crime, he strangled her. He then put kerosene on her private parts to remove traces of semen. A board of doctors who conducted the autopsy confirmed that the woman was sexually assaulted before being killed. A kerosene bottle, traces of the woman’s hair in the accused’s house and van, tape used to tie her body and her partially burnt clothes have been recovered. A source said the juvenile, in his statement to police, disclosed that on the day of the incident he had asked the victim to come to his house on the pretext of offering her work. The woman worked as a domestic help in several houses in the area. The accused lived just two houses away from where she worked. “The juvenile wanted to develop physical relations with the woman, but she resisted his efforts. He then tied her up and assaulted her. Since he feared being caught, he strangled the woman and set her private parts on fire to hide traces of semen. A portion of her face also got burnt. He then put the body in his car, dumped it near the canal and returned home,” added the source. Initially, the body remained unidentified. Later, in CCTV footage the woman was seen entering the area where the juvenile lived. However, she could not be seen exiting the area. The investigators began a door-to-door search and finally reached the juvenile’s house. The woman’s body was wrapped in a green cloth. The same coloured cloth was seen as a curtain in the juvenile’s house. He had used the curtain to tie her. When police searched the house, they could smell burnt cloth. “Cops then searched the vehicle outside the house. All of its tyres were punctured. The woman’s hair and footwear was recovered from it. The boy then broke down and confessed to having killed her. The kerosene bottle, which he had thrown elsewhere, was recovered at his instance. So were the remains of the clothes he was wearing,” said the source. Police said the vehicle was spotted in CCTV footage leaving the area and returning after 15-20 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rape-charge-added-to-murder-of-30-yr-old-woman-by-minor/articleshow/87857068.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Protest does not mean students & public should suffer: Bombay HC to striking MSRTC staff||MUMBAI: Observing that students returning to physical school and colleges cannot be made to suffer, the Bombay high court on Monday directed that drivers and conductors of MSRTC who are willing to ply buses must be allowed to do so. The HC also stated that it expects the protesting union members to remain peaceful and not resort to violence, and directed that if they do, the state can immediately initiate action against them. The HC bench of Justices P B Varale and S M Modak was hearing a petition by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), which had also submitted an affidavit pointing to instances of alleged obstruction and “stone pelting” when staffers were reporting for duty in the last several days. MSRTC senior counsel S U Kamdar with advocate Pinky Bhansali tried to seek an order to bar protestors from assembling at the gates and blocking employees from reporting to duty. The HC did not pass such an order after advocate Gunratan Sadavarte for the striking union members said they were not blocking and only conducting a peaceful protest. The HC, however, did ask Sadavarte to ensure people aren’t inconvenienced. “When we are permitting you to have a peaceful protest, it ought not to block fellow colleagues. You are considering only one aspect — your democratic right to protest. These poor boys who have not attended school for one and half years, when the state has now opened schools, do you expect them to walk? The protest doesn’t mean that your agitation should result in suffering of the students and general public. There must be some balance,” the HC warned. The HC said that pursuant to its November 15 order in a contempt petition filed by MSRTC against the protesting employees, members of the Maharashtra Rajya Kanisht Vetan Shreni Kamgar union attended a meeting of the committee it had ordered to be appointed. Government pleader P P Kakade said representatives of 26 other unions are also called on by the panel to submit their independent views from November 23. The HC directed that the committee, after hearing all parties, including the MSRTC and the state, must place its “preliminary opinion” before the court on December 20. When Sadavarte submitted that healthcare of protesters was an issue and sought doctors’ presence at protest site, the state said it had already placed fully equipped ambulances at the site with doctors. The HC, in its order, also said protesting members can be rushed to the “nearest hospital” in case of an emergency. The HC suo motu cited two news articles, including one by MSRTC’s ex-employee, which made relevant suggestions, and asked the state to consider them to resolve the stand-off between protesters and state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/protest-does-not-mean-students-public-should-suffer-in-mumbai-hc-to-striking-msrtc-staff/articleshow/87857707.cms||---

In another positive sign, the number of pregnant women taking the Covid-19 shot in Maharashtra has doubled, according to the current data analysed by the public health department. Till Monday, the state had administered 10.8 crore doses, fully vaccinating 3.6 crore people while giving at least one shot to 7.2 crore people. Second dose vaccinations had slowed down considerably as the festival season began in October. “Some districts such as Aurangabad and Buldhana are showing an uptick in demand,” said Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer. The average daily vaccinations in the state are now in the range of 7-8 lakh. Yet, more than 20 districts are below the state average when it comes to full immunisation. While Maharashtra has given both shots to 39.6% of its population, as many as 16 districts have done so to less than 30% of their population. Solapur is at the bottom now, having given two shots to merely 23.5% of its residents. Mumbai is the best performer, covering 69.3% of its eligible population. In a data update exercise, the health department found that many more pregnant women had taken the vaccine. Till the beginning of November, records showed 32,537 of them had received one dose. This number jumped two fold to 68,991 after the completion of the exercise. As against 1,026 fully vaccinated pregnant women till the beginning of November, the figure has now increased to 3,471. Still the vaccination numbers are miniscule, considering there are nearly 20 lakh pregnant women as per estimates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-doses-for-40-in-state-pregnant-women-takers-up/articleshow/87857066.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||No affordable medicine store at PGI for now||CHANDIGARH: Nothing has come out of deliberations on opening a hospital-based pharmacy at PGI to provide medicines at reduced prices and the project is likely to be scrapped. Space for the drug store was marked a few years ago but senior officials feel this is not a feasible project. “It is not easy to have drugs in a lower price range and allow particular brands alone,” said a senior official in the PGI administration. Although this concept is functional at SGPGI Lucknow and doctors had proposed the same model here, the project might not take off now. “In SGPGI, everything costs while we have many grants and funds for patient welfare that offer free or cheap rates treatment. Therefore, they can have the pharmacy store, that offers all branded and generic medicines which can be run by the institute,” said the senior official. The idea of the pharmacy was to open the institute's own drug store to provide branded drugs at cheaper rates without the involvement of a middle agency. There are Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) stores -- a Government of India initiative, that offer highly subsidised cancer, cardiovascular drugs and cardiac implants at PGI. However, these are not available for all diseases and more such stores are required for access to medicines. “The GoI had asked doctors to prescribe generic medicines but this has not been regulated. The patients cannot make out the difference and demand the same medicine as prescribed by the doctor. Even if another company makes the same drug at a lesser price, the patient would refuse to buy. However, if the doctors follow the practice of writing only the salt of the medicine, things can be convenient,” said a chemist at PGI. There are over 18 chemist shops in PGI which have varying rates of discounts from 10% to 15%. “Depending on which shop is located where, the price varies. In case of emergency, the cost of medicines is highest there and since there is urgency in treatment, patients buy from there to avoid delay in treatment,” said an attendant in the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-affordable-medicine-store-at-pgi-for-now/articleshow/87856314.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The minister on Monday met Union minister for environment, forests and climate change Bhupinder Yadav, and submitted the memorandum by the state in this regard. “The minister has agreed to take a lenient view on the matter. The minister said that it will provide all help within the contours of the wildlife protection act in this matter. The discussions at the level of secretaries will continue and we hope that a favourable decision will evolve in this regard,” Saseendran told TOI. As a prelude to considering the state’s request, principal secretary (forests and wildlife) Rajesh Kumar Sinha and principal chief conservator of forests and head of forest force P K Keshavan will hold discussions with secretary and the director general of the ministry of environment forests and climate change. Further discussions will be held with the Union minister who is expected to visit the state in the last week of November or the first week of December. The state had approached the Centre in the wake of large-scale destruction of agriculture crops by wild boars, making lives difficult for the farmers in areas near the forests. As per the figures given by the minister in the assembly on October 7 this year, 504 wild boars were shot dead in one-and-a-half months till then. In his meeting with the Union minister, Saseendran also handed over a detailed project report (DPR) prepared by the state forest department for reducing the human-wildlife conflict. The state plans to implement the project in the next five years, for which it has requested an assistance of Rs 620 crore from the Centre. The proposal has been prepared such that the cost will be borne by the Centre and the state in 60:40 proportion. Saseendran said that once the Centre provides financial assistance, the project can be completed within the stipulated time. He said that the government is taking steps to ensure adequate food and water to the wildlife inside the forests. He said that for demarcating the forest boundaries using digital methods, the state has sought a financial assistance of Rs 60 crore from the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/centre-to-consider-plea-to-declare-wild-boars-as-vermin/articleshow/87857084.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Day 1 : Attendance thin but excitement high in Gujarat schools||AHMEDABAD: In-person studies for Classes 1 to 5 began on Monday but the attendance was thin at government-run schools. Private schools are yet to resume offline education for this group. The state government in a sudden move announced on Sunday that in-person studies for Classes 1 to 5 would restart from Monday, immediately after the Diwali vacation ended on November 21. Parents and school authorities were left with very little time to prepare as parents are required to submit consent letters to schools before sending their children back to class. “Government-run schools in the state recorded about 15% attendance,” said a source. “The highest was in Tapi district while the lowest was in Vadodara district.” In the city, AMC-run schools drew an overwhelming response with about 65% attendance of the permissible limit, said L D Desai, the AMC school board administrator. He said that of the 1 lakh students of Classes 1 to 5, about 32,500 attended on Day 1. In line with the Covid-19 guidelines issued by the state government, schools are allowed to have only 50% of the students of the total class strength. Asked how the schools managed to get consent from such a large number of parents, Desai said that teachers went to students’ homes to get consent letters. Neither parents nor schools got enough time to make the necessary arrangements for resuming offline studies, said sources. Hitesh Patel, the president of Ahmedabad School Management Association, a group of grant-in-aid school managements and trustees, said very few students could attend school on the first day since resumption. “But parents are quite excited to send their children to school and we are expecting a good number of Class 1 to 5 students to start attending school over the next few days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/day-1-attendance-thin-but-excitement-high-in-schools/articleshow/87857075.cms||---

Of this, only 0.1% or 20 persons died in this age group in Gujarat. Of the total deaths (10,091), the share of patients below 15 years is 0.2%, statistics show. In fact, this group had the lowest death rate of all age groups. According to senior officials, the number reduced further after the second wave – as the Delta variant saw many cases where the entire families including children were infected. Experts said that across the globe, opening schools have led to small but insignificant spikes, but this should not deter parents from sending kids to school especially when almost everything else has opened up. City-based paediatricians said that the norm currently followed indicate the potential role of children as carriers of virus if they come in contact with any infected person. While the child may not even show any symptoms, he or she may carry it, but when the school staff and parents are fully vaccinated, it greatly reduces chances of spread. “On top of it, masks and social distancing provide an excellent cover. The classes must be well-ventilated and there must be less children than capacity. Non-sharing of water and meals and avoidance of assemblies can reduce risk,” said a city-based paediatrician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/children-account-for-just-2-of-cases-0-2-of-deaths/articleshow/87857142.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Poor maintenance leads to corrosion of JLN stadium roof||KOCHI: The roof of one of the premier sports stadiums in the state, which was host to international cricket matches, FIFA Under-17 World Cup matches, has rusted and needs urgent attention. The premises of the Jawaharlal Nehru International (JLN) Stadium at Kaloor, owned by the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA), also serves as a popular jogging track for morning walkers. The construction of Galvalume roof and allied works of the stadium were completed in 2010 at a cost of Rs 11 crore. GCDA officials said that since then no maintenance work was done to prolong the life of the structure. A report prepared by an expert in the field said the repairing of the joints, which support the truss roof, will require another Rs 9 crore. This is apart from the repair work on the corroded Galvalume roof. A senior GCDA official said that the roof corrodes fast due to the salty wind from the coast. GCDA has requested the government to allot Rs 9 crore to repair the joints of the roof. The government has now asked GCDA to constitute a committee comprising LSGD executive engineer, an expert from the IIT, and engineers from GCDA. “We have written to the LSGD about constituting the committee, which will inspect the roof and will come out with a solution,” said the official. The committee will examine whether the joints need to be replaced with new one. The panel will also check whether the whole roof needs to be replaced. A report will be submitted to the government soon. Tripunithura MLA K Babu sought vigilance inquiry into the issue as it raises safety concerns during the conduct of tournaments. He said a new roof should be erected urgently. “GCDA has not taken up any major projects in the past five years,” he said. The MLA also said no general council of the GCDA has been formed even six months after the assembly election was over. The authority is a defunct agency now. He asked to expand the jurisdiction of GCDA by including more areas for the development of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poor-maintenance-leads-to-corrosion-of-jln-stadium-roof/articleshow/87856328.cms||---

Another student body, Progressive Students’ Forum - TISS, has made the same demand and threatened to occupy the campus if it is not opened by November 30. TISS director Shalini Bharat told TOI that a committee for reopening the campus had been set up four weeks ago and it is looking at all the options. “We are a national institute and students will travel from all over the country to return to campus. The Covid situation in every state is evolving and we are concerned about the health of everyone.” Meanwhile, in a letter to the authorities, the TISS student fraternity has stated it has been more than 19 months since the campus was shut. Students who wrote to TISS about a week ago said they have been contacting the institute ever since the University Grants Commission laid down guidelines for opening of university campuses but there has been no response from the TISS authorities. “The pandemic affected the student community in the worst manner. The majority of the students belonging to marginalised communities are going through the toughest time due to the digital divide in the absence of basic resources such as electricity, internet connectivity and space for their studies,” students said. “These constraints are leading to anxiety, mental health and other psychological issues among students. Similarly, for research scholars, in the absence of library space, it is difficult to continue their research in an efficient manner,” they added. Members of the other student body, PSF-TISS, said their student community had “pe rsistently demanded” that their concerns over online education be addressed. “The administration however has only responded with a total lack of consideration. In light of the recent government orders, many campuses across the state have initiated the process of reopening but there has been no official response on this matter from the TISS administration.” Students said their grievances were being given “an apathetic treatment”. “Students are facing a lot of anxiety because of the uncertainties regarding the process.” Students said they have been asking the TISS administration to come up with a clear plan of action and notify the students about the reopening date and modalities by November 30. “PSF stands firm on this demand and shall continue our struggle till the administration comes out with a clear notification on the matter. Else, we, the students of TISS, as equal stakeholders of the institute, will start occupying our campus. This is the final call of action for the TISS administration. We will knock at the door of what is rightfully ours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/reopen-tiss-campus-by-nov-30-students/articleshow/87857070.cms||---

According to sources, the Congress will release the list of candidates after a meeting of the party’s state election committee, which will be formed soon. The Congress is likely to release the list of candidates in a phased manner instead of in one go. Talking to TOI, Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said that the party was waiting for the Punjab and Haryana high court order on the petition challenging reservation of wards. Thereafter, the state election committee of the Congress would be formed and the list of candidates would be announced after detailed discussions in the party’s Pradesh Election Committee (PEC), he said. Chawla added that there was anger against the BJP in Chandigarh over increasing inflation, failures of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation and poor Swachh rankings. In preparation for the elections, former union minister and ex-MP Chandigarh, Pawan Kumar Bansal has been meeting city residents and party leaders regularly. His son and Congress leader Manish Bansal also addressed public gatherings in different parts of the city. The Congress has already received around 200 applications for 35 wards for the upcoming MC elections. While the party is yet to announce names of candidates, names of some of the candidates are almost certain. Sources said that Congress chief spokesperson and former deputy mayor Harmohinder Singh Lucky could be the party’s face from ward no 2 (sectors 1 to 10). He has already started meeting people and conducting campaigning on social media. Sitting councillor and former deputy mayor Gurbax Rawat is likely to be Congress candidate from ward no 27 (consisting of sectors 38 West, 39 and 40). Rawat has also started interacting with ward residents. Congress’s leader of opposition Devinder Babla’s wife Harpreet Babla may be the party’s face from ward no 10 (sectors 27, 28 and 29). Babla is also holding meetings with RWAs and residents. Former deputy mayor Vijay Rana is frontrunner for the Congress ticket from ward no 33 (Burail village). He and his mother Kashmiri Devi represented this ward in the past too. Box: BJP, AAP start process Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood said, “The party has already started the process of identifying suitable candidates for municipal wards. Mandal level and district level process in this regard has been completed and scrutiny is going on. Finally, the election committee of the party will take a decision and an announcement will be made after that.” Election in-charge, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Chandermukhi Sharma, said, “The process of identifying suitable candidates started around a month back back and soon, the names will be declared. The party has also conducted an independent survey to find winnable candidates and selection will be done accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-polls-cong-candidate-list-likely-on-nov-27/articleshow/87856325.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This figure is over 33% more than the total number of doses administered in Maharashtra, the next contender state. In terms of people, 10.62 crore individuals are partially vaccinated in the state, while 4.37 crore have taken both the doses. Considering that the total number of eligible persons in UP is 15.04 crore, this translates to over 29% of the population being fully vaccinated and 71% just taking one vaccine dose. Lauding the achievement, senior health officials directed the staff to sustain the pace till all eligible persons are vaccinated and appealed to people to come and take their due vaccine in individual and social interest. Meanwhile, as many as 12 new Covid-19 cases were reported across the state in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 17.10 lakh on Monday. The cases were reported from eight districts. The official bulletin said eight persons had recovered from coronavirus infection taking the total of recovered to 16.87 lakh, translating into a recovery rate of over 98%. Following recalculation by adjusting new cases and recoveries, there are 104 active cases across 34 districts in the state.

---||Agra||People should take to streets to be heard by the PM, says Rajbhar||Agra: Former BJP ally in UP and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar has said that if any section of society wants to be heard by the Centre, then they should take to the streets because Prime Minister Narendra Modi can only be persuaded by protests. “The withdrawal of the farm laws has proved it that this government only listens to protesters,” said Rajbhar, who was in Aligarh to attend a private function organised to celebrate SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav’s birthday on Monday. “There are several pressing issues such as inflation and waiver of electricity bills and to get them resolved people should start a movement to get their demands met. Because, it’s ironic that even as BJP leaders insulted the protesting farmers by calling them anti-nationals and khalistanis, the PM apologised to them and decided to repeal the contentious farm laws,” said Rajbhar, who later addressed a Dalit mahapanchayat organised by the Banjara community in Khair area. Targeting BJP leaders, Rajbhar said the BJP government came to power by making false promises. “Nagpur is the centre where BJP leaders get training to lie to get votes. In Gorakhpur, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that he had given employment to 40 lakh people, while in Ambedkar Nagar, he said 25 lakh youths had been employed, and now he is saying that 4 lakh youths have been given jobs. Which one is correct,” he sought to know, adding that BJP leaders are expert liars. Rajbhar, who recently allied with the Samajwadi Party to defeat the BJP, said the ruling dispensation is against everyone who speaks truth whether journalists or officials. “An FIR has been lodged against a journalist in Mirzapur for highlighting drawbacks in the mid-day meal scheme. Instead of improving the situation, the government has targeted journalists. They are snatching freedom of everyone,” he said. “If our government is formed in the state, we will ensure a peaceful atmosphere, waive off domestic electricity bills, conduct caste census, provide free treatment to poor people, free education till graduation and form a journalists’ commission,” promised Rajbhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/people-should-take-to-streets-to-be-heard-by-the-pm-says-rajbhar/articleshow/87856333.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Goa||Formiga is a great role model for women’s football, we need to thank her: Thomas Dennerby||Panaji: India will be up against several legends when they take on the might of hosts Brazil in a four-nation international tournament on Friday. Brazil’s six-times Ballon d’Or winner Marta is part of the strong home squad, and so are the likes of Tamires, Adriana and Duda. But most of the attention in the opener will be on Miraildes Maciel Mota, popularly known as Formiga. After competing in a record seven World Cups and seven Olympics, the 43-year-old midfielder is set to play her farewell match for Brazil against India. “Formiga is a great player,” said India coach Thomas Dennerby. “She is one of the best central midfielders for the last 15 years.” Before India take the field for the much-anticipated clash against Brazil, the players will strain their necks for a glimpse of the giant of women’s football. Nicknamed Formiga (Portuguese for ant), she has donned colours for clubs in Brazil, US, Sweden and France. “When we get to the ground, we need to thank her for all that she has done for women’s football,” said the coach, who in 2011 led Sweden to a third-place finish at the Women’s World Cup. “She is a really good role model that tells players they do not have to quit playing when you are 30, 31, 32; it’s all about your performance. Keep on playing as long as you can.” Formiga made her World Cup debut in 1995 and is the only footballer to play in seven World Cups, ahead of Japan forward Homare Sawa, who featured in six. India are preparing for the Asian Cup 2022 at home and will play three games in Brazil. Besides the hosts, Chile and Venezuela are the other participating teams.

---||Pune||Meagre cash, expired visas, uncertain return — Afghan students rue fate||PUNE: On Monday, the United Nations (UN) pushed for immediate action to salvage Afghanistan’s distressed banking system, which has gone into freefall after most foreign development support was withdrawn following the Taliban’s takeover. Closer home, in India, the crisis is having a very human impact. Many Afghan students studying in the country are virtually cut off, not having received any money from their families for weeks and even months, forcing them to subsist on meagre savings or charity of friends. The visas of many have expired, and several have applied to the UN for refugee status. So dire is the situation that many are even forced to stay home and self-medicate for dangerous ailments like dengue. Some even live in fear for their lives, such as Adeeba. A student here, Adeeba has not been home in three years; she was looking forward to returning home after her course, but that plan is now untenable. “The Taliban doesn’t know I am studying outside. They will kill me — or worse — if I go back. My sister is confined to home,” Adeeba told TOI. “The Taliban is asking for very high taxes, which is making my family’s life back home even more difficult. I have not received any money from my parents for three months. The university has been very understanding and has not forced us to pay or leave.” Adeeba said if she uses her money just to buy groceries and nothing else, she would be able to survive for a month-and-a-half. “But what will happen after that?” she wondered. In Afghanistan, those in government or semi-government jobs have not been paid for months. Worse, they are unable to retrieve money deposited in their accounts as banks are rationing the deposits, per week or per month per person. Masooda says it has been four months since her father has been paid his salary. She says the bank allows the withdrawal of a fixed amount per week, which is enough for their own survival. “I don’t know what I will do after I finish my course here. I can’t even think of going back. One of my cousins was killed by the Taliban a few years ago. Imagine what they will do to a woman who left the country, alone, to study,” Masooda says. The situation is worse for Zaheeda, who came to India as a tourist before the Taliban took over and has since applied for refugee status with the UN. “I had come with the aim to check out colleges and then go back home and apply for a student visa. But now I am homeless. I have no visa to stay here, nor can I go back to Afghanistan. I cannot even apply to any college or university here because I do not have the relevant visa. Back home, girls are now allowed to study only till class VI,” said Zaheeda. Even in this situation, some Afghan students say they are fleeced by travel agents or face harassment from their house owners. Razia completed her master’s here and booked flight tickets to go home in August, when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan. “All flights were cancelled, but I never got my money back from the travel agency. My savings are nearly exhausted. My parents try to reassure me during weekly calls, but I know they are not okay. Even back in school, teachers would tell me I was too liberal for my own good. Now my father fears for my life. He keeps telling me not to come back. But without a valid visa, how will I get a job, and without a job or money, how can I live in an expensive city?” asks Razia. Nawaz says banks in his hometown have been closed for two months. “My course got over, and I was planning to apply for higher studies when the situation changed. I came down with dengue 15 days ago and my platelet count dropped drastically, but I could not get admitted to hospital. I am hardly able to make ends meet, how can I spend money on treatment? Plus, my visa has expired. On top of that, I had applied for higher studies in a city university and paid Rs16,000 admission fee, but was unable to join. The university didn’t refund that money.” (Names changed to protect identities)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/meagre-cash-expired-visas-uncertain-return-afghan-students-rue-fate/articleshow/87857073.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kochi||MDMA seizure: SIT seeks custody of accused||KOCHI: The special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the seizure of over 160g of MDMA at Kariyad near Nedumbassery on Saturday morning has filed an application before the court on Monday seeking custody of the accused. According to sources, the investigation team has received information suggesting that the seized contraband was smuggled in from abroad. A probe has been launched to find the exact source and destination of the contraband. On Saturday morning, the Ernakulam Rural police intercepted a car at Kariyad, seized 168g of MDMA and arrested four youths. The contraband, worth lakhs in the black market, was found stashed in a hidden compartment made under the steering wheel of the car. The accused Safeer Moideen, 24, of Perumbavoor; Hashim, 23, of Aluva; Jaseel P Jaleel, 24, of Vengola and Asif, 23, of Uliyannoor were later remanded in judicial custody. “A petition seeking custody of the accused was filed on Monday. We will conduct a thorough interrogation after receiving them in custody. We suspect that the contraband had come from abroad. As part of the investigation into this lead, we will check the telephone records and bank records of the accused. We expect to get more details about the source and destination of the contraband after questioning them in custody,” police said. A special squad of district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick had made the seizure on Saturday. The team had included officers from Nedumbassery police, the narcotic cell, and the district anti-narcotics special action force (Dansaf). As per initial investigations, the contraband was being smuggled in from Bengaluru. The car and a weighing scale kept inside the vehicle were seized. Police suspect that the gang had smuggled drugs in the past as well. The case is being investigated by an SIT which functions under SP Karthick. Aluva DSP P K Sivankutty and Nedumbassery SHO P M Baiju are leading the probe team. This was not the first time that MDMA was seized from the highway. In the first week of June, the Rural police had seized nearly two kilograms of MDMA worth crores from two persons at Karukutty. The accused were smuggling it from Chennai. In that case, the accused had used a specially designed compartment in their pick-up truck to transport the drug into the district. The same police team had earlier foiled an attempt to smuggle large volumes of ganja by seizing 225kg of the contraband from two vehicles at Karukutty on November 8. The team had then arrested three persons, including a couple. The accused were smuggling the contraband from Andhra Pradesh. The accused in that case are also in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mdma-seizure-sit-seeks-custody-of-accused/articleshow/87856332.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||City colleges impose curbs on students, teachers interactions||Coimbatore: The arrest of a teaching faculty member of Government Arts College, Coimbatore, on Friday, for misbehaving with a girl student has stirred a debate among colleges on the necessary measures to be taken to prevent such incidents. Government Arts College has already reacted with barring teachers from speaking to students over phone or messaging them. Besides, teachers should not meet students in staff room or in an isolated place in the college. The college administration also asked students to dress in a ‘decent manner’. While boys are barred from wearing jeans, girls are prohibited from wearing jeans or leggings and a dupatta is made mandatory with a salwar for them. Restrictions were also imposed for students’ movement inside the campus after college hours. Several other colleges in the city have sent similar instructions to their staff and students. Principal of Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Science B L Shiva Kumar said he has instructed teachers to behave in a dignified manner with the students and asked them to avoid speaking to students on topics other than academic matters. B Anirudhan, principal of Nehru Arts and Science College, said students have been given instructions about decent dress code. On the other hand, D brindha, principal of PSG College of Arts and Science, where 14,000 students study, says preventing phone conversation may create a divide between students and teachers. “This may not be healthy in an academic institution when most conversations happen through phone after the pandemic.” However, we have reconstituted internal complaints committee and students are free to approach in case of any harassments, she said. A faculty member from Dr GR Damodaran College of Science said restricting interaction between students and teachers especially in the PhD level may affect the research work. So institutions must be careful while framing such rules, even as the colleges must make students feel safe. Meanwhile, regional joint director of collegiate education has asked all colleges to ensure that internal complaint committees probe complaints received from students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-colleges-impose-curbs-on-students-teachers-interactions/articleshow/87857094.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Kochi||Cusat to study role of neurons in carcinogenesis||Kochi: The Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) will associate with an Indian scientist working at the University of Oxford to study the role of neurons in carcinogenesis. Centre for neuroscience, Cusat, director Baby Chakrapani P S will associate with post-doctoral fellow at University of Oxford Unnikrishnan Sivan in the project that intends to elucidate the role of neurons in carcinogenesis and metastasis. The study will be held using around Rs 1 crore worth fellowship provided by the central department of health research department. The fellowship is given by the department of health research to Indian scientists working outside the country and wanting to return to India. Sivan is one among the three scientists who got the fellowship thisyear. The fellowship is scientist-specific and very selective. The fellows could work in any of the scientific institutions and universities in the country and they would be eligible for receiving regular research grants through the extramural funding schemes of various science and technology agencies of the Government of India.  If the study achieves its purpose it would result in helping billions of cancer patients around the world. Sivan has completed his studies from Karolinska Institute at Stockholm, and University of Oxford. He is an expert in the field of stem cells, tissue engineering and cancer biology. Cusat is known for its research and public health interventions in the field of neuroscience and has successfully completed the project for making Kochi, the first dementia-friendly city in India. The varsity believes that the new association will mark another milestone in its research activities. Chakrapani received PhD degree in the area of neural stem cell research from the centre for neuroscience, University of Freiburg, Germany in 2011 and MSc degree in biotechnology from Cusat in 2004. He has worked as a post-doctoral researcher at Van Andel Institute for Research, Michigan, USA. His research focus includes neuroscience, stem cell research, neurodegeneration and neuroregenerative therapies. “Cancer neuroscience is a relatively new research area where scientists are trying to understand the role of neurons and neuron-derived factors in the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer. We need the expertise and advanced methodologies in the field of neuroscience to make progress. Cusat and I have overlapping research interests in this field. This is the reason behind my selection of the centre for neuroscience, Cusat,” Sivan said. Cusat vice-chancellor K N Madhusoodana said the varsity would provide all necessary support for Sivan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cusat-to-study-role-of-neurons-in-carcinogenesis/articleshow/87856345.cms||---

Of the 2.3 lakh cu m of the legacy waste, the contractor has remediated 1 lakh cu m of the waste, the status report by the corporation stated. Due to the prolonged monsoon, remediation work at the site is expected to resume from the first week of December, director of GWMC Levinson Martins stated. GWMC had taken the initiative to clear the old legacy waste dump at Sonsoddo. The GWMC had to discontinue the remediation work in March 2020 due to the lockdown imposed to restrict the spread of Covid-19. They resumed the work in May 2020 but had to discontinue from June till November 2020 because of the monsoon. They resumed from December 2020 and were discontinued in May 2021. “The remediation works were affected in April and May 2021 due to sudden rise in Covid-19 cases and curfew imposed in the state and due to rains experienced in May 2021 resulting from the effect of cyclone Tauktae. Remediation works were continued even during the difficult period when the lethal second wave of Covid-19 was witnessed in the state during March-May 2021,” Martins stated. Refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is sent to cement plants for co-processing and it depends on the intake capacity of cement plants. During the monsoon, the RDF dump was covered with tarpaulin. “Disposal of RDF has commenced in November 2021 and the contractor has transported about 14,000 cu m of RDF to cement factory from Sosoddo as on November 16, 2021,” Martins said, adding that the total quantity of inert and compost disposed is 4.5 lakh cu m. “Compost and inert are being used for backfilling/landscaping in the land belonging to Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTCL), behind KTC depot at Margao,” he stated. The high-powered coordination committee, in its meeting held on Feb 22, 2021, has decided to explore the possibility of setting up a 50 TPD wet waste treatment facility at Sonsoddo to treat daily waste generated by Margao Municipal Council (MMC) after remediation at Sonsoddo is completed. The existing waste management facility at Sonsoddo is being handled by MMC for fresh waste and MMC is treating the wet waste by windrow composting. Dry waste received in being baled by MMC at various decentralised locations, the corporation stated. The high court called for the next status report for work carried out from December by the next hearing on January 20, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/half-of-sonsoddos-garbage-remediated-waste-corp-to-hc/articleshow/87857116.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Defunct machine may prove dear to corp||Kochi: The weighing machine at the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram has become defunct forcing the workers to measure the waste based on the daily measurement fixed a month ago. The machine became defunct on November 3. Before that it developed snags on several occasions and engineers repaired it. “We cannot take the reading now. We now fix the measurement based on the measurement taken a month ago. We will have to write down increased quantity after some time and it will cause financial loss to the local body,” said an official. The Kochi corporation currently pays the contra ctors 550 for processing a tonne of waste. The local body gets money from other local bodies, including Thrikkakara and Kalamassery. “I have asked the engineer to visit the plant and repair the machine. We are not installing a new machine there since a new compost plan is set to come up at the plant and modern weighing machines will be part of it,” said corporation health standing committee chairman T K Ashraf. Meanwhile, dumping of septage waste still continues at the septage treatment plant at Brahmapuram despite no agency running it. “We have asked the security staff there to close the gate of the plant to prevent illegal dumping of septage. We have also given contract for operation and maintenance of the septage plant to a new contractor for 10 years. The contractor is yet to start the operations,” Ashraf said. While an official said the dumping of septage at the plant is in connivance with the police in the area. The official said police personnel collect money from the operators who illegally transport the septage to the plant. Since the septage in not being treated at the plant, the waste is running to Kadambrayar river, polluting the waterboy. But the pollution control board is not examining the quality of the water in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/defunct-machine-may-prove-dear-to-corp/articleshow/87856340.cms||---

With the temperature dipping, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which runs 206 shelter homes with a capacity of 7,092 people, has prepared a winter action plan. An additional 250 temporary homes would be set up before December 1 to cater to 2,000 more people in high-concentration areas because the number of homeless increases during winter. The government also provides meals thrice a day to them. Out of the 206 shelter homes, 81 are operational in RCC buildings and 111 in porta cabins throughout the year. The winter action plan would remain operative from November 7 to March 15. “During winter, the role of shelter homes becomes critical to save the lives of homeless people from severe cold. The action plan 2021-22 will be implemented to ensure a comfortable shelter to all homeless this season,” said Bipin Rai of DUSIB. In all, 16 teams have been formed to rescue the homeless lying on the roadsides or open spaces from 10pm to 4am every day. “Each rescue team will be equipped with one vehicle, driver and two attendants. After receiving information from the DUSIB control room or other sources, the teams will pick up homeless people from the identified locations and take them to a nearby shelter or hospital,” said Rai. A centralised control room has been made functional at Punarwas Bhavan, IP Estate to monitor and assist the rescue teams. It can receive complaints and information 24x7 through a dedicated helpline, mobile app and other sources. People can call on the toll-free number 14461 to give information about the homeless. People can also give information on DUSIB’s mobile app, “Rain Basera”, or by giving a missed call on 8826400500. “Any person who comes across a homeless person on the roadside can simply click a photograph and send it to the central control room. The homeless person will be located through GPS and teams will be informed to rescue him/her,” said Rai. Senior DUSIB officials would be heading a monitoring system to ensure better inter-departmental coordination to ensure necessary civic amenities to the homeless in the shelter homes. The Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee headed by chairman Ramesh Negi would be checking the progress of shelters by holding meetings at regular intervals with the stakeholders. The shelters will have durries, mattresses, bedsheets, pillows and blankets, lockers for keeping belongings, electricity, drinking water, toilets, bathing facilities, television and hot water. Each shelter will have caretakers working in eight-hour shifts. Shelters for women will have a woman security guard in each shift. The government has also planned awareness campaigns about shelter homes and the facilities available in them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-action-plan-9k-homeless-people-to-have-roof-over-heads/articleshow/87857104.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||MSRTC strike: Transport minister Anil Parab, NCP chief Sharad Pawar hold meeting; may propose salary hike||MUMBAI: The state government is considering a few options, one of which is hiking the salary of the striking state transport employees. The suggestions came up during a meeting of state transport minister Anil Parab with NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday regarding the ongoing MSRTC strike. The meeting, which went on for nearly three hours, was also attended by deputy CM Ajit Pawar.  Officials said the merger of the state transport into the state government would be financially draining, and so the government may propose a salary hike or hike in the allowance of the employees. “There are a few options that were dicussed in the meeting. Pawar had called a meeting to understand the issue and offer solutions. We will be presenting our view to the commitee appointed as per the directions of the high court,” said Parab. He said that a study of the payscales of different transport corporations will be studied, too. The MSRTC issued more termination notices to drivers, conductors and clerical staff on daily wages, with the total number of those receiving notices so far being 2,545 workers. This includes 2,116 drivers and 166 conductors. While close to 3,000 workers have been issued suspension orders, one of the unions now wants to fight a legal battle on their behalf so that they are taken back on duties whenever the strike ends. On Monday afternoon, the MSRTC ran 51 AC Shivneri buses, 85 Shiv Shahi buses and 25 ordinary ST buses with the help of around 7,000 staffers who were back on duties. The overall losses have now crossed Rs 300 crore in the past three weeks as the strike entered 26th day on Monday. Many protesters arrived at Azad Maidan from bus depots in other districts to give support to those already camping for the past few weeks. Union leader Shashank Rao said, “We want our key demand to be fulfilled — merger of the bus corporation with the state government. Will this decision be delayed because the next court hearing is on December 20?” For the past two days, commuters took to social media to say that union leaders can put forth their demands before the government, but drivers and conductors should not stop running buses. A tweet by @Neha74072970 said, “In Maharashtra, many ST staff strike the middle class people, they are unable to reach their workplace, please do something.” A tweet by @guddaa_1994 said, “ST staff we understand your problems but please take a moment and think about the common man who is suffering from this strike.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-transport-min-parab-ncp-chief-pawar-hold-meeting-may-propose-salary-hike/articleshow/87857726.cms||---
---||Patna||Boost your reading habit at Rohtas SP’s library||PATNA: The Rohtas police, in a novel initiative, has set up a library on the SP office premises at Dehri-on-Sone and will soon open another one at Rehal village in the deep forests under Nauhatta block where the Maoists had killed divisional forest officer (DFO) Sanjay Kumar Singh on February 15, 2002. The library at the SP office has been humming with activities during office hours. Girls and boys from remote villages spend their time reading books and holding group discussions during their visit to the SP office for character certificates and other works. “The books on literature, including authored by Rabindranath Tagore and Munshi Premchand, are also available at the library,” SP Ashish Bharti told this newspaper on Monday, adding that senior officers from the district will monitor the functioning of the two libraries set up as part of the ‘community policing’. Talking about the second library, Bharti said: “It will be made operational by the end of this week. It is near a government school in the village. The students preparing for different competitive examinations will benefit from the library, which will provide books free of cost.” The 2011-batch IPS officer said this library was being opened at a village under the Dhansa police station area, considered to be a Maoist hotbed. One of the beneficiaries of the SP office library, Dhananjay Kumar (20) of Kubba village, said, “It is beneficial for the aspirants of competitive examinations as authentic books are available here. We take books for examinations after completing formalities.” Dhananjay, a final year graduation student, also lauded the police initiative to open a similar library at Rehal, which is hardly 1km from the place where the then DFO, Sanjay, had been killed about two decades ago. Guleshar Ansari (17) and Prabhari Oraon, both residents of Kubba, echoed similar views. “We were finding it difficult to go to the cities for preparations due to the poor economic condition of our families. If the facility is provided at the village, the budding talents will prove themselves,” Dhananjay opined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/boost-your-reading-habit-at-rohtas-sps-library/articleshow/87856118.cms||Ramashankar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: DFS experts to examine girl’s diary||AHMEDABAD: As officials of government railway police (GRP) of Gujarat are investigating the death of a girl student aboard the Gujarat Queen train earlier this month, forensic science experts are poring over the contents of her diary to study the handwriting and ascertain if the missing pages can be verified. Sources privy to the developments said that forensic science experts were also roped in to investigate the crime scene and take DNA samples from her body. The current probe focuses on the girl’s version, that she was gang-raped in Vadodara, and that had driven her to end her life. “The experts have been roped in to ascertain the style of writing, finding any stress in the final pages and matching the contents with the page found on a person’s mobile phone. As the diary is important evidence in the case, handwriting experts have also collected some writings samples from the girl’s family,” said a source. While several investigating agencies are involved in the probe, state police are yet to crack the case. The 19-year-old girl’s body was found in a coach of Gujarat Queen on the day of Diwali at Valsad, and a cleaner reported it to police. From the diary in her bag, investigators learned about her gang rape in Vadodara some days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dfs-experts-to-examine-girls-diary/articleshow/87857136.cms||---
---||Patna||People & govt staff to take oath on Nov 26 against liquor: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: The government employees and the people of the state would take a pledge on November 26 against consuming liquor, chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday. Talking to media after visiting the Government Ayurvedic College & Hospital and the Government Tibbi College & Hospital in Patna, Nitish said, “All government employees and the people of the state will take a pledge on November 26 on the occasion of ‘Prohibition Day’ that they will neither consume liquor nor allow its sale in the state.” He added that the prohibition policy is being strictly enforced in the state and the officials have been directed not to spare anyone, including government employees, if found violating the liquor ban. “All law enforcement agencies have been instructed to ensure proper implementation of liquor ban across the state. Strict action will be taken against violators, including government officials,” Nitish said. The opposition RJD has been criticising the state government, alleging that the police were harassing the people by raiding wedding venues and bride’s room without women police in the name of prohibition. Justifying the raids at the weddings, Nitish said the police were acting on the basis of complaints received. “Police received complaints that liquor was being served at some weddings. When police get such inputs, they take action. Those who are not involved should not worry at all,” the CM said. The Patna police has raided more than 60 hotels and wedding halls over the last few days and arrested several people on the charges of consuming and providing liquor. Hitting out at the Nitish government over the raids, RJD leader and former chief minister Rabri Devi said the state police were harassing people on the pretext of prohibition. She tweeted a purported video of one such raid, in which policemen could be seen entering the bride’s room without the presence of any female police personnel. The video triggered a backlash with the opposition parties slamming the police for “insulting and harassing” innocent people. Meanwhile, Nitish said his government has decided to expand the services and facilities at all Ayurvedic and Tibbi colleges across the state in the coming years. “We have prepared a plan for that, but it would be announced at the forthcoming Rashtriya Ayurveda Parv to be held at Rajgir in Nalanda district,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-govt-staff-to-take-oath-on-nov-26-against-liquor-nitish/articleshow/87855855.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Meerut||Automobile breaking market crackdown: Another major player falls in police net, property worth Rs 10cr seized||Meerut: In a fresh development in the ongoing crackdown on Meerut’s infamous Sotiganj automobile breaking market, police have seized property worth Rs 10 crore belonging to Haji Iqbal, considered to be the second biggest player in the illegal trade of stolen cars and dismantling of vehicles. Police had earlier arrested and sent to jail Haji Galla and his four sons, seizing his property worth Rs 8 crore. Galla is the kingpin of the massive illegal trade while Iqbal already has over 10 cases against him. Additional SP, Suraj Rai, said, "Several of these cases of theft and dismantling of four wheelers are registered against Iqbal in Delhi and Noida. Though he had been arrested in July along with his three sons, we learnt about his two properties only a couple of weeks ago after a thorough probe. He has more wealth which we cannot disclose at the moment due to the legal process.” Iqbal and his sons were slapped with Gangster Act in July and he got bail on health grounds and will be out of prison soon. In the ongoing crackdown that began in July, hundreds of engines and parts of stolen vehicles have been recovered. The biggest haul was on October 31 when the police found 117 bike engines in one Mohd Afzal's house in Sotiganj market. They were hidden inside trunks, boxes and even a defunct washing machine, and ranged from 150cc to 500cc. The police later identified a nine-member gang that stole two-wheelers primarily from Delhi-NCR. Notably, Delhi alone accounted for 35,019 auto thefts in 2020, according to the National Crime Records Bureau's latest data, which is the highest in the country. The whopping figure was recorded at a time when the country was under strict lockdown for months. In 2019, it was slightly higher at 46,725.

---||Lucknow||Secular parties jittery after AIMIM raised CAA & NRC issues: Owaisi||A day after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, addressing a public meeting in Barabanki, asked the Centre to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or else his party will take to streets and turn UP into Shaheenbagh, the firebrand leader talks to TOI’s Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui about AIMIM’s plans for UP polls. Q: After keeping mum on the issue for almost two years, AIMIM is again raking the CAA bogie and threatening to turn UP into Shaheenbagh. Why? A: We opposed CAA tooth and nail in the Parliament and outside as it is based on religion and against the right to equality. In fact, I had torn a copy of the Act in the Parliament. Our views have not changed. We will do everything within the democratic framework to air our disapproval in the most emphatic manner. Q: No one was talking about CAA or NRC, what prompted you to take it up ahead of UP polls? A: Instead of UP polls, our party’s statements on CAA and NRC should be seen in light of PM Narendra Modi’s recent announcement that the three farm laws will be repealed. All we have asked for is a similar approach to CAA and NRC that have been opposed equally vociferously across the country. Why should our demand be linked to UP polls? Q: Allegations are that AIMIM is trying to polarise the environment with CAA and NRC issues which in turn will only help BJP? A: Such allegations suit the narrative of those trying hard to label AIMIM as the B team of BJP. We have demolished the B team hypothesis to bits time and again. Now they have come up with this new chapter. The problem with the so-called secular parties seeking support of Muslims is that they are not raising CAA and NRC issues and never staged a dharna or courted arrest like they did for farm laws. Now, they are getting jittery when AIMIM is raising them. Q: You have said that your party is preparing to contest 100 seats in UP assembly polls. Why just 100? A: AIMIM’s UP unit president Shauquat Ali said we should contest 100 Muslim-dominated seats in 2022. This was the view of our state unit since we started preparations for elections and remains unchanged. Our party’s central leadership also approved this. Q: Earlier, AIMIM was part of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) floated by Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has now struck an alliance with Samajwadi Party. What is the status of BSM now? A: Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha was floated by Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar. Now, after his alliance with Samajwadi Party, it is he who can answer your question better. As far as AIMIM is concerned, we were a part of the Morcha when we announced our plan to contest 100 seats. Our preparations are underway to contest 100 seats as planned. Q: After the initial spate of rallies in UP starting in August, AIMIM seems to be going slow with its election campaign? A: Not at all. We have held an average of four rallies every month since August. In all, we held at least 20 public meetings and rallies till now. In fact, we have three more rallies lined up in November last week. Rallies and visits of AIMIM leaders will increase in the days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/secular-parties-jittery-after-aimim-raised-caa-nrc-issues-owaisi/articleshow/87857723.cms||---

Police recorded the arrest of both the mother and her partner after finding out that the child was wilfully abandoned by them. The duo, hailing from Assam, is working at a private establishment at Muvattupuzha. The toddler was found playing alone near a bench in the park on Friday afternoon by a young man. He took him to the Fort Kochi police station. He was speaking Assamese. Later the child was handed over to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). Police said they have booked the mother and her partner under relevant Sections of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. Mary Anitha, chairperson, Centre for Empowerment and Enrichment (CEFEE), Ernakulam, an NGO which works for welfare of differently challenged children, had collected the child and took the child for an RT-PCR test and medical check-up. After the child tested negative, he was taken to a child care home. He was formally handed over to CWC around 2am on Saturday.

Of the six accused, Sivankutty and KT Jaleel are members of the present Assembly. The others are EP Jayarajan, K Ajith, CK Sivadasan, and K Kunhammed. They all were charged under the prevention of damage to public property Act and other provisions. The Assembly had witnessed violent scenes in March 2015, after the then Left opposition tried to prevent the then finance minister KM Mani from presenting the budget, alleging his role in the bar bribery case. A chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court at Thiruvananthapuram had dismissed their plea of discharge last month and had directed for framing charges against them to conduct a trial. It is contended by them that the lower court failed to consider various binding precedents cited by them while seeking a discharge. There was no material available on record to come to the conclusion that they had the intent to protest against the proceedings of the Assembly, they have alleged. Further, they argued that no complaint was filed by any of the MLAs present in the Assembly and the case was filed against them with an ulterior motive on the basis of a letter sent by the secretary of the Assembly. The Speaker, who was the competent authority to take action, had not filed a complaint, the legislators’ plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sivankutty-five-others-move-hc-against-trial/articleshow/87857113.cms||---

Jeshankar Borisagar, 66, a native of Vavdi in Amreli district, had met with an accident last week. He was brought to the hospital in serious condition. While the doctors tried to revive him for two days, he succumbed to the injuries and was declared brain-dead on Sunday. “After consent of his family, the two kidneys were retrieved and transplanted in two patients. During the pandemic, Borisagar, running a grocery shop in his village, would provide food and grocery even during the lockdown. Due to his kind acts, he was very popular with locals. His kindness thus continued even after his death,” said a doctor associated with the procedure, adding that his corneas were donated to the city-based eye bank. It was a hat-trick of transplants in a day for the hospital as a kidney transplant from live donor was also performed on the same day. The doctors said that a woman had donated her kidney to her husband. “The feat of three transplants in a day is achieved by only a few hospitals in Gujarat,” added officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-kidney-transplants-in-a-day-at-kd-hospital/articleshow/87857143.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Soon, Uttar Pradesh to become only state with five international airports||LUCKNOW: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi lays the foundation stone of Noida International Airport (NIA) in Jewar on November 25 (Thursday), UP will spread its wings to have five international airports — the highest in the country. This comes days after the PM inaugurated the Kushinagar international airport to put east UP on a global tourist map. The Yogi Adityanath government also seeks to fast track the Ayodhya international airport even as the state gears up for the assembly elections in the next few months. Earlier, only Lucknow and Varanasi were categorized as international airports in UP. Chief Minister Yogi, who is scheduled to visit the inauguration ceremony site in Ruhi village on Tuesday, will hold a meeting to oversee preparations. Touted as one of the flagship projects in the National Capital Region, the Jewar airport is projected to come up as a big civil aviation hub with four helipads and five runways. Constructed over an area of more than 3,000 acres, the airport will be built and operated by the Switzerland-based Zurich Airport International AG. In the first phase, which is scheduled to be completed by 2024, the airport will have the capacity to handle 12 million passengers per annum. The airport is also projected to ease out air traffic congestion at the IGI international airport in Delhi. Projected as India’s largest airport after its completion, the NIA is located about 72 km from the existing IGI airport in New Delhi, 40 km from Noida and about 40 km from the multi-modal logistics hub at Dadri. It will have multi-modal connectivity as it is close to the existing Yamuna Expressway (Greater Noida to Agra), close to Eastern Peripheral Expressway and it will have link with Delhi-Mumbai Expressway at Ballabhgarh, Khurja-Jewar NH 91, link to dedicated freight corridor, Metro Extension from Noida to NIA and link with the proposed High Speed Rail (Delhi-Varanasi) at airport terminal. A state government spokesperson said that the state has managed to put in place a “world-class connectivity” and infrastructure in a short period of less than five years. “The state had only two international airports since 2012 when Varanasi got the distinction after Lucknow,” he said. At present, UP has eight operational airports, while 13 airports and 7 airstrips are being developed. The operational airports handling commercial flights in UP are Lucknow, Varanasi, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Hindon (Ghaziabad). “This is also in sync government’s commitment to ensure uninterrupted multi-modal connectivity on land, railways, water and air,” he said, asserting that the ambitious Prime Minister’s GatiShakti National Master Plan has infused a sense of urgency into the plans for infrastructure development in the state.

A senior official of the AMC informed the committee that in November alone 12,000 such complaints were filed, which constituted 60% of all the complaints received by the AMC. Almost 35% of the blockages had developed in major drainage lines alongside main roads. Then 12% of the complaints were about catch pits not being cleared of soil. Approximately 11% of the complaints related to breakdowns in drainage lines connecting societies and commercial complexes. “A majority of the drain blockage complaints, almost 1,800, originated from the Walled City followed by the posh west zone areas such as Navrangpura, Paldi, Vasna, and Stadium which cumulatively accounted for 1,100 complaints,” said a senior AMC official of the west zone. “Most of the lines in these areas are more than two decades old and need to be replaced.” Requesting anonymity, a standing committee member said that almost 10% of all complaints concerned malfunctioning street lights. “A majority of the 1,800 streetlight complaints are related to those installed by the AMC. About 5% of the complaints pertained to lights on the main streets,” said the standing committee member. “We will undertake detailed discussions with various departments on citizen grievances and on ways to solve them expeditiously.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drainage-sucks-in-most-of-citizens-complaints/articleshow/87857133.cms||---

A team of Delhi Police on Monday took action against illegal hawkers/encroachers, including beggars, and cleaned up the Hanuman Mandir premises with the help of the fire department. Similar actions have been taken in the past few weeks. “Traders were complaining about increasing nuisance in the commercial areas due to the rising number of beggars and illegal hawkers encroaching upon public spaces. This was also restricting movement of pedestrians. Later, the high court also ordered removal of encroachers from Inner Circle and Outer Circle. We have so far removed 80% of the encroachers,” said CP station house officer (SHO) Upender Singh. “The exercise will continue in the coming days, too, so that the situation doesn’t become the same later. In fact, we are taking help of New Delhi Municipal Council in removal drives and also coordinating with others for shifting beggars,” said the SHO. The efforts of Delhi Police has been appreciated by New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA), which has been demanding for a long time strict action against illegal occupants and even approached the court for relief. “Their increasing number had dissuaded customers from visiting shops as these beggars were unnecessarily troubling them. There were no room to walk in the corridors due to the increasing mess day by day. We welcome the steps taken by the local area SHO and request for continuation of the drive,” said Atul Bhargava, president of NDTA. He added that the civic body was taking minor action after some time, but hawkers were coming back on roads the same evening. “We have never been against the authorised vendors, but this increasing number of illegal hawkers had made things difficult. At night, the entire place was also becoming unsafe,” said Bhargava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-hcs-hawk-eye-drive-in-cp-to-remove-squatters/articleshow/87857141.cms||---

The inspections were reportedly part of a preliminary enquiry by the department into allegations of irregularities in the construction activities at the panchayat. The inspection was held from 11.30am till 6pm. Khalid Mundappally, a social activist, had filed a complaint to the vigilance director alleging illegalities in the functioning of the panchayat. “The vigilance team had recorded my statement twice. I had also handed over details collected through RTI with the department. The agency is yet to register a case formally. But they are conducting preliminary enquiries,” said Mundappally. Meanwhile, Kizhakkambalam panchayat president Mini Ratheesh said that the inspections were held without serving any formal notice and that she was confident that there was no irregularities whatsoever in the dealings of the panchayat. “They came to the office around 11.30am and sought files from the officials.

On Monday, the government appointed a deputy collector in charge of the SilverLine project for Ernakulam district. Present deputy collector (land reforms, Kannur) Anil Jose has been transferred and posted as deputy collector (SilverLine) Ernakulam. Earlier, the government had appointed former CEO of Life Mission UV Jose as the special officer for land acquisition (SilverLine project). The order which assigned him this responsibility was issued last month. After his retirement, Jose was reemployed by the government as a deputy project director at state project management unit of Kerala Solid Waste Management Project, which is one of the major projects that is being actively pursued by the chief minister. The SilverLine project is also one of the priority projects of the state government. The opposition (UDF) has been raising a stiff protest against the project in assembly, with opposition leader VD Satheesan stating that the project for which embankments of 15-30m width and 4-10m height have to be constructed, will divide the state into two that is already reeling under a series of natural disasters and also change the land use pattern for 500m on either side of the project line. BJP state president K Surendran claimed that the project is paving the ground for major corruption. At the same time, the state has given assurance to the Centre that it will bear the liability in case the project fails in future, without any financial responsibility being fixed on the ministry of railways, which is a joint-venture partner in the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-appoints-officer-for-silverline-project-work/articleshow/87857161.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The discovery was made during the process of revision of such cards, which is going on across the state. After the incident, which happened at polling booth 264 of Deewan Public School in the cantonment area, a member of the minority commission made a complaint to the district magistrate (DM) K Balaji . "During the assessment of new additions in the voter list, we found that 10 IDs were made in the name of Dilkash," said Suresh Jain, a member of the Uttar Pradesh minorities commission. The DM has ordered an inquiry into the matter. He has also asked the additional district magistrate to look into the case. According to the voter list, the name and other credentials of Dilkash, such as his father's name and age, is the same in each voter ID, except the address, which is different. Meanwhile, the district got over 10,000 applications for new voter ID cards on Sunday. The city got over 20,000 new voter registrations in Meerut between November 1 and 20. Among the new applicants, around 2,000 are between 18 and 19 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ten-voter-ids-with-same-name-credentials-crop-up-in-meerut/articleshow/87856381.cms||Ishita Mishra

Spread across 130 acres, the tank was bone dry all these years as the feeder channels were not desilted. Recently, a few organisations carried out the desilting work of the 12km-long feeder channels through crowdfunding. The source of water for the Kalingarayan tank is a stream originating from Keeranatham. The water reaches the tank through streams after three major tanks in Ottankottai, Nallusamyappan Kuttai, and Karaikuttai in Keeranatham are filled. Since the feeder channels were not desilted for many years, the tank did not receive water, said P Yatheesh, coordinator of Keeranatham Waterbodies Welfare Association. Earlier, the district rural development agency had desilted the Karaikuttai and Nallusamyappan Kuttai tanks after an IT company had donated funds. Kalingarayan tank was one of the major boosts to recharge groundwater in the entire panchayat union. For the last few years, the residents claimed that the quality of groundwater was deteriorating as the tank was dry. Yatheesh added that with water in the tank the groundwater quality is expected to improve. People celebrated the inflow of water into the tank by riding coracles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kalingarayan-tank-receives-water-after-17-years/articleshow/87857163.cms||---

The deceased belonged to Khajekalan in Patna City. Another prisoner, identified as Mohammad Munna from Belaganj in Gaya district, also suffered injuries in the incident. The incident is stated to be a fallout of an altercation over fetching water from a handpump near the toilet of ward number 2 late on Saturday. The matter was, however, settled after the intervention of warders of the prison on Sunday. But Munna, who is facing murder charges, attacked Tuntun with a scissor at around 9am on Monday when he was returning to his ward after purchasing ‘litti-chokha’ from the kiosk inside the jail. The injured Tuntun was rushed to the PMCH where he was declared dead. Munna, who received injuries in the melee, is being treated at the jail hospital. Senior officials of the prison department visited the jail and inquired about the incident. The station house officer of Airport police station, Arun Kumar, said the bloodstained scissors used in the crime had been seized and would be sent to the forensic laboratory. The deceased had received injuries in his abdomen and neck, leading to his death. The accused was overpowered by the fellow prisoners, who informed the jailor, Lal Babu, about the incident. Tuntun’s relatives, who reached the PMCH, blamed the jail administration for his murder. His father Topan Rai expressed surprise over the recovery of scissors in the jail. “Had the jail authorities strictly followed the prison manual, my son would have been alive,” he told reporters outside the PMCH. Tuntun’s brother Lalan Kumar said the deceased is survived by his wife and a one and a half year old son, Ankush. His wife is stated to be pregnant. When contacted, jailor Lal Babu said the scissors were used in making masks by the prisoners in the jail. “The case is being probed by the officials,” he added. Referring to the incident, the jailor said Munna and Tuntun had clashed on Saturday. “This is perhaps the main reason behind the Monday incident,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prisoner-stabbed-to-death-in-phulwarisharif-jail/articleshow/87855875.cms||Ramashankar

The work, however, will remain suspended for three days, during which the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) will be held at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar on January 10-12. SVPI airport authorities have received clearance in this respect from the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “The runway resurfacing is very much on track and will begin as scheduled from January 3, 2022 and conclude on May 31, 2022. During the three days of the VGGS 2022, when air traffic movement is expected to increase at the city airport, the resurfacing work will be suspended and resumed from January 13 onwards,” said a well-placed source privy to the development. An email query sent to Adani Airports for an official comment on the issue went unanswered. Business delegates from different parts of the country and world in addition to several world leaders tend to attend the VGGS 2022 – the bi-annual investment summit hosted by the government of Gujarat. During this period, the city airport sees movement of several private aircraft and charters too in addition to scheduled commercial operations. The work will focus on runway overlaying, runway strip grading and slope assessment, Runway End Safety Area (RESA) grading and slope assessment, along with storm water drain construction and reinstallation of signages on manoeuvring area. When runway resurfacing begins at the city airport, the airport runway will be closed for flights from 9am to 6pm, which means flights will operate either before 9am or after 6pm. About 190 flights operate from SVPI airport every day, of which 45 each are in the mornings and evenings. The remaining 100 flights are spread through the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/runway-resurfacing-to-start-on-schedule/articleshow/87857186.cms||---

PMC chairperson Shantaram Kolvenkar said the special meeting was convened to seek views of members over norms of house repair licences and further, to convey these views to the directorate of municipal administration. Kolvenkar said they have found that many households avail of licences for house repairs and then construct new structures by flouting the conditions. Some others reconstruct the entire structure, which is not allowed under the licence. “To avoid such attempts, council engineers will visit the houses and inspect the status of the house twice - once when permission is sought for repairs and again, after completion of work,” he said. The council is also mulling new resources of revenue generation, including mandating permissions for piped natural gas and cable TV connections. Kolvenkar said the fees for the council’s permission would be negligible, but it would help keep a tab on use of such connections and help the council coffers by generating at least a small amount. “The fees, however, would be charged to service providers and not to households,” the PMC chairperson said. The meeting was attended by eleven councilors of the 15-member-body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ponda-council-mulls-strict-rules-for-house-repairs/articleshow/87857207.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

A notice was issued by the hospital resident doctors association on Monday, stating that a pen-down strike between 9am and 12pm will start on Tuesday. They will even withdraw from emergency duties from Friday, the association wrote to the medical superintendent. “The civic body assured us the salaries would be paid regularly, but they have gone back on their word,” association president Dr Sunil Prasad said. “Even the dearness allowance, which was scheduled to increase from July, is yet to come.” Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain claimed the corporation had released one month’s salary of junior doctors and would pay seniors soon. “Only one month’s salary will be pending. Considering our financial crisis, it’s not possible to clear all dues at one go,” he said. Despite a recent meeting with civic officials, the resident doctors of the Hindu Rao hospital has decided to continue their strike.

The officials at the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) calling it a cable fault due to the rains, the power problem resulted in many households having no water supply thereby increasing people’s hassles. “The power suddenly went off at 11:45pm. I had an important project to finish on Sunday and I could not finish it,” Ashima Parashar, who lives in a housing society located in the Salunke Vihar Road, told TOI. “There has been a breakdown in the area and our people are working towards mending it. In some localities in Kondhwa, the power has been restored and the work towards restoring it across the whole area is on,” Madhukar Ghume, the executive engineer of the Rasta Peth division of the MSEDCL, told TOI. “The power went off around midnight and it still hasn’t been restored. The power came for around 20 minutes at 2:30pm but it got disconnected again,” Amar Khandwe, a resident of Parge Nagar, said. Another MSEDCL official said the cause of the breakdown could be rains. “This will be ascertained. The workers are trying hard to restore power,” the official said. Sudha Kere, a homemaker who lives in the NIBM Road, was concerned about her refrigerator. “There is no power since long and water has started to seep through the refrigerator. We have portable emergency lights but they stopped working due to dead batteries,” she said. Jatin Kalaskar, who lives in Undri, said he had to go to a friend’s place in Lullanagar to charge his mobile phones. “I had a meeting with my clients but the phone’s battery died. I called up a friend who lives in Lullanagar using a local grocer’s phone and went to his house to get my phones charged,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/power-outage-leaves-residents-of-kondhwa-undri-hassled/articleshow/87836869.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Trial for non-Covid OPD starts at Dwarka govt hosp||New Delhi: Outpatient department (OPD) services have started on a trial basis at Delhi government’s Indira Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, which was partially opened for treatment of Covid-19 patients earlier this year. Sources said that full-fledged OPD services would begin from December 1, 2021 at the 1,241-bedded hospital. OPD services of six departments are expected to begin from next month, according to sources. These departments are medicine, ophthalmology, dermatology, paediatrics, surgery and ENT. The trial run would ensure that teething troubles are taken care of before full-fledged operations begin. According to sources, only OPD services would be initially available at the hospital and facilities would expand after more doctors and paramedical staff are deployed. The hospital has been in the pipeline for more than two decades as the land for its construction was allotted in 1997 and Rs 350 crore was allocated for the project in 2007. The construction work, however, could only start in 2014 and the hospital was partially opened earlier this year. While the super specialty hospital was planned as a 750-bedded hospital initially, the Aam Aadmi Party government decided to increase its capacity to a 1,241-bedded one, which also resulted in more time being taken to open the hospital for the public. Dwarka residents have been running an online campaign to make the hospital project operational. The hospital will not only cater to residents of the sub-city, which doesn’t have any government hospital, but also many areas of southwest Delhi. Delhi High Court had earlier reprimanded the government for delay in making the hospital operational and on November 9, 2021, it said that the government must endeavour to make the super specialty facilities functional at the hospital by March next year, instead of July. The high court also asked the Delhi LG to take a decision at the earliest on the issue of giving approval for additional staff for setting up a dedicated Covid-19 facility at the hospital. While the physical infrastructure at the hospital has been ready, finding adequate healthcare professionals and other manpower to manage a superspecialty hospital has posed some challenges. In a circular issued late last year, the health department had stated that it intends to post willing staff in three new Delhi government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trial-for-non-covid-opd-starts-at-dwarka-govt-hosp/articleshow/87857164.cms||Sidharatha Roy

At the same time, the residents are seeking a more permanent solution. “Multiple minor accidents take place on the Cloud 9 slope on a daily basis, due to the presence of so much rubble and gravel, making it difficult not just for two- and four-wheelers, but also pedestrians to navigate the patch. Vehicle drivers skid, while walkers often slip and fall. Riders and drivers unfamiliar with the area frequently lose control of their vehicles,” said Yash Parwal, a nearby resident.  Local corporator Nanda Lonkar argued that permission from the forest department is awaited for full-fledged repairs of the road and slope since August. “The plan is to widen the current road, which is currently 10 metres wide, to 24m. Furthermore, the gradient will be reduced by 3m.” VG Kulkarni, head of the PMC road department, said, “By next week, we will get some clarity about when permissions are expected to be approved.” Deputy conservator of forest Rahul Patil said, “The file is currently at the Nagpur office, waiting for a further nod.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/call-for-long-term-solution-to-risky-nibm-road/articleshow/87836877.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Vadodara||Soon, reduce extra flab without worrying about any side-effect||VADODARA: Popping pills to cut that extra flab can also take a toll on the mental and physical health of obese patients desperate to lose weight. But a breakthrough is in sight with MS University researchers developing a new class of anti-obesity agents that will pave the way for drugs that can control food cravings without any side-effect. The result is an outcome of 10 years of rigorous study when researchers from the Faculty of Pharmacy picked up the gauntlet of finding safe compounds that can be used for making drugs to treat obesity without any side-effect. Scientists say that practically there is not a single drug currently available in the market that can be called as an ideal or safe anti-obesity drug. The researchers have bagged a patient for their invention while their work has been acknowledged by the globally reputable journal Scientific Reports. Using virtual screening techniques, the team tirelessly worked on more than four lakh compounds to identify and design novel molecules as anti-obesity agents with no side-effects. The team led by by faculty’s founder dean professor M R Yadav, assistant professor Dr Prashant Murumkar and research scholar Dr Mayank Sharma found a compound that acts on cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) as CB1R which is responsible for regulating appetite, pain, emotions among others. These are present in the peripheral tissues as well as the central nervous system. When these receptors are activated, they increase the urge for eating. If these receptors are blocked or inhibited, the craving for the food decreases. “But blocking of central CB1 receptors has many consequences including serious psychiatric side-effects. The main challenge for us was to invent a tight CB1 receptor which would not have any such side-effects,” explained Murumkar. “Restricting the entry of the drug in CNS was one of the strategies that we worked upon to get rid of the CNS side effects,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/soon-reduce-extra-flab-without-worrying-about-any-side-effect/articleshow/87856408.cms||Prashant Rupera

A private school in Vaishali Nagar has reportedly suspended offline classes for four days for Class XI as a student tested positive for the Covid-19 virus. The student was tested positive on Sunday. Narottam Sharma, chief medical and health officer (CMHO) in Jaipur said that 11 cases were reported in the city. “The relief is that none of the positive patients are minors or in the age group of school-going children,” said Sharma. The gradual rise in cases has increased the worry of parents who have become reluctant in sending their children for offline classes. The local administration has decided to increase random testing in schools to detect cases timely. The schools are also on alert mode and are keeping a track of students who are complaining of any of the symptoms related to Covid. The classes, especially the primary sections are receiving very poor response from the parents for offline classes. Parents are stating that until the cases turn zero, they are not comfortable in sending their children to schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parents-in-a-fix-as-covid-cases-continue-in-schools/articleshow/87857162.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maoism to Gandhism: Former top Maoist cadre turns rural entrepreneur||Nagpur: Radha Majji, former Divisional Committee Member (DVC) of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), once considered a top cadre among the armed rebels of Gadchiroli, is now taking baby steps into the realm of entrepreneurship. She is a member of a self-help group (SHG) comprising of surrendered Naxalites like her. The group has just launched it’s first product, a floor cleaner, with the brand name ‘Clean 101’. A three-day training session at Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Rural Industrialization (Mgiri) at Wardha in August this year, along with a visit to Sewagram ashram, especially Bapi Kuti, brought about a life-changing transformation in her. The Gadchiroli police helped her by forming a group of 10 former women Maoists and two men. SP Ankit Goyal said the former Maoists were sent to Mgiri in Wardha, where they were trained in manufacturing phenyl and floor cleaner. The visit to Sewagram ashram also helped them to get introduced to the highest ideals of peace and brotherhood. “We will initially help the self-help group grow their business and try ensure they become self-sufficient in due course of time with our support,” said Goyal, adding rehabilitation would serve the real purpose of bringing back the former rebels into the mainstream of the society. “Apart from training them at a reputed institute, it also gave a wonderful opportunity for us to introduce them to the Sewagram ashram, where they could walk into an universe of peace unlikely the ideology of violence into which they were earlier misguided,” said the SP. Radha, who had several offences against her in the past, was a wife of another DVC member in the Maoist outfit. She, along with her husband, had surrendered before the Gadchiroli police in 2019. Radha said she is now confident of taking her skills ahead and making a living herself. “We are positive about doing well in the current endeavour,” said Radha in Madia language, which was interpreted for TOI by a police personnel. She also admitted that getting introduced to Gandhi’s teaching of peace and harmony for the first time in her life, through picture frames and other artefacts of Bapuji at the ashram, had a big influence on her. Apart from Radha, another former Maoist cadre Saguna Pendam too was part of the skill development training programme and is now a member of the group which aims to manufacture and market the floor cleaner they have just launched with the help of Goyal. “We are hopeful of taking the mission ahead,” she said, adding the ambience at Sewagram ashram had left her enchanted and she is now eager to follow the message of peace. Saguna was member of Gatta dalam and had four offences against her. She had surrendered in 2014. Gadchiroli police said the SHG had initially received some support from organizations like Dr Panjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth at Akola, which has placed an order for 200 units. “We are approaching government and non-government organizations to place orders for floor cleaners from the SHG to encourage the former Maoists settle into the mainstream of society,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maoism-to-gandhism-former-top-maoist-cadre-turns-rural-entrepreneur/articleshow/87857088.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Meerut||Noida-based firm providing helicopter services booked for cheating||BIJNOR: Days after two BJP workers staked claim on a rented chopper, an FIR has been registered against a Noida-based firm for cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust. The FIR has been filed by district panchayat board president Sakender Chaudhary against the aviation company, alleging that he had hired the chopper for “pushvarsha”, which had to be cancelled as the chopper was supposed to land in Police Line around 11am on Friday but came around 3pm. Besides, the company had rented the same chopper to another person illegally. As per the FIR copy accessible to TOI, the owner of the firm (name unidentified) and two other unidentified persons who were sitting in the chopper have been booked under IPC sections 420, 405, 500 and 120b. Interestingly, in the video that went viral on social media, the faces of the people booked can be seen clearly. One of them was Prince Chaudhary, said to be an aspirant for BJP ticket in upcoming assembly polls, who alleged on November 19 that he was stopped from showering flowers on devotees. The incident embarrassed BJP leaders and stirred a political storm in Bijnor district, as a result of which Prince’s name was not included in the FIR, which mentioned him as an unidentified person. On his part, Prince Chaudhary claimed to have the legal documents to show that he had booked the chopper. He claimed, "I had booked the chopper from Dehradun and it was to fly over Vidurkuti, where I would shower flowers on the devotees. There was no plan to land in Bijnor. But the pilot landed it at Bijnor Police Line on the orders of the administration. Then, we were not allowed to take off.” Notably, “pushpvarsha” (showering of petals) programme had not taken place on Friday, the last day of the Ganga snan, at Vidurkuti in Bijnor after the administration cancelled it following a spat over the helicopter by two BJP members. Sources said that both Prince Chaudhary and Sakender Chaudhary claimed they had booked the chopper. When the chopper landed at the Police Line, but was not allowed to take off, both contenders lodged a complaint against the Noida-based company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/noida-based-firm-providing-helicopter-services-booked-for-cheating/articleshow/87856403.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Kolhapur||Farmers fume as 5% weight cut from machine-harvested cane||Kolhapur: Farmers from Kolhapur and Sangli districts are upset over the mills deducting 5% from the gross weight of sugar cane cut using machine harvester. The sugar mills claim this accounts for the weight of the dry leaves that are of no use in sugar production. In case of manual harvesting, the dry leaves are removed before the sugar cane is transported for crushing. The farmers, however, say that deducting 5% from the weight will lead to losses as payments are made based on the sugar cane weighed by the mills. Shivaji Mane, the president of Jay Shivray, Jay Kisan farmers’ outfit, said, “We have requested the district authorities to intervene. The weight of the dry leaves is not more than 1% of the total weight of the sugar cane. The mills are cheating the farmers. Harvesting by machine costs less than manual cutting. Also, the work gets finished fast.” Being asked about the petitions by the farmers’ outfit, the office of sugar commissioner has clarified that since the committee appointed by the state government to estimate the weight of dry leaves is studying the issue, no order asking the mills not to deduct the weight can be passed. In a letter written by the sugar commissioner’s office to the regional directors, it is clear that the 5% deduction will continue. A study group was formed in February this year and the members of the group are visiting the fields and mills to estimate the weight of the dry leaves. Farmers’ leaders claim that farmers from the Kolhapur district have lost around Rs 80 crore due to the deduction of 5% weight. The sugar mills are using machine harvesters in greater numbers these days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/farmers-fume-as-5-weight-cut-from-machine-harvested-cane/articleshow/87854850.cms||---

According to Rajasthan Sanskrit University Act 1998, there are 13 members in the executive council including the vice-chancellor and registrar. For any meeting to be conducted, at least one-third members are required to be present. To maintain a quorum in JRRSU, at least five members are required. But in the last 67th syndicate meeting held on October 5, only four members were allegedly present and decisions were taken. Sources alleged that the names of two members mentioned in the minutes of the meeting and uploaded on the university website were not present at all. This prompted the governor to write to the university seeking an answer to the violations. Now, without sorting out this issue, the university called another syndicate meeting on November 25 to discuss matters related to the convocation ceremony in January. As per rules, the university has to confirm the decision taken in the last syndicate meeting as well in the next meeting. Registrar Ranjeeta Gautam said whatever happened was before her appointment and so she had no idea about the executive council meeting. Vice-chancellor Anula Maurya didn’t answer the phone call. Nominee of the governor in the executive council Professor Laxmi Sharma said, “Vice-chancellor Anula Maurya is not following the rules. This is completely against the norms. Even when we go for meetings in the university, whatever is written in front of us in the minutes is changed and sent to the governor later. This is sheer misuse of power in the university.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/varsity-flouts-rules-calls-another-executive-council-meeting/articleshow/87857173.cms||---

The case pertains to allegations that Shaji received a bribe of Rs 25 lakh from an aided school management in his constituency in 2014 to sanction Plus Two batch for the school. Majeed was quizzed by vigilance officials led by Kannur vigilance deputy superintendent of police Babu Peringeth at the Police Club in Kozhikode. The questioning lasted for around one and a half hours. The case is based on a complaint by Naushad Poothapara, a local leader of IUML, to the party state committee. Later, a CPM leader filed a complaint with the chief minister in 2017 following which the vigilance registered a case and started the probe. IUML had taken action against Poothapara for levelling the allegation. It is learnt that the vigilance had quizzed Majeed in this regard. Vigilance had interrogated Shaji for several hours in connection with the case and had also recorded statements of the school management, district-level office-bearers of IUML in Kannur.

---||Ahmedabad||Industrial effluent: 33 illegal drainage lines disconnected in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Following a rap from the high court over the illegal discharge of untreated toxic industrial effluent into the Sabarmati river, the civic body has jumped into action. On Monday, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) claimed that it had disconnected 33 drainage lines that pumped untreated waste into domestic sewage lines of the city. Ideally, industrial units have to drain their waste to an effluent channel that takes it to a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) after which the treated effluent is pumped into the AMC’s domestic sewage treatment plant (STP). AMC officials conducted surveillance in the Naroda, Narol, Odhav and Vatva industrial clusters and neighbouring estates. The 33 lines that were disconnected were in Shahpur, Odhav, Behrampura, Gomtipur, Sardarnagar, India Colony, Naroda, Lambha, Isanpur and Danilimda areas. The action comes after the HC admitted a PIL in October on the continuing pollution of the Sabarmati river. Almost a month ago, the AMC admitted before the HC that “ill-treated or untreated or partly treated” industrial waste from “improperly working” effluent treatment plants (ETPs) was being “discharged into the Sabarmati directly”. It added in an affidavit that “completely untreated industrial discharge” is also being “illegally discharged into the sewerage network” designed for household sewage. The AMC admission comes at a time when one of the members of the HC-appointed task force, environmentalist Rohit Prajapati, told the court that the Sabarmati for the 120km downstream up to the Arabian Sea is a “dead river”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industrial-effluent-33-illegal-drainage-lines-disconnected/articleshow/87857185.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: DMRC’s first India-made simulator to train drivers||NEW DELHI: In a big step towards indigenising technologies involved in Metro operations in the country, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Monday launched the first prototype of a Made in India simulator for training its drivers in association with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). DMRC and BEL signed a memorandum of understanding in September last year to develop a rolling stock driver training system (RSDTS), which will be useful for training drivers of Metro and railway trains. Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary of housing and urban affairs ministry and chairman of DMRC, launched RSDTS and also watched the demonstration of a supervisory control and data acquisition in the presence of DMRC managing director Mangu Singh and other senior officials of Delhi Metro and BEL. RSDTS “will also be used for evaluating the driving skills of a working train operator, which is done periodically for safety considerations. This will be the first indigenously developed universal train driving simulator that can be suitably modified for any Metro system or railways,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director of corporate communications, DMRC. Dayal said this product was being imported by DMRC from foreign equipment manufacturers at a high cost. “Also, the designs available with DMRC are suitable for use with a single type of rolling stock and signalling and line profiles. It is difficult and cost-prohibitive to make any changes at a later date,” he said. He said the indigenously developed RSDTS had the facility of the same core software to be utilised for creating different combinations of rolling stock, signalling and line profiles by merely changing the input data files, along with minor hardware changes in the driving desk, if needed. “This will enhance the flexibility of the training system and result in major cost saving for DMRC as the same system can be used for multiple stocks and different routes.” Dayal said the training system would have superior features and would be scalable to meet future requirements. Easy availability of driving simulators will help create a large pool of skilled manpower, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrcs-first-india-made-simulator-to-train-drivers/articleshow/87857206.cms||---

The boy had picked it up from a compound adjacent to his house while playing. The injured boy identified as Sreevardh –son of Pavithran and Divya – was admitted to a hospital in Thalassery with shrapnel injuries. Police said that his injuries were not serious. According to the police, the incident happened around 2pm. Sreevardh, along with two other kids, were playing with a ball in the front yard when the ball landed in an adjoining unkempt compound, housing a hostel. When the children went to the compound to pick up the ball, they found three ball-shaped ice cream containers amid the bushes and they took them without realizing that they were crude bombs. Sreevardh’s mother said that one of the containers exploded when the kid tossed it up in the front yard. “I came outside on hearing a loud explosion and there was smoke all around," she said. Dharmadom police said the bomb squad diffused the two remaining ice cream bombs. Police and bomb squads conducted a wide search in the area following the incident. In a similar incident in May, two children were injured after an ice cream bomb which they picked up from a lane near their house went off at Padikkachal near Iritty in Kannur. Ice cream bombs are made by stuffing explosives and stone pieces inside an ice cream cup. There have been many seizures of such crude bombs in the district and political parties have been using them for carrying out political violence against rivals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/boy-hurt-as-ice-cream-bomb-explodes-at-dharmadom/articleshow/87857199.cms||---

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-funded mega-survey is expected to start from next month, officials said. Talking to TOI on Monday, CIP’s director Dr Basudev Das, who is one of the principal investigators for the upcoming study, said, “We are currently working out modalities to kick-start the exercise. Also, we are awaiting the go-ahead from the district administration to begin the survey.” He added, “We have written to the deputy commissioner, requesting him for the contact details and other coordinates of the Covid survivors. We have also sought permission and local assistance, if needed, for the survey. If all goes well, we are hoping to start the survey by the first week of December.” Two mental health experts from CIP, Rims and CCL’s Gandhinagar hospital each will take part in the survey and the entire exercise, including the evaluation process, will take about six months to complete. Dr Das further said that as per their earlier studies/ research, it had come to light that around 20%-30% of the total Covid survivors had developed some type of mental illness. “Some of them include post-traumatic disorder, rise in substance addiction, anxiety and cognitive disorders, among others. It was also found that those who ha d history of mental health issues and were cured through counselling or medication, suffered a relapse. With this survey, we aim to dig deeper into the issue and study the pre and post-lockdown impact on a Covid survivor’s mental health and offer solutions on the issue.” Similar studies are set to begin in four other cities of East India, Dr Das said. “ICMR has four centres in eastern India namely, Ranchi, West Bengal, Tejpur and Manipur. Similar studies are expected to take place in all the four cities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/door-to-door-survey-to-assess-covid-survivors-mental-health/articleshow/87856322.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Coal to clean energy switch to be messy in Jharkhand: Report||Ranchi: Jharkhand will be worst impacted in the course of transition from coal-based economy to renewable energy sources, according to a report on how the switch might affect people’s livelihoods. As India pledges to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070 at the UN Climate Change Conference UK2021, the gradual phasing out of coal is imminent. However, this process of phasing out, aimed at achieving cleaner environment, may come at the cost of livelihood of millions of people dependent on coal. On Monday, Union coal secretary Dr Anil Jain released a report in New Delhi based on the study of possible impact on the coal-bearing districts during this phasing out. The report prepared by National Foundation for India (NFI) paints a dismal future of Jharkhand where 15 out of 24 districts are going to be impacted, with four — Ranchi, Koderma, Pakur and Palamu — identified to be highly vulnerable. The study titled — Socio economic impacts of coal transition in India — bottom-up analysis of jobs in coal and coal consuming industries focussed on around 266 coal-bearing districts in nine states — Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and parts of UP. The analysis done on the basis of dependency on coal revealed that 135 out of these 266 districts are going to be impacted severely because the dependency on coal. “Coal transitions in India are likely to be a messy and complicated exercise. At a conservative estimate, more than 13 million people are employed in coal mining, transport, power, sponge iron, steel, and bricks sectors,” the report reads. In case of Jharkhand, the four districts in highly vulnerable category — Ranchi, Palamu, Koderma and Pakur — have a large chuck of labour force dependent on coal mine and more than one coal-based industry while in three districts — Deoghar, Seraikela and Latehar — labourers are dependent on coal mines and at least one coal-based industry making them moderately vulnerable. Seven more districts — Giridih, Hazaribag, Ramgarh, Singhbhum, Godda , Dhanbad, CHatra and Bokaro have been placed in least-vulnerable district category, though the transition is going to be a challenge there as well. However, labour rights activist and state convener of NREGA watch, James Herenj, believes that when coal usage is phased out, the alternate energy resources would replace it and the new sector would have an equal potential to employ people. “We have been protesting opening of new mines as it causes displacement. Our people have paid a very high price for these mines. They could not earn much as labourers in these mines, so a phase out is going to be positive for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/coal-to-clean-energy-switch-to-be-messy-in-jharkhand-report/articleshow/87856402.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The deceased was identified as Varsha Patel (32) who hailed from South Park in Bistupur. A probe revealed that she was killed by Singh on November 12 at his residence in Telco. “Singh was involved in an illicit relationship with the woman and things started taking a turn for the worse when she began blackmailing him. He, therefore, hatched a plan to murder her to get rid of her,” Jat said. Late on November 12, Singh took her to his house in Kharangajhar under Telco police station area and upon reaching there, the couple ended up having a fight during which Singh hit her. “He banged her head against the wall and strangulated her to death. He then removed her belongings and stacked the body in sack. He then ferried the body on his bike and dumped it near a pond in Telco and fled,” Jat said. The next morning, he went to his native town in Bhojpur, Bihar since, as per his plan, he had taken a week-long leave from November 13 in advance. On the same day, a missing report of Varsha was lodged at Bistupur police station by her sister. While police were investigating the missing case, an unidentified body of a woman in a mutilated condition was found in Telco on November 18. Following the identification of the body by Varsha’s family, police went through the call records on her cell phone and became suspicious upon finding Singh’s name there. On Friday, he was picked up from Bhojpur and detained for questioning during which he confessed to his crime and he was arrested, thereafter. Though Varsha was married, she was living in her mother’s house following a discord with her husband, who is a Kadma resident. The 39-year-old SI is married and has two kids. The two were in a relationship for the past four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/si-held-for-killing-woman/articleshow/87856371.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Sindri, each plot will be of 50 decimal. JIADA has invited applications for nine plots in Giridih and Sindri. The last date to apply is December 1. We don’t have land in Bokaro," said Kritishree, regional director, JIADA. JIADA has also fixed the application charges starting from Rs 10,000 for plot up to one acre to Rs 50,000 for more than three acres. Approval on the proposals will be given following a meeting of the project clearance committee on December 6. In September this year, JIADA cancelled plots issued to different investors in Balidih (Bokaro) for failing to start their projects or their existing entities becoming non-functional for last many years. JIADA has 1,470.59 acres which has been allotted to around 700 industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jiada-invites-investors-in-giridih-sindri/articleshow/87856721.cms||Divy Khare

Of these, around 685 took their first jab and 3,702 their second. Goa’s doubly vaccinated population is now 10,01,188 and partially vaccinated beneficiaries 2,54,372. “As on date 85% of the eligible population has received both doses, we’re aiming for at least 92% coverage for fully vaccinated individuals to counter the highly infectious delta variant. Health workers are working hard going door-to-door vaccinating people who cannot make it to vaccination centres. In the bargain they’re also vaccinating many able-bodied people who are already due for the second dose of their vaccine,” director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said. Booth level officers are working closely and identifying those who are turning 18 and ensuring that they get vaccinated too. In Canacona, at a special vaccination programme, the health services were able to reach out to people from the scheduled tribes, who could avail of the facility at their doorstep. At the Covid vaccination programme held at the government primary school near Karmalghat, at Gulem on Monday, the community health centre staff led by Dr Classie Furtado vaccinated 46 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fully-vaxxed-cross-10-lakh-mark-on-mon/articleshow/87857282.cms||---

Yet, the promised plan to rehabilitate locals living in and around the sanctuary’s forests has not materialised. Wildlifers fear that this may lead to a repeat of the tiger killings of January 2020, which was the result of a man-animal conflict. Over the past two months, camera traps, pug marks and scats in the sanctuary have revealed the presence of two females and one male tiger. “Last week, villagers sighted tigers in broad daylight. However, anthropogenic activities like increasing encroachments and unauthorised entries by indisciplined picnickers have been posing a threat to their survival. If the forest department fails to intervene at the earliest, we will see a repeat of incidents like the Golaulim tiger killings in the near future,” said Amrut Singh, a wildlifer. Jabestin Arulraj, the deputy conservator of wildlife (North), however, said that the movements of the tigers are being closely monitored by the forest department. “We have already initiated various steps to understand and improve the status of large carnivores in the region. We are monitoring the tigers through camera traps and patrolling,” he said. Surla villager, Deu Pingale, said that in the past year itself, his family has lost four buffaloes and cattle and is still awaiting a rehabilitation plan from the government. “Although we received compensation, the danger of tigers attacking my domesticated animals still remains. If a proper rehabilitation package is given, I am ready to move along with my 12-member family and more than 50 of our animals,” he said. Last year, chief minister Pramod Sawant had assured to rehabilitate the dhangar families living in the Mhadei sanctuary, but no concrete steps have been taken in this direction so far. It was in 2013 that the forest department received the first evidence of the presence of a tigress on the Vagheri hill, but anthropogenic activities have threatened the tiger habitat atop it. Divisional forest officer Deepak Pednekar told TOI, “I will look into the matter and take the needful steps to curtail tree-felling if any is going on in the Vagheri area.” The recent decision to allow heavy vehicular traffic through the Chorla Ghat is also an inconvenience to the movement of big cats, said wildlifers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/save-tigers-relocate-locals-from-mhadei-forest/articleshow/87857278.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

India's pre-dawn air strikes on the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) facility at Balakot on February 26 in 2019 had led to the aerial skirmish a day later after the Pakistani Air Force launched a counter-attack with a strike package of advanced fourth-generation F-16 and JF-17 fighters, among others, to bomb Indian military targets across the Line of Control. Varthaman, then a Wing Commander, was among the fighter pilots who scrambled from the Srinagar airbase to intercept the incoming hostile jets. The attempt was thwarted by IAF but Varthaman's MiG-21 was shot down after he had downed the F-16. He was held captive in Pakistan for three days before being repatriated. "Varthaman showed conspicuous courage, demonstrated gallantry in the face of the enemy while disregarding personal safety and displayed exceptional sense of duty," said his Vir Chakra citation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-balakot-airstrike-hero-abhinandan-varthaman-awarded-vir-chakra/articleshow/87858615.cms||---

On Saturday, defence minister Rajnath Singh said India wouldn't shy away from venturing across the international border into Pakistani territory for military operations if its western neighbour "creates a lot of trouble". In a statement released late Sunday, Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs accused the Indian government of "engaging in falsehoods and fantasies while pointing fingers at neighbours". "His (Singh's) unfounded remarks are delusional on the one hand, and reflective of India’s characteristic hostility towards its neighbours on the other," it said. Relations between the two countries have remained frozen since a 2019 military standoff in parts of Kashmir that saw an aerial skirmish and bombing of each other’s territory. "Pakistan is fully capable of defending itself against any aggression. The entire world was witness to Pakistan’s capability and resolve in thwarting the Indian misadventure in February 2019," the foreign ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-riposte-to-rajnaths-military-warning-gratuitous-delusional/articleshow/87858620.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

No casualty was reported in the blast in front of Triveni Dwar of the Cantt area, police officers said on Monday. "It's a terrorist act. The CCTV footage is being analysed," said Pathankot SSP Surendra Lamba. According to police, a sentry informed that the grenade exploded soon after a bike went past around 9 pm. Punjab deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa held a meeting with senior police officers and issued strict orders to increase night patrol by deputing at least one-third of the gazetted officers in each commissionerate or district in accordance with the roster. He said it has come to his notice that adequate police patrolling was not carried out at night. Sunday's blast put the focus back on the border state's vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) attacked Pathankot airbase on January 2, 2016, and the gunfight ended with the death of four Pakistan-based terrorists, seven security personnel and a civilian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/grenade-blast-near-pathankot-cantt/articleshow/87858621.cms||---

Participating in the 40th convocation of Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning at Puttaparthi town in Andhra Pradesh's Anantapur district, Justice Ramana said rulers should check if they have any bad characteristics and ask every day if he/she was on the righteous path before taking any administrative decision. People have the supreme power to elect rulers in a democracy, the CJI said. "The present-day rulers should strive to protect the dignity and self-respect of women, children and weaker sections of society at all costs." The SSSIHL vice chancellor listed out the achievements of the students and the institution in his convocation address. Chancellor K Chakravarthi gave away certificates of merit and gold medals to meritorious students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-rulers-should-introspect-daily-about-their-decisions/articleshow/87858639.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

"If you do not admit such students, then IIT seats would be reserved only for those from metropolitan cities," said a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna. It directed the institution to admit the student in four-year civil engineering BTech course on or before Wednesday. The court said many students from the hinterland may face difficulties in paying fees online because of internet connectivity issues but because of this, they cannot be deprived of their seats in such prestigious institutions. Prince Jaibir Singh, studying in Allahabad, had qualified in the IIT-JEE (Advanced). The boy had secured an all-India rank of 25,864 and a rank of 864 among successful Scheduled Caste candidates. He was then allotted civil engineering seat on October 27. IIT-Bombay's portal was open till October 31 for completion of online admissions, which included fee payment, uploading of documents, and candidates' response to queries and other formalities. On October 29, Jaibir logged into the portal and uploaded the required documents. Unfortunately, he could not pay the fee due to shortage of funds. He borrowed the shortfall from his sister on October 30. He then made 10 to 12 attempts to complete fee payment but could not succeed due to a technical error on the portal. On October 31, he made similar attempts from a cyber cafe, where the same set of errors appeared. He unsuccessfully made calls to the admission authorities and then followed this with emails to them from October 31 till November 1. The dalit student again borrowed money to travel from Allahabad to Kharagpur - where the centralised admission authorities are located. The office at Kharagpur expressed inability to assist him. He then travelled to Mumbai and moved the Bombay HC, seeking a direction to the authorities concerned to admit him at IIT. But, the High Court refused to pass any such direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sc-uses-omnibus-power-to-help-dalit-boy-get-iit-b-seat/articleshow/87860126.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Nagpur||Road widening in forests may not need clearance, says env min||Nagpur: Even as the Centre is in the process to dilute the Forest (Conservation) Act (FCA), 1980, which was brought in to stop dereservation of forests in the country, the MoEFCC has exempted the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and state road user agencies from forest clearance if the right of way (RoW) belonged to them. The clarification issued to the state governments on October 26, 2021, by the MoEFCC’s forest conservation division states: “If the ownership of land vests with MoRT&H/NHAI/state road constructing agency, it is not a ‘forest’ as per government records and the same land is under ‘non-forest use’ before October 25, 1980, then provisions of FCA would not apply”. “This is one of the grey areas that are proposed to be amended. However, it seems the exemption has especially been granted for road development even before the amendments are debated at a proper forum. This is against the FCA provisions,” says conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar. “The decision will open floodgates for haphazard development and impact wildlife and its corridors,” says state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe. The MoEFCC move is based on a meeting of Group of Infrastructure held on August 24, 2021, under the chairmanship of road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari to discuss clarity on applicability of FCA over RoW roads, ownership of which rests with the NHAI or state government. “This letter overlooks apex court order of December 12, 1996, in TN Godavarman case. The order clearly states FCA was enacted with a view to check further deforestation which ultimately results in ecological imbalance, and therefore, the provisions made therein for forest conservation,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka from Mumbai. “The minister means ownership of the land will determine the status of forests. Obviously, the MoEFCC and Gadkari have forgotten the SC judgment which says FCA will apply to all lands that have forests, in addition to all lands that are shown as forests in government records,” added Goenka. Ex-DFO and expert on forest land matter Hemant Chhajed says, “The letter clears that FCA is applicable to the forest and forest definition lands in possession of Central and state government departments like railways, NHAI, defense, and others.” When the forest lands are given as RoW then the question of ownership does not arise because in the state there is no 7/12 extract of the roadside lands in the name of PWD, NHAI, or other Central agencies, says Chhajed. Chhajed adds, “After FCA 1980 came into force from October 25, 1980, the road width of national highway was 20 metres, state highway 6 metres, main district roads 5 metres and other than district 5 metres. However, in 2010 the road width expanded without prior permission from GoI up to 150 metres, 120 metres, and 100 metres respectively. So, we lost 13, 11, and 9 hectares per km of forest land and at least 10 crore trees in the last several years.” In 1955, the Bombay state government amended Indian Forest Act provisions and added roadside and canal-side areas as reserved or protected forest but said entries were not at all taken into relevant documents. Environment and wildlife lawyer Manish Jeswani says, “Earlier, the MoEFCC had issued a similar letter to benefit railway projects like the one in Melghat. Now it has been issued to expand highways. But exemption given for works in RoW is not in accordance with the FCA provisions.” “Every sanctioned RoW has a life. The sanctioned documents prior to FCA can never stand valid because it supersedes the earlier Acts. All sanctioned RoWs prior to FCA were valid for a stipulated period only and these need to be reviewed considering the present-day threats,” said conservationist Uday Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/road-widening-in-forests-may-not-need-clearance-says-env-min/articleshow/87857376.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

No casualty was reported in the blast that took place in front of the Triveni Dwar of the Cantt area, police officials said on Monday. “It’s a terrorist activity. The CCTV footage is being analysed,” said Pathankot SSP Surendra Lamba. A forensic team had also collected the samples of explosives, he added. Police officials said the grenade was probably hurled by some unidentified persons on a motorcycle as a sentry on the duty informed that it occurred soon after a bike passed by around 9 pm. Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa held a meeting with senior police officers and issued strict orders to increase night patrolling across the state. Randhawa, who heads the home department, said it has come to his notice that adequate police patrolling was not carried out during the night and ordered that at least one-third of the gazetted officers in each commissionerate or district be deputed for patrolling as per the roster. “I can randomly check the location of the duty officer at any time by making a video call to the official concerned,” he said. Principal secretary (home) Anurag Verma has issued letters to the DGP, the ADGP (law and order), police commissioners and SSPs in this regard, asking them to follow the directions of the deputy chief minister in true spirit. Police commissioners and SSPs have also been asked to send a copy of the roster to the ADGP (law and order), who would consolidate the roster of all districts and send a copy to the deputy chief minister, the home secretary and the DGP by 5 pm on a daily basis. Intelligence sources have not ruled out the possibility of anti-national elements trying to vitiate the atmosphere ahead of elections in Punjab.
