Darrell Brooks, 39, was due in Waukesha County Circuit Court at 4 pm CST (2200 GMT) after authorities said he deliberately drove an SUV through police barricades on Sunday and into the city of Waukesha's annual parade, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Milwaukee.  Waukesha police chief Daniel Thompson on Monday said his department would refer five counts of first-degree intentional homicide to prosecutors and additional charges could come later as the investigation progresses.  But Waukesha County district attorney Sue Opper's website said on Tuesday that her office was still deciding what charges to bring against Brooks, a Milwaukee resident arrested near the scene of the carnage shortly afterwards.  Police have ruled out terrorism as a motive and said Brooks, who was out on bail from a domestic abuse case, acted alone.  Police were not pursuing Brooks when he drove his car through the parade route, but one officer fired shots to try to stop the sport utility vehicle, Thompson said.  The injured included at least 18 children who suffered facial abrasions, broken bones and serious head injuries and were taken to Wisconsin Children's hospital in Milwaukee. Six were listed in critical condition, officials said. At least two of the children were since discharged from the hospital.  The five casualties, who ranged in age from 52 to 81, included some members of the "Milwaukee Dancing Grannies" parade group.  "Our hearts are heavy over the loss of our grannies and volunteer," the group said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding some of the injured members were in stable condition and one has been released from a hospital.  The incident drew the attention of President Joe Biden, who called the attack "horrific", and Pope Francis. The Vatican sent a condolence message to the Roman Catholic bishop of Milwaukee on Tuesday.  "The pope" commends the souls of those who died to almighty God's loving mercy and implores the divine gifts of healing and consolation upon the injured and bereaved," the message said.  At one of several vigils and services on Monday, Jeremy Wittig, 39, an information technology professional, said, "Waukesha is strong. That's why we are out here."  Video of the incident posted on social media showed a red SUV racing alongside the parade route and then into the procession, appearing to run over more than a dozen people before bystanders raced from sidewalks to help.  "I saw children who were run over," Brian Hoffman, 33, a Waukesha resident, recounted on Monday. "I am still totally shocked."  Brooks was last released from custody after posting $1,000 cash bond on November 11, an amount the Milwaukee County district attorney's office said was "inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges" against him.  Brooks had been charged on November 5 with obstructing an officer, battery, reckless endangerment, disorderly conduct and felony bail jumping in a domestic abuse case, prosecutors and state court records show.  Shortly before Sunday's attack on the parade, police received a domestic disturbance complaint involving Brooks and a knife, Thompson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/wisconsin-parade-attack-suspect-to-appear-in-court-as-prosecutor-prepares-charges/articleshow/87876135.cms||---

For the upcoming autonomous council elections, too, a decision has been taken to constitute a two-tier committee to strengthen and widen the party base in the council areas. The key decisions were taken in the Assam CLP (ACLP) meeting held in Dispur late on Monday, which was attended by all Congress MLAs. “In the municipal and autonomous council constituencies there are a large number of seats. So many leaders and workers get the chance to fight elections to show their popularity at the grassroots level. The Congress hopes for good days because we still have thousands of dedicated workers though we lost two successive elections in the last six months,” Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah told TOI on Tuesday. In order to accomplish the 33 lakh membership target, each MLA has been entrusted with one district, excluding his home district to supervise the membership drive. All three Lok Sabha MPs will also supervise their respective LS constituencies. Rajya Sabha MPs Ripun Bora will supervise Tezpur Lok Sabha, while Ranee Narah will supervise Lakhimpur Lok Sabha. “The membership drive will be speeded up and the target that has been finalized for the first phase is 33 lakhs. About 8.50 lakh membership forms have already been disbursed,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, chairperson of the media department of Assam PCC. The meeting was attended by ACLP leader Debabrata Saikia, deputy ACLP leader Rakibul Hussain, chief whip Wazed Ali Choudhury, Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah and working presidents Rana Goswami, Kamalakhsya Dey Purksyastha and Jakir Hussain Sikdar. MPs of both the houses from Assam, Ripun Bora, Pradyut Bordoloi, Ranee Narah, Gaurav Gogoi and Abdul Khaleque, were invited as special guests. A decision has been finalized to hold a brainstorming session under the chairmanship of MP Pradyut Bordoloi in January and to form nine sub-groups under senior leaders to share their ideas and views for the session. A training camp in Guwahati will be held in December after the assembly session as directed by the AICC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-congress-on-toes-for-2022-civic-polls-sets-up-84-poll-panels/articleshow/87876138.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||Guwahati||Congress pays tributes to Tarun Gogoi on first death anniversary||GUWAHATI: Rich tributes were paid to veteran Congress leader and former chief minister Tarun Gogoi on his first death anniversary on Tuesday. The three-time chief minister of Assam had also served as a minister of state in the Narasimha Rao government. Gogoi, who represented the Jorhat seat in Parliament from 1971 multiple times, was seen to be a Gandhi loyalist and in Delhi the face of Congress from Assam. When he took over as chief minister of the state in 2001, Assam had witnessed decades of insurgency and economic stagnation. But over the years he earned the credit for being the architect of a resurgent Assam, who steered the state on the path of progress. The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee organized programmes in every district to pay homage to the party stalwart, who had breathed his last at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital here due to post-Covid complications last year. Assam PCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah started the programme at the state Congress headquarters Rajiv Bhawan here by offering floral tributes to the portrait of Gogoi. An all-faith prayer was held on the occasion in presence of senior Congress leaders like former Assam PCC president Ripun Bora, leader of opposition Debabrata Saikia and senior Congressman Rakibul Hussain and workers of NSUI, Youth Congress and other wings of the party. “Tarun Gogoi took up the political leadership of Assam during the troubled times when the people of the state were fear-stricken due to secret killings. Before the 2001 state elections, people in Assam feared to come out of their homes after 6 pm,” said Borah. He added, “Our economy was shattered, the number of unemployed youths was escalating, the education sector was in a shambles and there was no proper infrastructure for education. He transformed every sector.” Remembering his father, son Gaurav Gogoi said, “Our discussions were centred on his vision of Assam.” “Fondly remembering my father Lt Shri Tarun Gogoi, especially his connect with ordinary people, knowledge about Assam and it’s complicated issues, and commitment to the ideology of the Indian National Congress party,” he tweeted. A public event was organized at Titabor, the constituency which the longest serving chief minister of the state represented in the assembly since 2001. “This government has been compelled to recognize his contributions and Padma Bhusan was conferred on Tarun Gogoi posthumously,” said late Gogoi’s brother Dip Gogoi. A separate memorial event was also organised by the Gogoi family here in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-pays-tributes-to-tarun-gogoi-on-first-death-anniversary/articleshow/87876243.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The bizarre matter came to the light after the farm’s owner Ranjit Kumar Parida lodged a complaint with Nilagiri police station on Tuesday. In his complaint, Parida said the marriage procession with a DJ band passed in front of his farm at Kandagarandi village around 11.40 pm on Sunday, playing ear-splitting music. “I requested the band operators to lower the volume as the music was too noisy and panicky for the chickens, who were shivering terribly. But the groom’s friends shouted at me and instructed the band to increase the volume. They purposely halted in front of my poultry farm for about 15 minutes and played noisy music,” Parida’s complaint read. When the procession finally passed the area, Parida was shocked to see many of the fowl unconscious in his farm. On Monday morning, Parida contacted some veterinary experts, who visited his farm and told him that those chickens died of heart attack. The chickens were not suffering from any disease. “There were around 2,000 chickens in my farm. Each of the 63 dead chickens would be around 3 kg. I suffered a loss of around Rs 25,000. The dead chickens are still lying in the farm as the police have asked me not to dispose them of until the end of the inquiry,” Parida said. Police said the matter is being investigated. “The Nilagiri police station has received a complaint in this regard. The charges are being verified,” superintendent of police (Balasore) Sudhanshu Mishra told TOI. An officer of Nilagiri police station said they have asked the groom or any of his family members to appear in police station on Wednesday for verification of the allegation. The police have also sought the help of veterinary experts in Balasore to ascertain the cause of the death of the chickens. “A chicken can die of heart attack after being exposed to high decibel sounds and extremely noisy music for several minutes. Animals and birds are scared of loud music and high decibel firecrackers,” Siba Prasad Das, a veterinary doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/chickens-die-of-heart-attack-due-to-loud-dj-music-in-odisha/articleshow/87876320.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||India||86% of terrorists killed in J&K this year were local residents: Sources||NEW DELHI: Of the 148 terrorists killed in Jammu and Kashmir so far this year, 86% were local residents and only 14% foreign terrorists, sources in the security establishment have disclosed. Also, as many as 129 local Kashmiris were recruited by terror outfits this year, they said.A senior officer said 127 local terrorists were killed in various encounters with the security forces in J&K this year, against 21 foreign terrorists neutralised in the same period. Local recruitment continues to be a concern, with 129 Kashmiris believed to have joined terrorist ranks so far in 2021. However, many of these local recruits have been killed in anti-terror operations, while some surrendered or got arrested.Around 199 terrorists, including 110 local and 89 foreigners, are said to be active in the Valley. Infiltration activity has picked up in J&K in the last one month, though it was largely concentrated in the Poonch region. “A group is believed to have already infiltrated through this route, and may have headed to adjoining Shopian by road. Usually, just after onset of winter, the terrorists use the Poonch-Samba-Rajouri sector, where visibility on the border is low due to foggy conditions, to infiltrate and lie low in districts like Shopian through the winter months. Once the weather improves, they resurface to execute terror attacks,” said an officer of the central security establishment.The officer added that arms continue to be smuggled into Punjab through drones, before being transported to Kashmir in trucks, using the narco-terror network.The falling share of foreign terrorists in J&K corresponds to the ISI and Pakistan-based terrorist outfits’ strategy to largely use local Kashmiris to execute terror plans so as to project terror in the Valley as an “indigenous rebellion” against the Indian forces. “While it is the ISI and terrorist outfits sponsored by it that mastermind the attacks in J&K, involvement of local people in their execution on the ground gives the former scope for deniability and thus escape global attention or sanctions, including Pakistan’s blacklisting by the financial action task force (FATF) that monitors action against terror financing and money laundering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/86-of-terrorists-killed-in-jk-this-year-were-local-residents-sources/articleshow/87876518.cms||Bharti Jain

The champion athlete, who passed away earlier this year, had been an inspiration to several generations of Indian runners. So, it was fitting that Gurgaon's first night run in months was held to commemorate Milkha's birthday. The Flying Sikh Midnight Run was flagged off at midnight – November 20 – by Manbir Singh, DCP Manesar. The four-hour-long run saw hundreds of athletes and running enthusiasts participate across the 5K, 10K, 21K and 36K distance categories. Runners set forth for the marathon at midnightThe run – organised by Enviro in conjunction with Dhaavak – began from Vatika Town Square in Sector 82 and concluded just before sunrise in New Gurugram. "We believe that such small efforts are important to thank the legendary athlete, whose life has been a guiding light for generations, and continue to motivate all of us to do more for the country, especially in the field of sports," said Lt Col Mehta, VP Operations (Residential), Enviro. The run was promoted with the tagline #MainBhiMilkha, urging the runners to imbibe the same spirit and passion for running as the great late Milkha Singh. Manbir Singh, DCP Manesar Running events – even late-night ones – had been common in the Millennium City before the pandemic. As they now restart, the running community says they have been eagerly awaiting their return. "It's good to have these events back finally. The absence of running events in the city felt like such a void. Plus, this one is in the memory of a man who inspired all of us, which makes it extra special," one of the participants told us. Runners said that it was "good to have these events back finally"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mainbhimilkha-celebrating-milkha-singh-with-a-run-in-gurgaon/articleshow/87872211.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur
---||Business||Apple says it is suing Israeli hacker-for-hire company||RICHMOND: Tech giant Apple announced on Tuesday it is suing Israel's NSO Group, seeking to block the world's most infamous hacker-for-hire company from breaking into Apple's products, like the iPhone. Apple said in a complaint filed in federal court in California that NSO Group employees are "amoral 21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse". Apple said NSO Group's spyware, called Pegasus, had been used to attack a small number of Apple customers worldwide. "State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change," said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering. NSO Group has broadly denied wrongdoing and said its products have been used by governments to prevent terrorism and crime. The company did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday. It's the latest blow to the hacking firm, which was recently blacklisted by the US Commerce Department and is currently being sued by social media giant Facebook. Security researchers have found Pegasus being used around the world to break into the phones of human rights activists, journalists and even members of the Catholic clergy. Pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously controls the smartphone's microphones and cameras. Researchers have found several examples of NSO Group tools using so-called "zero click" exploits that infect targeted mobile phones without any user interaction. The Biden administration announced this month that NSO Group and another Israeli cybersecurity firm called Candiru were being added to the "entity list", which limits their access to US components and technology by requiring government permission for exports. Also this month, security researchers disclosed that Pegasus spyware was detected on the cellphones of six Palestinian human rights activists. And Mexican prosecutors recently announced they have arrested a businessman on charges he used the Pegasus spyware to spy on a journalist. Facebook has sued NSO Group over the use of a somewhat similar exploit that allegedly intruded via its globally popular encrypted WhatsApp messaging app. A US federal appeals court issued a ruling this month rejecting an effort by NSO Group to have the lawsuit thrown out. Apple also announced Tuesday that it was donating USD 10 million, as well as any damages won in the NSO Group lawsuit, to cybersurveillance researchers and advocates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/apple-says-it-is-suing-israeli-hacker-for-hire-company/articleshow/87877161.cms||---

The proposed bill — which will also put in place a framework for Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to create an official digital currency — comes amid a raging debate over whether the government should ban private cryptocash or regulate them like shares and bonds. A very vocal lobby led by unregulated exchanges has been campaigning for their inclusion under a regulatory system, as opposed to an outright ban the government had earlier proposed. RBI has been backing a ban on cryptocurrency, arguing it can be used for illegal purposes apart from limiting the central bank’s ability to manage inflation, foreign exchange and the overall economy. It, however, sees no problems with the use of technology for managing logistic chains or land records but is opposed to its use as a financial instrument. It cannot be called a currency since the sovereign only enjoys that right,” the apex bank has pointed out. The Centre, however, seems inclined to ban bitcoins, making it clear that dabbling in them carries a clear risk. While there have been observations that a ban will be tough to enforce, or that it will only drive the entire growing trade underground, those supporting a prohibition have argued that even gambling or drug trafficking are illegal and those found violating the law face strict action. The divergent views had prompted PM Narendra Modi to recently hold consultations and call for global cooperation on the issue. While China recently banned all cryptocurrencies, El Salvador is the sole country to permit them for official use. Government sources said the bill has not been finalised yet and is unlikely to be introduced during the first week of the winter session that starts on Monday. But all eyes are on how the government defines the “uses” of cryptocurrency. In case it allows it to be treated as an asset or a commodity, as a section within the government has argued, it will pave the way for their trading on exchanges. The fear is that trading would allow the instrument to be used as a store of value, although officially it will not be a medium of exchange. There are concerns that the moment trading is permitted, people may use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins, for making part payment for purchase of property or for overseas transfer. While the RBI had banned investments in cryptocurrencies, the Supreme Court had held the circular illegal. In the meantime, the government-appointed committee headed by SC Garg, the then economic affairs secretary, submitted its recommendations seeking a ban and the government had planned to introduce a legislation during the Budget session. But with the session cut short, the bill “prohibiting” private cryptocurrencies could not be introduced, resulting in a fresh round of consultations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-lists-bill-in-winter-session-to-ban-all-private-cryptocurrency/articleshow/87877213.cms||---
---||India||Panel on data protection bats for individual privacy||NEW DELHI: Strongly advocating the need to protect the privacy of individuals, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Personal Data Protection Bill has asked the Centre to take “concrete steps” to ensure a mirror copy of sensitive and critical personal data in possession of foreign entities be mandatorily brought to India. The JPC headed by BJP’s P P Chaudhary has said once the Data Protection Authority is set up, the Centre “must ensure data localisation clauses under this legislation are followed in letter and spirit by all local and foreign entities, and India must move towards data localisation gradually”. The committee has asked the Centre to consider an individual’s ‘right to be forgotten’ by clarifying the responsibilities of data fiduciaries, but noted this may depend on available technology and practicability of such applications. The panel has held it may not always be easy to distinguish between “non personal” and “personal” data and the proposed authority must consider both within its ambit. To this end, the JPC has called for a mechanism to certify the integrity of hardware equipment. The report also calls for an alternative to the SWIFT system of funds transfer, saying that there have been worrying instances of breaches by Chinese lending apps in India with huge implications for privacy of individuals that needs to be addressed. “The committee is of the view that an alternative to SWIFT payment system may be developed in India which will not only ensure privacy, but will also give boost to the domestic economy.” The report bats for a regulatory system on the lines of the Press Council of India (PCI) for social media (SM) platforms, saying there should be a statutory media regulatory authority to regulate content of such media irrespective of where their content is published — online, print or otherwise. It also, importantly, calls on SM platforms to verify users once users complete verification procedures. “SM platforms, which do not act as intermediaries, should be treated as publishers and be held accountable for the content they host. A mechanism may be devised (where such platforms) will be held responsible for content from unverified accounts on their platforms. Once application for verification is submitted with necessary documents, the social media intermediaries must mandatorily verify the account,” the report states. The JPC has sought the inclusion of hardware manufacturers, who collect data through digital devices, in the law, noting that this is a loophole. “(The committee) desires that a new sub-clause as 49(2) (o) may be inserted to enable DPA for framing regulations to regulate hardware manufacturers and related entities.” It has called for a mechanism for formal certification process for all digital and IoT devices (sensors, gadgets) to ensure their integrity by setting up labs throughout the country. The committee has asserted the need to “design and set up processes to unify data across public sector, private sector, and academic and research institutions”, and formulate “robust data management policies, standards and best practices with accurate data, appropriate data access, strong data security, privacy and ownership rights”. “It has also been observed that national security is of paramount importance and India can’t compromise it on the ground of promotion of businesses. Therefore, the Committee feel that though there are provisions under Clauses 33 and 34 for crossborder transfer of data, some concrete steps must be taken by the Central government to ensure that a mirror copy of the sensitive and critical personal data which is already in possession of the foreign entities be mandatorily brought to India in a time bound manner,” the report says. The panel also said that though social media (SM) platforms were designated as intermediaries under the IT Act, the law failed to regulate the SM platforms adequately, having failed to keep pace with the changing SM ecosystem. The PDP Bill has similarly general provisions regarding SM platforms and intermediaries, the panel said, relaying its “strong view” that designated intermediaries may be working as publishers of content. The JPC had on Monday adopted the draft report with seven of its 31 members moving dissent notes against various clauses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panel-on-data-protection-bats-for-individual-privacy/articleshow/87877632.cms||---

However, the relief was short-lived as the calm wind conditions prevailed in the evening, and the air quality again slipped into the "very poor" category by 8pm. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, "The wind speed picked up to 8-12kmph during afternoon, but calm wind was recorded during evening hours." Another Met official said, "Strong winds blew on Monday and the speed even touched 25kmph. Due to relatively better winds on Monday, the air quality started improving from Monday afternoon. Hence, the 24-hour average AQI of Delhi improved to the 'poor' category on Tuesday at 4pm. The wind speed again deteriorated on Tuesday evening, and calm wind leads to accumulation of pollutants." According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain in the "poor" or the lower end of "very poor" category on Wednesday and the "very poor" category from Thursday. "The wind speed is expected to be low for the next three-four days," said Jenamani. The visibility at Safdarjung, the city's base station, and Palam was in the range of 1,500-2,200 metres. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the air quality might remain "poor". "Winds at transport level are likely to slow down and also change direction from northwest to south/southeast on Wednesday and north or northwest on November 25, leading to further improvement of air quality within 'poor' category. Local surface winds are also relatively low for the next three days that reduces dispersion of pollutants," it predicted. SAFAR added, "Surface winds are likely to increase from November 27. So air quality is likely to be within 'poor' category for the next three days. From November 27, local surface winds are likely to increase, resulting in improvement of air quality, but it's expected to be in the 'poor' category. The effective stubble fire count is 770 and its share in Delhi's PM2.5 is 3%." Meanwhile, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas conducted a review meeting with the states on Tuesday. The states submitted an action-taken report to the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-pollution-gets-second-wind-after-some-relief/articleshow/87877752.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The study conducted in two Delhi hospitals found that though vaccination prevents severity of the viral attack, there have been cases of breakthrough infection, and that there is also a probable risk of onward transmission to potentially very vulnerable people. The study was conducted by researchers from the INSACOG consortium, CSIR and National Centre for Disease Control.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); The researchers analysed data on 113 breakthrough infections among health workers by "constructing probable transmission networks from epidemiological and virus genome sequence data using a suite of computational approaches". Among known cases we identify a high probability that doubly-vaccinated individuals transmitted SARS-CoV-2, and potential cases of virus transmission between individuals who had received two doses of vaccine, the pre-print study said. The study highlighted the need for ongoing infection control measures even in highly vaccinated populations. The findings of the study assume significance as increasing complacency is setting in among people, especially in those who are fully vaccinated. It says that though vaccines remain effective against severe disease, breakthrough infections "are a reality". Experts highlight the need for infection control measures even in highly vaccinated populations and mask-wearing by individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-delta-can-infect-even-fully-vaccinated-says-study/articleshow/87877816.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Bengaluru||33% Covid fatality rate in govt ICUs better than global average||BENGALURU: The fatality rate in Covid ICUs of government hospitals was 32.8% during the pandemic, according to data with the state health and family welfare department. Officials said the global average is 42%-62%. The Karnataka government, through its critical-care support team and experts from private hospitals, had facilitated tele-ICU facility at ICUs in government hospitals across the state to remotely monitor and guide the doctors. "The case fatality rate (CFR) in Covid ICUs is much lower in government hospitals where the tele-ICU intervention was made. It's lower than the global average of 42% to 62%," said KV Trilok Chandra, nodal officer, Critical Care Support System Team (CCST) for Covid. The state government recently presented its tele-ICU intervention before the Union health ministry. Fatality rate doesn’t reflect ICU performance: DoctorTill September 2021, there were total 46,583 patients admitted to government hospitals catered by tele-ICU. Of them 15,275 patients died and the ICU case fatality rate was 32.7%, Chandra explained. As per the studies published by the Association of Anaesthetists, a global forum, in February 2021, Covid-19 ICU fatality rates have varied from 16.7% to 70% in different parts of the world at different intervals.CCST was started in April 2020 and its doctors conducted tele-ICU rounds with district hospitals to standardise treatment at all ICUs. "Compared to the global data, it is an acceptable rate," said Dr Pradeep Rangappa, a member of CCST. He highlighted that a Turkey study showed 62.8% mortality rate, and in China it was 25.7% to 37.7%. According to Dr Rajesh Shetty, executive committee member of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, Bengaluru chapter, to understand the ICU mortality rate, the group of patients has to be identified whether they were on ventilator, non-invasive ventilator, on high-flow nasal oxygen support, based on severity. "The ICU fatality rate depends on the type of patients admitted to ICU. Some ICUs admit only patients requiring non-invasive ventilator, ventilator or ECMO. The mortality rate is very difficult to compare," he said. However, no patient was on ECMO therapy, which replaces the function of the lungs and the heart. The Covid ICU mortality rate in corporate hospitals in Bengaluru that extensively treated critical cases requiring ventilators was 20-25 %, said a senior doctor from the city. Doctors TOI spoke with said that there are variables -- the two different waves of Covid, the patient condition at admission, age and comorbidities and treatment given -- to be considered to understand the ICU mortality rate. "All these factors skew the mortality rate. In some hospitals, it was higher during the first wave. In the second wave, the sheer increase in the number of persons requiring ventilators amid the shortage worsened the situation," said a doctor. Besides, admission criteria to the ICU and the cause of death and definition of mortality vary from one country to another, said doctors. Another top specialist mentioned that the Covid fatality rate in the ICUs does not reflect the performance of an ICU. "What needs to be calculated is the Standardised Mortality Rate (SMR), which is the indicator of the critical-care quality. It gives us a comparison of the actual hospital mortality of all the patients in the ICU with predicted mortality. If the SMR is less than 1, it means that the ICU has performed well in saving lives. SMR is the globally accepted parameter," the doctor said. If SMR is more than 1, it means that the patient could have possibly survived but for some reason s/he has died and the ICU performance has to improve. The SMR scoring is done based on Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (Apache). Apache scoring depends on variables, including the age and comorbidities. It answers the question was the patient sick enough to die, said doctors. Sources said district hospitals were working on finding their Apache scores. "During tele-ICU rounds, the common narrative was patients arrived with delayed presentation, late referrals," sources said. However, the SMR scores of government hospitals and the district-wise ICU mortality rates could not be accessed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/33-cfr-in-govt-icus-better-than-global-avg/articleshow/87877860.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Downpour halts research at JNCASR; samples shifted||BENGALURU: Research work at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), which has nearly 50 sophisticated laboratories, has come to a halt after heavy rain resulted in flooding of the campus on Sunday and Monday. While the institute has managed to shift most of its biosamples to cold storage units, it is yet to accurately assess the kind of impact that will have on ongoing projects. Also, tens of sophisticated instruments across labs have been exposed to environments that aren’t ideal for their functioning, which will also affect timelines of projects. JNCASR president Prof KU Kulkarni told TOI: “Research work has stopped for the time being. We’ve relocated most of our biosamples to cold storage places, but we cannot ascertain if that solves the problem. That assessment will be made by individual labs and researchers. Also, we’ve managed to secure most of the instruments, but the conditions — moisture, dust, dirt etc., — have varied. How badly the instruments have been affected by the flooding will have to be technically assessed, which will take a few weeks.” Pointing out that the sophisticated instruments can’t even be exposed to the common environment, he said the institute has had to deal with extreme environment in the past couple of days. “On Tuesday, we cleared up some areas but inundation is still there. Most of the nearly 50 labs had a few inches of water. Some were more adversely affected where water was more,” Kulkarni said. Kulkarni, while pointing out that even handling of the equipment/instruments needs special care, said: “We have outsourced some of the work as it was not a simple case of seeking the help of the fire department to secure instruments, given that they need special care. The inflow was so high that we could not do anything during the rain and flood. We are working on pumping the water out.” A senior scientist and head of a lab said a lot of their research work has been destroyed by the water and that it is more devastating than the impact the flooding has had on the infrastructure per se. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who visited JNCASR and met its management and senior scientist CNR Rao, said the rain Bengaluru witnessed was unprecedented. “There was 138mm of rain in just two hours. We’ve not seen such rain in such a short time. As a result, all the lakes are full and overflowing, and JNCASR is one of the places that has been affected. A few weeks ago when Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu was at the institute, they had pointed to a drain problem, which is being worked on. BWSSB has been directed to start the survey work,” Bommai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/downpour-halts-research-at-jncasr-samples-shifted/articleshow/87877883.cms||Chethan Kumar

Despite the forecast of light to moderate rain, some areas got no more than a brief drizzle. According to the meteorological department, the day’s maximum temperature touched 28 degrees Celsius, the highest in 30 days. This was also the highest temperature in the month of November since 2017. “A low-pressure system following the depression resulted in continuous heavy rainfall in the city. Whenever the effects of this system are not seen, the sky will be sunny. This system has just vanished. Bengaluru recorded a maximum temperature of 28 degrees Celsius. The highest for November was 33 degrees C recorded on November 29, 2017,” said Rajavel Manikhya, senior meteorologist. This has been the wettest November ever, with the city recording 180mm of rain in the first 18 days of the month. During monsoon, October 2 recorded the highest temperature of 30.8 degrees C. From October 6 to 23, the mercury level held on, but it began dipping later. “Tuesday felt like a summer day. It was difficult to face the heat all of a sudden after so much rain,” said Yuva Kumar BR, retired officer of ITI College. Bengaluru is expected to see moderate rain due to a cyclonic system existing in south Bay of Bengal over 24 hours, IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sunny-surprise-for-blureans/articleshow/87877884.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||After RCs, Karnataka govt seeks Centre’s nod to issue digital DLs||BENGALURU: Soon, motorists in Karnataka may not need to visit RTOs to get smartcard-based driving licence (DL) or wait for it to arrive by post. The government has decided to stop issuing smartcards for DLs and vehicle registration certificates (RCs). While the transport department has been issuing RCs in digital format since November 1, it has now sought the Centre’s permission to allow issuance of DLs via the same mode. Rajender Kumar Kataria, principal secretary, transport department, told TOI: “As per Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) guidelines, there is no compulsion to carry physical documents or smartcards. We have received several complaints on delay in getting new RCs or DLs due to shortage of smartcards. We have stopped issuing the cards for RCs since November 1 and DLs will be next. There is no misuse as all vehicle details are available on the Vahan portal.” He said Bengaluru being the IT capital of the country has taken a lead in this. “There is a monopoly of one or two smartcard providers. We will also save a significant amount of money,” he added. “Under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, every DL should be in the form of a laminated card or smartcard. Now, since digital DL has been allowed as an authentic document, the provision of mandatory issuance of the card can be removed. This is unnecessary expenditure and also leads to delays in issuance...This may be examined and the provision may be amended,” reads the letter from chief secretary P Ravikumar to MORTH. TOI has a copy of it. Once it gets MORTH nod, the government will also issue DLs in digital mode. Motorists can use these digitally signed certificates like RCs and DLs through DigiLocker or show printouts if any traffic cop or transport official asks for them. They can also laminate the digital document on the lines of Aadhaar. Motorists, especially those who passed/renewed licences or bought a vehicle/made changes in the RCs of existing vehicles in the state, have been complaining about delay in getting smartcards. There was a backlog of nearly two months. Though the transport department blamed the supplier of smartcards, the latter cited global semiconductor shortage. Sources said as there’s a monopoly with one or two smartcard providers in the country, the department was not in a position to scrap the tender. “This is a technology transition from smartcards to digital documents, like Metro which evolved from smartcards to QR-based mobile phone ticketing,” said an official. In 2009, the department switched from paper-based licences and RCs to smartcards. However, neither the department nor traffic police had card readers so there was no way to check the authenticity of smartcards. The Centre has allowed motorists across the country to use mParivahan or DigiLocker on mobile phone from October 1, 2020 instead of carrying physical documents while travelling. Mixed reactions to moveAddressing a press conference here, road safety expert Kamal Soi claimed Karnataka’s decision to shift RCs from smartcards to digital format is ill conceived. “With only 3.5 crore DigiLocker users in the country, the format is unjustified,” he said. However, many Bengalureans welcomed the move. Pradeep K, a resident of Koramangala, said: “Already, people have too many cards in the wallet. When many citizens are using UPI-based apps in the tech city, managing digital DLs and RCs won’t be a difficult task. Besides, anyone can make duplicate smartcards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-rcs-state-seeks-centres-nod-to-issue-digital-dls/articleshow/87877885.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Pleas against online gaming law are misconceived: Karnataka govt||BENGALURU: Defending the Karnataka Police Amendment Act which seeks to regulate online gaming activities, the government on Tuesday informed the high court that it is more concerned about organised syndicates soliciting bets on unknown results of an event or skill, which is akin to a game of chance. Commencing his arguments, advocate-general Prabhuling K Navadgi submitted that cricket betting has become a big menace and added that such an activity has wider ramifications like money laundering and narcotics among others. He also cited the betting and match fixing controversy in the Karnataka Premier League wherein the nexus between bookies, players and team owners came to be unearthed a couple of years ago. Terming the petitions misconceived, Navadgi claimed there are 5,000-6,000 games and it is difficult to find out whether they fall under game of skill or game of chance and such pure questions of fact have to be ascertained after analysing the nature of game. The state government also asserted that online gaming activities are a different class altogether, which requires third party intervention for their functioning and are accessible to an individual, literally all the time. Further, the AG cited the PIL filed in the high court seeking ban on all forms of online gambling and online betting and added that on March 31, 2021, the court had sought the response in the form of state’s stand on the issue and on July 8, 2021, it was conveyed that the state government has decided to come out with a piece of legislation banning online gaming activities. Regarding the petitioners’ claim that horse racing is a skill game, he said only those which are conducted as per racing order, in a particular licenced place on a specific day are exempted. A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi adjourned the hearing to November 30 for further hearing when the AG will dwell upon legislative competence and other issues raised by the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-pleas-against-online-gaming-law-are-misconceived/articleshow/87877886.cms||---

Sources in Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), a joint venture between the railway ministry and the state government, said a piece of deemed forest land in Devanahalli has been identified for setting up the depot. Officials said acquiring BU land at Jnanabharathi wouldn’t have been easy as environmentalists might have oppose it. (K-RIDE) is executing the 148-km Bengaluru suburban rail project.“The depot at Devanahalli is proposed at Akkupet and Bommavara villages in the taluk’s Kasaba Hobli in Bengaluru Rural. All corners of the forest land have been physically marked with temporary stone pillars,” a K-RIDE official said. “Jnanabharathi has an area of about 31 acres, but we need 60 acres for the depot. The location too was found to be not feasible as it is within city limits with educational institutions nearby,” said an official. As per the detailed project report prepared by RITES Limited, two depots were planned — at Jnanabharathi (56.9 acres) on the Parijaata line and at Devanahalli (61.2 acres) on the Sampige line. However, these two corridors are being taken up only in the second phase. K-RIDE is considering building a loop line from Yelahanka, which is part of Kanaka line, towards Devanahalli, where land has been identified for the depot. According to the DPR, 48 stabling lines, four inspection lines, and three workshop lines were planned at Jnanabharathi depot. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/k-ride-scraps-jnanabharathi-suburban-depot-plan/articleshow/87877887.cms||---

On Friday and Saturday, more than 60 officials raided the BDA head office at Kumara Park West. Sunday being a holiday and Monday a government holiday, there were no raids. However, the BDA head office was locked and its keys remained with the ACB. On Tuesday, the zonal offices at RT Nagar, Banashankari, Vijayanagar, and HSR Layout were raided. Innumerable documents were scanned and the raids are likely to continue for another couple of days, sources said. According to a press release from ACB, the sleuths came across various irregularities, including the sale of corner sites which actually have to be auctioned, creation of fake documents on land acquisition and diversion of compensation money to private persons. ACB also found violations in allowing constructions on civic amenity sites allotted at Bharat HBSC Layout in Bengaluru West, Sector 3 of HSR Layout and Mahalakshmi Layout, besides illegal allotment of sites. The bureau said makeshift sheds have come up on vacant and big BDA sites at old layouts, while plots acquired in the name of BDA have been illegally resold to individuals.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru hospital tracks infant sleep, says average nap time 11.5 hours||BENGALURU: The average duration of night sleep for Indian infants aged below 18 months is 8.5 hours, an hour lesser than their western counterparts. Total sleep duration of Indian infants for a day is an average 11.5 hours, less by 1 to 1.5 hours compared to infants in the west, says a study conducted by a Bengaluru children’s hospital. The study — Evaluation of Sleep Patterns and Practices in Healthy Indian Infants: Is there a Cultural Difference? — was conducted by Shishuka children’s hospital between April 2020 and April 2021; it evaluated the sleeping patterns of 1,027 infants in the 0 to 18 months age group. The study which analysed the quantity and quality of infant sleep says that the average bedtime was 9.45pm. “Though the average time for infants to go to bed was 9.45pm, it ranged from 6.30pm among some kids to 2.30am among a few others, which is worrisome,” said Dr KR Bharath Reddy, paediatric sleep specialist and director of Shishuka, who headed the study. Published in the current edition of Indian Journal of Sleep Medicine, the study says that 41.6% of the infants’ parents felt that their babies had a sleep problem, and 19.2% among them noted serious issues with their little ones’ sleep pattern. Consolidated sleep through the night plays a critical role in growth, development and behaviour of a child. “There is a need to understand sleep practices in the region to enable parent counselling and develop guidelines for healthy Indian infants,” said Dr Reddy, adding: “As per our study, infants woke up 3-4 times during the night. Every time they woke up, it led to parental sleep disturbance as well.” In nearly 46% of the cases, babies needed to be fed, 32% rocked and 15.2% held to sleep. Only 7.6% of the infants did not use any sleep associations (like rocking, feeding) and self-soothed. The researchers point out that babies who were able to self-soothe slept longer during both night and day compared to those dependent on associations. “After the age of six months, infants must sleep at a stretch for eight hours, known as consolidated sleep. It is not true that to wake up in between is a usual occurrence... Continuous sleep for eight hours through the night is what is needed after six months of age,” explained Dr Reddy. “Parents who read about sleep coaching ask us for help. We need to break the myth that feeding or rocking makes a baby sleep. It only makes babies get habituated to these, and they tend to associate sleep with the same. I believe that helping a baby self-sooth and sleep coaching early can assist both the child and parents experience good sleep,” said Dr Reddy. Indian parents finishing work late is another social issue which impacts night sleep of babies, Dr Reddy added. Dr Rashmi Bhopi, department of paediatrics, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Jersey, US and Dr Maya Rajagopal, department of paediatrics, Child Health Institute of New Jersey, US were co-authors of the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-hosp-tracks-infant-sleep-says-avg-nap-time-11-5-hrs/articleshow/87877889.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Five fellow accused of the convict, John Kennedy A alias Kennady, 28, of JC Nagar, were acquitted. According to the prosecution, Avinash J, 22, and his friends had arranged the live screening of the match on 4th Cross, SK Garden. Kennedy came there with his Labrador dog. Avinash and friends asked Kennedy to leave the place as his dog was creating a nuisance. It led to an argument between Kennedy and other viewers. Kennedy left the place and returned with his mother and sister. The group managed to explain the problem, after which his mother and sister went back home. But Kennedy continued to argue and stabbed Avinash’s friend Kenneth in the chest. Avinash tried to save Kenneth and received multiple stabs. Avinash was rushed to the hospital where he breathed his last. Five friends of Kennedy allegedly assaulted Avinash’s friends during the clash and were named as co-accused in the case. But, the prosecution failed to prove their roles and hence, the court acquitted them of all the charges. The defence advocates contended that it was a group clash over cricket betting. Matches were organized on the big screen on public roads for the sake of betting and Kennedy did not stab Avinash, it was argued. But the eyewitnesses supported the prosecution argument and evidence also helped in proving Kennedy's crime. “The facts show the accused did intend to cause the death of Avinash but had knowledge that his act would be causing his death. As regards the involvement of accused No 2 to 6, the prosecution has not placed corroborative evidence,” noted judge KG Chintha of the 65th Additional City Civil and Sessions Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/salesman-gets-life-term-for-murdering-student/articleshow/87877890.cms||Santosh kumar.B

K Rajesh, 35, a resident of Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh, had paid close to Rs 8 lakh until September-end but left in the second week of November without paying the bills incurred later for 41 days, police said. He has been booked under Indian Penal Code sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). “Taking the call record details, we spoke to around 10 people, with whom Rajesh was in touch before leaving the resort. Most of them claimed Rajesh cheated them of money in different ways,” an investigating officer said. Resort manager Yeshwant stated in his complaint that Rajesh checked in on July 23. The resort is located near the Kempegowda International Airport. Rajesh told the staff that he’s a realtor with lands in Andhra Pradesh and Bengaluru and runs different businesses. “Rajesh has been a regular customer since mid-2020 and often stayed in a single room for 3-4 days. A couple of times, he stayed for one or two months. Each time, he had promptly paid bills for rooms as well as for the food. On July 23, he checked into a room. The rent per day came up to Rs 7,850. He cleared the bill up to September 30 and told me that he would extend his stay for business purposes. Being an old customer and making prompt payments, he was allowed to continue staying without making any advance,” he said. But, Rajesh drove away in the wee hours of November 11. “The security staff did not stop him since he would often go for long drives,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ap-bizman-flees-from-resort-without-paying-3-2-lakh-bill/articleshow/87877891.cms||---

The parcel was declared as a musical instrument and meant to be sent by air cargo from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to Sydney in Australia. Officials received specific information that large quantities of pseudoephedrine were being smuggled from Tamil Nadu via Bengaluru airport to Australia’s New South Wales state. The banned substance is a key component in the making of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), popularly known as Ecstasy pill, a psychoactive substance, and drug-trading gangs often use the Bengaluru route to send the substance to Australia. Acting on a tip-off that drugs had been booked at a courier agency in Trichy, Tamil Nadu, the Bengaluru team tracked the parcel to a private agency in Yeshwantpur on Friday evening. The electric guitar was booked by a unidentified person from Chennai. Officials cut open the black case of the red guitar to find a white powder concealed on the edges. Tests established that it was pseudoephedrine. The DRI team is trying to trace the sender.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/oz-bound-drug-worth-50l-hidden-in-guitar-case-seized-at-airport/articleshow/87877892.cms||Petlee Peter

BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta took to social media on Tuesday and said, “Hennur main road, Kothanur, has been identified for complete rehabilitation. The work, which was held up because of rains, has already been entrusted to a contracting firm and will resume immediately. It is expected to be completed within the next 40 days.” Hennur-Bagalur Main Road was developed as an alternative road to facilitate easy access to the airport for east and southeast Bengalureans. But a host of civic works taken up on this road rendered several parts of it unmotorable. On October 4, TOI published a report on how a 3km stretch of the road from Hennur Junction to Kothanur police station was riddled with 406 potholes. Within 48 hours, BBMP swung into action to fix the road. However, the work came to a halt as soon as the city started receiving rain. BS Prahlad from the department of major roads, BBMP, said, “The road is in a bad state and hence had to be redone from scratch. A budget of Rs 4 crore has been allocated to revamp 1.2km on each side along with the pavements. In the next two days, we will commence work; we are waiting for the surface to dry up.” BBMP was trying to fix potholes with the wet mix, but the road’s condition only worsened it and the gravel stones started giving way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/airport-link-road-likely-to-don-new-look-soon/articleshow/87877893.cms||---

Think self-eating rockets and self-vanishing satellites, to name just a few among the 46 slices of mind-bending tech taking shape at its innovation hub. "All our rockets have metal casings that are dropped into the sea after launch or become (final-stage) space debris. We are working on a technology through which rockets will effectively eat themselves, eliminating waste-dropping into seas and space debris. We are looking at special materials for casings that can burn up along with motors," Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI on Tuesday. In the same vein, self-vanishing satellite technology would enable spacecraft destruction, once its lifetime is over, through a "kill button" to kickstart a process that will burn it up in-orbit. "When rockets fly, there are defects sometimes. Self-healing materials can correct some of these defects by themselves," Sivan said. Make-in-space concepts, quantum communication and advanced radars are the other technologies Isro is focusing on as part of the plan to prepare India for future even as private enterprises manage day-to-day launches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/isro-working-on-tech-that-can-beat-even-star-treks/articleshow/87877923.cms||Chethan Kumar

The move came a day after a similar one by rival Bharti Airtel. Vodafone Idea increased the minimum value of recharge by 25% for 28 days to Rs 99 from the existing Rs 79. Market leader Reliance Jio is yet to announce a revision in mobile rates, though analysts and the broader industry expects it to happen soon. The tariff hike from Vodafone Idea comes despite it continuously losing its customers. The company had started making some tariff revisions in the July-September 2021 quarter but it has made a big correction now with Bharti Airtel taking the lead. Vodafone Idea hiked the rates in the popular unlimited-calling category in the range of 20-23%. The lowest plan bundled with a per-day 1 GB data limit with a 28-day validity will cost Rs 269 from November 25 onwards. Currently, it costs Rs 219. Further, the price of the 84-day validity plan with 1.5 GB per day data limit will cost Rs 719 instead of Rs 599.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-airtel-voda-idea-raises-call-data-rates/articleshow/87878071.cms||---

The NGT bench was hearing a petition filed by Battu Satish Reddy, a resident who stays 50 metres away from the ash pond in Pittavani Palem village in Vizag district. The counsel representing Satish alleged that NTPC’s Simhadri Thermal Power Plant was violating the conditions laid by the Union environment ministry while granting environmental clearance. One of the conditions for issuing environmental clearance is that the fly ash generated to the tune of 33.5 million cubic metres should be collected in dry form in silios and fully utilised. Mentioning the current status, the petitioner alleged that 15.55 tonnes of ash is still lying a few metres away from Satish’s house. The NGT bench directed the district collector to visit the site and file a report related to the non-compliance with the conditions and loss to agriculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/panel-to-probe-green-norms-violations/articleshow/87876041.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Vijayawada||Capital trifurcation will ensure balanced development: Buggana Rajendranath||AMARAVATI: Finance and planning minister Buggana Rajendranath said while centralisation of development was the reason behind the movement for a separate state in the past, the Andhra Pradesh government has decided to decentralise development to prevent trouble in the future. The minister moved the Bills to repeal the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) Repeal Act and AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act in the legislative council on Tuesday. Speaking on the issue, Buggana said the government has made every attempt to create awareness about the need for trifurcating the capital city in order to provide opportunities for equal development to the three regions of the state. Stating the government intends to share the fruits of development equally with all three regions, the minister said, “Putting all eggs in one basket has never been a wise move. Hence, the state government wanted to develop three capital cities for the three regions.” Buggana said the Rayalaseema region had sacrificed the capital city when the Centre decided to create a unified state by merging AP and Rayalaseema with Telangana. He questioned what the fate of less-developed districts such as Srikakulam and Vizianagaram in the north-coastal region or the Rayalaseema districts would be if all big-ticket projects were spared for Amaravati. The minister added that the previous government had planned IT, electronic, industrial, entertainment, hospitality and healthcare cities in Amaravati by ignoring the aspirations of other regions. Buggana said expert committees headed by Professor Sivaramakrishnan and Justice Srikrishna strongly recommended decentralisation of development across three regions. The minister said the YSRC got a massive mandate in the 2019 elections and in subsequent local bodies elections because of its decision to ensure justice for all three regions. “Any sensible leader will consider developing Srikakulam on par with Guntur, and Kurnool on par with Nellore. Surprisingly, Chandrababu Naidu designed Amaravati on an extent of 7,500 sq km, which is almost double the area of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan and Ullas Nagar in Maharashtra,” said Buggana. The minister added that the government would bring in Bills for the decentralisation of the capital city with comprehensive information after due consultations with stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/capital-trifurcation-will-ensure-balanced-development-buggana/articleshow/87876028.cms||Samdani MN

However, there is a reason for them to be there. These vehicles were seized by the enforcement officials for transporting ganja. Hundreds of vehicles involved in cannabis transportation in parts of Visakhapatnam district have piled up in various police stations in the district. Majority of the seized vehicles are parked in Narsipatnam division in the state. Around 1,000 seized vehicles, including high-end cars and bikes, are choking the premises of various police stations under Narsipatnam jurisdiction. In most cases, the owners of the vehicles won’t claim them as they are also partners in the illegal business. But the owners of cabs, which are seized in ganja cases, come forward to claim their vehicles as they usually do not have any involvement in the trade and collect the vehicles after due court proceedings. “Some drug peddlers hire vehicles from private cab operators for transporting the weed,” said ASP Narsipatnam, V Manikanta. On disposal of vehicles seized in ganja cases, DIG (Visakha Range) LKV Ranga Rao said they will auction them as per the court directions. Over 200 seized vehicles were auctioned for Rs 87 lakh in various places in the district in December 2020. “The spike in the number of vehicles seized is due to the increase in the enforcement drives carried out by the police and Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB),” Ranga Rao added. A senior police officer said ganja has been transported in ambulances, oil tankers, high-end cars, autorickshaws and bikes. Mostly, ganja is transported through Narsipatnam route in the district. Drug peddlers are adopting innovative methods to transport the weed from one place to another. They are specialists in creating hidden chambers in vehicles where the ganja can be concealed along with sacks of vegetables, the police added. The enforcement officials are struggling to keep the seized vehicles due to space constraints at police stations. The public are also surprised to see large number of vehicles gathering dust. The locals observe that as ganja traders earn high profit, they are hardly bothered about the seized vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vehicles-seized-in-ganja-trade-choke-police-station-premises/articleshow/87876053.cms||Nalla.Babu

The committee, at its meeting chaired by state chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, directed the urban development and housing department to set up call centres and issue help lines so that people can lodge complaint about burning of solid waste. “Strict action will be taken against those found guilty of burning solid waste in open and causing air pollution,” Sharan said at the meeting. “The building construction and road construction departments have been asked to deal sternly against construction and demolition works without properly covering the sites. The departments concerned would also ensure water spray during these activities to check dust which worsen the air quality,” public relations officer of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), Birendra Kumar, said. The transport department officials were asked to make surprise inspections at vehicle pollution test centres as a measure to check air pollution caused by the exhaust of automobiles. The NCAP steering committee asked the authorities of the municipal corporations of Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur to use mechanical sweeper machines and ensure water spray during the cleaning of roads.

Azad had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket from Dhanbad in Jharkhand. He had joined the Congress in 2019 after being suspended by the BJP for his “anti-party activities” during the Bihar assembly election in 2015. Accompanied by his wife and children, Kirti took the membership of the TMC in the presence of Mamata. Son of former Bihar CM late Bhagwat Jha Azad, Kirti has a great influence among the members of Brahmin community in Mithilanchal region. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Darbhanga thrice on BJP tickets. Praising the West Bengal CM, Kirti said, “The country needs a person who can fight on the ground and give it a new direction. She has proved it and she can do it.” Earlier in the day, JD(U)’s former Rajya Sabha MP Pavan Varma had also joined the TMC. The joining of two senior leaders from Bihar is being viewed as an exercise by Mamata to expand the base of the party ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election. Reacting to Kirti’s joining, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “He is an opportunist and people like him should not continue in the party. It would no longer affect the party’s prospect in the coming elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congs-kirti-ex-jdu-mp-pavan-join-tmc/articleshow/87875297.cms||Ramashankar

The QR card installation work has been given to a private agency. The GMC has recently secured top position among all urban local bodies in the state having population of less than 10 lakh in Swachh Survekshan 2021. The project has already started. The municipal corporation is also developing a mobile application where citizen will register their complaint, if garbage is not collected from their houses or localities. In response to the complaint, garbage will be collected or lifted within 2-3 hours. The garbage lifting will be monitored from a control room to be made functional at the GMC office. At the entry gate of every house, a white coloured card with QR code will be installed. The cleanliness staff would scan the QR code by their mobile phones after which the code in control room will turn green. To ensure that the cleanliness staff do not skip duty, biometric attendance system will be introduced. GPS has also been installed in the vehicles being used in garbage lifting to track their location and ensure transparency. If there is any irregularity in lifting of garbage, the houseowner can register a complaint at the control room. Mayor Birendra Kumar alias Ganesh Paswan said, “The project would be carried out in all the 53 wards. The agency entrusted for the work would be setting up control room and other necessary infrastructure very soon.” He added: “We often received complaints from people that garbage was not collected from their houses or any particular locality. On some occasions, slackness by cleanliness staff also came to light. The QR card would ensure transparency. People will be able to register their complaints, if any, on the app being developed for the purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-civic-body-to-install-qr-code-in-70000-houses/articleshow/87875389.cms||---

The department has launched packages for weekend (Saturday & Sunday) and three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). “As travelling back to Patna takes six to seven hours, many tourists thought it would have been better had the package been for three days so that they could stay there for one more day. Hence, we launched the three-day package,” conservator of forest-cum-director, VTR, H K Roy said. Ambrish Kumar Mall, district forest officer, VTR division-1, said: “In two days, one night package, we offer lodging, food and safari. The number of safari increases in the three-day package.” Sharing his experience of VTR tour package, senior physiotherapist and in-charge of yoga at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), Dr Ratnesh Choudhary, said, “We had booked a three-day package from November 19 to 21. We went from Patna by an SUV provided by the BSTDC. The experience at VTR was enthralling as there are rivers, mountains and many animals can be seen during safari.

Dr Jaiswal said this while taking exception to the submission of dissent notes by two former Union ministers and Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Manish Tewari to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019. He said the two leaders went public with the report on Monday, the day JPC adopted it. “Since the report is yet to be tabled in Parliament, the Congress leaders have violated the parliamentary norms by making it public,” he added. “For this, the Congress president (Sonia Gandhi) is responsible. The Congress is a party in which no one can breathe freely without the permission of the Gandhi family, and, therefore, no one could have issued statements without the nod from the family,” Dr Jaiswal added. Incidentally, seven JPC members, including those belonging to the TMC and Biju Janata Dal (BJD), submitted their dissent notes to the JPC report on the PDP Bill (2019), but Dr Jaiswal picked up Ramesh and Tewari for criticism. After the PDP Bill (2019) was tabled in the Lok Sabha, it was sent to the JPC to invite suggestions and amendments by the public at large. As per the Bill finally adopted by the JPC, Section 35 has allowed the central government and its agencies to exempt themselves from the law of the land in matters related to the sovereignty of the country, security of the state and friendly relations with foreign countries. The Bill also provides for the constitution of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) headed by its chairman. Dr Jaiswal said the Congress had asked for a provision that the permission of the chairman be first sought before taking any action against any suspect – terrorist or otherwise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/data-bill-bjp-slams-congress-netas-for-submitting-dissent-notes-to-jpc/articleshow/87875371.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||State govt will provide water, electricity to every farm: Dy CM||PATNA: Deputy chief minister Tarkishor Prasad on Tuesday called upon the agricultural engineers to develop farming equipment for the benefit of small and marginal farmers and help increase agricultural produce in the country. Inaugurating the 55th annual convention of the Indian Society of Agricultural Engineers (ISAE) and a three-day international symposium on “Emerging Trends In Agricultural Engineering Education, Research and Extension”, at Gyan Bhawan here Prasad said, “With the rising population, farms are decreasing and the number of small and marginal farmers is also increasing considerably. Hence, agricultural technology must accord priority to the interest of marginal farmers.” The deputy CM said the state had achieved a lot in the field of agriculture ever since the first agricultural roadmap was implemented in 2008. Now as the third agricultural roadmap is likely to end next year, production of food grains has almost doubled during the period. He said, the state government is now committed to provide water and electricity to every farm with a view to boosting productivity. He also presented awards to distinguished scientists and technocrats for their significant contributions. Speaking as special guest on the occasion, state agricultural minister Amarendra Pratap Singh appreciated the role of agricultural engineers in successful implementation of the Green Revolution. The country could become self-sufficient in foodgrain solely due to the innovations made in farm mechanisation and irrigation techniques. Realising the importance of agricultural engineers, the state government has established a college of agricultural engineering at Ara, which will start its academic activities in the next academic session. Besides, one agricultural management college is also likely to start functioning in the state soon, the minister added. State agriculture department secretary N Srawan Kumar exhorted the agricultural engineers to develop low cost technology to benefit the marginal farmers, who constitute more than 90 per cent of farmers in the state. Micro-irrigation is likely to influence modern agriculture in a big way. “The state government has also launched a survey of farmers for implementing post-harvesting techniques to ensure proper storage of foodgrain,” he added. At the outset, Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University vice-chancellor R C Srivastava observed that if the potential of agricultural engineers are fully utilised, a large number of job opportunities can be created in the field of food processing, farm mechanisation and agri-business. Kota Agricultural University vice-chancellor D C Joshi and ISAE president Indra Mani Mishra also addressed the delegates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-will-provide-water-electricity-to-every-farm-dy-cm/articleshow/87875417.cms||B K Mishra

The six-member SIT headed by IGP (CID and railways) Subhash Trivedi will focus on tracking down the accused, who allegedly raped the girl and collecting evidence in the case. Cops from Vadodara crime branch and railway police from Valsad and Surat will be members of the team. Over the last three weeks, 25 teams from different agencies had been investigating the case and they questioned dozens of auto-rickshaws, and scanned CCTV footage of the area where the girl was allegedly raped. But they have failed to track down the accused. Investigators have also questioned employees of the institute in Vadodara where the girl used to work. The girl was found hanging in the coach of a train in Valsad on November 4. During initial investigations, the railway cops found the girl’s diary wherein she had written that she was kidnapped and raped by two auto-drivers in Vadodara. Within a few days, Vadodara police and Ahmedabad crime branch too joined the investigation. The cops are also trying to find out the girl’s cycle that’s been missing since the day she was allegedly raped in Vaccine Institute Ground in Vadodara. The Valsad railway police have said in their FIR said that an employee of the institute had taken photos of some pages of the girl’s diary and sent the images to the trustees of the institution on Whatsapp. The images were later deleted. Meanwhile, a team of Ahmedabad crime branch also visited the Vaccine Ground to get more clues about the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sit-formed-to-probe-navsari-girls-gang-rape-and-suicide/articleshow/87875794.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP pollution control board proposes to slap Rs 25L fine on NCRTC for flouting norms||Meerut: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has proposed to slap a fine of Rs 25 lakh on National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) -- a joint venture of the central government and the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Delhi which is implementing the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project across NCR – after it was found “flouting pollution norms” at rapid metro construction sites in Meerut city. During inspection in the past two weeks, a UPPCB team found dust flying all over at RRTS construction sites so much so that even leaves of trees nearby were covered with a thick layer of dust. The team also found that water was not being sprinkled properly to settle the dust. Roads in Shatabdinagar area were found broken due to movement of heavy vehicles carrying goods and machinery. Further, a boiler was found installed without the requisite permission, said a UPPCB official. “The RRTS construction sites were inspected on November 9, 21 and 22, following which a notice was issued to NCRTC to rectify the shortcomings, but nothing was done to mitigate pollution. The Meerut municipal commissioner also inspected the sites and wrote a letter to NCRTC and the Regional Pollution Control Board in this regard,” said a UPPCB official. “The pollution status in the city (Meerut) is very bad, and NCRTC construction activities are adding to the woes. We have issued several notices to the agency to ensure proper disposal of concrete waste and check accumulation of water around construction sites, but it did not pay any heed. Now, we have proposed to slap a fine of Rs 25 lakh on it. The proposal is pending in lucknow head office," said Yogendra Singh, a UPPCB official in Meerut. Meerut’s Air Quality Index (AQI) has been hovering at a dangerous level for the last several days. On Tuesday, the AQI was 246 (very unhealthy) at Pallavpuram phase 2 area of the city. AQI at Ganganagar stood at 198 (unhealthy) and it was 236 (very unhealthy) at Jaibhimnagar. Talking to TOI, NCRTC public relations officer (PRO) Puneet Vats said all the prescribed guidelines to mitigate pollution are being religiously followed at RRTS construction sites. “Anti-smog guns are operational round the clock to curb pollution. Regular sprinkling of water is done to settle the dust. The excavated soil and construction material are duly kept covered. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste is being disposed of as per the prescribed norms. Mechanised cleaning of roads are being done on a regular basis. High-pressure tyre washing facilities are in operation to remove mud and dust from wheels of heavy vehicles. All construction sites are barricaded,” said Vats. Vats added that a dedicated team of environment and safety experts are monitoring these pollution-mitigating measures to ensure their effectiveness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-pollution-control-board-proposes-to-slap-rs-25l-fine-on-ncrtc-for-flouting-norms/articleshow/87876093.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Business||Collaboration, trust are new currencies for success in business||By Shantanu DasOver the years, as a corporate professional pursuing music at the same time, I have found great similarities between the two. We can draw critical lessons from the musical world for sure. It provides a unique lens to draw parallels in various facets of people agenda, be it leadership, teamwork, collaboration, innovation, communication, empathy — the list can be endless. One thing that is fundamental to both music and a strong corporate culture is being scientific and intuitive simultaneously. Like the seven notes that serve as the foundation for the entire world’s music, organisational values form the basis of its culture. In music, if one note goes out of sync, the entire piece gets disarrayed. So is the case in an organisation wherein, if team players are not synchronised, it can have an adverse impact on business results. Successful organisations do a good job in defining the system for everyone so they can optimise their performance according to their roles, but in tandem with the others and the larger goal of the company. “To play a wrong note is insignificant, but to play without passion is inexcusable,” said Beethoven, one of the greatest musicians to have ever lived. Music is all about how passionate the musician is in displaying the craft. More the passion, better is the outcome. Is it any different for an organisation? Every individual has to have skin in the game, which is all about passion. While innovation in music brings freshness and mesmerises the listener, within employees it drives creativity and thus helps organisations stay ahead of the curve in an extremely competitive world. Orchestra or symphony, music is a great illustration of teamwork. A set of musicians with unique skillsets comes together and is guided by a conductor to produce a masterpiece. There is an inherent trust among all musicians to do their bit of the role with perfection. Similarly, organisations should thrive to bring a diverse set of talent under a strong leadership and produce outstanding business results. And especially in today’s times, collaboration and trust are the new currencies for business success. Further, an orchestra also personifies how diversity and collaboration leads to better quality, increased morale, and learning. In organisations too, teams can use the diverse abilities and insights of the employees, fostering a fulfilling, meaningful way of working together. In successful organisations, teamwork is an integral part, where cross-functional teams are entrusted to drive specific business needs or projects, including unique learning and development programmes that help employees across levels stay coordinated and motivated. When people are engaged in the right manner within an organisation, they feel valuable. Music is a connection to the heart, and it has the power to bring us together. Today, companies are increasingly demonstrating a proclivity for ‘leading from the heart’, which is strikingly like the world of music and musicians. For instance, one of the core principles of the founder’s growth mindset at Amway is ‘Lead with heart’, which encompasses inclusivity, openness and team work. Indian classical music is a shining illustration of sustained rigor, devotion and dedication. Can it be any different when it comes to employees?

Dilip Koradoya, a resident of Dhoraji in Rajkot district, was mandated to approach Rajkot District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission after the insurance company deducted half of the bill amount of his son Meet's treatment for viral pneumonia citing government's circular capping hospital charges for Covid-19 hospitalization. It was only after the insurance company was sued that it settled the dispute and paid the amount to Koradiya’s satisfaction. As per details of the case, Koradiya had bought a Rs 7.25 lakh cover for his family from Star Health & Allied Insurance Co Ltd. His son, Meet, fell sick on September 29, 2020, and he was admitted in a multi-speciality hospital in Surat. He was treated for viral pneumonia and discharged on October 5. He footed a medical bill of Rs 2.02 lakh. In the discharge summary, the hospital stated that the patient suffered from viral pneumonia and was not Covid-positive. A day after the discharge, Koradiya asked the insurer for reimbursement. The insurer approved Rs 1.01 lakh amount and deducted Rs 1.03 lakh. The insurer cited the Surat Municipal Corporation’s Covid-19 circular regarding hospital charges for Covid-19 to justify chopping reimbursement by half. Koradiya did not agree with the insurer and claimed that Rs 97,000 amount was wrongly deducted. The father cited the bill assessment sheet issued by the insurance company in December which mentioned the final diagnosis as viral pneumonia Covid-positive and asserted that this was not true. He claimed that his son was not suffering from Covid-19 and the discharge report clearly said so. He argued that when the patient was diagnosed with viral pneumonia and declared as Covid-negative, the municipal corporation’s Covid19 circular became irrelevant for deducting the amount from Mediclaim. When the insurer found that the issue had reached the consumer court, it offered to settle the dispute. Koradiya did not have an objection to a minor deduction about cost of certain medicines and hospital discount, and the dispute was settled at additional payment of Rs 83,000. This led him to withdraw his complaint earlier this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-pandemic-times-every-viral-pneumonia-not-covid-positive/articleshow/87876355.cms||Saeed Khan
---||Business||RIL, Bharti help sensex regain 1k pts||Mumbai: Strong buying in Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel late in Tuesday’s session led to a recovery of over 1,000 points in the sensex from an early low in the sub-58k region. At close, the index was up 198 points at 58,664 as financials and metals also witnessed strong buying. Tuesday’s gains reversed a four-session losing streak, during which the sensex had lost 2,253 points (3.7%). According to market experts, the recent slide in the sensex came on the back of a combination of negative news and developments. For one, rising inflation rates — in the US at a 30-year high, and in India where the wholesale price index is in double digits for the seventh consecutive month — are making market players nervous. Combined with this, the rise in fresh Covid infection cases globally as well as crude oil prices were pushing investors worldwide to be cautious with most risky assets, including stocks in emerging markets like India. Along with the year-end phenomenon of muted foreign flows, these factors have affected the Indian market, experts said. On the domestic front, the review of RIL’s $15-billion deal with global oil major Saudi Aramco and a disappointing listing for Paytm after what was India’s largest IPO further affected sentiment on Dalal Street, they said. Latent View Analytics made a strong stock market debut on Tuesday as the Chennai-based digital analytics company’s shares surged to Rs 531 in early trade on the BSE — a premium of around 170% compared to its issue price of Rs 197. It closed at Rs 489 a share on the BSE, a premium of 148% to the issue price of Rs 197. On the NSE, Latent View shares opened at Rs 512, a 160% premium, and closed at Rs 488. According to Religare Broking VP (research) Ajit Mishra, in early trades on Tuesday, investors reacted to the news of the rise in Covid cases in various parts of the globe, which led the benchmark indices to open lower. “However, healthy buying in select sectors such as metals, PSU banks and realty stocks triggered a gradual recovery as the day progressed,” Mishra wrote in a post-market note. However, he warned that participants shouldn’t read much into this rebound and wait for further clarity. “Apart from global cues, the scheduled monthly expiry would keep the volatility high in the coming sessions.” On Wednesday, trading on D-Street is expected to be volatile ahead of the expiry of November derivatives contracts on Thursday, market players said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-bharti-help-sensex-regain-1k-pts/articleshow/87876709.cms||---

Shares of the payment company ended at Rs 1,495 after opening at Rs 1,358 and hitting the day’s high of Rs 1,525. At current prices, the shares are still a third below the issue price of Rs 2,150. The IPO of One97 Communications (which owns the Paytm brand) had the worst opening for any public issue of over Rs 1,000 crore with shares falling 27% on the first day of trade. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said that the company would continue with new initiatives and help investors understand its numbers better through future results. On Monday, group firm Paytm Payments Bank launched Paytm Transit card, which allows users to pay for all metro, bus and rail travel, parking and other commerce with one card. In the first phase, the Paytm Transit Card rollout is being launched in collaboration with Hyderabad Metro Rail.The Rs 18,300-crore IPO was subscribed 1.8 times. The company was estimated to be valued at $16 billion in its last big round of private funding in 2019 led by T Rowe Price along with existing investors Ant Financial and SoftBank Vision Fund. While there weren’t many analysts’ reports on Paytm’s valuation pre-IPO, the runaway success of other startups like Nykaa and Zomato has boosted sentiment. Post-IPO on the listing day, Macquarie initiated coverage valuing the company at a 40% discount to issue price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-closes-in-green-for-1st-time/articleshow/87876718.cms||---

The bank’s ‘Trade Emerge’ platform provides access to comprehensive trade services, including a database of customers and their credit scores, logistics solutions and marine insurance. “India has emerged a key player in global trade. From April to October 2021, our overall exports and imports are estimated to be nearly $780 billion, recording a rapid growth over the same period last year. Typically, global trade is time-consuming, paper-intensive and process-heavy and requires knowledge of rules and regulations. This platform will make exports and imports hassle-free,” said ICICI Bank ED Vishakha Mulye. “This one-stop platform eliminates the need for importers and exporters to coordinate with multiple touchpoints,” said Mulye. She added that this would be useful to companies irrespective of their life stage, including those searching for new business, and established corporate exporters. The value-added services include information services provided through the Federation of Indian Export Organisations and access to a global database of partners from 181 countries in association with ‘The Dollar Business’ — a global export-import data and analytics platform.

The amount raised will mostly be used to fund growth of its business. The life insurer raised funds by issuing 10-year subordinated debt securities, which had a ‘AA’ rating and a stable outlook from ICRA. The funds were raised at a yield of 7.75% per annum, its officials said. Ratings company ICRA said that the assigned rating takes into account Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance’s “strong promoter profile, which enables capital, strategic, and operational support as and when required”. The company is a joint venture between Bank of India, which holds 28.96% stake, Union Bank of India holds 25.10% stake and Dai-ichi Life International Holdings owns the balance 45.94% stake. The importance of Star Union Dai-ichi Life to the promoters is demonstrated by their track record of equity infusion and their continued capital commitment. The rating also factors in the operational support in terms of access to the extensive branch network of about 14,300 of the promoter banks, ICRA said. “In terms of strategic support, the company leverages the vast experience of Dai-ichi Life in the life insurance industry for new product approval and reinsurance arrangements, among others,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/star-union-dai-ichi-life-raises-rs-125cr-via-bonds/articleshow/87876770.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Ajay Alok of the JD(U) said Nitish had dreamt to set the state's development on the right track in 2005 and that happened during the 15-year governance. “The works speak for themselves,” he added. Sources said senior JD(U) functionaries would draw a parallel between 15-year-rule of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi and that of Nitish. “The people will judge which one is better,” said a JD(U) MP. The celebrations are, however, being viewed as the JD(U)’s attempt to project Nitish at the national level. The JD(U)’s national council had passed a unanimous proposal in August this year, describing Nitish as a “Prime Minister material”. The JD(U)’s celebrations, however, have not gone down well with the opposition circles. The RJD and Congress took a swipe at the JD(U)’s celebratory events. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said, “The state has been pushed back in the last 15 years. More than 70 scams, corruption and plundering of public funds marked Nitish’s rule. Unemployment and migration have assumed alarming proportions,” he alleged. Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwri said, “Celebrations for what? Law and order is fast deteriorating in the state. Corruption is at its peak. Scores of people have died after consuming spurious liquor. Issues like unemployment and migration still exist.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-celebrate-15-yrs-of-nitish-rule-today/articleshow/87875285.cms||Ramashankar

The incident happened merely 11days after the Maoists killed four members of a family under Dumaria block in neighbouring Gaya district on November 13 night. According to sources, the Maoists planted explosives from all four sides of the ‘panchayat sarkar bhawan’ of Dakshin Umra panchayat and blew it up, damaging the building badly. After that, they attacked a cellphone tower located next to the panchayat building and set it on fire. The generator set of the tower was destroyed. It was the first Maoist incident after the announcement of panchayat elections in the district. The Maoists had also planted an IED probably to target the police force. But the police discovered the IED, which was defused later by the bomb disposal squad. Sources said the IED was powerful. Aurangabad superintendent of police (SP) Kantesh Kumar Mishra said two Maoist banners had been recovered from the spot. “As per the message written on the banners, the Maoists carried out this operation in protest against the encounter in Sukma and the arrest of Jharkhand’s top Maoist commander Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da and his wife Sheela Marandi,” he said. “The entire area has been sealed and raids are on to trace the Maoists. We have also sought cooperation from neighbouring districts in this regard,” the SP added. Both Bose and his wife were arrested in a joint operation conducted by the Jharkhand Police and CRPF. In response to their arrests, the Maoist groups have announced three days of Bharat Bandh from Monday to Thursday. An IANS report quoted locals as saying that the Maoists threatened them to keep silent. “Though we informed the police about the presence of the Maoists, the security forces did not come apprehending ambush,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-blow-up-panchayat-bldg-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87875323.cms||---

This will coincide with events organized by the JD(U) the same day to celebrate “Sushashan ke 15 saal bemisaal’ of chief minister Nitish’s government. RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh said the party had been waiting for its founder to light the massive lantern, which is its poll symbol. “This will bring lights in the lives of people of Bihar who are staying in the dark era under chief minister Nitish Kumar,” he said. When asked, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan denied that November 24 was intentionally chosen to coincide the event with that of the JD(U). “We were waiting for our party’s founder to first light the lantern, which has been made of stones brought from Jaipur. Its foundation was completed on Sunday only and the final touches are being given so that to get it ready by tonight,” said Gagan, adding that CNG, instead of oil, will be used to keep it burning. Lalu returned to Patna on Monday night to appear before the CBI court in a fodder scam case. Sources said after the lantern lighting event, he is expected to return to Delhi Wednesday night. Meanwhile, RJD attacked CM Nitish and his ‘15 saal bemisaal’ event. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, tweeted that he would tell Nitish how, when and where jobs have to be given to youths in Bihar. “Bihar does not need your narrow-minded and conservative thoughts,” Tejashwi wrote. Reacting to his tweet, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said Tejashwi was just reading or tweeting the scripts which his master Manoj Jha was writing. “Tejashwi has no experience of running a government or managing his party organization. He just goes by what he is told by Jha,” said Nishad. He further said Bihar’s development under CM Nitish had been lauded by people of national and international fame and the state was in the race of coming in the category of developed ones. “RJD is blind to the development works in the state during the 15 years of the Nitish government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-set-to-light-6-tonne-lantern-at-rjd-office/articleshow/87875350.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Vijayawada||AP: Kondapalli civic chief told not to delay polls||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Tuesday expressed displeasure at the Kondapalli municipal commissioner for delaying the election of municipal chairperson and vice chairpersons. The municipal commissioner, who is also the returning officer for the election, postponed the election twice due to unruly behaviour of YSRC councillors. The high court directed the returning officer to conduct the election on Wednesday and the Vijayawada police commissioner to provide security to the petitioners till completion of the voting process. The TDP members including Vijayawada MP, Kesineni Srinivas who is an ex-officio member, moved the high court with a lunch motion petition for urgent hearing. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, N Ashwani Kumar told the high court that the returning officer postponed the election against the rules to favour the ruling party. He said the returning officer cannot postpone the election once the process has been initiated. The proceedings issued by him are unsustainable in law and such proceedings are issued only to circumvent the directions issued by the high court to allow Kesineni Srinivas to vote as ex-officio member. Considering the arguments of Ashwani Kumar, Justice D Ramesh summoned the municipal commissioner and the Vijayawada police commissioner to be present before the court post lunch. Justice Ramesh posed several questions to the municipal commissioner, Sivanarayana Reddy, and in-charge police commissioner G Palaraju. The high court asked how many times the election would be postponed if unruly behaviour continued in the council hall. He asked what steps have been taken to control members from disrupting the voting process. Justice Ramesh directed the Election Commission to grant permission to the returning officer for conducting election on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kondapalli-civic-chief-told-not-to-delay-polls/articleshow/87875981.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Chaos prevailed inside the council hall with YSRC members raising slogans against MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) who came to vote as an ex-officio member. TDP members along with Nani reached the municipal council hall in the morning. YSRC members reached the venue along with Mylavaram MLA Vasantha Krishna Prasad. YSRC members allegedly argued with the presiding officer and destroyed the furniture as soon as the election officer started the head count. They walked out of the hall shouting slogans against the TDP. Nani urged the election officer to continue the election as a majority was present in the House. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu condemned the deferral, stating, “It is an utter failure of the SEC and the DGP. Outsiders, mainly YSRC activists, are entering the council hall and arguing with our members.

---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Worst may be over, farm fire impact likely to ease||NEW DELHI: The single-day contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 went as high as 48%, but experts said the impact of farm fires is predicted to remain low now. Data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) shows that the share of stubble burning has been below 10% since November 16, and it was just 3% on Tuesday. A senior official, who wished not to be named, said, “As the fire counts are continuously coming down, its impact on Delhi’s PM2.5 is likely to be negligible now. SAFAR data shows that it remained below 10% in the last week of November 2020 also.” The fire count was 770 on Tuesday. L S Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “While the farm fires typically subside around mid-November, this year observed a delay by 4-5 days (especially in Punjab) due to the delayed harvest on account of delayed monsoon withdrawal.” Gufran Beig, founding project director, SAFAR, said, “Now, stubble burning impact period is towards its fag end and fog impacting session will pick up.” SAFAR data shows that effective fire counts were 64,881 in November so far. SAFAR calculates the effective fire counts of four states—Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Another analysis done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water of NASA’s NRT VIIRS 375m satellite, said, this year Punjab and Haryana (combined) reported a total of 86,004 farm fires, the highest since 2016. However, the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space Laboratory, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), said a total of 89,162 burning events were detected in six states between September 15 and November 23, 2021, which are distributed as 71,181; 6,792; 3,376; 4; 1,222 and 6,587 in Punjab, Haryana, UP, Delhi, Rajasthan and MP, respectively. Meanwhile, the data of different satellites of fire counts vary depending on their methodology and resolution. VK Sehgal, professor and principal scientist, IARI, said, “The data varies depending on the special resolution of the satellite. It also depends on the channel used by the satellite to detect or estimate land surface temperature and also depends on an algorithm to detect temperature difference of a location with respect to surrounding.” Kurinji added, “For the next season, the priority should be on promoting the uptake of short-duration varieties and incentivising farmers to transition away from paddy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/worst-may-be-over-farm-fire-impact-likely-to-ease/articleshow/87876813.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Tomato, a key kitchen staple, has skyrocketed to Rs 70 per kg, while other vegetables are also seeing a sudden spurt in prices. “It has been continuously raining without any signs of abatement. Besides the crop in the fields getting ruined, even the harvested crop being transported to Goa is getting damp due to moisture,” Jaffar Mokashi, a vegetable vendor at Panaji market, said. It is learnt that vegetable prices have shot up because states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, from where vegetables are sourced by vendors in Goa, are flooded by unseasonal rain. This has in turn damaged crops, said managing director (MD) of Goa Horticulture Corporation, Sandip Faldesai. He said that the greens grown during monsoon are to be harvested soon, however, unseasonal rains have wreaked havoc resulting in large-scale damage. “Now it will require at least another three months for the new crops to be ready. Since the prices have risen significantly, people will have to learn to ration the veggies,” he added. Two days ago, the rate of tomato was Rs 42-48 per kg, which now has increased to Rs 68, while that of ladyfingers have risen as well. Lady fingers were selling at Rs 54 per kg, up from Rs 28 per kg two days ago. Carrots which were sold last week for Rs 38 per kg are now priced at Rs 48. The current retail price of cluster beans is Rs Rs 57 while that of French beans is 65. However, the rate of peas, onion and potato has slightly dropped, informed an owner of a vegetable outlet near Bhatpal, South Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tomatoes-at-rs-rs-s-70/kg-other-veggies-too-see-price-hike/articleshow/87876805.cms||---

But even after a month, civic authorities have failed to complete the task in Lucknow. A quick reality check by TOI found that roads are still in a bad shape in many areas such as Mahanagar, Nishatganj, Indiranagar, Gomtinagar, Aashiana, LDA Colony, Telibagh, Aliganj, Indiranagar, Vikasnagar, Jankipuram, Chowk, Rakabganj and localities on Sultanpur Road, Kanpur Road, Hardoi Road and Sitapur Road Agencies which have jurisdiction on these roads include Lucknow Municipal Corporation, Lucknow Development Authority and public works department. TOI spoke to several residents who described the problems and dangers these bad roads pose. Deepika Sharma of Gomtinagar recalled she met with an accident on a potholed road. “All the roads near Kathauta Lake are dotted with craters. A few days ago, I lost my balance while driving a two-wheeler and got hurt badly,” she said. Dr Abhishek Raichandani, who commutes between Polytechnic Crossing and Chinhat daily, said, “The potholes near Awadh Bus Stand seem to be the deadliest when the situation gets mixed with the beeps and horns of the heavy traffic.” Indiranagar resident Anju Singh, who developed backache while travelling on bad roads, said, “Even though my kids drive slowly when I am in the car, there are so many potholes in the area that can’t avoid them.” Mahanagar resident Ajay Kukar complained that shockers of his bike got damaged because of bumpy rides on roads in the area. Riya Singh, a resident of LDA Colony, said, “The condition has deteriorated to the level that now only dust is visible as the entire concrete surface has eroded.” “Driving on roads in Telibagh is a back-breaking journey,” said Madhur, a resident.

A key source in the state health and family welfare department said, “Due to a misunderstanding, the Supreme Court got the wrong impression about the compensation process for families of Covid-19 victims. However, after the Supreme Court directions, the state government has decided release compensation to the families of over 10,000 victims whose medical records are available with the government.” Officials said the government will also provide financial assistance to those who died within a month of their RT-PCR report showing Covid-19 positive. “There might be cases where such persons got themselves treated at private hospitals and records of such deaths may not be available with the government. “The state government will provide compensation to all those who died within a month of being found to have Covid-19 through an RT-PCR test or even if a registered doctor certified the death as being due to Covid-19,” said a source. The Supreme Court raised serious concerns and commented that the chief minister and state administration may not be taking its directions seriously. A bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna had on November 18 observed that the constitution of the scrutiny committee appeared to be an attempt to overreach directions passed by the apex court to give compensation to the families of the Covid-19 victims in the state. The apex court also reprimanded top officials of the state health and family welfare department for their poorly drafted submission to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-sc-rap-gujarat-to-pay-covid-ex-gratia-to-10k-families/articleshow/87876118.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Centre hails Uttar Pradesh government for clearing maximum pleas for aid to Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: The central government on Tuesday lauded the Uttar Pradesh women and child welfare ministry for disposing of maximum number of applications for financial aid to children who lost their parents to Covid-19. In a review meeting conducted via video conferencing, secretary, Union ministry of women and child development (WCD), Indevar Pandey said UP was at the bottom of the list with just 21 approvals last Tuesday but made a giant leap by taking the total to 346 within a week. According to WCD officials, UP stood first in clearing maximum number of applications followed by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Under the central government’s PM-CARES for Children Scheme, a Covid-19 orphan child will get a monthly stipend on turning 18 and Rs 10 lakh on reaching the age of 23, besides getting free education, health insurance and financial support for uniform, books, and notebooks. “We have cleared 346 cases of Covid orphans who lost both their parents. Every document was scrutinized at various levels,” said director, WCD, Manoj Rai. Total 577 applications were received for PM-CARES aid across the state. After detailed scrutiny by CWCs and district magistrates of all 75 districts, 346 applications were approved while 23 cases are still waiting for clearance at CWC level. According to WCD, maximum applications were received from Lucknow (36) and Kanpur Nagar (27). At least 23 applications were cleared in Lucknow, 22 in Kanpur Nagar, 16 in Ghaziabad, 14 in Meerut, 13 in Prayagraj, 12 each in Aligarh and Barabanki, and 11 each in Faizabad and Gorakhpur. “Over 200 applications were rejected as the applicants were not eligible. PMCARES Scheme does not cover orphans who don’t have proof of Covid-19 death. Certificates or proof of both the deceased parents are required for the central government aid,” the director said. According to WCD, an orphan who turned 19 but was 18 years’ old when his parents succumbed to coronavirus infection will also be eligible under the scheme if he/ she has documents to prove. “We expect that figure of PM-CARES aid recipients will rise as there are many orphans who have turned 19 years but were below 18 when their parents succumbed. We have asked them to contact the district probation office to apply under the scheme,” said deputy director, WCD, Vijendra Singh Niranjan. Orphans who have lost both parents will receive financial aid from the state as well as Centre. The government will provide the monthly stipend of Rs 4,000 per child till he or she turns 18. The state will also fund their higher education and provide tablets to them when they appear for Class 10 Board examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centre-hails-state-govt-for-clearing-max-pleas-for-aid-to-covid-orphans/articleshow/87876847.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Ahmedabad||Classes 1 to 5: Attendance jumps to 35% on Day Two||Ahmedabad: Student attendance at government schools for Classes 1 to 5 more than doubled in one day for in-person studies, data from the state education department shows. For the 32,978 such schools of the state, attendance was 34.96% for Class 1 to Class 5 on Tuesday. Of the 33,15,262 students in these classes at government schools, 11,59,160 were present, after schools reopened for Classes 1 to 5 students on Monday after more than 19 months. The highest attendance was in Navsari district, 56.4% of 51,722 29,173 students in these classes remained present on Tuesday. Of all the districts, the lowest attendance was in Gandhinagar, with 28.6% of 74,235 attending school on the second day. In Ahmedabad district, 34.29% or 35,010 of 1,02,103 students attended in-person class. The state government, in a sudden move on Sunday, announced that school for Classes 1 to 5 would reopen on Monday, immediately after the Diwali vacations ended on November 21. Parents and schools were left with very little time to prepare, as parents need to submit consent letters to schools before sending children for in-person studies. At the 465 schools run by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, just 15.5% of such students or 15,956 of 1,02,855 turned up at class on Tuesday. According to the state government’s Covid-19 guidelines, schools can only have 50% of the total class strength present on any given day. The new session for schools began on November 22 for all classes and this was one of the reasons for the government’s decision to restart in-person teaching for Classes 1 to 5 as well. The falling number of Covid cases also was a factor in the decision. Self-financed schools in the state are expected to reopen over the next few days after getting consent letters from parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/classes-1-to-5-attendance-jumps-to-35-on-day-two/articleshow/87876123.cms||---
---||Meerut||ATR has 27 tigers but space for 20, count may rise in fresh census||Bijnor: Amangarh forests, a buffer zone of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, had 13 tigers in 2012, when it was notified as a reserve. In the 2020 census, the tiger count had gone up to 27. Foresters believe that the tiger census, now underway, is most likely to reveal a further rise in numbers. The space is shrinking and territorial wars among the striped big cats is inevitable. Experts have suggested that more areas be declared as reserve forest to curb the cat fights and avert man-tiger conflict. Hari Singh, Bijnor sub divisional forest officer, said, "Tigers are thriving here as there is a large prey base. But we are worried about these territorial fights. The reserve has a capacity to accommodate 20 big cats as against 27.” Spanning a 95-sq km area of forests, teak plantations, grasslands and wetlands comprising over 12 waterholes and Pili Dam, and a rich prey base of herbivores – Amangarh is just right for tigers and leopards, said Saleel Shukla, Bijnor's retired divisional forest officer (DFO) and wildlife expert. “Over the past couple of years, the rise in tiger numbers has resulted in leopards being pushed out of forests into sugarcane fields. They in turn pose a threat to the farmers,”said Shukla. “Ideally, a tigress needs a 10-sq km area as it has cubs to take care of whereas a tiger can settle for a minimum 5 to 6 sq km territory provided there is an abundant prey base. At the same time, tigers are known to travel long distances, covering a 100-sq km area,” said Shukla. While the tiger count is rising, forest grasslands that support the prey base of herbivores are shrinking, so big cat fights are inevitable, said the former DFO. “It is necessary that the area of the ATR be extended,"added Shukla. M Semmaran, former Bijnor DFO, said, “Due to lack of space, tigers are creating their own territory . They have been spotted in a forested stretch between Kalagarh and Najibabad area. I hope tigers will create their own territory in the forest area adjacent to ATR. In addition, there is no boundary between ATR and Corbett. Big cats may migrate to Corbett, too.” A forest officer said the forest grasslands are shrinking due to encroachments by the pastoral Van Gujjars and farmers. He estimated that around 1,000 hectare of forest land has been lost. Not just leopards, tigers will also enter human territory in future, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/atr-has-27-tigers-but-space-for-20-count-may-rise-in-fresh-census/articleshow/87876111.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Ahmedabad||Bounties of Monsoon: Cash crop yields to soar||Ahmedabad: The prospects of cash crop production in Gujarat have improved with the revival of the monsoon in September. Although excessive rain did pose some challenges and affected crops in some parts of the state, initial estimates suggest an increase in production of groundnut, sugar cane and castor in 2021-22. However, more clarity will emerge as the season progresses in days to come. Sugar cane production seen up 10% Sugar cane production in Gujarat is expected to increase by about 10% in 2021-22 season. The sugar cane production in the state is likely to reach 112 lakh metric tonnes in 2021-22 as compared to 102 lakh tonne in 2020-21, shows estimates prepared by Gujarat State Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories (GSFCSF). “Sugar cane production is estimated to rise by 10% due to higher acreage and improved yield following a favourable climatic condition for sugar cane crop,” said Mansinh Patel, former chairman, GSFCSF. Several paddy farmers also opted for sugar cane crop this year as they had received less prices of paddy, said market players. The area under sugar cane cultivation surged to 1.53 lakh hectares in 2021-22 from 1.27 lakh hectares in the previous season. About 106 lakh tonnes of cane is expected to be crushed by sugar factories this year as against 98 lakh tonnes last year. Out of the total 13 function sugar factories in Gujarat have already begun crushing sugar cane for the current season. Groundnut production pegged at 33-38 lakh tonnes Despite are reduction in area under groundnut cultivation in Gujarat this kharif season, groundnut production across the state is estimated to rise with per hectare yield expected to increase due to the timely revival of monsoon. Gujarat is likely to harvest 33 lakh to 38 lakh tonnes of groundnut in 2021-22, shows estimates by different trade bodies. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA), a national-level body of vegetable oil industry, has estimated that the output at 38.55 lakh tonnes in 2021-22, which is nearly up by by 8.74% compared to 35.45 lakh tonnes last year. “The production is up mainly due to normal to excessive rainfall during August and Sept and there was no report of crop damage,” the association said in its recent crop survey. Average yield per hectare is likely to go up to 2,020 kg as compared to 1,715 kg last year. According to the state agriculture department, the groundnut acreage in Gujarat declined by 7.51% to 19.10 lakh hectares in this kharif season from 20.65 lakh hectares last year. Meanwhile, Gujarat State Edible Oils and Oil Seeds Association (SEOOSA) has estimated the state’s groundnut output at 33.44 lakh tonne in 2021-22 from 32 lakh tonne in 2020-21. The state government’s first advance estimate has pegged the oilseed’s production at 39.94 lakh tonnes. Cotton production estimated between 90-97 lakh bales Although the cotton acreage in Gujarat remained a tad lower than last year, the production of the natural fibre is likely to hover around 96.9 lakh bales (one bale weighs 170 kg) in 2021-22 as compared to 91.5 lakh bales in 2020-21, shows the preliminary estimates released by the Cotton Association of India (CAI), an apex body of cotton trade in the country. CAI will re-assess the crop scenario as the season progresses. Gujarat’s cotton output estimate also includes cotton procured from outside the state and ginned within Gujarat. However, Saurashtra Cotton Ginners Association (SCGA) does not expect much improvement in cotton production due to damage caused to the crop due to heavy rains in September. “Given the current scenario, we expect that Gujarat’s crop will be around 90 lakh bales as against 92 lakh bales. In best case scenario, it will remain the same as last year,” added Arvind Pan, president, Saurashtra Cotton Ginners Association(SCGA). Gujarat’s own production, according to the state agriculture department’s first advance estimate, will be 80.95 lakh hectares. Gujarat’s cotton acreage declined to 22.51 lakh hectares this kharif season from 23 lakh hectares last year, according to state government data. Castor production to improve at 14 lakh tonnes State agriculture department’s first advance estimate for kharif crops this year has pegged castor seed production in Gujarat at 14.08 lakh tonnes on an acreage of 6.30 lakh hectares. The state’s castor production had remained at 13.46 lakh tonnes and acreage was 6.51 lakh hectares in 2020-21, according to the state government data. Meanwhile, industry players opined that castor seed production will be more or less the same as last year. “When rains got stalled this year, there were fears that castor acreage and production would take a hit. However, revival of the monsoon in September improved the crop prospects. The castor crop will reach the same level seen last year,” said a member of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA), which had estimated a castor crop 14.94 lakh tonnes in 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bounties-of-monsoon-cash-crop-yields-to-soar/articleshow/87897874.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Quietly but steadily, the Gadchiroli police is learnt to be shifting focus on south Gadchiroli which is also a gateway to the Maoist stronghold Abhujmadh or commonly known as ‘Madh’ spread across the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border. The arrests of the senior most woman leader Narmada in the past and the latest encounter of Teltumbde on November 13 has now left another seasoned leader Tarakka and Sonu alias Bhupathi at the forefront to lead the armed rebellion in Gadchiroli and other parts of central India. The middle-tier Maoists leaders of Gadchiroli comprises a combination of young and experienced fighters like Girdhar, Raghu, Rupesh and Laxman in south Gadchiroli. Apart from the knowledge of the terrain and well adept in guerilla warfare, these middle-tiered leadership also commands respect of the local masses in south Gadchiroli. Though with repeated encounters, Gadchiroli police have managed to leave the military formation of Maoists’ Company number four almost debilitated in the north Gadchiroli, they are yet to make a dent on Company number 10 unit of the rebels in the south. It’s learnt Company number 10 is entrusted with the protection of Abhujmadh and operates on its border along the limits of Maharashtra. According to an official, the 200-km long stretch of the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border which is also shared by Abhujmadh is critical for Maharashtra. “Following instructions of the Central government, the stress would be on the inter-state operations along the borders to stop Maoists from infiltrating into different states to avoid police action,” said an official. “It is impossible to seal borders but repeated operations along the border regions would discourage Maoists from entering into a state whose security forces are constantly targeting them,” he said. “In 2018, the Maoists had suffered an unprecedented setback in Kasnasoor and Boriya with 40 of them getting neutralized in south Gadchiroli. Police would return with more strength to tackle the rebels in the south,” said an official source. It’s learnt Maoists leaders like Tarakka and Laxman had addressed meetings at three places at different villages along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border post the Mardintola encounter where Teltumbde was neutralized. The leaders had admitted overwhelming operational strength and prowess of the police and vowed to take them by surprise with a fresh strategy. SP Ankit Goyal said there is no room for complacency after having neutralized 27 cadres in north Gadchiroli. “We have already intensified our civic actions for the masses with the different schemes, projects and programmes. Parallelly, the operational pressures too would be equally maintained. The strategy remains the same for the police and so the pressure is maintained on the rebels,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mission-madh-for-gadchiroli-police-down-south/articleshow/87876842.cms||Soumitra Bose

An animal welfare activist from Deesa town of Banaskantha district, Dharmendra Fofai, has requested the high court to direct the authorities to implement various guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. The guidelines relate to the constitution of a state-level committee and the closure of illegal slaughterhouses in the interest of public health and environment. He has demanded the closure of illegal abattoirs in the state under various laws including the Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2011. According to the petitioner, only six licences have been issued by the state government to run slaughterhouses, and the rest are running illegally. Through his counsel Asim Pandya, the petitioner has urged the court to direct the government to close slaughterhouses, meat shops, and restaurants functioning in violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and other laws. He has also sought criminal and legal action against errant slaughterhouses, meat shops, restaurants, and poultry farms. The PIL demanded the enforcement of transport rules under the amended laws. The petitioner has demanded that the laws be followed in the management and disposal of slaughterhouse wastage. For proper enforcement, the PIL insisted on following the procedure as adopted by the government by constituting a state-level committee and district-level committees, which can regulate the affairs. The petitioner has sought the direction for the appointment of a retired district judge as the convenor of the state-level committee on slaughterhouses, which was ordered by the apex court. He has also asked for the formation of district committees under district collectors in accordance with a 2014 resolution passed by the state-level committee. There is also a demand for the appointment of two prominent persons in the state-level committee. The PIL has urged the HC to seek an action-taken report on the implementation of court orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/illegal-slaughterhouses-pil-spurs-notice-from-hc/articleshow/87876127.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Law student ends life over domestic violence||KOCHI: Law student Mofiya Parveen (21), allegedly committed suicide in Aluva over the domestic violence she suffered at her husband’s home. The Edayapuram resident was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home on Monday night. A suicide note recovered from her room said that she had to endure mental torture from her husband, Suhail, and his family. The note also alleged denial of justice and sought action against inspector CL Sudheer of Aluva East police station where she had filed a complaint against Suhail. Her family alleged that he verbally abused Mofiya in front of her husband and father when they were called to the station in connection with the domestic violence complaint she had filed a month ago. “Pappa, sorry. Please forgive me. You were right. He is not a genuine person. He portrayed me as a mentally-ill person. I can’t bear this pain anymore. Pappa, my soul will be here. Suhail and his parents are criminals. Action must be taken against them and the CI. This is my final wish,” she wrote. District police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick removed Sudheer from the post of Aluva East SHO. He was the investigation officer in Uthra murder case and was transferred to Aluva as a punishment for his unprofessional behaviour during investigation. A probe was launched under the direct supervision of Aluva deputy SP; police registered a case for suicide abetment against Suhail and family. Sources said Mofiya and Suhail got acquainted on Facebook and married in April this year. Her family alleged that Suhail, who convinced them that he was working in the Middle East, said that he did not want dowry. Two months after their marriage, Suhail and his parents allegedly started harassing her in the name of dowry. Her father Dilshad K Salim alleged that Suhail even asked him to pay Rs 40 lakhs as he wanted to produce a film. As he did not agree, Suhail harassment rose. “He tarnished Mofiya’s image in front of her relatives saying that she had mental issues. As the situation worsened, Mofiya filed a domestic violence complaint with the district police chief a month ago that was redirected to Aluva deputy SP office. A few days later I received a call from Alangad police,” Salim said. He alleged that police did not take action until Monday morning, when Sudheer asked Mofiya and her father to give their statements. But it turned into a ‘compromise’ talk as Suhail and his parents too came. Police hadn’t even registered a case based on her complaint. “During discussion, the inspector verbally abused me and Mofiya. He asked me how much dowry I had given to Suhail. When she saw Suhail and her parents, she asked why they were here and the inspector continued harassing us,” Salim said, adding that his daughter was opposed to dowry. Salim said the incident shook her and she locked herself in her room after returning home. As she did not respond to their knocks on the door, they looked through the window and found her hanging. Women’s commission too sought an explanation from Aluva deputy SP as Mofiya had approached it earlier. Youth Congress held a protest march to Aluva police station. The march turned violent and police had to use water cannons to disperse protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/harassment-law-student-ends-life/articleshow/87876856.cms||---

The department said that universities should be shouldered the responsibility of the electioneering process. The elections, which were last conducted in 2019, are held every September. Owing to Covid-induced restrictions, the polls could not be held for the past two years in the universities.

Meanwhile, a massive protest was held by students at Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University (HNBGU) on Tuesday. The students demanded that the convocation, which is scheduled to be held on December 1, should be held only after the student union elections are held and results of all exams declared. The protests intensified as some of the students even climbed the gate and started raising slogans at the VC office as well. Later, officials, including the VC, had to meet students in order to pacify them but students rejected their proposal and have given an ultimatum till November 25 to address their grievances. The students further said that if the university doesn’t come up with a proper solution, they will intensify the protest and oppose the convocation as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/student-polls-higher-education-dept-wants-varsities-to-shoulder-responsibility/articleshow/87875433.cms||Mohammad Anab

Chairman of the state board Sharad Gosavi said that the government will decide the mode of examination within a week. As for those students who have not received any marks in Std IX and XI, but were declared promoted as per the state’s order, and were not able to fill up SSC and HSC exam forms, Gosavi said that the board has requested the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training as well as Directorate of Secondary education to resolve the issue. “We have sent a proposal for offline examination to the state board. Now, it is up to them to decide. We expect a reply this week, post which we will declare the date sheet for the board exams,” he said. There has also been a demand from some organisations on the waiver of the SSC and HSC examination fees. However, the state board said that they had not received any such letter. “We have empathy for students who have lost their parents to Covid-19. But there can be many other students who come from extremely poor backgrounds. Hence, we cannot take a biased decision. If they send a letter, we will put it up to the higher authorities and seek directions,” a state board official said. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of the headmasters’ forum of the state, said that the schools were unable to fill the examination forms of students who had been shown just “promoted” in Stds IX and XI. Gosavi, who acknowledged the problem, said that they are expecting a solution from SCERT and the directorate of secondary education within two days as the state board only governs examination for SSC and HSC and no other classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/board-likely-to-declare-dates-of-ssc-hsc-exams-in-a-week/articleshow/87876129.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: SSKM set to start ID dept at Sambhunath Pandit||KOLKATA: Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) could soon be churning out infectious disease (ID) specialists. To set the ball rolling Bengal’s prestigious multispeciality hospital, popularly known as SSKM, has created an ID department at its annexe unit Sambhunath Pandit Hospital (SNPH). Two ID specialist doctors have already been posted. “For the first time, IPGMER has created the ID department. This was the first step to run an academic course in this speciality. We aim to run a 60-bedded ward that will take care of all types of infectious diseases and start DM course in ID,” said IPGMER director Manimoy Banerjee. The course is a three-year post-doctoral programme in infectious diseases. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought forth the scarcity of infectious diseases specialists across the country. Earlier School of Tropical Medical Kolkata had applied for starting this curriculum. While the National Medical Council has already inspected the facility at STM, the medical institute is yet to get the nod. IPGMER will be aiming to create four DM seats to begin with. Being the busiest multispecialty hospital in the state, IPGMER gets patients suffering from a spectrum of diseases and has transplant facilities. Health experts said IPGMER will provide a learning ground for doctors who would be trained in infectious diseases. Currently India has only a couple of institutes — AIIMS New Delhi and Christian Medical College Vellore — that produce ID specialists. Two ID specialists — Yogiraj Ray and Ayan Basu — have already been detailed at IPGMER. The two doctors have started looking after the Covid-ICU at SNPH along with other cases of infectious diseases. “These two DMs in infectious diseases have already joined us. We have submitted our proposal for post creation. Once that is sanctioned by departments including finance, we can call for more faculty members,” said the IPGMER director. Apart from Ray, Basu there are at least three more AIIMS-trained ID specialists who are currently working in Kolkata that include Sayantan Banerjee attached with ID Hospital Beliaghata, Soumyadip Chatterji and Sayan Chakraborty both attached with two different private hospitals. “IPGMER would be an institute that would give a good exposure to students on all perspective of infectious diseases,” said Ray who is an assistant professor. Sources at IPGEM indicated that the institute might require two more faculty members to run the department and teach students. Apart from these five, sources said that a couple of such AIIMS pass out specialists from Bengal are working in other states. During the pandemic the state government had expressed the need to churn out more specialists and expand treatment facility to other hospitals as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sskm-set-to-start-id-dept-at-sambhunath-pandit/articleshow/87876134.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ISC evaluation centres shut as glitch hits upload process||KOLKATA: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations asked schools to “close” the centres for evaluation on Tuesday after marks could not be uploaded post evaluation due to technical glitches in the Council’s Online Marks Capture System. Schools tried to upload marks after evaluating answer scripts of ISC examinees the entire Tuesday evening, but multiple attempts to upload failed with screens showing “errors”. The Council circular that reached schools finally read, “The Online Marks Capture System has become unresponsive. You may close the Centre for Evaluation for today. You shall be informed once the technical issue is resolved.” The circular also said that the answer script packets should be stored following the procedure for “short duration storage.” The glitch held up examiners despite the measures taken by the Council on Tuesday to ease the load and make the process faster after Monday’s complaints of delay that held up examiners even upto 2am on Tuesday. In many city schools, the evaluation process started at 4.30pm and went on till well past midnight. Examiners, mostly women, found it difficult to get transport to return home. A circular announcing the changes reached school heads before the English language exam started on Tuesday, bringing much relief. The Council reduced the number of papers each examiner had to evaluate from Tuesday. Instead of 35, each examiner had to evaluate 20 scripts. The Council also allowed invigilators to work as additional examiners in an exam centre. On Tuesday St Xavier’s Collegiate School got 11 examiners instead of six. The additional five were inducted from invigilators, said principal Father Thamacin Arulappan. At The Heritage School there were four more examiners. “Yesterday, we had six examiners, today we had 10 for 208 candidates of our school,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys. Students were happy with the question paper. “I found it easy. In fact, after yesterday, the tension has eased off,” said Zishan Qamar, a student of St Augustine’s Shyamnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isc-evaluation-centres-shut-as-glitch-hits-upload-process/articleshow/87876156.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: KGMU performs record 1,035 corneal transplants this year||LUCKNOW: The ophthalmology department of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has achieved the milestone of conducting over 1,000 corneal transplants in a year. The feat, attained in 10 months, is almost double of the transplants done last year. Till October 31, KGMU’s eye bank, run under the ophthalmology department, conducted 1,035 transplants despite challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. This means that doctors were successful in providing sight to more than 1,000 visually impaired people, bringing joy to their families. Data also shows that there has been a steady increase in corneal transplants by the department – from 20 in 2016 to about 367 in 2017, around 707 in 2018 and about 767 in 2019. The number, however, dropped to 598 in 2020 because of the hurdles created by the pandemic. The record growth has been made possible by two factors – increase in eye donation due to awareness among people and efficiency in cornea retrieval and transplantation by the KGMU’s ophthalmology department. The 1,000th transplant was performed on a 56-year-old woman from Gonda, who was suffering from retinopathy. “She had lost her eyesight due to retinopathy triggered by diabetes nearly two years ago. On the test, we found that her optic nerves were functioning and she had a sense of light and darkness,” said Prof Arun Kumar, faculty at the ophthalmology department and director of KGMU eye bank. “The transplant was performed nearly a month ago and her sight has started to come back,” he added. “As of now, we get an operation theatre for transplant for a day in a week in which we take up 3-4 cases. With dedicated OT and increase in staff, we can conduct procedures thrice a week, benefitting at least 8-10 patients,” he said. Honour donation pledge of kin: DocsWith 1,401 donations already made this year so far, KGMU is recording impressive growth in cornea donation over the year. However, experts insist it is not enough. “Though there has been a rise in donations over the years, it is not enough because demand is huge. We not only transplant corneas at our centre, but also provide them to other government medical institutions,” said director eye bank Prof Arun Kumar. People can call 24x7 at 1919 or 6390826826 for cornea donation. It is important for the families to honour the eye donation pledge of their relatives after death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-performs-record-1035-corneal-transplants-this-yr/articleshow/87876861.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Aurangabad||Whimbrel spotted at Jayakwadi||Aurangabad: In what is claimed to be the first sighting, whimbrel, a migratory shorebird, has been spotted at the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary, sparking excitement among bird lovers. Known for its distinctive decurved bill, the bird breeds in Europe among a few other parts of the world and comes to India during the winter. Kishor Pathak, the honorary wildlife warden, who spotted the whimbrel along with birders Pratik Joshi and Anand Paranjape recently, said, there has been no record of spotting the bird concerned at the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary in past. “Whimbrels are one of the most widespread curlews that come to India during the winter. This greyish brown middle-sized bird feeds by probing soft mud and picks up invertebrates, aquatic insects and small crabs found in water bodies,” he said. Found mingling with other shorebirds, whimbrel also has a distinctive call, which is a long series of shrill whistles. Scientifically named Numenius phaeopus, whimbrel is listed as ‘least concerned’ under IUCN red list. “Even if categorised as the ‘least concerned’, the population of whimbrel is declining due to shrinking habitats among other threats. At the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary where the bird was spotted, the habitat was encroached on by nets of the fishermen,” Pathak said. Officially notified as a bird sanctuary in 1986, the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is spread over 341.05 sq km and is home to many local and migratory birds. The current winter season is the migratory season of the birds, who arrive at the sanctuary from different parts of the country, as well as from abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/whimbrel-spotted-at-jayakwadi/articleshow/87874800.cms||---

The ERSU will consist of four civic body officials and a team of ‘sewerage commando’ who will attend only to rescue calls of sanitation workers in any emergency situation. One of the guidelines in Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013, was setting up of ERSU in any municipal body having 1 lakh population. “Each ward in the city will have an ERSU which will consist of a deputy city engineer as the nodal officer, assistant city engineer as the ward officer, assistant engineer as ward sub-officer, technical supervisor as the ward in-charge, and it will have a team of trained sewerage entry professional or sewerage commandos,” an AMC official said. “Following the guidelines of setting up ERSU in the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act 2013, the state Urban Development and Urban Housing Department in a circular dated April 28, 2021 had directed civic bodies to set up these units. AMC, the largest civic body in the state, has become the first civic authority in the state to set up this team. We expect other municipal corporations and smaller civic bodies to create such units as soon as possible,” said Parsottam Vaghela, director of Manav Garima Trust, an organisation working for the rights of manhole workers.  He said that the unit is a rapid response rescue team like fire brigade specially meant to rescue manhole workers in emergency situations, like the Bopal incident recently. The official said that there are 1,200 sanitation workers on payroll or the civic body who are being trained as sewerage commandos. “These trained workers will be deployed as ERSU commandos who will carry out rescue operations if need arises. They will be given all rescue gears necessary for such operations,” said the official. Safety gears such as respirators with oxygen apparatus, safety lines with harness, gumshoes, hand gloves etc. The official said the ERSU will report to and will be answerable to the Responsible Sanitary Authority (RSA). “RSA is headed by deputy municipal commissioner of the zone, and consists of a zonal additional city engineer and deputy city engineer,” the official said. Vaghela added that the sewerage entry professionals should be trained in the same way as fire department personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/emergency-response-sanitation-unit-set-up/articleshow/87876178.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Swedish diplomats also stressed on innovation and cooperation between entities from their country and India. “At the recent EU-India summit in Portugal, the two parties agreed to resume negotiations regarding the free trade agreement, with a number of issues to be resolved on both ends, such as tariffs or the free movement of labour. I feel that India has not felt the benefits of its previous free trade agreements with others, especially when it comes to balance of trade,” Molin said during a discussion with reporters. “However, there is a new impetus in the direction, and Sweden will certainly benefit in case of a free trade agreement (FTA) between India and the EU, as Sweden is reliant on trade,” Molin said. Molin, as well as Anna Lekvall, Swedish consul-general in Mumbai, and Sara Larsson, head of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in India, were in Pune as a part of a series of interactions with Swedish companies operating in the region. Pune and its surroundings are a hub of m anufacturing operations for prominent Swedish companies across segments such as heavy engineering, industrial tools, packaging and telecommunications with many centred around the Pimpri-Chinchwad and Chakan belt. Among the firms are Atlas Copco, Alfa Laval, Tetra Pak and Ericsson. Molin, Lekvall and Larsson also released a sustainability study and business climate survey, conducted among Swedish companies in the region. Larsson adding that those companies were expected to invest around US$ 1 billion into the Indian market over the next couple of years. Lekvall said partnerships were also in the offing around gender equality in the workplace, as well as innovations in technology and manufacturing. “Over the past 12 years, oer 100 Swedish companies have entered the Indian market.

The yellow metal price settled at Rs 49,500 per 10 gram in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, down from Rs 50,500 on Tuesday. Gold prices showed a downward trend on account of global cues. Spot gold prices touched $1,805 per ounce, according to World Gold Council. “International gold prices plunged to their lowest over the past two weeks or so, as dollar rallied and the yields from the US bonds were better,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). Acharya added: “This followed the US president’s support for a second term for the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell.” Jewellers are rejoicing at the reduction in prices as it will increase the momentum of sales for gold jewellery. “The demand for gold jewellery as well as for bullion is good because of the ongoing wedding season,” said a city-based jeweller. “A reduction in prices will give further impetus to the sales.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-price-down-by-rs-1k-in-single-day/articleshow/87876185.cms||---

To meet the requirements, Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO) in Lucknow has developed an advanced computerized psychological test module for loco-pilots of high-speed trains. “Loco-pilots have to be psychologically fit for safe train operations and proper psychological health is essential to eliminate the chances of errors arising out the judgement that may lead to serious consequences, including loss of lives and goods. These personnel have to undergo periodical psychological tests to ensure proper psychological health,” said Ashish Agarwal, the chief public relations officer of RDSO. The Psycho-Technical Directorate of RDSO has been conducting psychological tests for such personnel since many years. Earlier, this test was conducted in paper pencil mode with manual interface which has now been converted into computerized test. This was essential to eliminate the errors and personal biases, prejudices in testing procedure. After railway board’s instructions in 2006 to computerize all psychological tests, a full module of Computerized Test for Drivers of Speed Vehicles (CADAT) was developed. All pilots of trains operating over 110 km/hr must clear the psychological test. The psycho-technical directorate kept analyzing the shortcomings and constraints in the test over time and developed an augmented module to make the psychological tests more effective as per needs in the present context. Earlier, there were five types of tests, but the number has now increased to 11 in the new computerized psychological tests module now. “The team has developed 11 new types of tests, including form perception test, perceptual speed, re-construction test, picture memory and concentration,” said Manish Kumar, scientific officer in psycho-technical directorate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rdso-upgrades-psycho-test-for-locomotive-pilots/articleshow/87876881.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Teams of over 200 officers and personnel searched more than 40 premises of Astral Pipes and Ratnamani Metal across India including in Delhi and Mumbai. In the preliminary investigation, the teams have found over Rs 1 crore in cash, details of about 12 bank lockers, and have also seized documents related to financial transactions. The officials did not divulge the details of the operation. But sources aware of the developments said that it’s believed to be spurred by the difference between the revenues shown for taxation and the actual sales over the past few years. The teams visited residences of the directors and promoters, corporate offices, and manufacturing facilities of both the companies in several states including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Delhi. “The data is believed to be in a few centralized servers. A team of IT experts are copying and analyzing the data,” said a source in the know, adding that no details on the seizures were available. The source added: “The process may take two to three days. Meanwhile, key officials may be questioned in connection with the alleged financial discrepancies.” After the operation on a city-based gutkha distributor and a group based in south Gujarat, this is the third major operation by the I-T department in the past fortnight.  Gutkha distributor and Rs 100 cr unaccounted income Ahmedabad: The search and seizure operation of the I-T department focused on a city-based gutkha distributor that started on November 16 concluded with the detection of unaccounted income of over Rs 100 crore, a CBDT release said. The search had covered more than 15 premises and the officials had seized Rs 7.5 crore cash and jewellery worth Rs 4 crore. “During the course of the search action, various incriminating documents and digital evidence were found and seized,” the release said. “The preliminary analysis of these evidences clearly indicate evasion of taxable income by adopting various malpractices such as unaccounted purchases of materials, under-invoicing of sales, and unaccounted expenditure incurred in cash.” The release added: “Further analysis of seized material reveals that part of these cash sales has not been recorded in the books of accounts.” The release said that evidence of investment in immovable assets was also detected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/i-t-searches-focus-on-2-pipe-makers/articleshow/87876188.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government disburses funds for 1,200 non-Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: At the age of just 14 years, Suhani Raikwar has turned a motherly figure for her two younger siblings. Their mother Meera had succumbed to cancer in 2019, while their father Bablu, a daily wage labourer, died of suspected Covid-19 infection in 2020 at home in Lalitpur. Living in a 10 x 40 sq ft shed in Chaukabagh, the three minors were left on fate by their relatives, forcing them to drop out of school. Suhani took a job as domestic help to arrange food for herself and her two siblings. Similarly, 25-year-old Fareen from Nadipura mohalla in Lalitpur lost her husband Jamaal in December 2020 amid covid pandemic. Jamaal was a photographer and after his death, Fareen was forced out of her in-laws’ home along with her five-yearold son Mishab. Neither Suhani nor Mishab had any proof to establish that their fathers succumbed to Covid-19. TOI has highlighted difficulties faced by such orphans in multiple reports since May 2021. Taking cognizance of such cases, the UP government has released funds to be distributed among 1,200 ‘non-Covid’ orphans under the Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana (Samanya). Manoj Rai, the director of the women and child development (WCD) ministry of UP government, said, “Of 1,315 registered non-Covid applications, we have approved disbursal of funds into 1,200 accounts. Each non-Covid orphan would receive Rs 2,500 per month till the age of 18 years. The remaining applications will soon be approved after scrutiny.” According to the ministry, by Tuesday afternoon, 115 applicants including Suhani’s siblings and Mishab had received funds in their bank accounts. Lalitpur-based child rights activist Chandan Singh Ahirwar, who had been helping Suhani, said, “A total of Rs 15,000 has come into the bank accounts of Praveen (12) and Pradeep (10): the two siblings of Suhani. However, Suhani received no funds as under the scheme, only two children per family will receive this aid.” The government order states that a maximum of two orphans from each family would be paid Rs 2,500 per month till they reach the age of 18. However, under the scheme for Covid orphans, there is no limit for children per family to receive government aid. “The stories by TOI on non-Covid orphans made immense impact as many came forward to seek help. The UP government has attempted to help as many orphans as possible who were affected in the pandemic,” added Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-disburses-funds-for-1200-non-covid-orphans/articleshow/87876921.cms||Arvind Chauhan

While Anand has been in custody in the Elgar Parishad case since April 2020, Milind was an absconding accused. Anand’s plea said that he came to know that his brother was killed on November 13 in Gadchiroli. He said that he was the oldest among eight siblings, two of whom are now dead. His father and youngest brother, Pravin Teltumbde, had died earlier. Anand in his plea said that his mother is over 90 years old, and at such a moment of bereavement in the family, his presence by her side would be a great moral support, and the gathering of all family members would be a solace to one another. The special NIA judge has directed the prosecution to submit its reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teltumbde-seeks-bail-to-meet-kin-after-brother-killed/articleshow/87876917.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Business||Apple sues Israeli spyware maker, seeks to block access to iPhones||SAN FRANCISCO: Apple sued the NSO Group, the Israeli surveillance company, in federal court on Tuesday, another setback for the beleaguered firm and the unregulated spyware industry. The lawsuit is the second of its kind - Facebook sued the NSO Group in 2019 for targeting its WhatsApp users - and represents another consequential move by a private company to curb invasive spyware by governments and the companies that provide their spy tools. Apple, for the first time, seeks to hold NSO accountable for what it says was the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. Apple also wants to permanently prevent NSO from using any Apple software, services or devices, a move that could render the company's Pegasus spyware product worthless, given that its core business is to give NSO's government clients full access to a target's iPhone or Android smartphone. Apple is also asking for unspecified damages for the time and cost to deal with what the company argues is NSO's abuse of its products. Apple said it would donate the proceeds from those damages to organisations that expose spyware. Since NSO's founding in 2010, its executives have said that they sell spyware to governments only for lawful interception, but a series of revelations by journalists and private researchers have shown the extent to which governments have deployed NSO's Pegasus spyware against journalists, activists and dissidents. Apple executives described the lawsuit as a warning shot to NSO and other spyware makers. "This is Apple saying: If you do this, if you weaponise our software against innocent users, researchers, dissidents, activists or journalists, Apple will give you no quarter," Ivan Krstic, head of Apple security engineering and architecture, said on Monday. Earlier this month, the Biden administration, in a notable breach with Israel, blacklisted NSO and Candiru, another Israeli surveillance firm, saying that they supplied spyware to foreign governments that used it to target the phones of journalists, dissidents, rights activists and others. The Israeli government, which approves any sale of NSO's software to foreign governments and considers the software a critical foreign policy tool, is lobbying the US to remove the ban. NSO has said it would fight the ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/apple-sues-israeli-spyware-maker-seeks-to-block-access-to-iphones/articleshow/87878136.cms||Nicole Perlroth

An airport official said the pilot of a departing Vistara Airlines flight alerted the ATC about a dog on the runway around 4.30pm. The latter alerted the incoming IndiGo flight which then pulled out of the landing sequence, climbed up and went around the airport. An inspection vehicle was despatched to check the runway. The team found the runway to be clear and radioed to the ATC to ask the IndiGo flight to land. The IndiGo flight carrying several Trinamool Congress leaders touched down 10 minutes after the scheduled landing time. In the past, planes have had to abort landings after jackals were sighted on the runway. The airport grounds has a jackal population that surfaces during monsoon when the burrows get flooded. In another incident, a Varanasi-bound IndiGo flight had a bird hit during takeoff around 1pm. When the plane reached Varanasi the bird hit was confirmed on inspecting the aircraft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dog-on-runway-forces-flight-to-abort-landing/articleshow/87876227.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Though there is no official data, the Central Water Commission (CWC) says the recent floods in AP could be the worst in the past 10 to 20 years. State witnessed huge floods in 2009 when over 300 villages in cities including Vijayawada and Kurnool bore the brunt. The recent depression in the Bay of Bengal caused massive flooding in parts of Andhra Pradesh, especially in Chittoor and Kadapa districts. Tirumala, where the famous Lord Venkateswara temple is located, and Tirupati city were hit by floods of unprecedented scale. Somasila reservoir in Nellore district discharged all-time high of 5.5 lakh cusecs of water. Irrigation officials lifted 10 crest gates of the reservoir following heavy rain in catchment areas.  Speaking to TOI, V Vasantha Kumar, executive engineer, hydrology division, CWC, said the recent heavy rains wreaked havoc in Rayalaseema region triggering flash floods. A portion of the Pincha project was washed away and that led to heavy inflows into the Annamayya project on the Cheyyur river. The heavy rains (8 cm to 10 cm rainfall in three hours) along the Cheyyur river and the continuous rains for a few days from November 18 were the major reasons for the floods, he added. Rayalaseema region witnessed good rainfall during the southwest monsoon and most of the irrigation projects in the region received good inflows. But the sudden heavy rains led to massive floods in the region. Dismissing social media reports claiming that ‘the recent floods in AP are the worst in 140 years,’ Vasantha Kumar said they might be worst in the past two decades. Though IMD warned heavy rainfall over Rayalaseema region and Nellore district, the officials didn’t release the water from the reservoirs initially to mitigate the flood situation. The heavy inflow of rainwater led to breaches to some waters bodies and that led to floods in some parts of the Rayalaseema region, said a senior officer with IMD. The recent flash flood claimed the lives of more than 40 people while several others are still missing in Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra Pradesh region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-flash-floods-worst-in-20-years-says-cwc/articleshow/87875499.cms||Nalla.Babu

The police said the accused suspected that his mother-in-law caused differences between him and his wife. The incident took place at 12.30 am on Tuesday in Priyadarshani Colony of Sambhaji Nagar area that comes under Sadar Bazaar police station limits. The deceased has been identified as Sakhubai Kale (50), while the accused Vijay Dhillod (35) is a resident of Bhimnagar, Bhavsingpura in Aurangabad. As per the police the suspect reached Jalna on Tuesday evening and asked his wife to accompany him to Aurangabad. During the conversation, a heated argument broke out between them and the accused became upset after his mother-in-law scolded him. The accused in a fit of rage lifted a flooring tile and bludgeoned her head, before stabbing her multiple times with a sharp-edged knife. Based on the complaint lodged by his wife Jyoti (30), the police registered a case of murder against the accused. Sadar Bazar police inspector Anirudha Nandedkar said, the preliminary probe has revealed that the accused had the habit of assaulting his wife for petty reasons. Owing to the growing differences between the couple, Jyoti along with her two kids returned to her parents’ house in Jalna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-man-held-on-charge-of-killing-mother-in-law/articleshow/87874837.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||With more AC locals in Mumbai, crowds up but fares still a deterrent||MUMBAI: The number of passengers travelling by air-conditioned locals in the city touched close to 19,000 after eight more services were introduced on Western Railway, but commuters have demanded rationalization of fares besides allowing non-AC class passengers to board AC locals by paying the difference. The number of AC services on WR increased to 20, thus ensuring additional trains during the morning and evening peak hours. WR chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, “The numbers on Monday – the first day since frequency was increased - touched 18,805. The rise in numbers can be attributed to more availability of services.” The average ridership in the month of November is 6,407 so far, but on Monday, the numbers got better as Mumbai gradually opens up after imposition of the pandemic-induced lockdown. Fare is a major issue for poor patronage of the AC services as the railways’ own survey revealed nearly 52 per cent of the 35,685 respondents wanted reduced fares. To give an example of why fare is a deterrent, the monthly season ticket (MST) for first-class travel between Churchgate and Borivli costs Rs 755, while the AC service costs Rs 1,635. The single-journey fare is Rs 165 by AC and Rs 140 for the first-class compartment, but the frequency is poor as there are only 20 AC services in a day. Kailash Verma of the Passenger Amenities Committee of Railway Board said, “I have suggested to the railway minister Ashwin Vaishnaw to allow first-class season ticket holders to board these locals. At present, not many people are willing to take these (AC) locals because of poor frequency and expensive fares.” The railway minister has given an in-principle approval to implement Metro fares fixed by MMRDA for their network for daily tickets. However, season tickets will be charged as per existing rates. Borivli resident Seema Naik said, “Why are they delaying the implementation of Metro-type fare? It must be costing huge money to operate this (AC) train. Better to earn something than running it empty.” WR has also announced it will allow non-AC passengers to board AC trains. The on-board train ticket examiner will collect the excess fare. However, the date of implementation for that has not yet been announced. Zonal Rail Users Railway Consultative Committee member Shailesh Goyal said, “The only solution is to reduce fares or allow first-class commuters to board AC locals.” He also said scheduling of trains on WR is not satisfactory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-more-ac-locals-crowds-up-but-fares-still-a-deterrent/articleshow/87876950.cms||Manthank Mehta

The recruitment was done by gram sevaks and the elected body of the respective gram panchayats. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the ZP, had on February 26 issued a circular to the block development officers of Haveli and Mulshi tehsils, asking them not to carry out fresh recruitment at those gram panchayats The gram panchayats, however, recruited the employees on a permanent basis, a ZP official said. “Since there were allegations against the gram sevaks, who are employees of the ZP, we formed an inquiry panel to investigate the matter. The panelwill submit the inquiry report soon for further course of action,” Prasad told TOI on Tuesday.  “The gram sevaks, in association with gram panchayats’ elected body, made the recruitment a few days before the merger.

He said that the police crime branch will once again question Abdul Rahman, the driver of the ill-fated car, and Saiju Thankachan, the driver of the car that followed the car that met with the accident. Nagaraju said that in the coming days more people will be questioned and the police are presently engaged in the identification process of all persons who have attended the party. He said that the CB team had been trying to retrieve the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) of CCTV cameras from No 18 Hotel in Fort Kochi, where the victims attended a late night party before the accident. The DVR was allegedly thrown into the backwater near Kannangattu Bridge by the hotel employees and the police, with the help of fire and rescue divers, tried to retrieve it in vain on Monday. Though a second attempt was made on Thursday with Coast Guard divers and their underwater surveillance equipment, they could not find the DVR as the area was slushy. Nagaraju said that the police are trying to confirm if there was a mystery behind the accident and the DVR is crucial evidence in the case. “The probe will be concluded soon and we are checking whether the happenings at the hotel during the party had any connection with the car accident. For that DVR is necessary and we are trying to find it,” he said. However, police sources said that even if the hard disk is found from the lake, there is less chance of retrieving data from it since the device would have undergone water damage over the course of three weeks. According to sources, the data is stored in a magnetic strip and there is only a slight chance of data recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vyttila-accident-probe-in-final-stage-commissioner/articleshow/87876963.cms||---

After much delay and postponement, the varsity had announced that results would be available on Tuesday.

That did not happen today. “This is not expected from the MU where earlier the results were available instantly on the website. We spent the entire day checking the website, but no luck. We had to write examinations without hall tickets and the examinations also went on for over four months. It is high time MU rectifies its errors and puts things in place,” said a third-year hotel management student. “The website opened but did not show results,” complained another undergraduate student.

Meanwhile, students can check the results at their respective colleges.” “The adoption of a new software, MULinx, has led to several confusions,” complained a senior lecturer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mu-website-crashes-ug-odd-semester-results-dont-load/articleshow/87875508.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt may stick with DGP Sanjay Pandey till he retires||MUMBAI: The fate of both serving chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and acting director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey hangs in balance. Pandey’s name does not figure in a list recommended by the Union Public Service Commission to the state for empanelment, while a proposal to grant an extension to Kunte, who is retiring on November 30, is pending with the Centre. After DGP Subodh Jaiswal took up central deputation, the state government submitted a panel of DGP-rank officers to the Centre to fill the post. Initially, the state submitted a list of five officers. Then the Centre asked for a list of officers, who have completed 30 years in service. Along with Pandey, the state home department submitted the names of Hemant Nagrale, Param Bir Singh, Rajnish Seth, K Venkatesham and Vivek Phansalkar. According to reports, after a high-level meeting, which was attended by Kunte, the Central government shortlisted the names of Nagrale, Seth and Venkatesham; Pandey was not on the list. Nagrale is due for retirement in October 2022, Seth in December 2023 and Venkatesham in May 2022. On the other hand, Pandey is due for retirement earlier in June 2022. A senior bureaucrat said even if the Centre has submitted a list to the state, it is not binding on the state and it can ask Pandey to continue in the post till his retirement. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a decision on whether to select the new DGP from the panel or ask Pandey to continue till his retirement. In view of the ensuing civic polls, Pandey is likely to be continued to lead the state police force,’’ he said. On Sitaram Kunte, the bureaucrat said in all possibility, he may be granted an extension. “Our information is that the state government has submitted a proposal to the Centre for a six-month extension to Kunte. DOPT will take a decision on whether to accept the proposal or otherwise. If the proposal is rejected, then Thackeray will have to look out for a new chief secretary,’’ he said. Many bureaucrats, however, say that the practice of granting an extension to outgoing chief secretaries should be done away with as it comes in the way of the career prospects of junior officers. “We feel that only those IAS officers should be considered, who have more than one year service for retirement. Short tenured IAS officers have an adverse impact on the administration,’’ said one official. If Kunte does not get an extension, Shyam Lal Goyal, currently on central deputation, education secretary Vandana Krishna, planning secretary Debashish Chakravarty, home secretary Manukumar Srivastava, minority development sectetary Jayashree secretary and ACS Sujata Saunik are likely to be considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-govt-may-stick-with-dgp-pandey-till-he-retires/articleshow/87876965.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mayawati to focus on reserved seats, chalks out poll plan||LUCKNOW: Having recorded a lacklustre performance on reserved seats till now, BSP president Mayawati is hoping that increased focus on these seats will bring her party back to power after the 2022 UP assembly elections. On Tuesday, Mayawati held a meeting with the presidents of 86 reserved constituencies, including two for Scheduled Tribes, to chalk out the poll campaign strategy. “We will work out a comprehensive plan of action for reserved seats. The meeting on Tuesday was important as we discussed preparations at all levels like cadre building and polling booth work. We should win as many seats as possible, like in 2007, when we won 206 seats. A separate strategy will be chalked out for upper castes, especially Brahmins, for which the responsibility has been given to national general secretary SC Mishra and his team,” Mayawati said. Traditionally, BSP has not done well in reserved constituencies where Dalit votes get divided among candidates which leaves the upper castes as the deciding factor. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP swept UP winning 71 out of 80 seats, BSP failed to win even a single seat. Mayawati’s best performance on reserved seats since 1999, when she won five out of 17 reserved seats, was repeated in 2004. Meanwhile, Mayawati also released a booklet on Tuesday which contains information about the works done by the BSP government during its four terms. Saying that she believes in doing more than in talking, due to which she never releases an election manifesto, Mayawati said, “Previous governments as well as the current BJP government, have been making modifications to our schemes and declaring them as their own projects.” She said to counter this narrative, a booklet had been published by the BSP which did not go into details of the works done by the BSP government but highlighted major projects and schemes launched by her as the UP chief minister. “The Samajwadi Party, and now the BJP, are changing the shape of my schemes and projecting them as their own. No party has done so much work that I have done, not even the Congress, which was in power for long after Independence. Since nobody else is going to talk about it, BSP itself has got this booklet published and will distribute it across the length and breadth of the state,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-to-focus-on-reserved-seats-chalks-out-poll-plan/articleshow/87876961.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Two get 20 years in jail for smuggling opium poppy||VADODARA: A truck driver and a cleaner from Punjab were convicted by a special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) court on Monday for smuggling opium poppy worth Rs 1.2 crore in June 2014. The two convicts — Baldev Singh alias Gurudev Singh alias Deba Jat and Jasbinder Singh Majbisikh — were arrested by the special operations group (SOG) of Vadodara rural police on June 12, 2014, from the Vadodara-Halol Road for transporting 3,000kg of opium poppy. Police had searched their truck out of suspicion as the truck did not have a registration number at the side and back. The opium poppy was seized and samples of it were sent to FSL in Gandhinagar for investigation. The duo was arrested and booked under the NDPS Act at Waghodiya police station. Later the truck owner Beant Singh Majbisikh was also arrested. During the trial, the additional public prosecutor R S Chauhan submitted the report of FSL that had confirmed that the substance found from the truck was opium poppy. Seventeen witnesses and material evidence too were examined. However, the prosecution could not submit any concrete evidence against Beant Singh. The court of special NDPS judge H I Bhatt upheld the evidence and testimonies against Baldev Singh and Jasbinder Singh and sentenced the duo to rigorous imprisonment to 20 years and also fined them Rs 1 lakh each. The court acquitted Beant Singh giving him the benefit of doubt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-get-20-yrs-in-jail-for-smuggling-opium-poppy/articleshow/87875813.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Encroachments to blame for Tirupati floods||TIRUPATI: Though hundreds of crores of rupees are being spent to transform the temple city of Tirupati into one of the safest and liveable cities in the country, encroachments, coupled with poor drainage systems, are paving way for unprecedented floods in city denting its image of being one of the prestigious smart cities in the country. The city which remains inundated even five days after the heavy downpour is now staring at the prospect of heavy to very heavy rains as predicted by the India meteorological department. Now the big question is, what led to the unprecedented floods in the city? The presence of Tirumala hills on the north and the scores of low-lying water bodies to its northeast is a clear indication of the city’s incline. During the monsoon season, the storm water drains get filled up, also due to the water from the Seshachalam hills. Tackling the inflow that suddenly gushes down the hills and heavily chokes the drains, leaving a ruinous effect, is what bothers the civic authorities the most. Speaking to TOI, Tirupati municipal corporation deputy mayor Bhumana Abhinay Reddy said excess water from the Peruru Cheruvu and Perumallapalli Cheruvu overflowed which led to flooding at several colonies surrounding Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam for the first time in the history of the city. “Whenever it rains heavily at Tirumala, only some of the low-lying colonies witness waterlogging. But this time, even the western colonies of the city which are on a higher elevation were submerged as encroachments blocked the natural waterways from the Perumallapalli and Peruru Cheruvus. Excess water from these two water bodies have to be originally diverted to the Tummalagunta Cheruvu. But because natural channels have been encroached upon over a period of time, nearly 20,000 people in several colonies on the western side of the city were affected”, Bhumana Abhinay Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/encroachments-to-blame-for-tirupati-floods/articleshow/87875516.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Victim Prem Panchal, a resident of Padmawati Society in Ranip, had gone to the Sabarmati yard, where the train was stationed, to shoot videos for his social media accounts. The Class 12 student of Nishant School in Ranip touched the wire which carried 25,000 volts of electricity, got flung through the air, and landed on the ground, senseless. Locals rushed him to Sola Civil hospital where he was declared brought dead, said Sabarmati railway police. The incident took place on Monday evening. Prem is an only child. His father is an employee with the postal department while his mother is a home-maker. “His grandfather said that Prem’s friend came home around 4.30 pm and whisked him away on his scooter. Later, we got to hear of his death,” said police, who suspect that he had been shooting for the video at the yard with others who ran away when the tragedy occurred. “Prem’s social media accounts reveal that he had earlier risked life and limb to post videos of dangerous stunts along the railway tracks. However, this time, he climbed a train to shoot a video and was not so lucky. We are trying to find out who was with him while he was trying out the stunt,” said police. The Sabarmati railway police have registered a case of accidental death and started an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teen-climbs-train-to-make-stunt-video-electrocuted/articleshow/87876239.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: MSEDCL rectifies 3 lakh bills issued last year||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) had to rectify the electricity bills of over three lakh customers because of faulty meters or incorrect readings during the initial phase of the pandemic last year. An MSEDCL report by its chief public relations officer (PRO), Anil Kamble, stated that the power distribution company received over 12 lakh complaints of incorrect bills last year when the pandemic and initial lockdown had forced the public utility to issue average power bills for two to four months (from April to July 2020). When contacted, Kamble told TOI, “We have over two crore consumers across the state and no matter how hard we work, there will be some complaints of incorrect meter reading or other issues which crop up due to faulty metres. We are always addressing these issues at our offices closest to the consumers. Last year, too, complaints rose due to the pandemic and we did rectify such bills.” According to Kamble, the MSEDCL conducted 5,678 gatherings with consumers across the state to address issues of incorrect bills, while over 3,201 webinars were held to make sure grievances were heard. More than 15,000 dedicated cells were also started. He said such complaints could still crop up as faulty meters can result in incorrect readings and the final bill amount; such errors should be rectified at the very earliest. Vivek Velankar, the founder of city-based NGO Sajag Nagrik Manch, said the average billing process last year resulted in widespread confusion, especially over the calculation process. He said for change, the MSEDCL resolved the queries of consumers, who were unaware of the mathematics behind these calculations. “About 90% of the complaints we received were just confusion about the average bill calculation, not the final bill amount,” he said. Last year, after the first lockdown was enforced from late March to mid-May, the MSEDCL stopped taking meter readings. The difference between the reading in March before the lockdown and the fresh reading in June was used to arrive at the number of units consumed in between. Consumers had been given the option of submitting the meter reading on the MSEDCL app but only 3.65 lakh of 2.30 crore used the facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-rectifies-3l-bills-issued-last-year/articleshow/87876232.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Nearly 500 villages still remain cut off due to damage to the roads. People are finding it difficult even to reach their homes after floods as most roads have been washed away beyond recognition. Many bridges and low-level chaptas have also suffered damages. The roads and buildings, and panchayat raj departments, who were planning to take up repairs and maintenance works of the roads after the rains, will require around Rs 2,000 crore to take up permanent restoration of roads in four rain-hit districts. The estimates may go up to Rs 4,000 crore as many bridges have also been washed away. “We will require at least Rs 150-200 crore to take up immediate restoration of roads in the affected areas,” said a senior official. The R&B department has estimated that about 1,632 kilometres of road network has been damaged, and breaches were reported at nearly 125 places in the four districts. While about 539 kilometres are damaged in Kadapa, the damages to roads in Chittoor district is about 217 kilometres. About 715 kilometres of road network has suffered damage in Nellore district. Breaches have been reported at 48 places in Chittoor and 46 places in Kadapa district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/500-villages-remain-cut-off-govt-needs-rs-2k-crore-to-restore-roads/articleshow/87875541.cms||Samdani MN
---||Lucknow||Nadda dinner was a booster for booth chief||Gorakhpur: A day after BJP chief JP Nadda and CM Yogi Adityanath dined with him and his family, Balram Rajbhar, the booth-level president of the saffron party in Rajhi Khale village in Gorakhpur, is an exhilarated man. On Tuesday, he told TOI how the event had cemented his commitment to work for the party in the upcoming state elections. “On November 19, I got a call from the party that Nadda ji and Yogi ji will visit my house and eat with us. It was a huge honour for me and my family. I did not have much resources. Villagers helped me in organising the feast for party top leaders,” said Rajbhar. The feast included dal puris, home-made laddoos and sabzi. Nadda was in Gorakhpur on Monday to preside over a convention of booth-level functionaries in what was seen as BJP’s attempt to roll out its gargantuan poll machinery to step up the electoral spade work. The BJP leaders’ move to visit the house of a party functionary from the Rajbhar community marked the saffron outfit’s fresh bid to consolidate the MBC community which holds electoral significance in east UP. The development was also perceived by experts as BJP’s tacit punch at ally-turned-rival SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar—who has allied with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. The area, Rajhi Khale, has a population of more than 10,000, of which majority are from the Rajbhar and Nishad communities: both electorally sound in Yogi’s political backyard. Balram himself has worked with the SBSP chief in his initial days. “I had high regard for him but not anymore. He has shown his most opportunistic face which will never gel with backward castes, especially in and around Gorakhpur,” he said. He said under the BJP dispensation the condition of his family improved a lot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-dinner-was-a-booster-for-booth-chief/articleshow/87876973.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Kochi||No directive to open more outlets: HC||Kochi: The high court on Tuesday said it has not directed for increasing or decreasing the number of liquor retail outlets in the state while ordering for ensuring basic infrastructure. Justice Devan Ramachandran said the decision on the number of liquor retail outlets is part of the policy decision of the state government and no directive has been issued by the court. During the hearing, the court said what the government should be doing is to ensure that operation of liquor outlets do not cause disturbance to the public, including women and children. People visiting liquor stores are now parking their vehicles on the roads and it is causing much difficulty to the public, the court said while stating that the excise commissioner should take steps to redress such difficulties. A petition filed by Congress leader VM Sudheeran alleging that the government is multiplying the number of liquor retail outlets in the name of complying with the court’s order. It was alleged in the petition that the government is trying to open 175 new liquor outlets citing the court directive to take steps to reduce the long queues in front of existing outlets. Sudheeran has sought a clarification that the court’s order does not include a directive to increase the number of liquor outlets or counters. He has also sought an order staying the proposal to open 175 new outlets until his petition is disposed of by the court. The court has scheduled further hearing on the case on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-directive-to-open-more-outlets-hc/articleshow/87876977.cms||---

Ganapati Ulvekar and Bheemanna Naik filed their nominations as BJP and Congress candidates respectively. Leaders of both the parties arrived at the deputy commissioner’s officer here and filed the nomination. Later addressing the media district minister Shivaram Hebbar said the BJP candidate would win hands down. “The local bodies were strengthened in the state after BJP came to the power. Grants for different developmental works in rural areas were given and works have been completed during the BJP tenure. The Union government is also interesting in strengthening local self-governments,” he said. BJP has more than 70% votes in Uttara Kannada local bodies. The district has five MLAs and an MP. All will strive hard for victory of BJP candidates, he added. While filing nomination Karwar MLA Roopali Naik and Kumta MLA Dinakar Shetty and several BJP leaders accompanied the candidate. Later, Congress candidate Bheemanna Naik filed his papers. Congress leaders RV Deshpande, BK Hariprasad, former MLAs Madhu Bangarappa, Satish Sail, Mankal Vaidya and Sharada Shetty accompanied Naik. Criticizing BJP for trying to weaken the panchayat raj system by not holding elections for zilla panchayat and taluk panchayats, Deshpande said panchayat raj is the gift of Congress party and BJP was always against it. He said BJP believes in the vulgar display of wealth by distributing money and liquor during the elections and silently killing one after another democratic institution he alleged. B K Hariparasad too criticized BJP government in the Centre for its ‘autocratic’ style of functioning and exuded confidence that the Congress candidate will win from Uttara Kannada. Four independent candidates also filed their nominations and they are Prakash Shripati Hegde from Sirsi, Dattatray Naik from Bhatkal, Ishwar Gouda from Kumta and Somashekhar VS from Karwar. (PIC: S1.

---||Pune||MSRDC plans speed traps on 10km Pune-Mumbai expressway ghat section||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRDC) has planned a slew of measures to control rash driving on a 10km-long ghat section on the Pune-Mumbai expressway. The MSRDC plans to install speed traps at three vantage points and will also tell the Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) to intensify night patrolling on the stretch. During two drives carried out by the transport department between September and November, most cases registered against rash drivers pertained to lane-cutting and speeding, officials said, adding that different types of deterrents were necessary. “Apart from the transport department’s drive, a campaign carried out by the HSP recently saw over 6,000 motorists being fined for lane-cutting,” an MSRDC official said. According to a transport department official, during the first drive between July 5 and 10, more than 500 motorists were fined for lane-cutting, while during the drive between October 8 and 19, more 1,500 were booked for the same offence. “The first drive was carried on the heels of a serious accident in which three people, including a toddler, died. The second drive was aimed at maintaining order on the highway during the festive season,” the official said. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne told TOI that a drop in accidents will be possible only through enforcement. “We need toeducate drivers on road discipline,” he said. Between August and October, the HSP had fined 6,255 heavy vehicle drivers Rs1,000 each for lane cutting. “There are regular and vigilant patrols at night on the expressway. No other highway in the state has night patrols,” Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, HSP Pune, said. MSRDC said it would also increase the number of signboards warning motorists about the dangers of speeding and lane-cutting on the highspeed corridor. “We are also awaiting the final approval for the Highway Intelligent Traffic Management project. Speed traps will be in the form of hidden cameras and equipment with lights to caution motorists if they are speeding,” an MSRDC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrdc-plans-speed-traps-on-10km-eway-ghat-section/articleshow/87876241.cms||Joy Sengupta

Not satisfied with its rank, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has started working on a strategy to improve its rank in the Swachh Survekshan-2022. Explaining his plans for Swachh Survekshan-2022 to the mediapersons, GVMC commissioner Dr G Lakshmisha said they will look into the components, which have not worked in favour of the GVMC in the SS-2021, and work on those to improve ranking next year. “The GVMC wants to transform the city from ‘manhole to machine hole’ by deploying the required machinery for the same. On the sanitation front, we will improve our men, machinery and material. We have also focused on better sewerage disposals. Once the 15 MW waste-to-energy plant is commissioned, all the garbage generated in the city will go to the plant instead of the landfill. All the legacy waste accumulated over the years at Kapuluppada dumping yard would be bio-mined to convert the dumpsite into a green patch in a phased manner,” said Lakshmisha. The GVMC Commissioner added that sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 108 MLD would be added to the existing plants under the ongoing underground drainage project in Pendurthi, Gajuwaka and Malkapuram. The GVMC has been awarded a 3-star rating as part of SS-2021, which might have negatively impacted its ranking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gvmc-starts-working-on-improving-ss-22-ranking/articleshow/87875558.cms||---

Anubhav Singh, Nityanand Gaur and Senapati Sahni were arrested from Ramgarhtal police station area on an informer’s tip-off. Deputy SP STF DK Shahi said that the arrested accused had taken money from the candidates at the online centre and allowed them to cheat by letting them sit separately in a lab or room at the centre. “The accused had given two options to a candidate: one was making a solver sit in place of them and the other was arranging for answers while the candidates themselves solved the paper. They charged Rs 15 lakh per candidate,” said Shahi. “On November 15 and 16, one Rajneesh Dixit had given them roll number slips of two candidates.

This is second major action by NCB in Nanded. Earlier, in the early hours of November 15, a team o the NCB had intercepted a truck at Manjram of Naigaon, Nanded, and seized 1,127 kg of marijuana worth several crores of rupees. The marijuana was coming from Andhra Pradesh. This was followed by a series of raids in Jalgaon and other places. In the latest case, NCB has arrested three accused — identified as Hardayalsingh Gulabsingh, Jivansingh Avtarsingh Chopra and Jeetendrasingh Pragansingh Bhullar. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede told TOI, “We have seized two different types of drugs, including 111 kg of poppy straw, from the busted manufacturing unit in Nanded district.” During the day, NCB issued a release stating: “On a specific information, a team of NCB-Mumbai raided three shops in Kamtha, Nanded, and busted a clandestine drug unit.” In the operation that started on Monday, a total of 111kg poppy straw, 1.4kg opium, Rs 1.55 lakh in cash, two grinding machines — that were being used to grind the poppy seeds for preparation of opium — were seized. NCB has also seized electronic scale and currency counting machine. The accused were taken to Mumbai, where they were produced before an NCB special court on Tuesday, following which, they have been remanded in three-day police custody.  “During the preliminary probe, it has come to fore that the accused had been operating the illegal opium manufacturing unit for the past three-four years,” said Wankhede. Sources said an accused recently nabbed by the NCB gave in and confessed about the rampant opium manufacturing unit in Nanded. When contacted, Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale, citing the findings of the local police, said the accused owned licences for preparing beverages made of poppy flowers. “Few years back, their licences were revoked and now it has been found that they got into opium business,” Shewale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ncb-team-seizes-111kg-poppy-straw-1-4kg-opium/articleshow/87874859.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Thane||Spl PP alleges Thane cops protecting ex-CP & others||Thane: Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat appointed by the government in the extortion cases against former Thane police chief and IPS officer Param Bir Singh, among others, on Tuesday alleged that the officers probing the case are protecting the accused and avoiding filing a chargesheet within the mandatory 60 days’ period, thus paving the way for default bail to the accused. On the whole, he said for reasons best known to them, Thane police were dragging their feet in the entire case and not giving any assistance to the special PP, he said. Speaking to the media after appearing in the court in the case, Gharat said he has complained to the city police commissioner Jai Jeet Singh and the state home department about the indifferent handling of the probe. The Thane Nagar police station has registered a case of extortion, among other charges, against Singh and 28 others for extortion and other crimes. The FIR was registered based on a complaint by 54-year-old Ketan Tanna, a bookie. Tanna alleged that when Singh was Thane police commissioner between January 2018 and February 2019, the accused extorted Rs 1.25 crore from him by summoning him to the office of the Anti-Extortion Cell and threatening to frame him in serious criminal cases. They also extorted over Rs 3 crore from his friend and alleged bookie Sonu Jalan in the same way. Gharat was visibly annoyed over the lax attitude of the Thane police officers. “I have already complained about the investigating officer Babasaheb Nikam, who is neither co-operating with me nor has briefed me about the progress of the probe.” He said that in cognizable offences, when senior officers are involved, police have got the legal right to arrest them. “In this case they should have been arrested and put behind bars,” he said. Gharat said that during one of the recent hearings in the court, the IO was very much present in the court but did not give him the brief and did not even attend to him, which itself was a gross insult. He said one accused in the case has applied for bail by default as 60 days have already lapsed, and this will be decided by court on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/spl-pp-alleges-thane-cops-protecting-ex-cp-others/articleshow/87876987.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Parties have stood united whenever nation faced any challenge, says Mulayam Singh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav on Tuesday said political parties should unite on the issues of corruption, unemployment and inflation. Appreciating the fact that parties have buried their differences and always stood together whenever the country faced a challenging situation, he expressed hope that people will engage in dialogue and discussions to resolve issues. The SP founder was speaking at the book launch of “ Rajneeti ke us paar” (On the other side of politics) written by party thinktank and Rajya Sabha member Ram Gopal Yadav. Chaired by Akhilesh Yadav, renowned poet Kumar Vishwas was the guest of honour at the event which was attended by senior politicians cutting across party lines. Communist Party of India leader Atul Anjan, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, Aam Aadmi Party’s UP in-charge Sanjay Singh, and RJD MP Manoj Jha also addressed the gathering along with journalist Hemant Sharma and poet Uday Pratap Singh. “ Mujhe khushi hai ki jab bhi chunaoti aayi hai desh ke samne, sab dal ek sath desh ke sath kharde ho gaye (I am glad that whenever the country was faced with a challenge, all parties stood united for the country),” Mulayam said. The former defence minister and three-time CM added that today there are questions of unemployment, corruption and unemployment and he was happy that India has taken on all these issues. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said “the book will not only inspire socialists but also the generations to come.” “ Agar hum “ Rajneeti ki us paar dekhen” … to kya dikhayi deta hai …. Rajneeti (If one looks ‘On the other side of politics’ (title of the book), one sees only politics). “And when we look on the other side in politics, we can see there will be a Samajwadi government in the state,” Akhilesh said. Poet Kumar Vishwas said questions were raised over his sharing the stage with Akhilesh Yadav. “Some said it was “strange”. I said in a democracy this has been the norm … what is “strange” is that these days it does not happen often,” he said. Vihwas said it would have been better if any of the senior BJP leaders had made it to the event and added that they were perhaps pre-occupied with the elections. Strking an emotional chord, Ram Gopal Yadav, said: “ Aaj main jo kuchh bhi hoon Netaji ki wajah se hoon. M ai ye chahta hoon ki unka ashirward humare oopar hamesha bana rahe (Whatever I am today, it is because of Netaji , and want him to always shower his blessing on me). The event had lighter moments when Uday Pratap Singh, a noted poet who has been Mulayam and Ram Gopal’s teacher as well, left everyone in splits when he referred to Kumar Vishwas and said: “Ek baat Netaji humse kaan mein keh rahe hain … ki agar ye kaheen naheen hain to inko Samajwadi Party mein kyon nahi bula lete (Netaji said to me if Kumar Vishwas is with no other party then why don’t you invite him to join SP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parties-have-stood-united-whenever-nation-faced-any-challenge-mulayam/articleshow/87877003.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

K Umamaheshwar Rao, director, NITK Surathkal, said that the institution was closed for many months, and opened for on-campus classes a month ago. Currently, there is a decrease in Covid-19 cases. Students in the second-year BTech courses and PhD scholars have arrived on campus. A few students are continuing with online classes. “Last year, the admission process for first-year BTech students happened online. This year we have decided to go offline, including physical verification of documents at the campus,” said Rao, adding that if all goes well, classes for first-year BTech students may begin from the last week of December. Meanwhile, as per the instruction of the Central Seat Allocation Board (CSAB), all the candidates who have been allotted a seat for the BTech programme in NITK Surathkal, and have accepted the same from rounds one to six, under the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA)-2021, will have to report online. The process commenced on the JoSAA portal on Saturday, and will be held till Wednesday. Vidya Shetty K, dean, (academics), said that the institute will take a decision on physical reporting for fresh BTech candidates next week. “Last year, since all the admissions were held online, we did not have physical verification of all documents,” she said. Currently, the sixth round of counselling by JoSAA has been completed, and there are a few more rounds to go. “As on date, out of 926 seats available at the institute, close to 900 seats have been filled. It is also mandatory to have 20% of supernumerary seats for women out of total admissions,” said Vidya, adding that physical reporting is likely to be held in the second week of December. Change in DASA admissions There is a change in Direct Admission of Students Abroad (DASA) 2021. It will not accept Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, instead, from this year, JEE-Main scores will be taken into consideration. SAT is a test used for college admissions in the US.

Owaisi was in Solapur city and the rally had been organised to galvanise support ahead of the civic body polls in February next year. During his speech, Owaisi also compared the condition of Muslims with the Maratha community members while pitching for the Muslim reservation demand. “Before the assembly elections, Congress and NCP called us (AIMIM) communal and the ‘B-team’ of BJP and Shiv Sena. Many of our secular Muslim brothers fell for the propoganda and voted against us. After the election, both the so-called secular parties joined the Sena to form the state government. They came together to save their family members and hide the scams. Congress and NCP functionaries felt no shame when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said in assembly that Sena is proud to have demolished the Babri mosque. Sharad Pawar and Rahul Gandhi should tell us when Sena became secular. Did they all forget what happened in 1992?” asked Owaisi. Owaisi said that after coming to power, Congress and NCP have also forgotten to grant the legally valid reservation in education to 50 Muslim communities. “The Marathas have much more landing holding when compared to the Muslims. They also have more IAS and IPS officers from the community. Even the Supreme Court ruled against Maratha reservation. On other hand, though the Bombay high court termed reservation for Muslims in education valid, the Congress and NCP are silent on the topic. Justice should be done in favour of the weak and not the powerful,” said Owaisi. Traffic cops fine Owaisi  The Solapur city traffic police personnel fined AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi Rs 200 for travelling in a vehicle without the front number plate. The vehicle had a Telangana-registered number plate on the rear. Though the challan was issued in Owaisi’s name, his local supporter paid the fine. The challan was issued when Owaisi arrived at the government rest house. As the news of him being challaned spread in media, Owaisi decided to mention it during his speech. “I knew my journalist friends love me, but I didn’t know they love my car too. Congratulations. When my car arrives, they dance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/owaisi-brings-up-babri-92-riots-at-solapur-rally/articleshow/87874880.cms||---
---||Pune||Local corporators suggest measures to avoid snarls||Pune: Corporators from the Sinhagad Road area have approached Pune Municipal Corporation commissioner Vikram Kumar with a demand to implement all traffic-related measures ahead of Rajaram Bridge going towards Funtime Theatre Chowk to avoid snarls and chaos during the upcoming flyover work. Work on the flyover on Sinhagad Road would begin in a few days. Prasanna Jagtap, a local corporator, said the PMC should set aside adequate carriageway for vehicles besides suspending roadside parking according to requirements. An alternate road up to PL Deshpande Garden should be readied at the earliest to decentralise traffic flow, he said. For the flyover project, a large-scale ceremony was organised recently in the presence of Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari. Jagtap said, “We have submitted memorandums to the administration. The preliminary work on soil testing and markings have started. We have advised the PMC to make adequate arrangements for smoother traffic before starting the digging and other heavy works. The Sinhagad Road is one of the busiest roads in the city. Hence, it would require proper planning before the work begins.” Daily commuters are expecting the work to get over within the stipulated time. Rajesh Shivdas, who takes the Sinhagad Road often, said, “The administration should not delay the work. The driveways for motorists should be maintained properly to ensure smoother vehicular movement. There should be manpower at chowks to control the traffic and assist walkers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/local-corporators-suggest-measures-to-avoid-snarls/articleshow/87876270.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: 180 exotic trees may soon be transplanted for flyover on Sinhagad Road||PUNE: The civic administration, before starting the flyover work on Sinhagad Road, has proposed transplantation of the 180 trees that are already on its median. Environment activists, however, said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) must revisit the necessity of shifting the trees and ensure that transplanting is done in a scientific way. The trees identified for transplantation are 10-12 feet tall and are of exotic varieties. The proposal of transplanting is on the PMC’s tree authority table for further discussion. A meeting on this is likely to be held in the next couple of days. PMC officials said the administration has not received any suggestions or objections so far on the transplanting proposal. Environment activist Vaishali Patkar said, “An infrastructure project can be designed in such a way that could avoid transplanting of trees. However, if at all there is a need for transplanting, the administration should take the help of experts so that chances of damaging the trees could be minimised. Transplanting hasn’t proved successful most of the time, so a proper method needs to be followed.” Patkar said civic administrations should consult environment experts before planning and executing infrastructure projects to avoid complications and damages to nature. Sachin Punekar, scientist and president of Biospheres, said the trees at the Sinhagad Road median are of exotic varieties and they can be transplanted at nearby gardens or at the roadside. “Such transplanting is possible while executing infra projects such as a flyover but the PMC should seek experts’ advice before transplanting the trees,” he said. Local corporator Prasanna Jagtap said he has suggested the PMC to carry out transplanting with proper planning, and transplant only those trees which can be aligned with the flyover’s design. Ajay Wayse, an executive engineer with the PMC, said the proposal has been tabled before the garden department and tree authority. Trees will be transplanted only after taking the suggestions of the tree authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/180-exotic-trees-may-soonbe-transplanted-for-flyover/articleshow/87876265.cms||---

Sources in the special operations group (SOG) of Ahmedabad rural police said Patel, 27, delivered drugs around 300 times to 50 places in Gujarat. “During the investigation, we found that he had identified certain places such as pan shops, tea shops, closed offices or houses and deserted places to avoid police scrutiny,” said a cop. The cop said Patel used to go to various parts of the city and would identify safe spots for delivery. “Whenever he went anywhere, he would identify locked offices or houses where he could order the delivery of the drugs. Apart from that, he had selected hangout places like paan shop or tea stalls for deliveries,” said the cop. The police officer said they had gone to the places he had taken deliveries at, and many of those them were found to be closed. Patel was caught by Ahmedabad rural police, who found drugs worth Rs 8 lakh in his possession. Sources in police said Patel would source the drugs from countries like the US and the Netherlands through cargo courier services and got them delivered in Gujarat and other states. He had also organized rave parties in Mumbai and Delhi and peddled drugs such as MD and cocaine. Police officers said Patel had also sent drug parcels to his friends Shanghai, China, and Auckland, New Zealand. Police also arrested three of his aides and charged them under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-drugs-case-delivery-at-paan-shops-locked-offices/articleshow/87876274.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||India||SC: Won't defer Tripura civic polls, state govt must ensure fair process||NEW DELHI: Observing that postponing elections should be a matter of "last and even extreme recourse", the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to defer municipal polls in Tripura and directed the state administration to discharge its duties in a "non-partisan manner" to obviate the grievance of the Trinamool Congress that the party is being targeted by political rivals. The court passed a slew of directions to ensure free and fair elections and said, "The DGP and home secretary of the state shall observe these directions scrupulously so as to obviate the need for the court to adopt coercive steps in the event that a breach of its directions comes to light." The municipal polls are on November 25 and the results will be declared three days later. The campaign, which came to an end on Tuesday, was marred by political violence, blamed by TMC and BJP on each other. The court passed the order on a contempt petition filed by TMC against the state government and police for not implementing the SC's November 11 order to protect its functionaries who were being targeted by BJP workers. While we are not inclined to accede to the prayer for postponing the elections for the reasons indicated earlier, we are equally of the view that it is the duty of the DGP, the IGP (law and order) and the home secretary of the state to assuage any misgivings about the fairness of the law enforcement machinery in supporting the electoral process. The law enforcement agencies must discharge their duties in an even-handed and non-partisan manner to obviate the grievance which has been urged before this court that candidates and supporters of the AITC are being unfairly targeted by contesting political groups," the bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Vikram Nath said. Senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Trinamool, told the bench that its functionaries were being attacked and not allowed to campaign. They submitted that Tripura has become a "terror state". Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the state, refuted the allegation and said the ministers from West Bengal were making inflammatory speeches to incite violence. The court, after hearing both sides, directed the state DGP and IGP (law and order) to hold a joint meeting with the state election commission by Wednesday morning for assessing the requirement of a sufficient strength of paramilitary forces drawn from the CRPF for ensuring peaceful conduct of elections. The court said they "shall take all steps to ensure that the election process is conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner". "Since a serious grievance has been expressed on behalf of the petitioners that despite the lodging of FIRs, no action has been taken by the law-enforcing agencies, the respondents shall submit before this court a statement of (a) the complaints which have been lodged; (b) the FIRs which have been registered; (c) action taken against those who have resorted to violence; and (d) arrests that have been made," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-wont-defer-tripura-civic-polls-state-govt-must-ensure-fair-process/articleshow/87878195.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The government has directed the NDRF and SDRF teams not to stop the search operations till all the missing persons, who might be waiting for help in vulnerable locations, are accounted for. There still no clarity on the missing figures even after five days of one of the worst natural disasters to have hit the Rayalaseema region in recent memory. The district collectors of Kadapa, Chittoor and Nellore have reported that the search operations are still on to find the whereabouts of the missing persons. “We are waiting for updation of the death toll as the entire administration is busy handling the relief measures,” said K Kannababu, special commissioner of State Disaster Management Authority. The state government has already announced Rs 5 lakh ex gratia for the kin of the deceased. About 1,366 villages in the four districts were inundated due to the flash floods that followed the heavy rains, prompting people to run away to safety. Kadapa district bore the brunt of the flash floods, with about 866 villages marooned due to the breach in Annamayya project and overflowing of Cheyyeru river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-clarity-on-number-of-persons-missing-search-on/articleshow/87875589.cms||Samdani MN

Sajag Nagrik Manch (SNM), a citizens’ group, has written to the PMC, demanding review of the decision. The group claims that nearly Rs11 crore have already been spent by corporators on such bags, and yet it has not helped in the reduction of use of plastic bags. “Now, the corporators have approved the fresh demand ahead of civic elections. They want to use the bags and other materials for political publicity. The allotment of funds for buying these materials should be cancelled,” said Vivek Velankar of SNM. At the meeting, elected members across party lines gave a nod to divert money from development projects to procure buckets. As per data with PMC, on average, around Rs10 lakh per year are spent on the procurement of such buckets by each corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-oppose-pmc-spending-on-buckets-bags/articleshow/87876276.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Date sheet for SSC and HSC board exams to be out in a wk||Pune: A proposal has been sent by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education to the state government recommending offline examination. Chairman of the state board Sharad Gosavi said that the government will decide the mode of examination within a week. As for students who have not received any marks in Std IX and XI, but were declared promoted as per the state’s order and were not able to fill up SSC and HSC exam forms, Gosavi said that the board has requested the State Council of Education Research and Training as well as Directorate of Secondary education to resolve the issue. “We have sent a proposal for offline examination to the state board. Now, it is up to them to decide. We expect a reply this week, post which we will declare the date sheet for the board exams,” he said. There has been a demand from some organisations on waiver of the SSC and HSC examination fees. However, the state board said that they had not received any such letter. “We have empathy for students who have lost their parents to Covid-19. But there can be many other students who come from extremely poor backgrounds. Hence, we cannot take a biased decision. If they send a letter, we will put it up to the higher authorities,” a state board official said. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of the headmasters’ forum of the state, said that the schools were unable to fill the examination forms of students who had been shown just “promoted” in Stds IX and XI. Gosavi said they are expecting a solution from SCERT and the directorate of secondary education within two days. Technical problem that can be addressed: Students who had attended online classes, or submitted assignments or even appeared for online examinations were assessed based on a formula and given marks. There were many students who were either not attending online classes, or were not there for exams. These students were also deemed “promoted” as per government’s order. But they were not given any marks and hence the SARAL system that accepts only marks to upgrade students still shows these students in their previous class. Since it is a technical problem, it can easily be solved by giving them minimum passing marks in the SARAL system so they can be upgraded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-date-sheet-for-ssc-and-hsc-board-exams-to-be-out-in-a-wk/articleshow/87877025.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Goa||Citizens, activists push for buffer zones around monuments||Panaji: Citizens and activists are likely to approach the high court of Bombay at Goa demanding that state bodies immediately impose buffer zones around heritage monuments in Goa — as per a central communique to the state in 2011 — to ensure there’s no structural damage to them. A 2011 letter from the Archaeological Survey of India’s head office in New Delhi to the state’s town and country planning department contemplated that no construction activity or allotment of land be allowed around the historic monuments of Old Goa. “Now that we know that the state was requested to draw the buffer zone by the Union government, we are committing blatant negligence by not implementing it. We will go to court over this,” said Tahir Noronha of the Save Old Goa heritage activism group.” Save Old Goa, a collective comprising citizens, heritage lovers, architects and activists, have been protesting the rampant construction around the Unesco world heritage site, and will have another protest on Sunday evening. Noronha said that damage could also be caused to monuments due to air pollution and vehicular vibration around them. Also, for coastal lands, there is a groundwater shift during construction that may also cause potential damage to monuments, he said. “Goa is the only state in India where buffer zones around protected monuments are not being enforced. By building in such areas, we are putting not just nationally-recognised heritage sites at risk, but also international ones,” he said. “The state regional plan was kept in abeyance from 2010 to 2017 to make these small changes (pertaining to buffer zones), yet these weren’t done by the TCP,” he added. “At Ponda, the flyover is within the 300m buffer zone of the Safa Masjid, yet, part of the monument collapsed in July this year. There is heavy construction near it to build the flyover, causing vibrations, besides the rain, which added to the damage,” he said. Similarly, he said that the St Cajetan church has had structural issues in the past. In 2003, a Unesco report pointed at a crack in the domes of the church demanding immediate repairs. Offering a solution, he said that the TCP could study the regional plans and ODPs and draw the buffer zone, following which the department of archives and archaeology and the ASI can look into it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/citizens-activists-push-for-buffer-zones-around-monuments/articleshow/87877032.cms||---

The two leaders also discussed seat-sharing for the UP elections. The meeting remained a closely guarded secret till Akhilesh tweeted a photograph shaking hands with Jayant Chaudhary and captioned it: “Shri Jayant Chaudhary ke saath, badlao ki ore (Heading for a change along with Jayant Chaudhary). The RLD was also quick to retweet the picture with a reply “saath saath challenge (will walk together). The RLD tweeted another picture of Jayant standing with Akhilesh and captioned it “badte qadam” (Moving forward).

The announcement of a formal alliance may come in the form of a joint rally possibly somewhere in Western UP, the date and time of which was yet to be finalised. “If we go by how the SP announced its alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) it was only photographs of the two leaders meeting followed by formal announcement of a joint rally,” said a senior SP leader. He went on to say that with RLD the things were a bit different as the two parties have already contested elections as alliance partners so announcement of alliance for 2022 polls was not needed. About seat sharing, well informed sources in the SP said the two sides have agreed that the RLD will contest on around 30 seats. “A few candidates here and there can always be adjusted on RLD nominee contesting on SP tickets and vice-versa,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-may-offer-30-seats-to-ally-rld/articleshow/87877020.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Pune||Maharashtra lowers eligibility to 50% for availing pre-matric scholarship||PUNE: After a poor response in applications for pre-matric scholarship for students in standards I to X, the state directorate of adult and minority education has relaxed the eligibility criteria of 50% to only pass marks. The directorate has also extended the date of application to November 30 and students can apply for this scholarship and take advantage in fee relaxation. Director of adult and minority education, Dinkar Temkar, said, “The relaxation in the eligibility criteria will allow more students to take benefit of this scheme. We have now also extended the dates for application and now we are hoping that maximum students would benefit out of it.” The adult and minorities education department has reported that nearly 81,695 beneficiaries have not opted for the scholarship this year. Temkar said, “Due to the pandemic and online schooling many students moved to their home towns. So these students have changed their schools or their applications were not received as they moved to their home towns. But the relaxation in eligibility criteria will surely help in boosting the scheme.” After the students make an online application, it is scrutinised for eligibility at school, district and state-level authorities after which the scholarship is approved, added Temkar. Once the scholarship is approved the student, he/she has to apply for renewal each year through their schools. The government has set aside 30% scholarship for girls of each minority community which is transferable to male students of that community in case of non-availability of female students in that community. If the physical target of scholarship for a particular minority community in a state/UT is not utilized, it will be distributed among the same minority community in other states strictly in accordance with merit and without disturbing the national ratio for the community. Maintenance allowance will be provided to hostellers and day scholars. Scholarship will not be given to more than two students from a family. It is applicable for all scholarship schemes meant for minorities under this ministry taken together. Change in schools, migration and also benefit of other government scholarships has found few takers for the pre-matric scholarship scheme provided by the state directorate of adult and minority education. Till recently, about 81,000 scholarships were not applied to by the students this year. An amount of less than Rs 500 is transferred directly to the beneficiary’s bank account once the student is eligible for the scholarship, but the change in school as a result of migration to native place has been the major cause for poor application.

The civic body is now on a mission to identify the factors which made them trail. Proper utilisation of water treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) is one of the parameters for Swachh rankings. Indore, which secured first place in rankings, is selling treated water to industries. Vishakapatnam, the biggest city in AP, is also selling treated water to steel plant. The VMC failed on this front. The civic body eyed to sign an MoU with Dr Narla Tatarao Thermal Power Station (NTTPS) for supplying around 63 MLD treated water for cooling the boiler chambers. But the proposal didn’t materialise due to financial constraints. Altogether, 135 MLD treated water is generated from STPs everyday and VMC is able to use only a small part of it for watering the plants at public parks. A dedicated STP park is constructed at Bhavanipuram where only treated water is used to water the plants. The civic body is presently discharging the treated water into Krishna river. The AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) had submitted a detailed project report on pipeline to Ibrahimpatnam NTTPS and the VMC has now been focusing on the project. “Proper utilisation of treated water in STPs is an important factor for improving ranking in Swachh Survekshan. We would have achieved first rank if we did it. Never late, we have started making efforts to better our ranking,” said VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/underuse-of-treated-water-played-spoilsport-to-vmcs-ss-ambition/articleshow/87875610.cms||Venu Lanka

Pune MP and advisory committee chairman Girish Bapat will preside over the meeting, to be held after a gap of more than a year. Stakeholders, including members of the business community, defence, Airports Authority of India, airlines and others will participate in the meeting. “Some of the important points that would be discussed in the meeting include the defence land issue, which has to be transferred to the Pune airport authorities for expansion of the facility, and the shifting of the existing cargo hold area among others. A stock will be taken on the progress of the new terminal building project and the multilevel parking lot. Discussion on new flights and international routes is a possibility too,” an airport official said. An airport source said the issues to be discussed on Wednesday were discussed in the last meeting too. “Most of the issues were discussed last year, but there has been no development in any area. The cargo hold area has not been shifted as the Indian Air Force is yet to provide the plot asked for. No fresh land transfers to the AAI from the defence ministry has happened too. These projects are important and need quick redressal,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airport-committee-may-discuss-land-transfer-issue-today/articleshow/87876292.cms||Joy Sengupta

This year, deaths of nine pregnant women were reported in the district, while a year ago, there were 15 such deaths, and three years ago, 28 pregnant women had died.

Last year, most deaths were due to complications in pregnancy and delays in the arrival of ambulances. Sanjaysinha Chavan, the chief executive officer of the Kolhapur ZP said, “The reason for the deaths is delay either at the family level or at the institutional level. We have decided to initiate awareness campaign to bring down the mortalities. We have asked the private establishments to adopt the standard practices while handling the complications in pregnancies. If any death takes place due to negligence of the hospitals, we can cancel their license.” Public health workers ensure that high-risk pregnant women and pregnant women from remote places are brought to the nearby health centres in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/drop-in-maternal-mortality-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/87874892.cms||---

Besides honouring the Maratha queen, the KV Dham is also going to enshrine the statues of Aadi Shankaracharya, Bharat Mata (Mother India) and Lord Kartikeya at key points of the corridor. Busy in gearing up preparations for the inauguration of over Rs 700 crore KV Dham by the PM, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Tuesday, “Over 85% of the work at KV Dham project has been completed and finishing is in progress in most of the buildings constructed in the corridor area. The process for restoration of idols of Goddess Parvati, Goddess Annapurna, Lord Ganesh, Lord Hanuman and Lord Satyanarayan in the KV temple premises has been started by installing prefabricated temples there.” Agrawal further said, “The process of installing statues of Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar, Adi Shankaracharya, Bharat Mata and Lord Kartikeya has also been started. The statue of Adi Shankaracharya will be installed at KV Dham’s entry point near the ghat along the Ganga.” “The statue of Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar will be installed near the tourist facilitation centre, while Bharat Mata’s statue will be mounted near Mandir Chowk. The statue of Lord Kartikeya is being installed near KVT. Each statue is 6.5 ft tall and will be installed on stone pedestals,” he added. Since its construction by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar in 1977, the Kashi Vishwanath temple, considered among the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva, is witnessing development for the first time. While going through the detailed project report of KV Dham project in November 2018, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had asked the authorities to ensure that the statue of Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar is installed as a tribute to her for rebuilding KVT in 1777 after it was destroyed in Mughal period. After viewing the DPR of KV Dham in December 2018 before laying foundation of the project in March 2019, the PM had also paid tributes to Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar and paved the way for developing facilities for hassle-free visit of pilgrims to this holy shrine. In February 2020, the PM had said, “It seems that after 18th century Queen Ahilyabai Holkar, Lord Vishwanath has given the responsibility of developing Kashi to us.” Regarding the date of inauguration of KV Dham, Agrawal said that all preparations are being made in view of the high probability of the PM’s visit on December 13, but the final schedule will be announced after confirmation from the PMO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/queen-ahilyabai-holkars-statue-to-be-installed-at-kv-dham/articleshow/87877095.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Last day to avail OTS policy today, else pay penalty||REGULARISATION OF WATER, SEWERAGE CONNECTION Ludhiana: The last day to avail one-time settlement policy for regularization of illegal water supply and sewerage connections is Wednesday. After it, defaulters will have to pay 100% penalty. The municipal corporation had kicked off a door-to-door survey-cum- recovery drive in four blocks of the city to regularize the connections, but it could not generate much response. After Wednesday, double amount will be recovered up to the next three months and if defaulters will not get connections regularised in six months from the date of notification (August 24), these will be disconnected and applicable penalty and interest will be charged on pending user charges.As the response to OTS policy remained poor, the officials were told to start a door-to-door drive in four blocks. The drive was kicked off on November 9, but the officials claimed that it could not bring the desired results. One of the officials said the major reason behind the poor response was that civic officials did not have complete data about defaulters and no system was set for finding them out.Nominal charges are fixed under this scheme. For houses constructed in area up to 125 square yards, Rs 200 per connection is fixed (Rs 100 for water supply and Rs 100 for sewerage); for 125 to 250 square yards, the charges are Rs 500 per connection; and for above 250 square yards, the fee is Rs 1,000 per connection. However, for commercial/ institutional properties up to 250 square yards, the charges are Rs 1,000 per connection and for above 250 square yards, these are Rs 2,000 per connection.MC superintendent Vivek Verma said, “People still have time till Wednesday to avail this opportunity and get their illegal connections regularised at nominal rates.” Connections regularisedZone Before drive After driveA----------753---------------1,640B----------- 525--------------1,728C-------------920-------------1,710D-- -----------1,500----------2,000||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/last-day-to-avail-ots-policy-today-else-pay-penalty/articleshow/87875639.cms||---

They also vandalised public property, spray-painted signboards and tied a saffron kanduva to the mayor’s chair. However, the mayor was not at her office when the incident happened. At 10am on learning that BJP activists were planning stage a protest at GHMC head office, Hyderabad police had deployed policemen at various locations. As several BJP corporators were part of the group, police could not stop them from entering the building. The agitators claimed that they were forced to stage a protest since funds were not released by GHMC to the corporators. “Besides funds, the protest is about not holding the council meeting for a long time,” a BJP protester said. Some policemen were deployed at the chambers of the GHMC commissioner, while another group, including eight woman police personnel, were stationed at the mayor’s office. A large number of agitators, including woman corporators, barged into the mayor’s chamber, they outnumbered the police personnel posted there. Caught unware by the development, police became cautious and brought in reinforcement to avoid similar situation at the commissioner’s chamber. Meanwhile, the protestors spray-painted GHMC signboard and vandalised flower pots outside the mayor’s office. Police finally had to lift a large number of protestors out of the mayor’s chamber. The agitators even tied a BJP kanduva (shawl) to the mayor’s chair. All through the protest, they raised slogans against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Police took 95 protesters into custody and they were analysing video footage of the persons who staged the protest at the mayor’s chamber. A case was registered for trespass, obstructing government officials from performing duty and other relevant charges against the BJP activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-cadre-barges-into-mayors-room-vandalises-office-paints-signboards/articleshow/87876334.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Brace for traffic chaos: Cops give nod to shut 6 roads for infra works||Nagpur: Brace for traffic jams on many roads in the city. Nagpur traffic police have given no-objection certificates (NOCs) to various contractors for closure of six roads to construct flyovers and bridges at different places. After the busy Kadbi Chowk-Gaddigodam stretch was closed for almost two years, Nagpur traffic police have again given an NOC to keep it shut for 90 days. The application seeking permission to keep the stretch closed for vehicular movement for three months was made to the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), traffic’s office on September 27. Had permission been given in September, the work could have been completed by December end. But permission was given on November 17. During this period, the construction of a flyover and Metro line are supposed to be carried out “on a war footing”. In a letter, officiating DCP (traffic) Dr Akshay Shinde categorically mentioned that the construction work should be carried out 24x7. Dr Shinde has also directed the firm — AFCONS — to take all preventive measures so that no untoward incident takes place. Police have diverted the traffic coming from Kamptee Road and heading towards Wardha Road, from Mangalwari railway overbridge (ROB) to Kadbi Chowk. Motorists will have to use Sadar Residency Road to move towards LIC Square and beyond. Similarly, vehicles heading towards Kamptee Road will be diverted from Sadar Residency Road. Traffic restrictions were also put in place on three more busy stretches to pave the way for a three-armed railway overbridge connecting Kadbi Chowk-Golibar Chowk with Santra Market. Though the deadline for completion of the ROB is 12 months, traffic police have enforced traffic restrictions for a month, which will end on December 16. During the period, two wheelers will be allowed to use the stretch from Kabdi Chowk to Motibagh railway crossing, while four-wheelers will be diverted from Sadar Residency Road. Similarly, traffic coming to Motibagh railway crossing from Golibar Chowk will be diverted to Kadbi Chowk via Central Avenue, Ramjhula Kingsway and Sadar Residency Road. The four-wheeler traffic will be completely closed on Santra Market to Guard Line Road, but two-wheelers will be allowed to ply. These two infrastructure works have started increasing traffic congestion in Sadar area, especially on Mangalwari ROB, Residency Road and beyond. Haphazard parking of vehicles is only adding to the woes of motorists as the Sadar traffic zone has taken no measures to ensure smooth movement of vehicles on this stretch. Traffic police have also restricted movement of vehicles on Dipti Signal railway crossing and Bhandewadi railway crossing to for construction of ROBs there. Traffic restrictions on these two roads will be in place till December 17, stated a press note issued by Dr Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/brace-for-traffic-chaos-cops-give-nod-to-shut-6-roads-for-infra-works/articleshow/87876388.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||IMS scam: ED attaches assets worth Rs 144 crore||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached assets worth Rs 144 crore in the multi-crore Insurance Medical Services (IMS) scam under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Apart from the properties of director of IMS Devika Rani and joint director K Padma, assets of their family members and suppliers of medicines have also been attached. The ED identified 131 immovable assets consisting of 97 open plots, six villas, 18 commercial shops, six agricultural land parcels and four flats in and around Hyderabad, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Bengaluru and Noida. The ED has also identified a large volume of movable assets in the form of securities and fixed deposits acquired by the accused. The ED attached Rs 17 crore from Devika, Rs 74 lakh from Padma, Rs 119 crore from K Srihari Babu, owner of Omni Medi company, Rs 4 crore from Pandiri Rajeshwar Reddy of Teja Pharma and Rs 2.4 crore from ESI Hospital pharmacist Kodali Nagalaxmi — all totalling Rs 144 crore. The charge against Devika is that she was in collusion with Padma and other staff of IMS, violated norms and prudent procedures and issued purchase orders to firms belonging to Srihari and to benami firms belonging to her and Rajeshwar. The ED alleged that medical items were purchased at grossly inflated rates, indents of dispensaries were fabricated and stock registers fabricated to siphon off the medicines. “Padma was siphoning off medicines and supplies in the name of organising medical camps. Patented products were sold in a cyclical manner and purchased by IMS at 4-5 times the normal market rate,” it said. Devika, Nagalaxmi and their families, in order to conceal the bribe money, had entered into a conspiracy with PMJ Jewellers and purchased jewellery worth Rs 6.28 crore without bills, the ED said. The ED also initiated a money laundering probe based on eight FIRs registered by the Anti Corruption Bureau against the accused for violations in the tendering process, misappropriation of government funds and causing loss to the state exchequer to the tune of more than Rs 211 crore. The ACB had arrested all the accused and all of them are on bail now. “The money laundering investigation has revealed that IMS director and other representatives and select suppliers pocketed huge amounts of bribes and profits running into more than Rs 200 crore from 2015-16 to 2018-19. These proceeds of crime have been well layered by showing excess profits or cash infusion in their personal bank accounts or accounts of various shell firms,” the ED said. The accused also gave huge cash advances to purchase prime real estate. Cash was also deposited in their bank accounts at regular intervals and the same was used to buy immovable properties. The ACB alleged that the accused conspired with local suppliers of medicines and medical equipment and issued purchase orders to select suppliers by deviating from the norms. The norms were issued in 2012 by the government to streamline the procurement process to prevent leakage of funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ims-scam-ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-144cr/articleshow/87876329.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar that the authorities have power to introduce such change and dismissed the petition. “The only argument is that in the past since the plot was reserved as recreational ground, it should have been retained as such and, at least, commensurate area should have been provided elsewhere for that purpose. This cannot be the scope of judicial review. It is the prerogative of the authority concerned and the change effected in the development plan, in one sense, is a matter of policy,” the bench said. “It is not the case of the petitioner that the change has been effected for some mala fide reason. Suffice it to observe that sufficient explanation has been offered in the reply affidavit, which justifies the need for change in land use in respect of Plot No.1. We find no reason to examine the matter further and therefore, put quietus to the entire issue by dismissing this petition summarily,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-sc-dismisses-plea-against-land-use-change-to-build-veeps-residence/articleshow/87877127.cms||---

The gas cylinder which exploded was a commercial cylinder. “It looks like someone failed to turn off the regulator at night after cooking. At around 4.45 am, one of the residents went to the washroom and opened the door, where the light was already switched on and this might have triggered the blast,” Gachibowli police said.

Gachibowli police inspector G Suresh said the case has been pending since 2017. “We are working to file the chargesheet as soon as possible,” he said. Healthcare facilitator Tareque Azam Choudhary of Choto Hossainpur Rajganj of Noakhali district in Bangladesh, who was arrested on September 8, 2011, in Dhaka, was accused of collecting kidneys from 30 poor Bangladeshis and allegedly selling them to patients in Singapore, Chennai and Vellore. In July 2016, Gokul Prem Kumar, general manager (international marketing), Continental Hospitals Limited, signed an agreement with Tareque Azam to pay him 20 per cent of the treatment bill as a ‘facilitation fee.’ As per the agreement, the hospital had agreed to indemnify and not hold Tareque Azam against any suits or claims brought by any third party against the hospital. Investigations have revealed that Tareque Azam was into illegal kidney business in Bangladesh since 2006. A whistleblower, S Praveen Kumar, a former doctor at Continental Hospitals, filed a complaint with director of medical education then. Dr Kumar alleged that his signature was forged on a note prepared for organ transplant of a patient from abroad. It was then that the agreement between Tareque Azam and the hospital came under the radar of police and DME.Gachibowli police lodged an FIR under the Human Organ Transplantation Act against three employees of Continental Hospitals, including Prem Kumar, for cheating and forgery under IPC sections. The case was kept under wraps all these years.

On reaching Ludhiana civil hospital, they had lodged a written complaint with chief medical officer SP Singh, saying they were tortured there. The inmates said two ‘babas’ ran the centre, which had no psychiatrist or pharmacist. “If someone gets ill, they give medicines on their own without consulting a doctor. Moreover, the staffers carry pistols. When an inmate speaks against them or demands food or medicine, the staffers beat them with the pistol butt. We were locked in a room. At times, we were given only a chapati with salt to eat,” they added.After receiving the complaint, the CMO had asked deputy medical commissioner Dr Surinder Singh to look into the allegations and submit a report.Dr Surinder Singh said, “Maharaja Ranjit Singh Rehabilitation Centre, Mullanpur, is unauthorised.

They had got the details of 10 other customers at the branch and were planning to defraud them. The anti-bank fraud section of the detective department had received a complaint from the bank about unauthorised transfer of money from a customer’s account on November 11. “The accused were aware that the victim would get SMS or email for transaction. So, they used various modes to steal the money,” said an officer. The three accused were produced in the court on Tuesday while the rest have already been remanded in police custody. “More arrests may be made in connection with this fraud,” said a deputy commissioner of the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/agency-staffer-six-others-held-for-rs-45-lakh-bank-fraud/articleshow/87876362.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The body was found stuck to a rock inside the waterfall basin, below the railway bridge on Sunday. Collem police, who got the autopsy done on Tuesday, said the forensic experts have said that the man could have died by drowning as he had bit his tongue which is widely found in cases of drowning. On Sunday evening, some trekkers had spotted the body while returning from the Dudhsagar falls, where they could see only the raised hands of the deceased. “The body had only a shirt and a t-shirt but no pants or under garments. This had led to the suspicion of foul play,” police said. Collem police inspector Prajyot S Fadte said the person could have drowned in a stream atop a hill from where the Dudhsagar originates and later the body could have flown down. “His clothes must have flown away with the force of the water,” he said, adding that the person could have died around 10 days ago as the body was decomposed. After the autopsy, the body has been preserved at the mortuary of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital at Bambolim and a case of unnatural death has been registered at the Collem police station. Police are verifying the records of missing persons from its counterparts to reveal his identity, the police inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dudhsagar-death-by-drowning-reveals-autopsy/articleshow/87877137.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For the Satara DCC bank, 11 directors had already been elected unopposed, including chairman of state legislative council Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar and Rajya Sabha MP Udayanraje Bhonsle. The election was held for the remaining 10 seats. Out of the 10, the Sahakar Panel backed by the MVA won six seats, and four independent candidates — mostly the rebels from MVA constituent parties — won the other seats. However, the NCP faced a jolt after former minister and sitting MLC Shashikant Shinde lost by one vote against rebel candidate Dyandeo Ranjane. Several of Shinde’s supporters pelted stones at the NCP office in Satara. Shinde, while apologising for his supporters’ behaviour, said the leaders within the party had conspired to defeat him and he will soon reveal their names. Another jolt for the MVA came with the defeat of Shiv Sena leader and minister of state for home Shamburaj Desai. He lost to independent candidate Satyajeetsinha Patankar. Desai said he contested the election despite knowing that he will be defeated. State cooperation minister and NCP leader Balasaheb Patil won. He was contesting for the first time for the DCC bank election. MVA parties retained power in Sangli DCC bank too. Out of 21 seats, MVA backed candidates won 17, and BJP-backed candidates won four seats. Congress was jolted by defeat of sitting MLA and district party president Vikramsinha Sawant. Congress leader Vishal Patil, the grandson of late chief minister Vasantdada Patil, managed to win among other candidates of Sena and NCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mva-panels-win-sangli-satara-dist-co-op-bank-polls/articleshow/87874356.cms||---

They include LD College of Engineering, Vishwakarma College of Engineering, IIT RAM and Rajkot Government Engineering College, among others. “More than 3,000 students had applied for 2,000 seats in government engineering colleges that got vacant after completion of few rounds of admission. These vacant seats were of meritorious students where the cut-off marks for admissions were high. After the reshuffle, 1,500 seats are still left vacant,” said sources in the admission committee. The 2,000 seats in government and grant-in-aid colleges for which reshuffling round was held included 584 seats that were empty after candidates took admission at Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NIT) after the Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) recently started admissions to undergraduate courses. These seats were taken by candidates who are among the top scorers in the state. They are mainly from the top government and grant-in-aid colleges in the field of computer science, IT and civil engineering where the cut-off marks are high, said sources. As a result, candidates seeking to change their field applied for these seats. For instance, a student who has enrolled for an IT course at a college of lower ranking was eligible for a civil engineering seat at LD College of Engineering (LDCE).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/acpc-faces-challenge-of-filling-1500-engg-seats/articleshow/87876364.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Pujara: Hope my good batting form continues in NZ series||Kanpur: Indian cricket team vice-captain Cheteshwar Pujara is hopeful that his batting form will continue in the two Test series against New Zealand. Pujara was one of the pillars of the Indian team’s success in the Test series in England earlier this year. India had beaten England by 2-1. Due to his 227 runs in the four tests against England, he was made vice-captain of the Indian team. During a virtual media conference, when he was asked what had changed, his mind or batting style, he said his mind was different in the England test series. “I was just fearless, there is no change in my batting technique,” he added. So far, the preparations for the two Test series against Kiwis have been good and I would play without fear against the visiting team, Pujara said. When asked that he had not played a three figure innings since 2019, he said it was not a problem. “It is good if my 90 and 80 runs helped the team to win. Earlier, I used to put too much pressure on myself which changed since I scored 91 and 61 at Leeds and Oval,” he said. “As far as my hundred is concerned, it will happen when it has to happen. My job is to bat well for the team and it is not that I haven't been scoring runs. As long as I am batting well and contributing to the team, I am not bothered about my hundred. It's a matter of one innings," he said. “One doesn't need to put too much pressure on self. Just go out and enjoy the game rather than worrying too much about what’s going to happen. Our experience and playing at home will help us,” Pujara said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pujara-hope-my-good-batting-form-continues-in-nz-series/articleshow/87877134.cms||अनंत नारायण

One of the applicants, Mohammed Abdul Shakeel, a coma patient at a private hospital in Old City, was discharged owing to monetary issues. However, Shakeel’s relatives wanted to avail CM relief fund and had applied for income certificate online. Unfortunately, the application was turned down citing insufficient documents even though the medical certificates and related documents were submitted. “We had applied for the income certificate for my brother Mohammed Abdul Shakeel, who is in coma. More than Rs 4 lakh has been spent on his treatment so far and we need more money for further treatment. However, when we approached the CM’s camp office to avail CM relief fund, we were told to get the income certificate. So, we applied for the income certificate but authorities rejected the application even though we attached all the required documents,” Mohammed Abdul Shakir, the applicant’s brother, told TOI. Mohammed Ahmed, GHMC vice-president, minority cell, TTDP told TOI that there is no respite for applicants from unexpected problems being faced for the caste and income certificates. “I have submitted representations to the higher-ups in this regard and requested them to launch an inquiry against Bahadurpura mandal tahsildar. Many applications are being rejected citing lack of documents. Though the matter was brought to the notice of the officials concerned, the issue persists,” Ahmed said. Bahadurpura MRO S Ramulu told TOI that he would look into the matter and find out the reasons behind the rejection of the applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patients-income-cert-application-rejected-kin-cry-foul/articleshow/87876361.cms||---

In his meeting with employee unions and BJP leaders Gopichand Padalkar and Sadabhau Khot on Tuesday, transport minister Anil Parab said that the committee has been given 12 weeks to submit its report. The state government, he said, does not want that the strike is stretched till then, so a proposal of an interim solution was given to them. “They have responded positively to the proposal given by the state government, and it was decided that they will come back tomorrow (Wednesday) for another round of meetings when a final decision will be taken,” said Parab. He said that the state government will agree to whatever report the committee submits, but this proposal is aimed at ending the strike as it is causing a lot of incovenience to commuters. Padalkar had earlier in the day given the state government two days’ ultimatum to take a decision on the the demands of the striking employees or they would march to mantralaya and not allow anyone to enter the state secretariat building. The total number of suspended MSRTC employees has risen to 3,052. So far, services of 645 workers, mainly daily wagers including drivers and conductors, have been terminated.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana counsel: Cops didn’t kill 4 accused deliberately||HYDERABAD: The four accused in the Disha rape and murder case were taken to Chattanpally in the early hours under armed police escort to keep them safe from any mob fury and their subsequent deaths were due to unexpected turn of events, forcing cops to fire in self-defence, according to Supreme Court advocate Lata Krishnamurti who appeared for the state before the SC-appointed inquiry commission on Tuesday. The state’s counsel read various parts of the Special Investigation Team’s (SIT) report on the alleged encounter to argue that the killings were not a deliberate attempt to liquidate the four accused. When commission chairman asked advocate Krishnamurti to explain why the accused were taken out at 3.30 am on December 6 to recover Disha’s articles, she referred to the public fury over the rape and murder case and how people were baying for blood. She said that to keep the accused safe police had taken their custody from Cherlapally prison late in the night on December 4, shifted them to the safe house at Mirjapur and then taken the four to Chattanpally during the early hours to recover Disha’s articles with the protection of armed police escort. Reading from the SIT report, the advocate cited the TSFSL ballistic and serology reports, which mention traces of Gun Shot Residue (GSR) found in the swabs collected from Md Arif and C Chennakeshavulu, to claim that the accused were not killed at close range. Subsequently, the commission members asked the state’s counsel why the gist of statements of ACP V Surender and CI K Narasimha Reddy in the SIT report does not mention that mud, dust or soil was thrown in the eyes of the police by the accused at the time of recovery of Disha’s articles. The state’s counsel stated that it was mentioned in the 161 CrPC statements of the members of the police party. Pointing to a paragraph in the SIT report where it was stated that “D1 to D4 promised that they will show material objects hidden at Chattanpally,” when commission chairman V S Sirpurkar commented that the said paragraph was incorrect as the accused could not have used such a language, advocate Krishnamurti responded that the investigating officer (IO) had summarised the confessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-counsel-cops-didnt-kill-4-accused-deliberately/articleshow/87876350.cms||Mahesh Buddi

The minister proposed that the runway resurfacing be deferred to January 20 instead of beginning it from January 3, 2022, as scheduled, due to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS).

SVPI airport authorities will require an approval from the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), to reschedule the runway recarpeting activity. If approved, this will be the third time that the planned runway resurfacing activity is rescheduled. SVPI airport authorities may also decide to further defer the deadline. According to the original plan, it is scheduled to be held between January 3 and May 31, 2022. An email query about the issue sent to Adani Airports elicited no response. When resurfacing begins, the runway will be closed for flights from 9am to 6pm, which means flights will operate either before 9am or after 6pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/min-wants-runway-work-after-vibrant/articleshow/87876371.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Ludhiana health department has issued them directions to send the samples of the suspected patients to the civil hospital and only after re-testing, a person will be declared positive. The decision was taken after it came to the knowledge of the health officials that some laboratories and nursing homes were using unrecognized tests. Ludhiana chief medical officer SP Singh said, “Some small hospitals, nursing homes and private laboratories are doing rapid antigen tests, which are not recognized by the health department for confirming a dengue case. These tests were creating unnecessary panic. The department approves only the Elisa test for it.” “All the private laboratories, nursing homes and hospitals doing antigen tests have been directed to send samples to the civil hospital for re-testing, after which the health department will declare a patient dengue positive,” added the CMO. The health officer said prominent hospitals, like Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and Christian Medical College and Hospital, were doing Elisa tests, so they were not required to send samples for re-testing. 19 cases reported The district saw 19 dengue cases on Tuesday. Of these, 11 were from the urban areas and eight from the rural. With this, the total count of dengue cases of the district has reached 1,732 and suspected cases are 4,383.

The party which had in principle decided to enter the electoral fray against K Kavitha, daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, from Nizamabad MLC seat, did not field any candidate. Though Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) working president Mahesh Kumar Goud was supposed to file his nominations to give a contest to Kavitha, the party backtracked from its decision after the feedback from local leaders that the Congress candidate may not be able to get a respectable number of votes. Likewise, the Congress leadership decided not to contest from Nalgonda and Warangal MLC seats too on the advice of the local leadership. As a result, the Congress ended up filing nominations from only two of the total 12 MLC seats going to polls on December 10. While T Nirmala Reddy, wife of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president and Sanga Reddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy filed her nomination for Medak MLC seat, Rayala Nageswara Rao filed his nomination from Khammam MLC seat. Though Congress does not have numbers to defeat the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Jayaprakash Reddy said they will try to give a tough fight as a large number of MPTCs, ZPTCs and councillors were unhappy with the ruling party and may vote for Congress candidates and give them a decent vote count.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-to-contest-only-2-seats-after-feedback/articleshow/87876377.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Kalpetta man gets 5-year RI term for bid to join IS||KOCHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, on Tuesday, sentenced a man to five years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) for travelling to Afghanistan in a bid to join the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS). Nashidul Hamzafar (29), a native of Kalpetta in Wayanad, admitted that he was guilty of the charges raised against him and the court chaired by judge Anil Bhaskar convicted him. Hamzafar was sentenced to three years of RI under IPC Section 120 B for conspiracy, five years of RI and Rs 10,000 fine under IPC Section 125 for waging war against any Asiatic power in alliance with the government of India. He will have to serve five years of RI under Section 38 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for the offence related to taking membership in a terrorist organisation and five years RI under Section 39 of UAPA for supporting a terrorist organisation. The sentences will run concurrently. Hamzafar was arrested in Sept 2018 and was lodged in prison since then as he did not receive bail. The court said that the period of his jail stay, before the verdict, will be accounted for. Hence, he will have to undergo RI for one year and 10 months now. However, following the verdict, he was shifted to the high-security prison at Viyyur. Hamzafar, a BBM graduate who was working in Bengaluru, decided to join IS along with 15 persons from Kasaragod. They left for Afghanistan in Oct 2017. Hamzafar and his friend from Wayanad, tried to reach Afghanistan via Iran. However, his friend abandoned the plan before entering Afghanistan. Though Hamzafar crossed the border, he was caught by Afghan police and detained in Kabul prison. In Sept 2018, he was extradited to India and NIA recorded his arrest. During the course of investigation, Hamzafar’s friend turned an approver in the case. Most of the other accused in the case, who reached Afghanistan, were killed in the war. Three women among them were detained at a Kabul prison but their latest whereabouts are unknown . After pronouncing the verdict, NIA judge Anil wished Hamzafar a bright future in open court. He advised him to support his father, who is a cancer survivor and mother, who is bedridden, after serving prison time. “He is a young man and I hope he understands his family’s situation. Religion is for individuals who can choose which faith to follow. But when it comes to society, the Constitution is the religion,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kalpetta-man-gets-5-year-ri-term/articleshow/87877154.cms||---

The court has sought his explanation within four weeks. Reddy recently quit civil service to join the TRS. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy was hearing the criminal contempt case referred to them by Justice T Vinod Kumar who, while hearing a writ petition filed by a resident of Siddipet in the first week of November, felt that Reddy’s action and remarks were contemptuous. According to the writ petition before the single judge, then Siddipet collector Venkatrama Reddy held a meeting on October 26 with agriculture officers and seed dealers. Reddy’s language turned stern while addressing seed dealers. “Do not sell paddy seeds to farmers. If you sell, your licence will be cancelled. Even if you secure stay orders from the high court and Supreme Court, I will not implement them,” the writ petition said highlighting essence of Reddy’s warnings. The single judge observed that the collector was forgetting that he too may have to knock on the doors of the HC for justice one day. “He should not have displayed such scant regard towards courts,” the single judge said while concluding that his remarks prima facie constituted a criminal contempt case. As a single judge is not empowered to initiate a criminal contempt case, he referred the matter to the registry with a request to place it before the Chief Justice. When matter came up before the CJ bench on Tuesday, advocate general BS Prasad urged court to give them an opportunity to explain their case. “We sought the same before the single judge, but it was not allowed. The collector would have tendered an unconditional apology to the court at that time itself after explaining his case from the right perspective. We will do the same before this court now,” he said. Bench gave him four weeks to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mlc-gets-4-weeks-to-clear-stand-in-contempt-case/articleshow/87876385.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Retired cop cites CCTV footage to claim son framed by NCB||MUMBAI: Retired assistant commissioner of police Anant Kenjale, whose 28-year-old son Shreyas was arrested in a drugs case in June, on Tuesday cited the CCTV footage recovered from his building to challenge the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) allegations in the special NDPS court. Kenjale claimed that his son was falsely implicated. Shreyas alleged that panchnama nowhere mentions that NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede was briefly in the house during the alleged raid. NCB has alleged that 6.8gm of LSD blots and 300gm of marijuana were found in Shreyas’s Goregaon flat on June 21. Kenjale said since his dog was upset with unknown people—NCB officers—in their house, he took him down for a walk where he saw Wankhede. The next day, Shreyas was detained. Kenjale said as he was not allowed to his to meet his son or given reasons for his detention, he sent an email to NCB. “Within some time, I got a call from an unknown number. My son was made to speak to me...[the caller] told me that I had made a big mistake by se-nding the e-mail; the agency is angry and they will make a huge case against me,” he said. Shreyas, in his plea, claim-ed, “The CCTV recordings demolish the bona fides of the pr-osecution’s panchnama.” He said contrary to panchnama, NCB panchas were not in his flat from 9.30pm to 11.30pm and urged the court to take the footage on record. In another plea on retracting his statement, he said, “At NCB office I was forced to sign on pages on 3-4 occasions. I was in a lot of pain as I had a leg fracture. Due to the pain and threats to implicate my family, I signed on many pages out of fear...I was not made aware of the contents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-cop-cites-cctv-footage-to-claim-son-framed-by-ncb/articleshow/87877810.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Hyderabad||‘India made gains in food production’||HYDERABAD: Agriculture scientists and experts said on Tuesday that India has made significant gains towards increasing food and crop output to feed a population of 1.3 billion people. To feed the entire population, India has boosted food production threefold and horticulture and fish output tenfold each. V Praveen Rao, vice-chancellor of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University, said at the 5th International Agronomy Congress: “It is a matter of pride for the country. We should also have a plan in place to face the challenges of increasing foodgrains production and to provide food to the entire population.” Professor Trilochan Mohapatra, director-general of ICAR, said agronomy was a vital aspect of agriculture. “We now have a surplus of agricultural produce. Agricultural exports have surged by more than 40% when compared to last year,” he explained. Export of wheat, basmati rice, sugarcane goods and cotton had increased tremendously. “However, there is a need to boost oilseed production because we continue to import oil and need to raise its production,” he said. D Samunder Singh, president of International Weed Science Society in Brazil, said the Indian agricultural scenario had transformed from a ‘begging bowl’ to a ‘surplus state’. He advocated for deployment of robotics and drones in agriculture for optimum input utilisation.  PV Vara Prasad, president of Crop Science Society of America underlined the importance of developing technologies that were inclusive and accessible to all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/india-made-gains-in-food-production/articleshow/87876411.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Some of the accused were arrested after the shop owner, Debasish Kundu, lodged a complaint with Kalighat police station. Cops said they are trying to recover the stolen chain and purse. In the complaint, Kundu stated that the accused had entered his house forcefully and demanded money to bless a newborn. Though his family members told them repeatedly that no child was born in the house, they refused to leave. When Kundu rushed to his house from the shop, he found that the gold chain and purse had been snatched by the accused. This incident happened barely two months after Prasad Ranjan Das, a retired government employee, and his wife, Malabsree, were held hostage in Bhowanipore by a group of transgenders who had demanded Rs 51,000 as a gift for the birth of the couple’s granddaughter. According to sources, the eunuchs, who had come to Kundu’s house, were not from the local area. “We are trying to find whether the same gang was involved in the incident on Tuesday,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gold-purse-snatched-by-eunuchs/articleshow/87876412.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Tadoba wants NTCA to withdraw transect method||TIGER CENSUSNagpur: The Tadoba and Andhari Tiger Reserve management is writing to the National Tiger Conservation Authority to withdraw the transect line methodology for tiger enumeration. Under this method, forest guards, labourers and officials have to walk several kilometres in core areas teeming with carnivores.On Saturday last, forest guard Swati Dhumne was killed by tigress ‘Maya’ while she and a three-member team was laying the transect line for the fifth cycle of All India Tiger Estimation (AITE). The results, which will reveal the number of tigers in the country, are to be declared next year. It will also throw up the presence of other carnivores, prey species and tiger habitats.Faced with criticism on the lack of safety for staff, the park management immediately suspended the exercise. “The transect line methodology was introduced in 2006 when the entire tiger population of Sariska was wiped out. In the last 15 years, several new technologies like advanced camera traps, MSTrIPES, GIS-based patrolling module, drones, thermal imaging etc have been introduced. We need to modify our techniques giving importance to staff safety,” say Tadoba officials.Wildlife activists said the forest labourers are daily wagers and “the NTCA should insure workers part of the exercise”. “We should go in for 100% camera trapping,” they say.Highly placed sources said that sanctuaries are not going in for a new data. “No one is making their 2021 Phase IV data official. It was completed this summer and data compiled by August-September. This same data will be used for AITE-2022.”Those involved in the exercise say this data will be used to understand carnivore density only. It is being done as the NTCA has set a stringent deadline to complete the fifth cycle and the results have to be announced on July 29, 2022, which is the World Tiger Day, they said.Some wildlife experts said the line transect method is better applied in open landscapes and not in densely forested forests like Tadoba. “The probability does not give number per species per terrain per season and the of accuracy cannot be calculated. Moreover, human error cannot be avoided,” they say.Wildlife conservationists and biologists involved in the exercise said that the 5th estimation cycle is fully digital. “It is being done with the help of MSTrIPES, a GIS-based patrolling module, which has an inbuilt ‘ecological’ app. The entire field data related to transect lines will be loaded in this app. There is no replacement to the transect method.”They further said that the Dhume case is an accident and “can happen with anyone patrolling on foot”. “For one incident, the methodology for all tiger states cannot be changed. Tigers cannot be counted with help of drones in Indian forest landscape,” they say. PREVALENT METHODSLINE TRANSECT* Quantifies ungulate abundance in an area based on visual encounters while walking along 2km fixed-line transects. 1-2 persons walk on each line. Records are kept of all herbivores and other listed wildlife seen during the walk. Each animal sighting number, time, species, group size, pellets, dung, scats etc has to be recorded. Vegetation and tree species also have to be recordedCAMERA TRAPSUses the capture-mark-recapture framework. Involves photographing individuals uniquely identifiable by their pelage patterns. Sampling carried out simultaneously in a minimum block of 200 sqkm. Cameras deployed in a grid of 2sqkm. In each grid, a double-sided camera trap operated for 25 days. The distance between two adjacent trap stations is between 0.8 to 2 km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-wants-ntca-to-withdraw-transect-method/articleshow/87876416.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Will probe if trees have been cut illegally: NMC tells citizens||Nagpur: The public hearing on felling of trees in the city turned out to be a stormy affair on Tuesday morning, with infuriated citizens holding their ground against rampant destruction of green cover in the name of development. While initially officials of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) garden department tried to go for individual hearings, citizens insisted for a public hearing to “ensure transparency and accountability.” Amidst heated arguments, citizens presented satellite images of the area opposite Futala Lake, which were recently published by TOI. Countering authorities’ claims that only around 28 trees were cut, citizens questioned, “Even a layman can look at the images and tell that hundreds of trees have been chopped off. Why was MahaMetro allowed to start the project without getting environment clearance?” TOI had reported on Tuesday that NMC had granted permission to MahaMetro to fell 16 trees in the area. Pointing out to the amended state Tree Act, activists said, “Why is permission being granted in bits and pieces for the Futala project. This is against the new norms. Also, why didn’t NMC conduct public hearing before giving nod to cut the trees?” With the citizens unanimously demanding strict action against MahaMetro and private contractor DP Jain, NMC’s garden superintendent Amol Chorpagar and other officials reportedly assured citizens that an inquiry will be conducted. “We will look into the matter and if we find that trees have been cut illegally, we will file an FIR,” the citizens were told. Another mass objection was against large-scale tree felling proposed in the lush green premises of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) for Ajni metro station’s parking area. Clarifying that as the felling would probably include over 200 trees, civic officials reportedly told citizens that the matter would be in the hands of State Tree Authority as per the amended rules. TOI tried to contact NMC officials, but could not get a response. Right after the public hearing, the citizens went straight to Ambazari police station and filed a complaint against MahaMetro. Senior inspector Ashok Bagul of Ambazari police station said complaint from the environmentalists has been received and is being looked into. “The tree plantation officer of NMC is conducting the hearing. The report is awaited. We would have to refer to the report before taking any action,” he said, adding due importance is being given to the issues raised by both the sides. “The report of the environmentalists would be sent for legal opinion. We will also refer it to the supervisory level officers and wait for their instructions,” said Bagul, adding relevant provisions related to the trees in the urban setting would be referred to for dealing with the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-probe-if-trees-have-been-cut-illegally-nmc-tells-citizens/articleshow/87876434.cms||Manka Behl

---||Delhi||Our dengue concerns fell on deaf ears, Delhi HC slams officials||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday castigated the authorities over the spread of dengue, noting that concerns flagged by it have “fallen on deaf ears.” It warned that while it has been taking the municipal corporations and Delhi government to task on the issue of delayed or non-payment of salaries to staffers, it cannot be that “only salaries are paid but no work (is done)”. A bench comprising justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh demanded an explanation from South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) why the city this year witnessed a “big surge” in the number of dengue cases, which resulted in several fatalities. It sought an affidavit from the corporation on the steps taken by it to control mosquito breeding, while hearing SDMC’s plea against Delhi government’s decision to seek retrospective recovery of grants-in-aid from civic bodies. “Is it that the municipality has given up everything and it is only to collect taxes and disburse salaries? We will not entertain this petition. How do they expect salaries if they don’t do work,” it further said. “Obviously your mosquito checkers, breeders are doing nothing. They are not going to the ground. Probably they are just marking their attendance and you are paying them, that’s all… How many of them have been given a show cause for dereliction of duty?” the bench wondered. It appears that the observations have fallen on deaf ears, the court added, highlighting that since October 6, 2021, when it first raised concern over the spread of dengue, the situation in the city has only worsened. “How can it be that every year dengue is increasing? Is it not a municipal function? We are at pains to understand what is happening?” the court questioned the counsel for SDMC. “Let an affidavit be filed within two weeks by the petitioner (SDMC) disclosing what steps have been taken on the ground and not just on paper,” the court ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/our-dengue-concerns-fell-on-deaf-ears-hc-slams-officials/articleshow/87876417.cms||---

Cops and lawyers said they faced problems in communicating with the victim and the accused and sought the help of interpreters for the probe. That is why, it took longer time to arrest the accused, they said. The four were produced in a Sealdah court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till November 26. An investigating officer appealed before the court to deploy an interpreter for the probe. The woman had first lodged the complaint in July against one of the accused, with whom she had a relationship for seven years. After she had walked out of the relationship that strained over the years, the man and his friends abused her. Later, the woman alleged that she had been sexually abused by the man and his three friends against her wishes. Following a confessional statement before the magistrate at a Sealdah court last week, cops introduced rape charges against the accused. “The investigation of this case is complicated as we have to seek the help of an interpreter for every step, be it recording the victim’s statement or questioning the accused,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deaf-mute-woman-gang-raped-four-held/articleshow/87876418.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Filed by a group of residents of Jangpura, the plea said no wine shop was permitted to be opened within 100 metres of any educational or religious place and hospital. Justice Yashwant Varma asked the government’s counsel to take instructions on the issue and said the bench would consider issuing notice to the licence holder of the wine shop only after getting the response of the Delhi government and the excise department. The petitioners said the proposal of the opening of the wine or beer shop at a particular location in the colony was against the provisions of relevant laws, rules. The plea added that in terms of a clause of the Delhi Excise Policy and the Delhi Excise Rules, 2010, no wine/beer shop is permitted to be opened within 100 metres of any major educational institutions, religious places and hospitals with 50 beds and above. “The proposal of the opening of a wine/beer shop at the said place is taken without adhering to the aforesaid provisions of rules as there are not only more than one religious places like temple, gurudwara but also school and hospital.

The directions were given by Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor to register a case, said advocate Mohd Irshad, appearing for Atishi. The complaint alleged that the fabricated video was published on social media to cause provocation against the CM amongst the farmers, who repose strong faith in him.

---||Pune||Think out-of-the-box to boost inoculation: Centre||Pune: The Centre’s latest directive to states on efforts to boost vaccination against Covid-19 calls for innovative ideas to motivate and mobilise those still left out, while many districts in Maharashtra are using coercive techniques to speed up the inoculation. In a letter issued on Monday to the health secretaries of all states, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan called for mobilising the population to get vaccinated under the Har Gha Dastak initiative, on till November 30, through persuasive measures by appointing local ambassadors, sending messages on cellphone for vaccination or giving badges to those vaccinated at workplaces. The directive assumes significance in the state in the wake of the recent order of the Aurangabad collector making one jab mandatory to purchase fuel or ration and travel by private buses. The Nagpur administration decided to withhold salaries of unvaccinated staffers and so did the Thane municipal corporation. “But the Centre has clearly called for persuasion and not coercion, and districts cannot use such tactics,” said a senior health official from the public health department on the latest directive from the Centre. The letter issued by the Union health secretary nowhere talked about any coercions to push up vaccination. It instead urged states to identify the beneficiaries left out and mobilise them to get vaccinated on a priority basis. “Strategies to nudge those yet to be vaccinated could be taken up through involvement of local immunization ambassadors, reminders through IVR messages for the second dose and even badges at workplaces for vaccination,” stated the letter. The state has so far completed 78% first dose vaccination. But only about 13 districts are above the state average in administering the first dose. Mumbai and Pune top the list. Beed and Nandurbar continue to grapple with below-60% vaccination coverage for the first dose. The state’s daily vaccination average was around 9-10 lakh last month. It dropped to 5-7 lakh daily in November. “We have eight days to go for the Har Ghar Dastak programme and we shall be intensifying the drive. We want to conduct 8-9 lakh vaccinations daily,” a state public health official said on Tuesday. The state had administered 10.77 crore vaccine doses till November 22. Of them, 7.14 crore are first dose and 3.62 crore are the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/think-out-of-the-box-to-boost-inoculation-centre/articleshow/87876435.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Meanwhile, the body was sent for postmortem. “We have arrested the driver of bus,” BS Chauhan, sub-inspector at Civil Lines police station, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/40-year-old-dies-after-bus-hits-bike/articleshow/87873691.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Dehradun||Teerth purohits protest against Char Dham Board outside ministers' residences in Doon||Dehradun: A day after the core committee of the Char Dham Priests’ Association met to chalk out a strategy regarding the agitation against the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act, teerth purohits have begun a sit-in protest outside the residence of state ministers at Yamuna Colony in Dehradun. They are demanding the withdrawal of the Act, which has brought over 50 temples, including the Char Dham shrines, under the state government’s control. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, said, "We will continue to stage protests in a democratic way till the time the Act is withdrawn. On November 27, we are going to hold a rally in Lucknow from Gandhi Park to the Secretariat." He said protests would intensify if the Act is not withdrawn by November 30. Sati added, "Our opinion was not sought before the Act was framed, which is why it holds no meaning to us." The priests of Char Dham have been at loggerheads with the government on the issue since December 2019, when the Act was passed amid heavy protests from the Indian National Congress in the state assembly. During his brief tenure as the chief minister, Tirath Singh Rawat removed several smaller temples from under the Act's umbrella. He had also said that the decision regarding the Board would be reviewed. Afterward, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, during his visit to Uttarkashi on July 15, announced the review of the Act. A committee was formed on August 15, headed by Manohar Kant Dhyani, former Rajya Sabha MP, to look into the matter and recommend changes. The Char Dham priests have a sizable population in 17 assembly seats in the Garhwal region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/teerth-purohits-protest-against-char-dham-board-outside-ministers-residences-in-doon/articleshow/87873706.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Ahmedabad||45 of 500 illegal drains sealed; GPCB and AMC eye more units||Ahmedabad: A survey by the civic body of the Naroda, Narol, Odhav and Vatva industrial clusters revealed that there are more than 500 drainage connections at industrial estates in these areas that are allegedly injecting their untreated industrial effluent illegally into the municipal drainage network. A team of 45 engineers and workers from the civic body as well as the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), equipped with litmus paper, acid testing kits and plumbing tools were digging up drainage chambers and junctions to see how the factories had installed 300mm pipes to inject their waste into municipal drains, which ultimately drain into the Sabarmarti river. Till Tuesday, a total of 45 such connections were sealed. “The AMC’s sewage treatment plants are not designed to handle industrial effluent,” says a senior AMC official. On how industrial units were able to freely inject their toxic waste into domestic drains, the official said, “Over the past two decades we provided factories connections for sewage only, as there are workers who need drinking water and toilets etc. In a few years, these units began pumping their waste into these domestic connections, instead of sending them to the common effluent treatment plant (CETP),” added a senior AMC official. Pathik Patwari, senior vice president of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), said, “The AMC may seal the discharge pipelines of units that are illegal. However, it does not have any right to tamper with waste water discharge pipelines of units that are set up legally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/45-of-500-illegal-drains-sealed-gpcb-and-amc-eye-more-units/articleshow/87876426.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra to step up drive to use 2.55 crore Covid vaccine doses allocated in November||PUNE: The allocation of 2.55 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to Maharashtra in November — the highest so far in a month — could push up the state’s pending stock of 1 crore shots, but the government authorities are steadfast on exhausting them through intensified vaccination under the Har Ghar Dastak programme and planned immunization camps. Of the monthly allocation, the state has already received 1.75 core doses. Of them, 1.25 crore were Covishield and 50.25 lakh Covaxin doses. About 1 core doses, officials claimed, had been administered in Maharashtra so far in November. Another 80.22 lakh doses would reach the state before the end of the month, triggering uncanny fear of vaccine wastage in some quarters. To utilise these doses, the state health department are conducting intensified vaccination drives in laggard districts by organising camps and ensuring that maximum people were covered under the initiative. “We have administered around 1.2 crore doses till now in November as we have had on an average about 5-6 lakh vaccinations daily. We should easily do 9-10 lakh vaccinations daily in the coming days through various initiatives as we have even rolled out workplace vaccination,” said a senior officer of the state health department. Some districts are taking coercive measures to ramp up vaccination and exhaust the stock. The Aurangabad district administration on Tuesday made one dose of Covid vaccine mandatory for those looking to travel by private buses. Autorickshaw drivers and other private transport vehicle operators in the district had also been directed to get at least partially vaccinated before November 25, failing which, they would not be allowed to ferry passengers. While Covid vaccination is mandatory for the workforce of private bus services, the Aurangabad RTO (regional transport office) has been given the responsibility to ensure compliance. “Autorickshaws and other vehicles, whose owners or drivers are not vaccinated, will be seized as disciplinary move besides penal action,” the district administration said. The administration iterated that partial vaccination was compulsory for the employees of different establishments such as hotels, bars and liquor shops. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan issued another order on Tuesday, asking the fuel pumps to deploy dedicated employees — with the MobileGuru app on their cellphones — to check the authenticity of the customers’ vaccination certificates. The order stated that after verification, a fuel station worker should issue a token to the customer and stamp it. The customer should then take the token to another worker, who would verify the stamp and the token before selling fuel. Festivities played a dampener in vaccination in the state in the initial weeks of November, pushing up the number of pending doses to about 1 crore. It was being intensified again through the Har Ghar Dastak programme, stated health officials. Recently, state health minister Rajesh Tope had also met the central health minister, requesting the later to reduce the gap of Covishield doses. “We had requested to reduce the gap so that second dose beneficiaries could be given the jab at the earliest. But the Centre has not changed the gap, citing technical reasons,” Tope had told TOI after the meeting. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed some districts and set a target to ensure 100% first dose Covid vaccination of the beneficiaries.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Help with Rs 50k debt dies on roof of ex-employer, locals go on rampage||KOLKATA: A 32-year-old woman was found hanging on the terrace of her former employer’s house at North Purbachal on Monday evening, leading to her family and neighbours—almost 130 of them—descending on the neighbourhood near Kasba connector, hurling bricks at the house and vandalizing a vehicle. Victim Ruma Ghosh’s family alleged foul play and police also registered a murder case though sources confirmed on Tuesday evening that initial postmortem opinion concluded her injuries were ante mortem and so, it was likely to be a suicide. Ruma, a resident of Purba Rajdanga who used to work for Narayani Malakar (57), had gone to their flat around 6.15pm on Monday, seeking employment. Around 7pm, it was Narayani, who reportedly discovered her body hanging from a pole on the terrace. As the news spread, Ruma’s family and neighbours went on the rampage, alleging she was murdered as she had failed to repay a loan of Rs 50,000. The Garfa police initially lodged a rioting FIR against Ruma’s family and also registered a murder case against Narayani early on Tuesday, after a written complaint from Ruma’s husband. According to police, Ruma used to work for Narayani, who now lived alone in her top-floor flat of the three-storey building, after her husband died recently. He was a senior bank official. One of her sons lives in London and the other in Hyderabad. Narayani had discontinued Ruma’s services after the pandemic broke out and when Ruma went to her on Monday, she reportedly refused to employ her again, saying she did not need additional help. Ruma, recalled neighbours, was seen pleading that she needed job to sustain her family, which included her husband, a rickshawpuller, and two kids below 10 years. After Ruma left, Narayani reportedly went to the terrace to pick up clothes when she saw her hanging. “Ruma was found hanging from a bamboo structure meant for drying clothes. She used a saree. Narayani called the other residents, who alerted police. Ruma was taken to SSKM, where she was declared brought dead,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. Soon after police took the body away, at least 130 Rajdanga slum dwellers converged on the building, smashed a car of a flat resident, and hurled stones and bricks at the Malakars’ home, said Khan. A few bricks also landed in the other flats in the building. The vandalism continued for several minutes before cops reached the spot again and resorted to lathi charge. “They vandalized flower pots on the terrace and staircase. A case of rioting was lodged by police suo motu,” Khan said. Neighbours claimed Ruma’s neighbours argued and threatened for close to two hours. Early on Tuesday, Ruma’s husband, Surojit Ghosh (35), told police Ruma had borrowed Rs 50,000 from Narayani’s husband to build a house but could not repay it. Surojit claimed Narayani had called Ruma to discuss the loan. He claimed she was assaulted and murdered and then hanged to pass it off as a suicide. “Treating the said letter of complaint as FIR, we have lodged a separate murder case,” said Khan. Cops said they were waiting for a detailed postmortem report to decide on their next step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/help-with-rs-50k-debt-dies-on-roof-of-ex-employer-locals-go-on-rampage/articleshow/87876445.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Private hospitals in Maharashtra seek revision of 80:20 bed quota order||PUNE: Private hospitals have sought a revision of the state government’s 80:20 bed allocation order issued in September. With active cases coming down and less hospitalisation in the state, private hospitals said the government should revise the order. The September order stated it was applicable until “further orders”. While each collector has been allowed to change the ratio to 50:50, depending on the need and the Covid situation, the order also needs to be looked into, stated hospital representatives. Senior state government officials said there has been no discussion on the review yet. “It is yet to be taken up for review even as cases have come down,” an official said. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India,said as Covid cases are decreasing, authorities should revise the 80:20 rule for Covid admission, and also capping of hospital rates for Covid patients. “We should have dedicated Covid or infectious disease hospitals to manage further outbreak. There is a need to take the opinion of all stakeholders in future,” he said. Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble hospital, and a member of the hospital association, said the order needs to be re-examined. Manjusha Kulkarni, secretary, association of hospitals, Pune, said the state should review the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-hosps-seek-revision-of-8020-bed-quota-order/articleshow/87876441.cms||Nisha Nambiar

According to the district health office authorities, they are trying to identify the unvaccinated people and get them inoculated at the nearest vaccination centre under the drive. Abhay Tidke, additional district health officer, Pune ZP, said, “Under the ‘Har ghar dastak’ drive, we want to speed up the vaccination with regards to the pending first dose.

Some independents alleged TRS activists tore their nomination papers twice. It all started when Telangana State MPTCs Forum president Sailaja Satyanarayana Reddy along with her proposers reached the collectorate to file her nomination. At the same time, TRS MLC candidates — Patnam Mahender Reddy and Shambirpur Raju — along with their supporters also landed at the collectorate to file their second set of nominations. As tempers ran high, TRS workers stopped Sailaja’s supporters from entering the collectorate and tore her nomination papers. She approached district collector Amoy Kumar, who asked her to submit another set of nomination papers. Sailaja and her supporters alleged that second set of nomination papers was also taken away by supporters of Mahender, who is contesting as an MLC.  Sailaja and her supporters sat on dharna. “These incidents took place in front of the collector when we tried to give second set of nomination papers,” Telangana Panchayat Raj Chamber president Ch Satyanarayana Reddy said. Reddy said he would lodge a complaint with ECI. Meanwhile, another independent Chalika Chandrasekhar from Serilingampally managed to file nomination.

Speaking to he media in Thane last week, he said the department was working out a plan to procure a disputed land belonging to a now defunct engineering company spread over 100 acres in Kalwa (east). The company had shut down few decades back and the issue of compensating its stakeholders is still pending in Court. “The land is under litigation but Mhada is ready to settle the dues and purchase the land to construct one of Maharashtra’s biggest housing projects comprising 29,000 flats for the low, middle and high income group. In addition, nearby slum settlements and encroachments could also be brought under the fold,” said Awhad.

For the first time post Covid-induced restrictions, the number of daily passengers in city buses has crossed the 1 lakh mark. A senior official from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s transport department confirmed, “After almost 21 months, the number of passengers travelling in the Aapli Bus fleet in a day surpassed 1 lakh, and was recorded at 1.06 lakh.” It was in early March 2020, when the Aapli buses used to report over 1.5 lakh passengers every day. “Now, almost all Aapli Bus routes have started witnessing rush,” the official said. NMC’s ticket revenue too has increased by almost Rs2 lakh per day. According to data, 360 buses are making around 4,283 trips on various routes and collectively covering almost 62,217km daily. NMC is generating daily ticket revenue between Rs15 lakh-Rs 16 lakh, as against Rs12 lakh pre-Diwali. To a query, the official said that before pandemic, NMC used to operate 360 buses with the daily revenue hovering between Rs17 lakh and Rs20 lakh. The opening of educational institutions has improved the passenger count on city buses. Routes like Sitabuldi to Khaparkheda and Butibori to Hingna are getting a good response, with the Hingna depot topping the revenue chart. The average earning per kilometre (EPK) is being recorded at Rs26.28, while the earning per bus is Rs5,015. The highest EPK was recorded on Orange Street (OS). NMC’s transport department recorded 28.22 EPK on OS depot, which mostly operates buses on Hingna routes.

It also dismissed the appeal filed by the man challenging the lower court’s order. In his complaint, Mahesh Sharma, a resident of Bankhandi Rishikesh, had filed an FIR on May 19, 2009, at Laxman Jhula police station, saying that his niece Neetu Sharma along with her husband Subodh Sharma had left home for Neelkanth.

With their sentencing, a total of 89 persons have been convicted in connection with the communal violence which claimed nine lives in the fishing village of Marad on May 2, 2003. Special additional district and sessions court judge KS Ambika had convicted Koyamon alias Mohammed Koya (58) and Nisamudeen (38) on Nov 19 and the quantum of sentence was pronounced on Tuesday. Their trial was held separately. The two convicts had gone into hiding after Marad killings. Koyamon was arrested in 2011 while Nisamudeen was nabbed in 2010. Special prosecutor R Anand appeared on behalf of prosecution. Koyamon, who was found guilty under two sections of the Explosive Substances Act and other IPC sections, was sentenced to double life imprisonment. He was given an additional five-year (rigorous imprisonment) term apart from a fine of Rs 1.02 lakh. Nisamudeen was also given a double life term for murder (IPC section 302) and under section 27 (3) of Arms Act and an additional eight-and-a-half years rigorous imprisonment. He was told to pay Rs 56,000 as fine. The court directed that the fine amounts should be given to the family of Santhosh, who was one of the victims of the riots. Marad killings, the worst-ever communal violence witnessed in Kerala, saw eight persons belonging to the Araya community being murdered in the coastal village of Marad in May 2003. A member of the gang of assailants was also accidently killed in the incident. In Jan 2009, the special court had sentenced 63 of the 139 accused who faced trial in the case. There were a total of 148 persons named as accused in the case. While 62 of the accused were awarded life imprisonment, one person received a five-year term. Later in August 2012, the high court had awarded life imprisonment to 24 more accused, setting aside their acquittal by the lower court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/marad-riots-double-life-term-for-two-accused/articleshow/87877187.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Antilia bomb scare case bail: ‘Accused not in know of plot’||MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to an accused in the Antilia bomb scare case six months after his arrest, a special NIA court observed prima facie, it could not be gathered that he had active knowledge of the conspiracy or the SIM cards he allegedly provided were to be used for illegal activities.  The court said even assuming momentarily that the accused, Naresh Gaur (31), provided five SIM cards, out of which one was used in businessman Mansukh Hiran’s murder, the question remains if he was aware that the SIM cards he gave to the co-accused, Vinayak Shinde, would be used for placing a gelatine-loaded vehicle near the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and for the murder.  “Prima facie, it appears that the accused was unaware the SIM cards were being used for the illegal purpose. He has acted as per the directions of his owner (employer),” Special Judge A T Wankhede said. The employer is a witness in the case.  Gaur was the first among 10 to be granted bail on Saturday. However, the order was stayed for 25 days after the prosecution said that it wanted to move the Bombay high court. The detailed bail order was made available on Monday.  Gaur was accused of criminal conspiracy and dishonest misappropriation of property. He was arrested on March 21. The court said from Gaur’s employer’s statement it was clear that accused dismissed cop Sachin Waze threatened and insisted that he procure the SIM cards. The court said consequently, the employer directed Gaur to procure the SIM cards who, in turn, obtained them from another witness.  Accepting arguments made by Gaur’s lawyer, Aniket Nikam, the court said, “Nothing is on record to show that the accused has ever contacted the accused Sachin Waze. He has no direct connection or contact with the accused Sachin Waze. No CDR reflects to that effect. He only handed over the SIM card to accused Vinayak Shinde,” the court said. It said Gaur had acted as per his employer’s directions.  Seeking bail, Nikam argued merely by providing SIM cards one cannot be said to be part of any conspiracy. “Naresh Gaur did not know for what purpose the SIM cards would be used. He was also not aware an explosives laden car would be planted outside Antilia or Mansukh Hiran killed,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bomb-scare-case-bail-accused-not-in-know-of-plot-in-mumbai/articleshow/87877550.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi: Court sets aside Rs 5,000 cost on cops for seeking adjournment||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has set aside an order imposing a cost of Rs 5,000 on the police to be paid to the accused in a northeast Delhi riots case for seeking adjournment, saying it was not justified. A magistrate court had on October 12 allowed a request for adjournment sought by the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) but imposed the cost that was to be paid by the state to both the accused in equal proportion. The revision petition, filed by the police against the order, stated that the sessions court had made certain observations in the case which had made it necessary for the investigating agency to take up further investigation and as such the SPP had sought an adjournment. The petition further stated that it was the basic law that if the adjournment was sought on justifiable grounds, as was sought in the case, it ought to be granted. District Judge Ramesh Kumar noted that perusal of the magistrate court’s order showed that the request for adjournment was made on behalf of the police on the ground of compliance made by the sessions court on September 10, wherein directions were issued for segregation of chargesheet qua the complainant on one hand and three complainants on the other hand. The court said a request for adjournment was made to this effect, which appeared to be a bonafide one. “In the present matter, it is clear that the trial court had granted adjournment for compliance of the order of the sessions court. Thus, IO (investigating officer) was supposed to comply with the said direction. Accordingly, I am of the considered opinion that the imposition of cost of Rs 5,000 is not justified. In view of the aforesaid discussions and the law laid down in the aforesaid judgment, the revision petition is allowed and the impugned order, dated 12.10.2021, is set aside to the extent that the cost of Rs 5,000, imposed by the trial court, to be paid by the State to both the accused in equal proportion, is hereby waived,” the judge said in its order on November 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-sets-aside-rs-5000-cost-on-cops-for-seeking-adjournment/articleshow/87877183.cms||---

They were on their way to offer prayers at the Khodaldham temple near Jetpur when the tyre of their car burst between Biliyara and Bhojpara village and the driver lost control of the car. “The car jumped a divider and rammed with a state transport bus coming from Veraval side. The intensity of the collision was such that the roof of the car was blown away and the vehicled got crushed,” a police officer said. Ashwin’s younger brother Mukesh, who had come to Munjiyasar two days ago, told the police that the family was supposed to come to Munjiyasar after visiting Khodaldham temple. After the accident took place, an 108 ambulance from Gondal and another from the trust reached the spot while locals rushed in first to help.

When an x-ray scan didn’t show anything significant, her blood test was done, which revealed that her platelet count had dropped below one lakh, indicating exposure to viral infection. The 30-year-old professional was then diagnosed with post-viral arthralgia and treated with medications, leading to her full recovery. This is how many patients with viral infection are coming to orthopaedic clinics in the city over the last two months. In India, dengue and chikungunya are major causes of viral arthritis, especially during the post-monsoon period, experts said. Pune has seen a sharp rise in cases of viral infections, including seasonal viruses, dengue and chikungunya, over the last three-four months. “Since September, we have been seeing about two to four cases of viral arthritis every week at our clinic. While in some patients, a single major joint is involved, a few have complained of pain in multiple joints (poly-arthralgia),” said orthopaedic surgeon Kiran Shete. Some patients come down with fever followed by joint pains, others experience joint pains followed by symptoms like fever, nausea, malaise. “If not treated properly, it may lead to arthritic changes in joints,” said Shete, who heads the Spinalogy Clinic in Aundh. “Joint pains in about 70% patients, who have had some kind of viral infection, resolve within six weeks. Those who continue to experience pain even after six weeks have chronic viral arthritis or post-viral inflammatory arthritis. About 30% of the patients I am currently treating have this chronic kind of viral arthritis,” said rheumatologist Pravin Patil. The viral infection, in the 30% cases, tampers the body’s immune system in such a way that it remains in the attacking mode (autoimmune response) even after the patient has recovered, Patil said. Rheumatologist Girish Kakade said “We need to diagnose these patients properly because some of these patients may develop chronic arthritis if not treated early.” Importance shall be given to associated nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin B12 deficiency. “Healthy nutritious food and early treatment can help avoid long-term complications,” said family physician Santaji Kadam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seasonal-ailments-push-up-viral-arthritis-load-in-city/articleshow/87876443.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||DGP Pandey summoned to verify transcript in Mumbai: CBI||Mumbai: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday argued at length to contend that Maharashtra Director General of Police Sanjay Pandey was being summoned not because he is the DGP, as the state says, but because his presence is needed to verify the transcript of recorded conversations between him and the former Mumbai police chief, Param Bir Singh. Additional solicitor general, Aman Lekhi, making submissions from Delhi at a hybrid hearing before a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal, said Pandey has been summoned also to verify and question him on the content of a letter written by the ex-CP which claims that Pandey had advised him to withdraw his March 20 letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging ‘corrupt malpractices’ by the then Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. Lekhi also cited Monday’s Supreme Court order of interim relief against Singh’s arrest saying the apex court had even observed that it finds the picture very disturbing. “An earlier commissioner seems to show lack of faith in the police,” the SC had said. Lekhi sought dismissal of a petition filed by the Maharashtra government against CBI investigation into its FIR under Prevention of Corruption Act against Deshmukh and sought a special Investigation Team (SIT) instead on the grounds of conflict of interest as it said the CBI director at present was former chief of police establishment board as state DGP recommending and deciding police transfers and postings. Lekhi said the petition amounts to nothing but a delaying tactic and a move to protect someone. He referred to the letter dated April 19, 2021 to the director, CBI by Singh where his conversation with Pandey, was recorded when he had gone to formally hand over charge. Special senior counsel and former ASG Darius Khambata for the state said if the CBI wanted to rely on contents of the letter it must first prove the contents. Lekhi stated that the letter was a annexure to Singh’s petition which the HC had dismissed and the state has relied on the dismissal. The CBI counsel said the state said the summons to DGP and chief secretary were being issued every few days and had expressed apprehensions that they would continue to be, causing hardship and ‘embarrassment’ to them and the state administration. Lekhi said the state was being “Nostradamus” and seeing into the future like a “clairvoyant” when in fact the CBI had agreed to their wish to appear before it in Mumbai, and not Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dgp-pandey-summoned-to-verify-transcript-in-mumbai-cbi/articleshow/87877835.cms||Swati Deshpande

The decision has been taken to save the money that is being spent on running the facility. The cantonment authorities said that 10 beds will be reserved for patients from the cantonment as well as from other areas. “The step has been taken after assessing the intake of patients at the unit. Based on it we have decided to reserve 10 beds for common patients, while the remaining 15-20 beds will be run by the appointed private body/agency,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. Kunar said, the cantonment spends Rs25-30 lakh per month on running the unit. “Through this move, we will save around Rs3crore annually,” Kumar added. Besides, Kumar said that the quality of treatment will be enhanced since the agency will appoint adequate number of doctors as well as the medical staffers. At present, the Pune Cantonment Board hires specialised doctors on a contractual basis to operate the ICU facility, the official said. Meanwhile, residents and activists from the cantonment areas said that the authorities should ensure that common citizens are not denied admission at the facility. “The reserved beds should not be given to the agency for any purpose. Otherwise, the agency might refuse admission to patients on the pretext of non-availability of beds,” said Sanjay Kawade, an activist from Ghorpadi area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-cantt-board-to-operate-icu-through-private-agency/articleshow/87876452.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges, universities wait and watch before calling more students||KOLKATA: A week after educational institutes returned from the Covid break, most have decided to first review the Covid scene and then, call more students for in-person classes. Authorities have been taking cautious steps towards reopening and have been particularly careful with hostel accommodation. Some students have also been reluctant to attend in-person classes. Besides, institutes want to finish admissions, registrations and and students’ vaccination before calling all back. St Xavier’s College has resumed offline classes with the outgoing PG and BEd batches, while Presidency University has been calling students from different subjects once a week. Ramakrishna Mission colleges have prioritized students with lab-based subjects and Jadavpur University has selected only a few departments, from where students of some semesters have been attending on-campus classes. Many Calcutta University colleges have resumed offline classes with outgoing UG and PG students. “All ofline economics classes will start in January 2022. In English, only UG II and PG II are coming to campus, the rest may come next month but only after the scene is reviewed. UGIII and PG II of history are attending offline classes,” said a JU official. “Dates for engineering UG offline classes will be decided later.” St Xavier’s College has spruced up hostels, but it looks to give outstation students time to shift, wait for vaccination of students below 18 and ensure healthcare facilities on the campus. Presidency, too, will open in phases. “We will reopen fully only after reviewing the Covid situation. Online and hybrid classes will continue,” said Fr Dominic Savio, principal at St Xavier’s College. At RKM Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, all students with lab-based subjects have been called to campus for practicals. “We do not want to rush. Theory lessons are being held online. We want to wait and watch before calling more students,” said principal Swami Kamalasthananda. RKM Vidyamandira, too, is holding only practical classes on campus now. “We are a residential college and we have to be careful,” said vice-principal Swami Mahaprajnananda. Even with a few students, colleges are keeping a watch. “We insist teachers and students wear masks. Everyone’s temperature is being checked,” said Maulana Azad principal Subhasis Dutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-univs-wait-watch-before-calling-more-students/articleshow/87876450.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Usha Padhee, joint secretary, Union ministry of civil aviation, and Milind Sohoni, deputy dean, ISB, exchanged the MoU in the presence of Union minister for civil aviation, Jyotiraditya M Scindia As part of the MoU, ISB will analyse RCS and prepare a case study that can be used in academic institutions and administrative training institutions for students of public policy. Commenting on the development, Sohoni said – “We at ISB are excited to be a part of this project. UDAN is a rare experiment worldwide, and ISB is studying this to bring it into our classrooms for students to learn.” In fact, this MoU also marks the extension of the socio-economic impact study of the RCS or UDAN scheme conducted by ISB in 2020. In the previous study, analysis of data revealed that passenger load factors on RCS flights were high and that more than half the RCS flights at the national level flew at more than 70 per cent capacity. At the airport level, airports serving tourist and pilgrimage destinations observed a higher increase in passenger traffic than other airports, it added.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: CBSE schools go extra mile to keep students exam-ready||HYDERABAD: City schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education have gone the extra mile by conducting minor tests and holding revision lessons following commencement of term 1 board exams for class 10 and class 12. This is the first time that the board is conducting the board exams in two stages. The term 1 exams are in multiple-choice format on OMR sheets. While exams began on November 16, most of the major papers are expected to start this week. The term 1 exam will be of 90 minutes for each subject in which students will be given 20 minutes to read the paper instead of 15 minutes. Many schools are handholding students to help them with the new pattern. “We have conducted multiple tests and revision lessons to help students with the new pattern. The new pattern was declared by the CBSE only a few months back. So consistent preparation over the past few months is helping students adapt to the new pattern,” said Narasimha Reddy, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur. With major papers starting from November 29 wherein full attendance is expected, printing of question papers is turning out to be a huge challenge for managements. For schools, there has been an extra amount of preparation this time. “The exam begins at 11.30 am and we get encrypted papers from CBSE only by 9.30 am. We would get less than two hours to decrypt question papers and print about 200 papers without technical snags. It is a massive task for many schools,” said principal of a school on condition of anonymity. Term 2 exam will be held in March-April 2022 and will have a mix of subjective and objective questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbse-schools-go-extra-mile-to-keep-students-exam-ready/articleshow/87876719.cms||---

This comes after the state government challenged the order of the single bench to give the benefit of ACP to the aforementioned category of the staff. However, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik scrapped their appeal during the hearing on Tuesday. Earlier, 48 people -- including two education department employees Dinesh Chandra Joshi and Tribhuvan Kohli -- had knocked on the court’s door with a petition alleging that the state government is not giving them ACP benefit. Under the ACP scheme -- introduced by the central government in 1999 to deal with the problem of “genuine stagnation and hardship faced by the employees due to lack of adequate promotional avenues” -- employees are granted two pay hikes on completion of 12 and 24 years of regular service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-quashes-state-govts-plea-class-iv-employees-to-get-assured-career-promotion/articleshow/87873742.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Bhadra being reduced to ruins with every passing day||Vadodara: The crime branch in Bhadra in the walled city of Vadodara is buzzing with activity with high-profile cases off late, but most would be oblivious of the fact that the office’s neighbour is the first royal abode of the city. Brick by brick and pillar by pillar, the once magnanimous structure is being reduced to ruins. Bhadra got its name as royals used to stay there. The building was a busy one till around 2000 with government offices like the treasury, taluka panchayat and others being located there. One by one, all offices were shifted elsewhere and Bhadra was left alone to fend for itself. The structure has an ornate ‘jharokha’ on its facade. It was the abode of the rulers till Sarkarwada was constructed by the Gaekwads around 1800. The Bhadra was later used as an administrative building. Archaeologist R N Mehta has noted that the building came up towards the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 8th century. He notes that it was built in a style developed after the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan. It has small rooms on the ground floor and larger ones on the upper floor that had a Zanankhana, Darbarkhand and the room of the ruler, Mehta has noted in his book ‘Vadodara: Ek Adhyayan’. Several representations and even a report prepared by experts for its restoration have not led to any developments. Architect and convener of the Vadodara chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) Sanjeev Joshi, who was a part of the team that prepared the report said that two reports were prepared for the monument in 2015, including that for a theatrical sitting at the site and another for a complete restoration. “The possibility of using the building during the Vadfest was also being examined,” Joshi said. Sources said that the reports were prepared at the insistence of the district administration. These were also shared with the state government, but there was no development subsequently. “The structure has deteriorated further by now. Every monsoon leads to more damage in decay in such buildings. A fresh assessment needs to be made,” Joshi said. Art historian Chandrashekhar Patil said that there was still a possibility to restore the structure. “The ‘jharukha’ is very unique and one may not find a similar one elsewhere,” he said. Patil added that the teak pillars used in the structure were still intact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bhadra-being-reduced-to-ruins-with-every-passing-day/articleshow/87875828.cms||Sachin Sharma

However, the matter had been compromised. Chakole is now on the run after trying to shoot the intern and her friends on Monday at GMCH. There had been a compromise at the police station after the June complaint. The intern did not want to pursue the matter and Chakole had got a warning notice. Chakole created ruckus at GMCH earlier this week by brandishing a firearm-like weapon, and trying to fire at the intern and others who came to her rescue at the parking lot outside the dean office on Monday. Police said Chakole was miffed with the intern as she had snapped ties with him and there had been a rift between them since last few months. Chakole, a school dropout, had befriended the intern through Facebook around a year ago after posing as a coal businessman. He had later started mentally harassing her by doubting her character, and also barged into her rented place at Vishwakarma Nagar earlier this year, after which the police complaint was filed against him. Police learnt through Chakole’s relatives that he had not been at his home for more than six months. His family too has distanced themselves from him. He has now been booked for attempt to murder and molestation by Ajni police after Monday’s incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-intern-had-complained-against-friend-in-june-too/articleshow/87876456.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Pune||Pune: Mucormycosis continues to surface among Covid cured||PUNE: Covid-associated mucormycosis or black fungus cases might have significantly gone down, but fresh infections in small numbers are continuing to surface. Last week, four new cases of Covid-associated mucormycosis were reported in Pune district. Besides, 29 patients are recovering at various hospitals, including Sassoon General Hospital, in the district. With this, the number of total Covid-associated mucormycosis cases has gone up to 1,537 in the region in the past eight months. Of them, 1,284 have recovered and 224 died. The most common factor for contracting mucormycosis in recovering Covid patients is the combination of uncontrolled diabetes and use of steroids. “Most new patients are being referred to Pune from neighbouring districts like Ahmednagar and Solapur. A few of these cases have developed complications, as they delayed seeking medical care,” said Samir Joshi, Sassoon hospital’s ENT surgeon. Mucormycosis needs to be treated with antifungal medicines, while keeping blood sugar under control and eating a balanced diet are crucial for early recovery, experts have said. Maxillofacial surgeon J B Garde said, “The patients are coming from neighbouring districts and the rural parts of Pune. Those who land up early need only clearing of infection (debridement) in the sinuses.” Blackish discoloration over the bridge of the nose or palate and blurred or double vision with pain have emerged as prominent red flags in addition to the one-sided facial pain or numbness, toothache and sinusitis, expressed have said. Mucormycosis cases rose during the second wave of the pandemic between February and August this year and started declining after a drop in the daily Covid infections. “Earlier, we would see 20 to 40 cases a week.It is now down to three to four,” additional district health officer Abhay Tidke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mucormycosis-continues-to-surface-among-covid-cured/articleshow/87876464.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Patients share beds, sleep on floor at crammed Osmania General Hospital||HYDERABAD: A huge space crunch at the Osmania General Hospital (OGH) has left patients cramming in single beds and lying on the floor. The lack of space has been a major headache at the hospital ever since wards were shifted from the 100-year-old dilapidated structure to other buildings on the premises. Currently, a majority of wards are being run from the emergency block, another 50-year-old building, and Quli Qutub Shah building which is even older. Surgeries are being conducted at a newer Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) building. “The major issue which we face here is space crunch. Immediately after the second wave, when all departments were thrown open, the footfall was still less, but over the last few months the footfall has risen again, similar to pre-pandemic days. As a result, we often have to adjust patients in floor beds,” said a resident doctor at the OGH, citing recent vidoes of two patients being adjusted on a bed. The resident doctors also described the anguish of patients, stating, “patients and relatives throw a tantrum over this arrangement frequently. They ask us why are we not providing them with good facilities”. Despite years of being bogged down by controversies and the issue of construction of a new building flaring up frequently, patients and doctors at OGH are forced to adjust in less than adequate infrastructure and space. The issue is now in the High Court and the construction of a new building is yet to begin. About the difficulties being faced in light of the pandemic, Dr Sagar Dharmula, president, Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA), said, “Although the entire bed strength of the hospital has been accommodated in the existing buildings, there is no option of following social distancing. Beds have to be crammed in a small space, with many floor beds being put up. We are accommodating over 2,000 patients, but with a lot of space crunch. Now, even patients are restless and ask when will the new building be ready.” When contacted, officials did not immediately respond for a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patients-share-beds-sleep-on-floor-at-crammed-osmania/articleshow/87876508.cms||---

Bahadurpura police said the man appeared not in a completely sound mental condition, but investigation is on. Later, the officials released a video of 31-year-old G Sai Kumar attempting the misadventure. Kumar reached the boulder-like structure at the moat. He sat on it for a while as the lion stared at him. A little later, the big cat charged and tried to reach him from its open enclosure, but could not scale the wall. Around this time , visitors at the zoo noticed that a man had breached the security enclosure and had gone close to the moat. They raised an alarm as the lion’s gaze was fixated upon the intruder. Meanwhile, two guards of the zoo reached the location and called him. On seeing them, he returned. They took him into custody, thrashed him and later handed him over to police. “Today, around 3:30pm a person who was walking vulnerably on the boulders of the African lion moat area, where the lions are released in the exhibited enclosure at Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, which is a absolutely prohibited area, was rescued and caught by the zoo staff and handed over to the Bahadurpura police,’‘ Nehru Zoological park curator said in a press release. Sai bought a ticket like any other visitor and entered the zoo. “He looked not in complete sound mental condition. Fifteen years ago his family had abandoned him. He claims that his parents are in Keesara, we are trying to trace them. As of now, there is no case against him since he is mentally unsound,’’ Bahadurpura inspector D Durga Prasad told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-enters-lions-den-at-zoo-lives/articleshow/87876622.cms||---

Telangana HC seeks clarity||HYDERABAD: The Telangana High Court on Tuesday sought to know from a petitioner as to which provision of the law allows a state to give reservations in the liquor business. The Bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy was hearing a PIL filed by A Anand of Telangana Republican Party challenging non-allotment of proportional number of liquor shops to SC and ST persons in the recently-concluded liquor shops allotment for 2021-23 period. According to the petitioner, there are 15% SCs and 9% STs in the state. But the state allotted only 10% of shops to SCs and a mere 5% to STs. Stating that this was unjust, he sought enhancement of their share in tune with the figures of their population. The Bench said that the same GO allotted 15% to BCs. “We have heard of reservations in the education and employment spheres. But where is the law that allows a state to grant such reservations in the liquor business,” the Bench asked, while observing that the whole idea of allotting liquor shops to various communities may have to go. The “Forget about the proportional allotment, even the current allotment on the basis of caste must go,” the Bench observed. The counsel for the petitioner sought time to answer this query.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/reservation-in-liquor-biz-hc-seeks-clarity/articleshow/87876747.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Fishing is the main occupation in Thurputhallu village which has over 2,000 households. The students are developing charcoal water filters to ensure access to clean drinking water. The filters are being built in two schools. Cholera, jaundice and typhoid are common in the village. Four students from Hyderabad and Bangalore , working on a project of 1 Million for 1 Billion Foundation's Purpose Academy program in partnership with Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology at University of California Berkeley and innovation Acceleration Group, are helping provide health solutions. “Main problems these villages face is lack of awareness regarding pressing health ailments and shortage of clean water... Apart from charcoal well, we created audio-visuals modules in cardiac health, water borne diseases, first aid, substance abuse and women’s health,” said Hyderabad students. Dr. Swati Subodh, co-founder of 1M1B Foundation, said, “They identified that women’s health and menstrual health was a big problem and built awareness modules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-students-on-uc-berkeley-health-project/articleshow/87876585.cms||---
---||India||Member of committee on farm laws writes to CJI, wants report released||NEW DELHI: Though he blamed the government for its non-consultative approach behind the current protests that led to the decision of repealing the farm laws, SC panel member Anil Ghanwat said the protesting farmers have been "misguided by some leaders who do not seem to appreciate how a minimally regulated free market can allocate national resources to their most productive use". Besides Ghanwat, a senior leader of the Maharashtra-based farm organisation Shetkari Sanghatana, the other two members of the panel were agriculture economists and farm sector experts Ashok Gulati and P K Joshi. This is Ghanwat's second letter to CJI N V Ramana, requesting the report of the panel be made public. He had earlier written to the CJI in September, claiming that the recommendations of the three-member committee would pave the way to resolve the crisis and end the farmers' agitation. Urging the CJI for the second time to make the report public, Ghanwat on Tuesday wrote, "After the government's decision to repeal the farm laws in the coming winter session of Parliament, the committee's report is no longer relevant with regard to those laws but there are suggestions in the report on farmers' issues that are of great public interest." The SC had on January 12 constituted the committee to listen to the grievances of the farmers relating to the farm laws and views of the government, and to make recommendations. The panel had then on March 19 submitted its report to the apex court. The report has, however, not yet been made public. Ghanwat, in his letter, emphasised the needs for reforms, saying while the specific laws may no longer exist, the "reform impulse that was reflected in these laws is not diluted". "Many of India's farmers are desperate for renewed, not less, focus on reforms - particularly market freedom and technology freedom. These laws were accepted in principle by our farmers movement but were not accepted entirely by the farmers because the policy process of the Indian government is not consultative," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/member-of-committee-on-farm-laws-writes-to-cji-wants-report-released/articleshow/87878266.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Schools may tweak routines to fit in classes, board exams||By Poulami Roy KOLKATA: The first week of school reopening passed off smoothly but CISCE and CBSE schools will face the challenge of juggling on-campus board exams for X and XII and hybrid classes for IX and XI. While ISC exams for Class XII have already started, ICSE exams for Class X will begin from next week and major subjects for CBSE term-1 board exams are also slated around that time. To beat the examination rush, The Heritage School has started their offline annual exams for classes IX and XI, while other schools are considering to hold the IX and XI annyal exams ahead of the Christmas break. The Heritage School principal Seema Sapru said, “Students of classes IX and XI are also coming on alternate days for their terminal examinations. The school routine has been drafted in such a way that the annual exams are not clashing with the board examination days.” Calcutta Boys’ School started offline lessons with IX and XI from November 22, but they have been holding hybrid classes, with half the strength goinf to school and the other half attending online classes. “Classes IX and XI are doing their hybrid classes for four periods a day, and at the same time, board exams are also on. Everything has been going on systematically. But after November 29, the class timings may have to be changed as both ISC and ICSE exams will be on together,” said principal Raja Mcgee. A few schools, like St Xavier’s Collegiate School, have decided not to call students to campuses for classes till the boards are over. Don Bosco Park Circus has prepared a schedule for classes IX and XI, going to the campus on alternate days. DPS Ruby Park may modify class timings of classes IX and XI before the major subjects for the CBSE term-1 exams start as those will witness a high number of examinees, who will be seated over a large area. At South Point School, more than 1,200 students of classes IX and XI are attending school in two halves on gap days of CBSE board exams. “The first half is attending the morning session and the second half afternoon. The response to offline classes is good,” said trustee Krishna Damani. Mahadevi Birla World Academy has prepared a schedule for three streams of class XI, who are attending school on different days, mainly on gap days of the board exams. State board schools, on the other hand, are worried about completing syllabus according to the new schedule, according to which classes IX and XI have been given classes only twice a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-may-tweak-routines-to-fit-in-classes-board-exams/articleshow/87876481.cms||---

According to sub-inspector Tejas Desai, both Patel and Thakor knew each other before they got married to different persons. They both were parents of two children each. Desai said that, as the deceased belonged to different caste, their parents and community members did not allow them to marry each other.

---||Nagpur||NCP skips photo op as Bhoyar moves from saffron to white||Nagpur: Congress’s Dr Ravindra Bhoyar filed nomination papers for his maiden MLC poll on Tuesday, in the presence of leaders from all four factions of the district unit of the party. Putting up a united front, the leaders chose to field media queries on the ‘front foot’, especially about the MLC polls being a dead rubber due to the on-paper lead for BJP. “We don’t fight polls to lose,” said cabinet minister Sunil Kedar, who has shouldered the responsibility of swinging votes in Bhoyar’s favour. “All elections that we have won so far is due to the love of the people and that will take us through,” he added. Bhoyar was questioned about his chances, considering the factionalism which Nagpur district Congress unit faces. “We are all together. Let there be no doubt about it. On December 14 (result declaration date), you will see how BJP falls apart,” said Bhoyar. To be on the safer side, Congress leader Prafulla Gudadhe-Patil too filed his nomination as a substitute candidate. He told TOI, “We do this as a back-up policy, just in case his (the official candidate’s) form is rejected or any discrepancy is noticed... then it should not reduce the party’s electoral chances.” While all top Congress’s district-level leaders were present for the nomination filing, the party’s ‘natural ally’ in Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Nationalist Congress Party, however gave the photo opportunity a miss leading to speculation of discontent. Rumours were rife that this was due to Congress’s state unit chief Nana Patole’s statement earlier this month, about wiping of NCP from Vidarbha. Bhoyar tried to downplay NCP’s absence saying, “Their city president Dhuneshwar Pethe had gone out somewhere and is expected here soon.” But that did not happen. TOI tried getting in touch with Pethe for a reaction, but his phone was constantly busy. Sources said senior NCP leaders had directed the local unit to stay away from Bhoyar’s nomination form filing photo-op. But a Congress leader said these are minor issues and blamed media for blowing it out of proportion. “Has any NCP leader openly said that they won’t support Bhoyar? Please understand that officially Bhoyar is a Congress nominee. MVA is not fielding the candidate, nor was there any discussion between the parties. But all constituents of MVA are firmly together,” said the leader. 9371177662||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ncp-skips-photo-op-as-bhoyar-moves-from-saffron-to-white/articleshow/87876490.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Kerala continues to contribute the maximum cases while Maharashtra is a distant second. Union minister of state for health and family welfare Dr Bharati Pawar on Tuesday said five states, including Kerala and Maharashtra, are reporting a majority of the new Covid-19 cases in the country at present. Talking to TOI, Pawar said the ministry had a review meeting on the Covid situation about 10 days ago, which showed while Kerala contributed around 57% of new Covid-19 cases in the country, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu’s contributions were around 8% each. West Bengal and Mizoram each accounted for 7% of the cases.  “There are nine districts in Kerala and seven in Mizoram where the positivity rate is over 10%. Unlike Mizoram, states such as Kerala and Maharashtra have much bigger populations. There is an imperative need for these big states to further curb the new cases,” said Pawar. On Monday, of the over 1.3 lakh active cases in the country, Kerala had over 54,700 active cases, Maharashtra over 13,300, Tamil Nadu over 8,600, West Bengal over 7,900 and Mizoram 4,715. “Top authorities of the union government are in constant touch with these state governments. A health ministry team had even visited Kerala. The onus is on all state governments to ramp up testing in districts where the positivity rate is high,” she said. Responding to a query, Pawar said the initial feedback about the door-to-door vaccination programme in the states is good. The initiative, which started on November 3, will continue till November 30. “There are 13 states such as Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Ladakh, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, which have vaccinated 91% of their total beneficiaries of 18 years and above with the first dose. But there are 19 states, where the average vaccination with the first dose is around 50%,” said the minister.  Maharashtra’s first dose coverage is around 74% and second dose coverage is 35%. India’s vaccine first dose average is 79% and 38% is the second dose. “The Centre has ensured that all states have abundant vaccine doses. The beneficiaries must come forward to get fully vaccinated,” she said. Pawar said the ministry is yet to decide on issues such as vaccination of children aged 12 years and above and administering booster doses to those fully vaccinated. “Once things are finalised on these issues, the Union government would spell it out. The priority is to vaccinate beneficiaries who are either unvaccinated or fully vaccinated,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/maharashtra-sees-dip-but-its-among-5-states-with-most-new-cases/articleshow/87876502.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

A third one had died in the interim. Additional sessions judge Siddhartha Kumar Wagav while pronouncing the judgment on Tuesday also issued non-bailable warrants against the then investigating officer (IO) Hoshiyaar Singh and a witness, Dinesh Kumar, for “connivance with the actual murderers” and for “falsely implicating an innocent father” for the murder of his own daughters. Hoshiyaar Singh had filed a chargesheet against Avdesh Singh, the father of the three children, based on a statement by Dinesh Kumar. Back in 2002, Avdhesh, a tonga puller, his daughters Rohini (9), Neeta (8) and Surmi (7), and other members of the family were sleeping in their house at Jeba Mukundpur village under Nighohi police station in Shahjahanpur district. The three children were sleeping on one cot and Avdhesh on another. Suddenly, three men, Chutkannu alias Naththulal along with his brother Rajendra, and son Narvesh (all go by their first names) barged into Avdesh's house and opened fire on the sleeping family. Avdhesh managed to escape but the three children were gunned down. Thereafter, Avdhesh had registered an FIR against the three men, but the IO arrested him instead for the murder of his own children and sent him to jail. Avdhesh remained in prison for over six months before getting bail. IO Singh had filed a chargesheet against Avdhesh and a closure report was prepared. During trial, the court found Avdhesh to be innocent, charging the three men for the brutal killings of the children. Additional district government counsel Shripal Verma said, “Death penalty has been announced for Rajendra and Narvesh. But justice won't be done until IO Hoshiyaar Singh and witness Dinesh Kumar are also punished.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/19-yrs-after-dad-framed-for-murder-of-3-kids-real-killers-get-death/articleshow/87875770.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded by the digital air quality monitor in the billboard has remained consistently above 200 during the last six days, putting the air in the city in ‘very unhealthy’ category. Schoolchildren, who were brought to the billboard on Tuesday to educate them about AQI and pollution in atmosphere, expressed shock over the air quality they breathe. Chandrapur city has the dubious distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in the state. Waatavaran Foundation and Eco-Pro Organization, under the aegis of Chandrapur Municipal Corporation, have installed The Billboard that Breathes to highlight how dangerously polluted air the citizens of Chandrapur are breathing and what is its effect on the health. Eco-Pro president Bandu Dhotre explained to the visiting students about the project and the alarming pollution levels in the city, and guided them about their responsibility towards maintaining environmental balance. “It is shocking to know about the intensity of pollution in the air. If these artificial lungs have turned back in just six days, what could be the condition of our lungs that are breathing the same unhealthy air for many years,” said a student Anshika Bhattacharya. The students were curious about the ticking numbers on the AQI monitor, but were more at the awe over the speed with which the artificial lungs have turned black. “What an unhealthy air we are breathing all these years. If somebody undergoes an operation, doctors would find our lungs even blacker than the artificial one on the billboard,” said student Shreya Bele. Farha Qazi attached to Waatavaran Foundation claimed that the billboard at Chandrapur is likely to turn pitch black in record time. She informed that it took 15 days for similar billboard to turn back in posh Bandra locality in Mumbai, while the one at Kharghar (Navi Mumbai) turned black in 10 days. “Our previous studies with the billboard have shown that citizens living even in posh localities like Bandra are not safe from pollution. The way lungs billboard at Chandrapur is growing dark, it is likely to break previous record,” she said. Dhotre, who is monitoring the AQI, said the billboard is likely to turn dark black in a day or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chandrapurs-artificial-lungs-turn-almost-black-in-6-days-expose-very-bad-air-quality/articleshow/87876504.cms||Mazhar Ali

The party has also issued a whip to all corporators to not leave town till further notice. There are chances that Union minister Nitin Gadkari may preside over the meet, if he is in Nagpur. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari confirmed the developments, but strongly dismissed suggestions that Bhoyar’s exit has anything to do with it. “Bhoyar was an exception, nothing else. BJP is a party of committed workers and there is absolutely no danger of defection. Our meet on Wednesday is part of regular interactions which keep happening between party members. Of course, now that we are heading into the political season, it is obvious that these meetings will focus on electoral issues,” said Tiwari. Those close to Bhoyar claim that at least eight BJP corporators are on the verge of quitting. Tiwari, one of the seniormost BJP leaders, said, “How much value can you place on what someone says. And I don’t think that people wait so long to do something. If they have to quit, they shall just walk away. But nothing like that is going to happen with BJP, hence, I repeat that Bhoyar’s case is an exception.” The mayor added that the whip to corporators for not leaving town was not a ‘post-Bhoyar’ reaction. “We issued that whip about two weeks ago. All members were told to remain in Nagpur,” said Tiwari. While Tiwari refused to entertain any thought that the party is concerned over the aftermath of Bhoyar’s exit, other leaders told TOI that it is a much discussed issue. Speaking on condition of annonymity, a party leader said, “I agree with the mayor that it’s not an earth-shattering moment for us, but it’s definitely a surprise that something like this could happen. And Bhoyar was not a fringe corporator who had entered the party purely for electoral gains, but a strong RSS man. So if someone with such strong roots to both the Sangh and the party can quit, means tommorrow it could be others too.” All eyes are now on Wednesday’s meeting because with just months to go for the civic polls, an aggressive Congress party, combined with Bhoyar, who’s looking to extract his pound of flesh, may suddenly change the political equation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-calls-meeting-of-corporators-mlas/articleshow/87876498.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

With the help of 200 students of scout guide who are part of a voluntary organization Shishu Vihar, Dr Tejas Doshi, a general physician has, so far, distributed 30,000 cotton bags and collected 15 lakh plastic bags of the environmentally dangerous types, and deposited these to the solid waste department of the municipal corporation for proper scientific disposal. Dr Joshi started this initiative in 2019 to sensitize people about the disadvantages of plastic and inform them about the environmental agreeable and sustainable cotton bags. However, owing to the Covid-induced lockdown, his activity remained suspended during 2020. He has now once again, since the last few months, restarted his activities and created several temporary centres where he collects plastic bags once a week. Students collect plastic bags and distribute cotton bags at these collection centres and also at traffic signals. While distributing cotton bags, the students also ask people to avoid using plastic bags. “We can’t eliminate plastic from our life but we can do to minimise its use,” Dr Doshi told TOI. He said the bags are sewn from waste cloth and costs about Rs 7 for which he gets sponsorship. “There are provision stores or other shops who would want to distribute cotton bags for their advertisement and they contact us. Three persons sponsored these bags on their birthdays, while one couple sponsored the cotton bags on their marriage anniversary,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/doc-treats-plastic-pollution-with-cotton-bags/articleshow/87875766.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Gopinath Ravindran reappointed as Kannur University VC||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, on Tuesday, reappointed Prof Gopinath Ravindran as the vice-chancellor of Kannur University for four years with effect from November 24. The reappointment, the first in the history of the higher education sector in state, was made even as the government had constituted a search committee for the selection of candidates fit for the post of the vice-chancellor and November 30 was notified as the last date for the candidates to send their applications. Save University Campaign Committee, the whistle-blower group in the higher education sector, has already shot a letter to the governor against this reappointment. The committee said that the appointment could only be counted as a political reward for setting the ground for the alleged, illegal appointment of CPM leader KK Ragesh’s wife as associate professor at Kannur University’s Malayalam department. Ragesh is the chief minister’s private secretary. “As per the University Act, the candidate selected as the vice-chancellor should be less than 60 years of age at the time of appointment. But, the governor ratified the government’s recommendation based on the claim that Gopinath Ravindran’s being a reappointment, the age bar set by the UGC need not be applicable in his case,” the campaign committee said. It also alleged that the reappointment of Kannur vice-chancellor would leave other vice-chancellors more susceptible to political influence on a quid pro quo basis. Gopinath Ravindran had allegedly gone ‘an extra mile’ by speeding up the selection process of candidates for the post of associate professor by, allegedly, flouting UGC norms. It is alleged that the screening committee was set up the very next day after receiving all applications and an online interview was arranged in another four days. Also, the committee alleged that the first rank was given to Ragesh’s wife, flouting UGC norms. It wanted the governor to withdraw the reappointment of Gopinath Ravindran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ravindran-reappointed-as-kannur-university-vc/articleshow/87877225.cms||---

The Nandigram project in West Bengal had ended the CPM rule there. Similarly, SilverLine project is going to mark the end of CPM here too, he said. While speaking after inaugurating the dharna organized at Kundara in Kollam, by Kundara MLA P C Vishnunath and Kollam MP N K Premachandran against the SilverLine project, the opposition leader said that the LDF government was showing undue and unnecessary haste in the project. “The government should not think that they could go ahead with the project without answering the apprehensions of UDF in this project,” he said. “The government has put up the entire state for sale through this project, and the state would witness an unprecedented strike by UDF against SilverLine. The UDF will not support the project at any cost and will bring together all the people across the state against this project. Already a mass movement has begun in Kannur against this, and similar agitations will be witnessed in the coming days,” said Satheesan. “The chief minister is saying that the government is not willing to back down from this project. Why is he saying that? What is the commitment behind this project which is preventing him from going back?” he asked. The chief minister had also said that he would address all the concerns raised against the project. So far he has not got time to explain it before the people of the state. The people are still clueless about the project and there is lack of transparency since the beginning, Satheesan added. The urgency in going ahead with land acquisition for this project has raised several eyebrows. Such an urgency was not shown during land acquisition for the national highway development, he said. “Land is a precious commodity in the densely-populated state where Forest Act, CRZ norms and Paddy And Wet Land Act have restricted any kind of constructions in several areas. There is only a limited amount of land available in the state where the state government is now going to have this project. It is certain that the people will be losing their livelihood when this project gets executed,” he added.

Union defence minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to inaugurate the event that is based on the theme of “Technology, finance and capacity building resilience to disasters in the contexts of Covid-19.” The four-day event is scheduled to have seven plenary sessions addressed by experts around the world, 36 technical sessions where 230 technical papers contributed by researchers and policy makers will be presented and three feature events with MPs, city mayors and the media. “Climate change is compounding the risks through its impact on increasing frequency and intensity of disasters. Now, the deadly pandemic of Covid-19, which is affecting communities and countries across regions, killing people and disrupting society and economy, has added another dimension to the complex risks of disasters,” read the concept note on WCDM-2021. According to officials, the global database of disasters estimates around 12,732 disasters in the last two decades where over 1.4 million people lost their lives and 3.9 billion people were affected adversely. Dr S Ananda Babu, convenor of the event, said, “Technology can certainly be a game changer in building resilience. This will require transfer and dissemination of proven technologies from the lab to land and from the developed to the developing countries.During the past five years, several initiatives have been taken for technology development and transfer for building resilience to disasters, but the impacts of the initiatives are yet to be seen in large parts of the globe.” Stating that finance is the second most critical issue for building resilience to disasters, Babu added, “The need for significant mobilisation of resources from a variety of sources and the effective use of financing for building resilience to disasters have been highlighted very prominently in the global development agendas.” The event, which is scheduled to be held from November 24 to November 27, will have sessions on socio and psycho-social issues for long term recovery from pandemics, overcoming economic slowdown and financial stress for building resilience and the emerging technologies and innovations for reducing risks of disasters. The event will be held in collaboration with the Delhi government, National Disaster Management Authority, National Institute of Disaster Management, Defence Research Development Organisation and Indian Council of Medical Research, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/disaster-mitigation-in-focus-at-iit-event/articleshow/87877226.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The Union cabinet, in July this year, had approved an outlay of Rs 23,000 crore, with the Centre’s contribution at Rs 15,000 crore. “Initially, the Centre had given the states Rs 8,000 crore and later, more funds were made available. The states must make use of the funds and also pump in their own funds to set up facilities like medical oxygen plants, ventilators, medicines etc,” she told TOI. She added that they had received feedback that all the states are working to enhance the medical infrastructure under this package. “The pace should be enhanced since this package is meant to tackle in case there is a third wave of the pandemic,” added Bharati Pawar. — Ranjan Dasgupta & Abhilash Botekar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahraashtra-centre-gave-its-share-of-funds-for-covid-infra-says-bharati-pawar/articleshow/87876509.cms||---

These machines will first sprinkle water and then sweep using the mechanical brooms, especially major cement roads. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “These two machines will be put to trial on Wednesday, following which we will come to know how many kilometres can be cleaned in a specified time. Based on that, we will work out detailed plan for utilization of the machines.” He said these machines are likely to be used on major cement roads. “Vehicular traffic on major roads increases early in the morning and hence it becomes difficult for sanitary workers to sweep them. These machines will be helpful in cleaning the dust and garbage gathered near the road-dividers and footpaths, which at times result in accidents and also cause pollution,” he said. The civic body had received some funds under NCAP, of which Rs85 lakh have been spent on purchasing the machines. A company from Delhi, which delivered the machines, has claimed that one unit can clean 8-10 kilometre distance in an hour. In-charge of NMC’s workshop Ujjwal Lanjewar said, “Each machine has three brooms fitted in the rear side. First the sprinklers, fitted on the front side, will release water lightly followed by suction of dust and garbage. It will prevent dust from getting airborne while sweeping is done.” This is for the first time the civic body has procured machines to sweep the roads. In 2013, the NMC had engaged a machine on rental basis. TOI had exposed various irregularities then and the machine was discontinued after a few months. At present, sweeping of city roads, spread in 227 sq.km, is done by around 7,500 sanitary workers. The NMC will also get some additional marks in the Swachh Survekshan with the utilization of these machines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-goes-hi-tech-buys-2-automated-road-sweepers/articleshow/87876539.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

His movable assets, as per the same form, are valued at Rs43.15 lakh. Bhoyar’s wife owns movable assets only, valued at just over Rs10 lakh.

According to latest figures, dengue cases have almost reached pre-pandemic levels. The only silver lining is that recorded deaths are in single digits.  The BMC released a consolidated chart of monsoon-related ailments which shows dengue cases, after dropping to 129 last year, have again jumped to 821. Chikungunya, transmitted by the same mosquito as dengue, has shown a spurt too. The city saw its usual count of malaria and H1N1 infections. Surprisingly, enteric diseases, including gastroenteritis and hepatitis A, remained low for the second year in a row. Overall, monsoon diseases claimed seven lives this year, down from 12 in 2020 and 20 in 2019.  Between January and November, the city has recorded 821 cases and 3 deaths of dengue over 129 cases and 3 fatalities last year. In 2019 there were 920 cases and 1,003 in 2018. A drastic drop in testing and lack of people mobility for months in 2020 were key reasons for the historically low numbers last year. “With those factors taken away plus intermittent rainfall and climatic conditions, cases are back to usual,” said Rajan Naringrekar, BMC’s insecticide officer. He said indoor breeding has been the biggest challenge to curb breeding of dengue mosquito. “Also, slums areas in Mumbai collectively have more than 18 lakh drums storing water. Each of them can be a potential source,” he said.  Chikungunya, another viral disease spread by the aedes egypti mosquito that transmits dengue, saw a spurt with 60 cases. BMC said it was the only disease they thought saw a rise in 2021. Interestingly, malaria didn’t see the extent of drop dengue saw last year. Mumbai recorded more cases (5,007) in 2020 compared to 4,357 in 2019. This year too, malaria has affected 4,813 people but has not caused any deaths as per records. The most intriguing is the curve of gastroenteritis. Mumbai records 7,000-8,000 gastroenteritis cases annually. It dropped to 2,549 last year as most roadside eateries and unclean drinking water sources were not accessed. But with life and work routines returning to normal, it didn’t see a rise. In 2021, 2,564 cases have been reported, a nearly 70% drop compared to pre-pandemic times. Hepatitis A has witnessed a major decline. 258 cases have been recorded; 263 were recorded in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-six-fold-rise-in-citys-dengue-cases-from-last-yr/articleshow/87876516.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Business||India agrees with US, to release oil from stockpile to cool prices||NEW DELHI: After questioning the US proposal initially, India has agreed to release five million barrels of oil - or roughly a day's consumption - from its strategic reserves in a coordinated manner with other Asian importers with the aim of checking runaway crude prices. Though the timing is yet to be worked out, this will be the first time that India will release its reserves for market intervention since it filled up the first storage in 2018. However, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd, the state-run company that operates the storages, has been selling some of the reserves since August under a routine commercial activity. For the US, which reports said has pledged to release 50 million barrels, it will be the second time since the 2011 Libya war. Altogether, stockpiles of the world's top five oil consumers make up 15 days supply globally, currently pegged at 99 million barrels a day. So any price relief is likely to be temporary unless other nations join the move. All member nations of International Energy Agency together hold 1.5 billion barrels of stockpile. Beyond the initial shock, oil market sentiment will be more susceptible to the worsening Covid situation across Europe. No wonder India had initially doubted the effectiveness of the move. "Strategic oil reserves weren't ever intended for a situation like this... It's for a force majeure situation, if there's an earthquake, a global outbreak of hostilities," oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri had told Bloomberg TV last week. Admittedly, oil prices have slipped below $80 a barrel since the news of the US move to rope in India, China, Japan and South Korea broke last week. But oil is showing resistance at $78-79 as news only added to the existing market anxiety over Covid in Eurozone, even as demand is rising from Asia. This is unlikely to be bridged by a one-time tapping of stockpiles. India appears to be in the same boat as the US as the leadership in both countries face popular anger and inflationary pressure from high oil prices. The Modi government had cut fuel taxes earlier this month ahead of crucial state polls. "There are five million barrels sitting there but they (Opec) are not producing," Puri had told CNN last week after talks with Opec counterparts in Abu Dhabi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-agrees-with-us-to-release-oil-from-stockpile-to-cool-prices/articleshow/87878283.cms||Sanjay Dutta

The grievance of the petitioner is that the proceedings dated August 5, which were issued calling for applications from people who aspire to be appointed as trustees, had failed to give effect to the intention of the legislature under Section 25A(d) of the Act, which speaks about the qualifications of the trustees.The counsel for the petitioner submitted that all the relevant information including the antecedents of the trustees who are to be appointed should be placed before the selection committee and made known to the public. If the same is not done, it will vitiate the selection process.However, the state submitted that the proceedings issued calling for applications is in consonance with Section 25A(d) of the Act. It is unnecessary to insist that it should be in the form of an affidavit.A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan observed that when the notification and the application contained all the relevant information which would be placed before the selection committee, the apprehension of the petitioner is unwarranted. The judges observed that it is not possible and also not necessary to upload the details of all the applications in the website for public view. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-on-application-details-of-temple-trustees-dismissed/articleshow/87876531.cms||---

District collector Aneesh Sekhar and corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan had submitted proposals in this regard, he told reporters after a five-hour-long district development coordination and monitoring committee (DISHA) meeting.Moorthy said Rs 60 crore had been sanctioned for relaying roads damaged in Madurai due to the rain and work would start in the first week of December. Though DISHA meeting usually reviews developmental activities in the city, the implementation of Pocso Act was discussed in detail for the first time. Su Venkatesan, MP, who chaired the meeting, said they were committed to reducing crimes against children in Madurai and hence reviewed the implementation of Pocso Act. In all, 76 cases have been filed under the act in Madurai in the last one year. The status of the cases reviewed in the previous years, compensation and progress of trial were also reviewed.He said 14 of the smart city projects in Madurai were about 95% complete.

With most first year students unvaccinated, there is also concern of mixing them with vaccinated students.Anna University is mulling ways to accommodate all students on campus and hostels following the government order. “We may allow 30 to 40 students per classroom and will accommodate more than one student per room in hostels. After finalising the details, we will call first year students to campus,” said vice-chancellor R Velraj. The university is already conducting physical classes for second and third year students while online classes are going on for first year students. Final year students finished their classes entirely in physical mode in the current semester.Madras University is also renovating hostels to accommodate more students. “We have informed all colleges to conduct physical classes for all students. First year PG students will join physical classes after completing their induction programme in online mode,” said S Gowri, vice-chancellor. Colleges in Chennai like Women's Christian College issued circulars asking all students to attend physical classes. In Madurai, colleges like Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science and The American College said they would call students back to campus. “We won’t have much of an issue in case of space. The syllabus for this semester will be continued in the physical classes,” said Davamani M Christober, principal of The American College. D Pandiaraja, principal of Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science, said they will revise the syllabus and conduct the exam according to the government’s directive.Colleges with higher student strength are a little worried about holding all classes offline. But college managements say they can only follow what the government says and it might not be possible to have only a restricted number of students in a classroom and that relaxation is needed. “First year students have to come to the campus without being vaccinated.

---||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC proposes to hike property tax by 2-5%||NEW DELHI: With the finances of South Delhi Municipal Corporation in the doldrums, its commissioner proposed an increase of 2-5% in tax rates for residential, commercial and non-residential properties. But Tuesday’s budget being the last before municipal elections in 2022, the deliberative wing of the civic body is unlikely to dismay the voters by approving the higher taxes. The budget for 2022-23 proposed to divide all categorised residential properties in two slabs, A to E and F to H, and charge 14% of annual value as tax in the first and 12% in the second. At present, the rate is 12% in A and B categories, 11% in C to E categories and 7% in F to H. For non-residential and commercial properties, the proposal was to put the tax rate at 15% for properties in A-D categories. As of now, the rate is 15% for A and B categories and 12% for C and D categories. Property tax on commercial, non-residential properties in the E, F, G and H categories was proposed to be raised to 12 % from the existing 10%. Commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said, “We hope to increase revenue from property tax by 15% after implementing these increases. This is important to bring the civic body out of the deep financial crunch. If not implemented, SDMC will face a serious problem in paying salaries on time.” The hiked property taxes will bring in Rs 1,445 crore in 2022-23 against Rs 1,260 crore in 2021-22. There was also a proposal to add hotels, motels, company guest houses, district centres, malls and shops in DMRC complexes and restaurants without bar facilities to the list of properties charged tax at 20% rather than the existing 15%. The proposals also included reducing the 15% waiver for payment of property tax before June 30 to 10% and reducing the 30% rebate given to the senior citizens, disabled citizens and women to 20%. Likewise, for lumpsum payment of advance taxes by co-operative group housing societies, the budget proposed reducing the incentive from 20% to 10% and ending the 10% rebate given to DDA and CGHS flats of up to 100 sq metres. Bharti said, “We will also appeal to Delhi Government to reduce the transfer duty from the prevailing 3% to 1 %.” Bharti claimed that SDMC was looking at all sources of revenue generation. “We implemented the policy for installing mobile towers in 2020 and till October 2021 we generated Rs 15 crore from 117 sites. Revenues from advertisements came down from the proposed Rs 170 crore to Rs 90 crore due to the pandemic. We now hope to generate higher income by allocating space for LED /digital advertisements in 13 more markets,” said Bharti while presenting the SDMC budget. Bharti also said, “Tenders for the construction of a parking facility for 238 cars in GK II, 81 in Amar Colony and 225 near Punjabi Bagh Cremation Centre will be invited soon. Such space has also been identified at Punjabi Bagh Club Road and B-1 Janakpuri.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-corpn-proposes-to-hike-property-tax-by-2-5/articleshow/87876569.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kochi||Kerala: Pro-CPI outfit distances from SilverLine rail project||THRISSUR: Even as the LDF government is rushing with the execution of the proposed semi high-speed SilverLine project, ‘Yuvakalasahithi’, a cultural organization associated with CPI, has come out in the open against the project. Yuvakalasahithi office-bearers on Tuesday released a pamphlet articulating the reasons for its opposition to the multi-crore project. Addressing a press conference at Thrissur Press Club, Yuvakalsahithi leaders Alamkode Leelakrishnan and E M Satheesan demanded that the government should reconsider the decision to implement this project which could entail an investment of anything between Rs 66,000 crore and Rs 1lakh crore. They pointed out that this train, proposed to be made operational with such a massive investment, would accommodate only 675 passengers in one trip. The fare for this train ride will not be affordable to the vast majority of people in the state. Tens of thousands of people will have to be evacuated for the execution of the project, a large number of hills will have to be flattened and large areas of wetlands will have to be filled for the project, they said. There must be serious discussions whether Kerala, which is reeling under severe financial stress due to the natural disasters and Covid 19 outbreak, will be able to chip in 28% of the overall project cost, they said. As an alternative, the government should explore the possibility of doubling the existing rail tracks and dedicate one set of the tracks for fast trains. “It would cost less than half the proposed SilverLine project,” said Leelakrishnan Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad, another pro-Left science outfit, has also raised objections to the proposed K-Rail project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pro-cpi-outfit-distances-from-k-rail-project/articleshow/87876560.cms||---

The total toll in Mumbai has reached 16,311 so far. “While fewer tests were done than usual, the infection rate is so low in the city that numbers are unlikely to rise further right now,” said a BMC official. The doubling rate has increased to 2,526 days, and the weekly growth rate of the infection remains at 0.03% over the last month. While H West ward (Bandra) has the highest growth rate in the city at 0.05% and doubling rate of 1,279 days, the lowest is 0.01% in B ward (Dongri), with 10,000 days to double. After 10 consecutive days of zero cases, B ward registered one case each on Saturday and Sunday. State officials said there are nearly 12 districts that have not reported a single death in the last few weeks, while most districts are reporting deaths in single digits in a month. “The situation is very much under control.

The issue was raised by Dalmia Cements and its MD Punith Dalmia, both of whom were made accused in the quid pro quo case filed by CBI and the consequent case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Though Punith and his company avoided summons issued by ED, they did appear before the ED finally and their statement was recorded after their plea challenging the summons was dismissed by a single judge. But the writ appeal, filed by them, was still pending before the HC. What remains after they appeared before the ED and their statement too was recorded? Their counsel N Naveen Kumar contended before a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy that they want this court to adjudicate and give a finding because they have apprehensions that their statement might be used against them. “Though the law says that forcing a person towards self-incrimination is wrong, the same is not being adhered to,” he said and sought time to enable a senior advocate to argue their case. The bench posted the case to January 27, 2022. Nimmagadda seeks relief In a separate hearing, businessman Nimmagadda Prasad on Tuesday urged the HC to quash the case filed against him in the Vanpic charge sheet. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing his case through senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy, who contended that CBI had filed the case against Prasad as if making investments in anticipation of profits was wrong. The investments made by Prasad have been earning dividends and the investment too has doubled on account of profits, he said. The pending CBI case has become a stumbling block for his international ventures, he said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-rule-on-accuseds-right-to-remain-silent/articleshow/87876559.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The manager of the hall and the labour contractor too have been arrested. Senior inspector Kishor Nagrale of Nandanvan police station said owners of the hall, Jayashree and Sanjay Kale, were arrested along with manager Dinesh Pilley and labour contractor Kanhaiyya Patel. Nandanvan police sources said the four were later released as the offences under which they were booked were bailable ones including 304 A of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The owners of the hall had earlier said Sahu had stepped into the life which was meant only for goods and not human transportation. A warning board too was pasted inside the lift. Sahu, working with the catering team, died after sustaining an injury while travelling in the lift escorting some utensils last week. He was rushed to a private hospital where the doctors had declared him dead. Nandanvan police had registered an accidental death case but later converted the case into an criminal offence holding the hall owners, manager and labour or catering contractor responsible for causing death due to negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/four-arrested-get-bail-in-lift-accident-case/articleshow/87876561.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Manjalkudi in Enathi-Theli panchayat in Thirupuvanam panchayat union have 70 dalit families who have to travel three kilometres to Enathi to buy their ration goods. “We last received rice in September and after that my wife and I have been buying ration rice from other shops for Rs 10 a kilogram,” said K Ramar, 69, an agriculture coolie.“Usually the rice supplied to us through ration shops is of very bad quality, but that is what we eat three times a day as we cannot afford to buy it from retail shops,” said P Selvi, a villager. The villagers say that ration shopkeepers treat them very badly if they complain about quality. “If a good consignment comes, we don’t get it, but we haven’t got even the bad one for three months, even during Diwali,” Ramar said. As they have to travel three kilometres, the villagers have demanded their own PDS shop so that at least they will get their quota.CPM union secretary Ayyampandi and others said they found alround neglect when they visited the village. “A culvert says that a tar road has been laid in the village at a cost of Rs 34 lakh during 2020-2021, but I couldn’t see any road after the sign board. People have to walk two kilometres to fetch water and street lights don’t burn in this village,” he said. Sivaganga district collector P Madhusudhan Reddy said the people had not received rations only for this month and they would get it on Wednesday. “There is no way they could have gone without rations for three months, as claimed by them,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-rations-for-three-months-say-sivaganga-villagers/articleshow/87876568.cms||---

The accused had allowed the children to use the facility despite them having no money and sexually assaulted the survivor when they were leaving. Finding Hyderabad native Mohammad Yakub, guilty, special judge Bharti Kale said, “No doubt the accused is handicap by one hand but he has committed sexual assault and therefore much leniency cannot be shown.” The court further said that the incident has occurred at a public toilet used by little girls at odd hours. “Spot panchnama reflects that the male and female bathroom is adjoining to each other and there is a table at the centre, where the caretaker of the bathroom sits and collects money. I find that there is serious concern that whether such little girls, who use such public toilets at odd hours are safe and are protected,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-public-toilet-caretaker-gets-five-year-ri-for-sexual-assault-on-minor/articleshow/87877647.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Nagpur||Over Rs16,000 crore unclaimed funds lying with LIC: RTI query||Nagpur: The Life Corporation of India (LIC) has an unclaimed funds of Rs16,000 crore till last year, a reply to an RTI query has revealed. The amount belonged to lakhs of policyholders across the country, who failed to claim it after completion of their policies or their family members have forgot to claim after the insured person’s death. The insurance behemoth, which would soon be coming out with an IPO, probably the biggest one in India, informed that the amount of these unclaimed deposits was increasing every financial year. The LIC’s reply came in response to queries asked by Sanjay Thul, national president of Federation of Customs, Central Excise and GST, SC/ST Employees Welfare Association. According to the insurance company’s chief public information officer (CPIO) Harleen Gauba, they had Rs6,885 crore unclaimed deposits in 2015-16, which jumped to Rs16,052 crore in 2019-20. This is an increase of over two and half times in five years. The total amount included interests on it along with returns on the investment made by the corporation. The LIC invests its amount across various sectors like the government securities, equity, shares and mutual funds. The behemoth however failed to reply on Thul’s other queries like number of policyholders who had failed to claim their amounts and what steps taken to reach out to them and their families so that they should get their due benefits. “Despite Chief Election Commissioner’s (CIC) orders, the LIC failed to reply on both these counts in clear breach. They must make efforts to refund the money to deserving policyholders or their families rather than sitting on it and garnering interests,” Thul told TOI. An LIC official told TOI that their company had provided a facility on its website for checking unclaimed insurance money. “The policyholders need to submit their policy number, name, date of birth and PAN card number of staking a claim. After verification of their details, the amount would be deposited in their bank accounts directly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-rs16000-crore-unclaimed-funds-lying-with-lic-rti-query/articleshow/87876577.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The green tax being remitted for non-transport vehicles older than 15 years and transport vehicles older than 10 years is witnessing a rise in Ernakulam this year While the green tax remitted in Ernakulam RTO office in 2019 was Rs 15,21,600, it has increased to Rs 19,59,600 till November 23 this year. According to motor vehicles department (MVD) officials, the pandemic had resulted in a dip in green tax remittance last year. Still, Ernakulam RTO limit had managed to collect Rs 14 lakh last year. “We have made green tax mandatory for old vehicles for any transaction. Otherwise, we would face an audit objection. Besides, many could not remit tax last year due to Covid. Now, they have also started to remit the tax,” said an MVD official in Ernakulam. The situation is not different in rural areas too with the Muvattupuzha RTO office also showing a rise in the green tax remittance this year. An official in the office said that currently green tax is being remitted for vehicles registered in 2005-2006 period. “The number of old vehicles is rising gradually and there will be a corresponding rise in remitting the green tax too. It shows more vehicles are getting older in the district. Next year, green tax will be remitted by owners of vehicles registered in 2007. They will have to re-register it next year and for that, they will have to pay the green tax,” said the official in Muvattupuzha. He said the rise in fine amounts also forced many to remit the tax in a time-bound manner. As online facilities for tax remittance improved recently, it has also resulted in the rise in people complying with the green tax. Also, the tax amount has not been raised by the government. As the vehicle population of non-transport vehicles is high, most of the green tax comes to the coffers from such vehicles. The vehicle registration in Ernakulam showed a degrowth in 2019 and 2020. In Ernakulam RTO, the highest green tax remittance was reported in September and October this year. Last year, it was in December and March 2020 and 2019, respectively. The least was reported in May 2021, thanks to strict Covid-induced restrictions. Manoj Kurup, secretary of Kerala automobile dealers’ association, said there is a huge inflow of used car vehicles from other states, including New Delhi, to the state. “The resale of used vehicles is high now and that is reflected in green tax remittance. The main issue people face now is they do not get financial assistance from banks to buy new vehicles as many lost jobs during Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/noticeable-rise-in-number-of-old-vehicles-plying-on-kochi-roads/articleshow/87875832.cms||T C Sreemol

The teachers will help with unit-wise lesson plans, explain the assessment process and share their own project examples. On Tuesday, Pathway School, Noida held a training session for teachers of the 10 pilot schools for the middle-year programme (MYP). Earlier, teachers had been trained at KR Mangalam World School. Delhi Board of School Education established by Delhi government would be following the IB curriculum, which is being introduced in 20 Specialised Schools of Excellence in Class IX and above. In 10 schools, it is being started at the junior level as a pilot project. Dharmendra Kumar, Hindi teacher at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Laxmi Nagar and a teacher development coordinator, said, “This is the third such training on objective-based learning attended by us.” He has been in the profession for 22 years. The teachers hope the curriculum is introduced soon with smaller class sizes and other administrative changes. The training includes learning various aspects of IB, such as familiarising with terminologies, training on vertical and horizontal alignment of the content and an overview of inquiry-based teaching, along with interdisciplinary learning and action that can be taken by students. In Tuesday’s session, 70 teachers were guided on how they needed to follow formative, summative assessments, rely on projects and ensure criteria-based assessment. Shalini Advani, director, Pathways School, Noida, said, “Delhi government understood the benefits of IB education and gave us the opportunity to share our knowledge and expertise with government school teachers. The process started in September. Around 17 subject teachers have volunteered to train 300 government school teachers.” Asked about the challenges government school teachers would face, Anshu Sharma, MYP coordinator at Pathways School, said, ”The IB system requires planning and innovation. The implementation process requires different types of methodology and innovative practices of teaching and resources. Infrastructure will be needed as technology is a major part of IB MYP teaching.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pvt-schools-with-ib-curriculum-extend-help-to-govt-schools/articleshow/87877257.cms||Shradha Chettri

It was in January-February that the district received the highest rainfall of 251.45 mm. Sources said Ramanathapuram district has a total of 5,660 waterbodies, including tanks or kanmois and ponds. Of them, 500 are fed by the Vaigai, used for irrigation and controlled by PWD. Of these, only 30 are full while 111 tanks are 75% full, 151 are 51% to 75% full and 103 hold different quantities of water ranging from 26% to 50%. As many as 105 tanks have less than 25% water in them. The Gundaru river supplies water to 141 tanks in the district and only one of them had reached its full capacity. In all, 81 of them are either dry or hold less than 25% of their capacity of water while 50 are 26% to 50% full and nine 75% full. As many as 1,122 tanks come under the district rural development agency. Just 589 have 50% of water in them and 173 less than 25%. Ramanathapuram district has 3,897 ooranies, most of them rainfed, while only18 of them are full. Ramanthapuram Vaigai Irrigation Farmers Association president M S K Packianathan says the tanks in the district including the large ones like Periyar kanmoi, Sikkal kanmoi and Kalari kanmoi have not filled. This was because the channels and tanks have not been cleared or desilted. ``We have cultivated paddy in 1.47 lakh hectares and chilli in over 16,000 hectares, but all this would go waste because of non-maintenance of water bodies,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ramnad-got-above-average-rainfall-but-only-1-tanks-full/articleshow/87876580.cms||---

Elections for the 14 seats in the registered graduates category, representing each of the faculties, are scheduled on December 19. Even before the final day of submitting nominations, around a dozen-odd candidates have already submitted their candidature while a slew of others are expected to file their nominations in the next couple of days. Before the university issued notification, it was expected that just a couple of faculties like Technology and Engineering and Social Work (FSW) will witness a close contest. But with new faces entering the poll fray, a tough fight is expected in the other faculties as well. At FSW, apart from sitting senate member Kapil Joshi, three other candidates — Samir Mahajan, Jaymesh Oza and Arjun Solanki — have filed nominations. Similarly, even as sitting senate and syndicate member Dinesh Yadav is set to file his candidature for the seat representing Faculty of Arts on Wednesday, two other candidates Umang Gupte and Amrish Patel have submitted their papers. For the seat representing Faculty of Law, advocate Kishore Pillai and Shailesh Vyas have filed nominations. So far, one candidate each has filed nomination at Faculty of Commerce, Faculty of Fine Arts and Faculty of Journalism and Communication (FJC). A majority of candidates have started campaigning on social media platforms. The electoral roll that was finalised by the university officials last month has voters in the range of 1,400 to 3,180 plus in big faculties like arts, science, commerce and FTE while faculties like FJC have little liver 50 voters registered in the rolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/keen-contest-on-cards-for-msu-registered-grads-polls/articleshow/87875904.cms||---

The report has called for action against the flat owner where the blaze erupted under Section 53 (1) of the Mumbai Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966, for carrying out unauthorised work in the premises, and also black listing of the agency that certified that the fire fighting systems were functioning.The water from the building’s riser system did not give adequate pressure when it started. The fire brigade, in a report tabled before the standing committee earlier, had said that when their team reached the spot and rushed to the 19th floor, they tried using the in-built water hose, but the “water did not have the required pressure”. Recommendations in the report also include keeping a check on wooden materials used in flats for interior decoration works and empaneling of the interior design companies. A civic official, requesting anonymity, said, “On inspecting the flat, it was found that a lot of wooden material was used by the interior decorators. This led the blaze to spread rapidly. There needs to be a check on the amount of wood work used in flats, and hence we plan to recommend that like structural engineers and architects, even interior decorators should be empanelled and works should be carried out only through licensed ones. Besides, there is also a need for the fire brigade to have another arm so that while one arm is only assigned to fire fighting works, the other can inspect structures and issue notices to buildings periodically in case of deficiencies in the fire fighting system.” The report has also suggested that like fire audits, electrical audits must also be made mandatory. However, civic officials have said that while a bi-yearly fire audit can be mandated by them for buildings in the city, an electrical audit cannot be made compulsory under law and the PWD is the regulatory authority for it. Therefore, the investigation team suggested that a provision via an amendment on the same be made in the Maharashtra services Act. A senior fire brigade official said that 70% of all fire incidents in Mumbai every year are owing to short circuits. A preliminary report by the Fire Brigade into the blaze at the Curry Road highrise had stated that the fire was owing to a short circuit in the main electrical distribution board of the 19th floor flat, number 1902. The report has been tabled before the BMC chief IS Chahal for a final approval. When contacted, additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, who headed the inquiry, did not respond for a comment on the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-report-on-sobo-highrise-fire-calls-for-action-against-flat-owner-audit-agency/articleshow/87877904.cms||Richa Pinto

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1,65,60,000 on the two convicts. Police identified the convicts as 32-year-old Karthika, wife of GR Manikandan, and 30-year-old S Prabhu, both natives of Nambiyur in Erode district. The two had floated a country chicken farm - Healthy Poultry Farms India Pvt Ltd - at Nambiyur in May 2012 and launched two ponzi schemes to lure investors. “In one of the schemes, they promised 500 country chicks, a temporary shed, feeds, a monthly incentive of Rs 8,500 for three years and an annual bonus of Rs 8,500 to the people who invested Rs 1 lakh in the firm. They said the capital investment would be returned at the end of the three-year investment term,” a police officer said. In another scheme, the officer said, they promised 300 country chicks, a monthly incentive of Rs 8,500 for three years and an annual bonus of Rs 12,000 to the people who invested Rs 1 lakh in the firm. “They, however, didn’t extend any benefits to the investors after collecting money from them.” In December 2012, the officer said, one of the investors lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) sleuths, who registered a case against the directors of the firm and its staff - GR Manikandan, K Sathish alias Sathishkumar, N Murugan, M Ramasamy, R Jayasamundeeswari and S Rajendran, all residents of Nambiyur - for criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and cheating. The case trial was held before the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act cases in the city. Judge A S Ravi pronounced the verdict on Tuesday, sentencing 10 years rigorous imprisonment to Karthika and Prabhu, and acquitting six others of all charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ponzi-firm-directors-get-10-year-jail-term/articleshow/87876582.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kochi corporation fails to adopt measures to improve ranking||KOCHI: Over the past few years, the ranking of Kochi corporation in Swachh Survekshan has been very poor. City lags behind in hygiene parameters like proper garbage collection, waste treatment facilities and adequate number of public toilets. Still, the corporation authorities have not taken any measures to improve the ranking. “The major reason is the lack of public sanitation facilities. We will have to enhance such facilities,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. This year, Kochi has been ranked as the 338th city as cleanliness is concerned. In 2020, Kochi’s ranking was 372. Though Kochi improved the ranking a bit compared to last year, the city is still one among with poor hygiene facilities in the country. Kochi, which ranked fourth in2015, slipped to 55 in 2016 and to 271 in 2017. The ranking further slipped to 276. The city, which couldn’t announce open defecation free (ODF) status over the years, had completed the procedures a couple of months ago. But the ranking was given on the status until February 2021. As per the norms, Kochi city requires at least 300 public toilets. Unfortunately, the number of public toilets in the city wouldn’t exceed a couple of dozen. As per the Swachh norms, toilets in petrol bunks can also be considered as public toilets provided they are accessible to the public. Still, corporation authorities haven’t made any efforts to make use of such facilities. “We don’t have adequate public toilets. The waste treatment system in the city is not up to the mark. The treatment plant at Brahmapuram is not functioning properly,” opposition leader Antony Kureethra said. “If we take measures to rectify the flaws, we can improve our ranking,” Kureethra said. After Kochi has been declared a binless city a few years ago, there are no waste bins in the corporation limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-corp-fails-to-adopt-measures-to-improve-ranking/articleshow/87875837.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

According to the BMC Covid dashboard, only 13 buildings are sealed across the city till November 22, a huge drop from 43 as on October 23. The number of sealed floors has also fallen to 1,047 from 1,609 during the same period. And the number of Mumbaikars in home quarantine currently stands at 40,216 as compared to 63,279 on October 22. The BMC seals a building if five or more residents test positive for Covid-19. In case there are fewer than five cases in a building, the floor where the patient lives is cordoned off. During the peak of first and second waves, police personnel were stationed at times outside sealed buildings to restrict entry and exit. Officials said that the drop in number of sealed buildings and floors is not surprising as cases are reducing in the city. “There has been no visible rise in cases after Diwali so far,” said a BMC official. “However we will continue to stay vigilant in December as we expect a noticeable increase in overseas travellers.” Mumbai International Airport Ltd recently said that with the ministry of aviation allowing airlines to operate 100% of the-ir scheduled capacity and the upcoming Christmas season, passenger traffic is inching towards the pre-Covid days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-one-month-no-of-sealed-bldgs-falls-nearly-70-in-city/articleshow/87876589.cms||Richa Pinto

Only ongoing or new initiatives and small projects to improve civic services and recreational facilities were highlighted by commissioner Gyanesh Bharti on Tuesday. The projects funded through public-private-partnership, CSR schemes or other sources of funds include Shaheedi and Bollywood parks, plastic waste plant of five tonnes per day capacity, a material recovery facility, e-vehicle charging stations, parking app, compressed biogas plant at Hastsal and solar panels on municipal buildings. Besides, starting the recourse centre for children with special needs in each zone, establishing stack or multilevel parking facilities at new identified sites and animal and bird centres at Vasant Kunj were among other projects part of the existing or proposed budgets. “We have prepared the detailed project report for the Bollywood Park, which will come up on eight acres at Jangpura. The proposal, which will be done in PPP mode, will be presented in the next standing committee meeting. We have planned to erect 3D and 2D cutouts of filmstars, process of film production and other equipment related to film production,” said an official. For Shaheedi Park, too, funds received from the Centre’s Urban Development Fund Scheme would be utilised. “ SDMC has signed an agreement with Broadcast Engineers Consultant India Limited to run parking facilities through the “My Parkings” app to help users book parking space in advance, find vacant space, pay online and find the route to the facility. “The move will ensure hassle-free parking facilities to users and attract them. An MoU has been signed with IGL for construction of a compressed biogas plant with a capacity of 100 TDP wet waste at Hastsal and land has already been provided for this purpose,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-mega-infra-initiative-in-sdmc-budget/articleshow/87876583.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Agra||Ram Vriksha’s aide files plea in court to book Mathura cops for kidnapping||Agra: An associate of cult leader Ram Vriksha Yadav on Monday filed a plea before the CJM court in Mathura, seeking a kidnapping case against Mathura police for forcibly taking Yadav away while he was trying to flee along with his followers during the 2016 Jawahar Bagh clash. The petitioner urged the court that the cult leader should be presumed alive as the authorities failed to give DNA proof confirming his death. The court on Tuesday posted the matter for hearing on December 6. Talking to TOI, Yadav’s counsel Laxmikant Gautam said, “As the report of scientific investigation (DNA test) has not been submitted in the court so far, it should be presumed that the cult leader is still alive.” Yadav’s Basti-based associate Rajnarayan Shukla is a witness, who had seen policemen taking away Yadav with them, added Gautam. On June 2, 2016, Jawahar Bagh witnessed a bloody clash between thousands of followers of Swadhin Bharat Vidhik Viacharik Satyagrah (SBVVS) led by Yadav and policemen who had gone there to clear the illegally-occupied land. Though the park was cleared of encroachment, the clash claimed 29 lives, including the life of an additional superintendent of police. The case was later handed over to the CBI, which is yet to file a charge-sheet. In 2017, Yadav’s son Vivek had also claimed that his father was alive when police took him away. Thus, declaring him dead was a “conspiracy” hatched by the administration to end the movement launched by him after their DNA samples did not match with the samples claimed to be that of Yadav, he added. On June 16, 2016, a Mathura court had refused to accept the death certificate of Yadav submitted by the highway police in a separate case and had ordered a DNA test. Incidentally, Gautam was the first to raise doubts over the police’s claim about the identification of the cult leader’s body. Gautam had seen purported pictures of "Yadav’s body" circulated on social media and claimed that the body was not of the cult leader.

Commuters on the stretch said they were enthralled to see the freshly painted portraits accompanied by the quotes of their favourite leaders on the flyover pillars. The national highways wing of the state highways department said they had roped in an artist from Chennai to draw the pictures on a pilot basis. A highways department official said, “We have done wall paintings on two pillars to see the reaction of people. If people like it, we will take it to our higher officials in Chennai and get permission to adorn select 100 pillars of the flyover with the paintings, which will focus on the culture and tradition of the region, and leaders.” T Ganesh, a commuter, said “It is refreshing to see the paintings on the pillars. It is also a good idea to keep the posters away. This idea can be emulated in other flyovers too to keep them clean.” Many people also took to social media to appreciate the efforts of national highways officials. The official, meanwhile, said the construction work was progressing in a phased manner and would be completed in a few months. The construction of the 3.15-km flyover, which is expected to ease traffic congestion on Trichy Road and Mettupalayam Road, had begun in 2019. The Union government had allotted Rs 232 crore for the project. The 17.2-metre wide, four-lane structure starts from the stock exchange building area near Ramanathapuram and ends at Rainbow on Trichy Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kalam-chidambaram-pillai-now-adorn-flyover-pillars/articleshow/87876586.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Man fights three years for PF dues, gets it hours after his death in Ujhani||BAREILLY: Hetram Pal fought desperately for three years after his retirement in 2018 to get his provident fund, sitting in protest often in the past 10 months. His health had been failing and medical bills were piling up. On Monday, he lost one battle, but finally won the other. A few hours after he was declared dead, officials transferred Rs 3 lakh from his PF account into his wife's bank. The remaining Rs 7 lakh will come soon, they have promised his grieving family. The 63-year-old, who worked in a cooperative mill, had been pleading for months that he needed the money urgently because of his deteriorating financial condition, made worse by his illness. Rajeev Kumar Rastogi, the general manager of Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills in Ujhani, a town near Budaun, where Pal worked for over 40 years, assured his family in writing that the pending amount will be credited to them in "a or two". There are over 100 other employees who have been fighting the same battle, all of whom retired in 2018. Rastogi told TOI on Tuesday that the payments were pending because of "issues with their account details." In Pal's case, it was "an issue with his date of birth". His family has contested that. After retirement, Pal had spent most of his savings on buying a house at Civil Lines in Budaun, expecting the money in his PF account to aid him in future. He lived with his wife Munni Devi, and son Mahesh Pal. Two other sons live elsewhere. "My father earned Rs 28,000 a month at the mill," Mahesh said. “His PF claims were not settled even after three years of his retirement. He served the mill for nearly 40 years but the administration didn't think his loyalty was worth anything. He submitted several applications but nothing ever came of it. Our financial condition is weak and I don’t have a stable job. The fear of losing his hard-earned money made my father depressed, because of which he remained unwell. He was undergoing treatment but did not recover." Hit hard by his father's death, Mahesh said he decided to take action against the mill administration and approached police to lodge an FIR. But circle officer Alok Mishra intervened and summoned the general manager of the mill to the thana. It was then that Rs 3 lakh was transferred into his mother's account. A retired mill worker who is also waiting for his dues said, “Whenever we tried to talk to the accounts department, they dodged our queries or asked us to come later. It went on and on like that. We have now been assured that our PF claims will be settled soon.” Rastog said, "Some 235 employees have retired and PF claims of 125 of them have been cleared. We will try to ensure that pending dues of the remaining employees are also taken care of. We will investigate to see if the delay was because of negligence by our staff or if there were hurdles in the Lucknow office."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-fights-3-yrs-for-pf-dues-gets-it-hours-after-his-death/articleshow/87875844.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Coimbatore||4 held for murdering ex-convict in serial bomb blast case||Coimbatore: Four people were arrested on Tuesday for murdering an ex-convict in the Coimbatore serial bomb blast case at Podanur in the early hours of Monday after he threatened them at knifepoint when they questioned him about stealing a goat from one of their houses. Police said another two accused in the case were on the run and three special teams were deployed to nab them. The Podanur police identified the arrested as 28-year-old S Abudhakir, his younger brother 23-year-old S Mohammed Ali and his friends A Mohammed Nazif and A Mohammed Ansar, both aged 24 years. A police officer said all the four were daily wage labourers from Nanjundapuram Itteri near Kurichi in the city. The officer said M Sait alias Sait Bakrudeen, the ex-convict in the serial bomb blast case, had stolen a goat from the house of Abudhakir in the early hours of Monday and taken it to a mutton stall. “The arrested four followed him to the mutton stall and questioned him about stealing the goat. Sait, however, threatened them at knifepoint.” Meanwhile, Abudhakir’s father Sulaiman alerted police, who intervened in the issue. “We asked Sait, who was under the influence of alcohol, to go home and come to police station in the morning. While he left the place, the four, along with two of their friends, followed him and assaulted him with an iron rod and wooden log,” the officer said. Sait’s family members found him unconscious with severe injuries near the house in the morning and took him to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he died without responding to treatment. The Podanur police, who had initially registered a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), changed the Section to 302 (murder) of the IPC after Sait’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/4-held-for-murdering-ex-convict-in-serial-bomb-blast-case/articleshow/87876594.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the ongoing rainy season has offered a conducive environment for breeding of aedes mosquitoes, health experts have called on the district administration and the public to take preventive measures to keep the children from falling victims to dengue. Dr V Booma, head, paediatrics department, Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said at least 20 children were getting admitted to the hospital daily with dengue-like illnesses after the rain in the past two weeks. Being a tertiary care hospital, Dr Booma said, cases were being referred to CMCH from various parts of the district and neighbouring districts. “Cases are reported mostly from Mettupalayam and Udumalpet.” Dr D Vijayagiri, paediatric surgeon, SGK Hospital, Mettupalayam, said they were finding it difficult to differentiate between dengue and Covid-19 cases, as symptoms were similar. The hospital alone records about 40 suspected dengue cases daily. “Even in Covid-19 cases, patients witness a drop in platelet count. Hence, we are worried. Along with dengue, there are possibilities of associated Covid. While dengue mainly affects blood cell components, Covid affects lungs. It increases the morbidity and delays the recovery. If dengue is not subsiding within two-three days of treatment, we will have to suspect Covid-19 and take repeated tests,” Vijayagiri said. Dr A Jayavardhana, head of paediatrics department, PSG Hospitals, said they were getting about seven to 10 children with dengue or related illness daily. “Most of them are mild cases of dengue. Severe form of dengue may be witnessed in the second part of the season in January and February, because of reinfection. Parents should exercise caution and take adequate steps to keep mosquitoes out of their houses.” Meanwhile, more rain is expected in the coming days, because of the formation of another new weather system over the Bay of Bengal. This may only lead to a spike in dengue cases. Dr P Aruna, deputy director of health services, has sought support from the public in keeping their surroundings free from mosquito breeding sources. “A week-long drive was carried to educate the public on clearing waste materials from their houses. While stagnation of rainwater needs to be prevented, people should not dump unused materials in isolated places in their houses, as mosquitoes prefer dark places to hide.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/spike-in-dengue-cases-raises-concern/articleshow/87876608.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Ruckus in north corporation House meeting as discussions turn ugly||NEW DELHI: Amid a ruckus during a North Delhi Municipal Corporation House meeting on Tuesday, AAP MLA Mohinder Goyal allegedly slapped BJP-nominated councillor Vijendra Yadav for alleged misbehaviour with other councillors. The leader of House, BJP’s Chhail Bihari Goswami, said the House was scheduled to discuss the issue of rising air pollution and the steps taken to tackle it. “As soon as the discussion started, AAP’s councillors and nominated MLAs gathered in the well. They were trying to hide their party’s shortcomings in dealing with the pollution crisis for years and created the ruckus. A few BJP councillors then gathered and highlighted the loopholes of the new liquor policy. Unable to control his anger, Goyal slapped Yadav standing next to him,” he claimed. “We condemned the incident as no law gives any elected member any right to manhandle or slap anyone,” Goswami said. Yadav claimed to have filed a police complaint and visited LNJP Hospital for an MLC. “Even outside the House, the MLA manhandled me. I was simply carrying a bottle full of black tea while criticising the Delhi government’s liquor policy. I will ensure action is taken against people misbehaving with me,” he said. AAP councillor Ajay Sharma, however, claimed Yadav was carrying liquor bottles and misbehaved with women councillors despite their objection. “When he refused to give up, this incident happened. One of our women councillors also filed a police complaint,” he said. Leader of opposition Vikas Goel said BJP did not let a single AAP member speak. Besides alleging that BJP members misbehaved with AAP’s women councillors under the influence of alcohol, he also claimed they got into a fist fight with Goyal. However, Goswami denied all allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ruckus-in-north-corpn-house-meeting-as-discussions-turn-ugly/articleshow/87876616.cms||---

They have had a regular visitor at home who had taught them the basics in alphabets, numbers and life skills. These visitors are the special educators from Delhi government schools, who now cater to 632 children identified by a survey to enumerate city kids with disabilities who are out of the school system. Nishant’s mother, Neetu, who lives in Sangam Vihar, told TOI that her son had gone to school for a few months but had suffered a fall and not recovered enough to resume school. “He cannot move his hands without support. But he can talk, so I believe he can read and write too. We cannot take him out and that is why we find it nice that someone actually comes home to teach him.” As for Kashish, she has speech impairment, among other disabilities. “The teacher has been trying to help her using pictures and photographs,” said her aunt Moni, with whom she lives. “The teacher has also taught me a few techniques to help me with Kashish’s education. She gets to learn new things every week or 10 days.” The education of such children is an initiative of Samagra Siksha, a scheme that aims to bridge gender and social gaps in school education. Rashmi Lorenja Tete, who teaches Kashish and several others, said, “The main motive is to have these kids in school. We will teach them and prepare them for admission in schools. With the help of family members, we are toilet training them, teaching them how to brush their teeth and other life skills too.” Teachers like Tete had to take the help of the residents’ welfare associations, the heads of the local temples and mosque and neighbourhood shops and business owners to locate these children. In addition to street plays to create an awareness about education, the Directorate of Education’s inclusive education branch has also provided resource materials for the initiative. Ajay Singh, OSD, inclusive education branch, said, “This year, we undertook a bigger exercise on this project. Generally, parents are reluctant to talk about children with multiple disabilities, but we roped in colony residents to convince them about benefits for such kids from Delhi government. It isn’t necessary that everyone becomes a doctor or an engineer. Everyone, however, should acquire some vocational skills to aid them in the future.” Last year, DoE had similarly provided home-based education for around 251 schoolchildren with various types of physical limitations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-special-task-at-hand-taking-education-to-home-of-disabled/articleshow/87877277.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||India||Nation honours the 'Gallants of Galwan'||NEW DELHI: The nation on Tuesday remembered the "Gallants of Galwan" who heroically fought the numerically superior Chinese troops, armed with nail-studded rods and other sharp weapons, at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15 last year. Colonel Bikumalla Santosh Babu, the then commanding officer of 16 Bihar, was posthumously conferred with the nation's second-highest wartime gallantry medal Maha Vir Chakra by President Ram Nath Kovind at an investiture ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan. Col Babu's wife and mother received the medal. Naib Subedar Nuduram Soren (16 Bihar), Havildar K Palani (81 Field Regiment), Naik Deepak Singh (Army Medical Corps) and Sepoy Gurtej Singh (3 Punjab), in turn, were posthumously awarded Vir Chakras. Havildar Tejinder Singh (3 Medium Regiment) was the fifth and only living recipient of Vir Chakra under "Operation Snow Leopard" for the Galwan clash, which was the first time India and China witnessed casualties in a border clash in 45 years. While 20 Indian soldiers laid down their lives, China till now has not disclosed the actual number of its casualties, though it did later admit to losing a battalion commanding officer and four others. The clash had erupted after the People's Liberation Army reneged on the agreement to dismantle an observation post on Indian territory near the 'Y-junction' (Y-Nala) of the Shyok and Galwan rivers in the Galwan Valley on June 15. Recalling Col Babu's bravery, the citation said, "While holding the position, his column faced stiff resistance from the adversary who attacked using lethal and sharp weapons along with heavy stone pelting from adjoining heights." "Undaunted by the violent and aggressive action by an overwhelming strength of enemy soldiers, the officer in true spirit of service before self, continued to resist the enemy's attempt to push back Indian troops," it said. Col Babu, despite being grievously injured, led from the front to deter the "vicious enemy attack" at his position. "In the skirmish that broke out and the ensuing hand-to-hand combat with enemy soldiers, he valiantly resisted the enemy attack till his last breath, inspiring and motivating his troops to hold ground," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nation-honours-the-gallants-of-galwan/articleshow/87878304.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Fuel pumps told to verify authenticity of vax certificates||Aurangabad: District collector Sunil Chavan on Tuesday issued yet another order asking the fuel pumps to deploy dedicated employees — with the MobileGuru app on their mobile phones — to check the authenticity of the customers’ vaccination certificates. The order states that after verification, the fuel station worker should issue a token to the customer and stamp it. The customer should then take the token to another worker who will verify the stamp and the token before selling fuel. The latest order has not gone down well with Aurangabad petrol dealers’ association (PDA) and different advocacy groups who have termed it absurd, non-feasible and unwantedly taxing on citizens. High court advocate Vishal Bakal raised questions over the legality of the consecutive orders passed by district collector as well as district supply office. “None of the other district collectors in the state have passed such orders. Why only few entities — like fuel stations, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) suppliers and agriculture produce market committees — are being asked to follow this order and not other entities like liquor shops, pharmacies, grocery shops and businesses?” he asked. A letter sent by Chavan on Tuesday to PDA district president Aqil Abbas has pointed to the non-compliance of his previous orders of selling fuel only to the customers wearing masks and those producing vaccination certificates. PDA members also expressed concerns that the implementation of the order could resulting in long queues, traffic snarls as well as heated arguments by customers. Abbas told TOI: “We are short of staff. Implementing the latest order is not only going to be difficult for us, but it will also cause inconvenience to the customers.” The PDA members held a meeting to discuss the implementation of the order. Most of the members opined that they will have to cut down on operating hours to meet collector’s demand. The association’s treasurer Hiten Patel said, “Fuel stations are already short-staffed, and employes across fuel stations are reluctant to personally verify vaccination certificates, as some customers threaten and abuse the workers.” He said that despite offering incentive to the staffers, they are not ready to take on the duty of allowing the customers inside fuel station after checking vaccination certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/fuel-pumps-told-to-verify-authenticity-of-vax-certificates/articleshow/87875194.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Kumar had earlier been mistakenly declared dead by a government doctor in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad. Kumar had slipped into a coma because of an internal head injury and surgery was not a possibility because of a bleeding disorder. He was on ventilator support and doctors had put him under conservative treatment using medicines. His brother, Satyanand Gautam, informed TOI about his demise. Satyanand said, “My brother fought for his life but lost the battle after five days. He wanted to live. He showed signs of recovery as he used to respond whenever we called his name. His vitals were normal. However, he had a clot in his brain...We will take action against everyone responsible for his death.” Sreekesh, who was an electrician at the municipal corporation, was the youngest of five brothers and was married to one Rani. He was taken to a private hospital for treatment on Thursday night after an accident in Moradabad city, where doctors said he had suffered an internal head injury. After treatment, doctors gave up and referred him to a higher centre. His kin brought him to the district hospital, where the doctor on duty pronounced him dead. They then bundled him into the mortuary freezer before a post-mortem could be done the next day. Nearly seven hours later, when a "panchnama" -- a document signed by family members after identifying the body and agreeing to an autopsy -- was to be filed, Kumar's sister-in-law, Madhu Bala, noticed that he was showing signs of movement. In a video that has now been widely shared on social media, an astounded Madhu Bala is heard exclaiming, "He's not at all dead, in fact, he's far from it! How did this happen? Look, he wants to say something, he is breathing." Other equally bewildered family members then crowded the body and asked for doctors and the police. Moradabad’s chief medical superintendent, Dr Shiv Singh, had said that it could be a case of "suspended animation", where there is a temporary cessation of many vital organs without death, which could lead to extraordinary situations such as this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-miraculously-found-alive-inside-mortuary-freezer-dies-after-five-days/articleshow/87875872.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The city corporation installed the bollards on the road to introduce a cycling track last month. The cycle track was introduced by carving out a portion of the busy road to encourage cyclists and to create awareness on pedaling. The initiative was well received by bi-cycle enthusiasts. However, the initiative did not last long as the speeding vehicles on the road hit the bollards and completely damaged them. Pramod Kannah, a bi-cycle enthusiast, said he liked the initiative although the track was only for around 500m. An official from the Smart City scheme said that the cycling track was introduced as a pilot project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/speeding-vehicles-damage-plastic-bollards/articleshow/87876618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Project a real necessity to ensure speedy connectivity||SilverLine semi high-speed rail corridor connects Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod in less than four hours with stops in 10 districts en route. The project will guide the state towards the path of sustainable development and growth. Most people prefer travelling by trains in the north-south line for long distance trips. However, due to numerous hurdles, the average speed achieved is only around 45 kmph. Even the fastest train takes about 12 hours to cover a distance of 560km from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod. Since connectivity has become a major issue, the project is a real necessity. The work of SilverLine was started in 2018 and the DPR was prepared in 2020. The completion cost of the project is Rs 63,941 crore and has taken care of the cost escalation, taxes and interest during construction period up to 2025. The DPR has been recommended by NITI Aayog, department of expenditure and ministry of railways for external finance. The DPR was shared with NITI Aayog as part of processing of external loan. They had raised some queries in the initial phase as they compared the project cost with cost of high-speed rail and land cost with land cost of NH widening. Railways is able to do conventional rail projects fit for 160kmph at a cost of Rs 50-60cr per km and only marginal increase in cost is required for increasing the speed to 200kmph. For a semi-high-speed project Rs 120cr per km is sufficient. Alignment of the SilverLine also avoids thickly populated areas where land cost will be high. We have clarified the same and they got convinced and recommended the DPR for processing the loan through department of economic affairs. The estimate was also audited by an independent consultant (RITES) who have vetted the estimate as realistic and reasonable. SilverLine is envisaged as a green project which will enable ‘mode shift’ from conventional polluting vehicles to public transport system. Only RORO services are proposed as freight traffic which is found to be viable after a detailed survey with truck operators. With the completion of this project, 46,206 road users per day will be shifted to SilverLine. Alignment is at grade only for 347km length and the balance stretches are on viaduct, tunnel/cut and cover, etc. There is free movement from one side to another side of the line in viaduct, tunnel/cut and cover. In addition to the existing roads, for the convenience of the local public, a passage is being provided at every 500 meters so that people can move freely across the rail. The project has financial internal rate of return of 8.49% and is financially viable. The project is cash positive from the third year of operation. The repayment of debt is possible from project revenues itself. The multilateral/bilateral loans have repayment tenure of 20 to 40 years and will not create financial burden for the state. The work will be divided into five major EPC packages and will be taken up parallelly. The construction will be monitored by PMC agency having expertise in international projects. Preparatory works of land acquisition, including social impact assessment study, is going on so that land acquisition can be done on receipt of approval from the railway board.

Of the monthly allocation, the state has received 1.75 core doses. About 1 crore doses, officials claimed, had been administered so far in November. Another 80.2 lakh doses would reach the state before the end of the month, triggering uncanny fear of vaccine wastage. To utilise these doses, the health department is organising camps in laggard districts and ensuring that maximum people were covered under the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-plans-to-use-2-5cr-doses-allocated-in-nov-through-intensified-vax-drive/articleshow/87876628.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Three get life term for murder of 5 of family in Aligarh in 2011||AGRA: Three men were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Aligarh district and sessions court on Monday for the murder of five members of a family, including two children, in Khair area in August 2011. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1.20 lakh each on two of the accused while the third was fined Rs 50,000. The court held that accused Chandraveer, who is in his early 40s, with the help of his associates, was guilty of murdering Kedar Singh after abducting him. Later, they murdered Kedar’s wife Hemlata (35), two minor children, Naveen (15) and Swadesh (9), and his father Atar Singh (60), in their house with an intention to illegally occupy the property and money. Chandraveer had earlier borrowed Rs 2 lakh from Kedar but failed to return it. Talking with TOI, district government council Dhirendra Singh Tomar said on August 22, 2011, police were informed that a foul odour was emanating from a locked house owned by Kedar Singh in Khair area. When the police broke open the door and entered the house, they found the four decomposed bodies — Kedar Singh’s wife Hemlata, children and father -- in the kitchen. The autopsy report revealed that they were strangled to death almost 4-5 days before the bodies were found. The body of Kedar Singh, who was then missing, was recovered from Agra’s Barhan area a few days later. An FIR was registered against Chandraveer Singh and his associates, Rohit and Rajeev Sharma, under section 302 (murder), 364 (kidnapping), 120 B and 201 IPC at Khair police station on a complaint filed by the dead man’s father-in-law, Kishan Singh, a resident of Mathura. A minor was also booked in the case. According to Tomar, Kedar had sold his 20 bighas of land in Mathura and had settled in Aligarh in a bid to provide good education to his children. He had started a property dealing business in Khair. Chandraveer, who was known to Kedar, had borrowed Rs 2 lakh from him with an assurance to return it on time, but did not do so. When Kedar had asked him for his money, he took the former with him on August 12 on the pretext of paying him back. Kedar never returned to his house thereafter as he had been killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-get-life-term-for-murder-of-5-of-family-in-aligarh-in-2011/articleshow/87875880.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The caseload had plunged below the 100-mark on a few occasions in the second week of this month, but only to gradually increase later. Health officials, however, said the spread was under control and attributed the marginal increase in the fresh cases to the impact of the festive season, when people crowded the shopping and recreational facilities. They said the caseload would come down in the coming days. On Tuesday, 119 people were tested positive for the virus in the district, even as three people succumbed to the infection. It was the highest number of cases to be reported in a district in the state on the day. Chennai came second with 114 cases. The lowest caseload that the district reported recently was on November 8, when only 98 people were tested positive for the infection. The cases started increasing after November 10 and a highest of 130 cases were reported last Sunday. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said the district hadn’t seen any formation of Covid-19 clusters recently, other than the one at Annur a couple of weeks ago. “The minor surge is due to the festival crowd in the first week of November and the caseload is expected to come down in the next few weeks, as most of them are isolated cases.” Aruna said they had managed to keep the spread under control after significantly relaxing the Covid norms and reopening the educational institutions. “This was possible because of mass vaccination. More than half of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, while more than 90% has taken the first dose. We will vaccinate more people and the cases are expected to decline after people develop immunity against the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-119-covid-cases-tops-state/articleshow/87876626.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While it was sold at Rs 30 per kg a month ago, it is priced at Rs 120/kg in the city retail stores now. At RS Puram farmers’ market, tomato was sold at Rs 96 per kg on Tuesday. Traders said there wouldn’t be a significant drop in the price in the near future, as rain was still battering various parts of the state. They, however, said adequate stock of tomato was available in markets. “While tomato is available in the wholesale market, the price is on the higher side. I bought 1kg tomato at Rs 90 per kg and am selling it at Rs 96. In retail markets, the same quality tomato is priced up to Rs 130 per kg,” said a trader from the farmers’ market. V Murali, a retailer from Ramanathapuram, who sold tomato at Rs 120 per kg on the day, said all the customers had cut down on the quantity of (tomato) purchase. “Almost all of them are purchasing only less than 250g of tomatoes. So, the sale has come down.” Other vegetables are also pricey and homemakers are facing the heat. Brinjal and ladies’ finger are priced at Rs 100 per kg in retail stores. Other locally grown vegetables like cluster beans, lima beans, snake gourd, ridge gourd are also sold at higher prices. Things are not different with the vegetables grown in hills. R Shobana, a resident of Sukrawarpet, said the high prices of tomato and other vegetables had hit them hard. “. Tomato is priced almost the same as apple nowadays. I have stopped buying tomatoes, while cutting down on the quantity of other vegetables being purchased. I have around half a kg of tomatoes in my refrigerator. I think I should utilize them as long as possible.” Another homemaker said it would be a challenge to all the homemakers, who are running their families on a tight budget. “I have to be more judicious in choosing the vegetables for the next one month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/homemakers-face-heat-as-veggie-prices-soar/articleshow/87876630.cms||V Devanathan

The facility will be available on Android Google Play Store and Apple App Store from Tuesday. Passengers who already have the UTS app on their phones will have to update it for activation of this new facility. Commuters can book both journey and season tickets; renewal of season tickets is also possible, said officials. “The linking of UTS mobile app and Universal Pass will help passengers get train tickets without any hassle,” said Central Railway (CR) general manager Anil Kumar Lahoti. In the offline system, passengers have to produce their Universal Pass at the booking counter to purchase a ticket. Universal Pass, a system developed by the state government, is issued to only fully vaccinated people who have completed 14 days since the second dose. CR’s chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, “During the pandemic, UTS mobile app was suspended as there was no system of verification of the vaccination status of passengers. Now, it has been activated with proper vaccination verification made possible by linking the Universal Pass with the app.” This new app is a standalone example of the railway server collaborating with an external server for validation of tickets. The linking of Universal Pass portal and UTS mobile app has been a joint effort of the Maharashtra government, CRIS and Central Railway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaxxed-commuters-can-book-local-train-ticket-on-phones/articleshow/87876639.cms||Manthank Mehta

Talking to TOI, Pawar said that while Kerala is contributing around 57% of the fresh Covid-19 cases in the country, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu contributions are around 8% each. Similarly, West Bengal and Mizoram are each having 7% of the cases. Dr Bharati PawarThe ministry had a review meeting on the Covid situation about 10 days back. “There are nine districts in Kerala and seven in Mizoram, where the positivity rate are over 10%. Unlike Mizoram, states like Kerala and Maharashtra have much bigger populations. There is an imperative need for these big states to further curb the new cases,” stressed Pawar. Of the over 1.31 lakh active cases in the country currently, Kerala has over 54,700 active cases, Maharashtra has over 13,300 cases, Tamil Nadu over 8,600 cases, West Bengal over 7,900 cases and Mizoram 4,715 cases.“Top authorities of the Union government are in constant touch with these state governments. A team of MoHFW had even visited Kerala. The onus is on all state governments to ramp up testing in districts where the positivity rate is high,” she stressed. Responding to a query, Pawar said that the initial feedback about the door-to-door vaccination programme in the states is good. The initiative, which started on November 3, will continue till November 30.“There are 13 states such as Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Ladakh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, which have vaccinated 91% of their total beneficiaries of 18 years and above with the first dose. But there are 19 states, where the average vaccination with the first dose is around 50%,” informed the minister. Maharashtra’s first dose coverage is around 74% and second dose coverage is 35%. India’s vaccine first dose average is 79% and 38% is the second dose.“Centre has ensured that all states have an abundant quantity of vaccines for all states. The beneficiaries must come forward to get fully vaccinated,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5-states-including-maha-have-85-new-cases-mos/articleshow/87875200.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Aurangabad||Covid vaccination made must for private bus travel in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad district administration has made one dose of Covid vaccine mandatory for those looking to travel by private buses. Moreover, autorickshaw drivers and other private transport vehicle operators too have been asked to get at least partially vaccinated before November 25, failing which, they will not be allowed to carry passengers. Given th MSRTC staff strike, many citizens have had to depend on private buses or other modes of transport for their journeys. The latest order of linking travel to Covid vaccine has evoked mixed reactions. “Travel operators should make sure — right at the ticketing counters — that the passengers are vaccinated. Unvaccinated people must not be given tickets,” district collector Sunil Chavan said. While Covid vaccination is mandatory for the workforce of the private bus services, the Aurangabad RTO has been given the responsibility to ensure compliance. “Autorickshaws and other vehicles, whose owners or drivers are not vaccinated, will be seized as disciplinary move besides penal action,” the district administration has added. The administration has reiterated that partial vaccination is compulsory for the employees of different establishments such hotels, bars, liquor shops etc. “Those violating the norms related to mandatory partial vaccination will face action under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” Chavan said. Keshav Ratnaparkhe, a senior citizen, said the mandatory vaccination for boarding private buses would lower the risk of Covid infection. “Considering the chances of crowding and overall seating arrangement in buses, the risk of infection is very high. I support the move to make vaccination mandatory for those travelling by private buses,” he said. However, a private bus operator, who plys buses between Aurangabad and Beed, said authorities are going overboard trying to achieve the vaccination target. “Aurangabad is perhaps the only district where a range of vaccination-linked curbs have been imposed. Even if vaccination is not made mandatory by the Centre or the state, the district administration is acting in a strict manner by making it compulsory,” he said preferring anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vaccination-made-must-for-pvt-bus-travel-in-aurangabad/articleshow/87875208.cms||---

No wonder then, that a food heritage walk has been organized around Sursagar Lake as a part of the People’s Heritage Festival. “This lake is an identity of the city, but only a few know about the variety of cuisines that is available around the lake. So, I decided to organize a walk wherein people can enjoy the lake’s view as well as taste the food served here. It will be a different experience for the foodies,” said Chandrashekhar Patil, who has organized the walk. The food heritage walk will start from the music college at 6pm and the participants will be taken to the eateries nearby. “People will get to taste Rajasthani ice-cream, different types of pulaav, and spicy ragda patis apart from some more street-food. While they relish the cuisines, I will explain to them about the food’s history and its recipe too. Also, some history of shops will be narrated,” Patil told TOI. “Also, there are a number of historic buildings and spots around the lake including the music college, Madhyavarti girls school, Chimnabai Stree Udyogalaya, two single-screen theatres and some old temples. The participants will be briefed about these heritage structures and their importance,” Patil said, adding that the walk will be a mix of fun, leisure, relaxation and foodie delights During the heritage festival, several walks including heritage walks around Kothi, walled city and a crocodile walk along Sursagar Lake have already been organized. A bicycle ride pedalling around in the walled city also got a good response from the participants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sursagar-turns-epicurean-alley-for-heritage-walkers/articleshow/87875897.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Delhi||Reopen private schools: Delhi parents’ appeal to CM Arvind Kejriwal, LG and others||NEW DELHI: Parents of children studying in different private schools have written to the Delhi government asking them to reopen schools. As the government has permitted construction work in the wake of the air quality index improving a little, the parents want the schools also be allowed to open. The schools were closed on November 13 due to rising pollution. The letter has been signed by 140 parents from diverse backgrounds, including lawyers, professors and entrepreneurs. It has been sent to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, education minister Manish Sisodia, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and a few others. The letter states, “After 20 months of closure, Delhi Disaster Management Authority authorised the reopening of schools for all classes in Delhi at 50% capacity, effective November 1, 2021. This coincided with the annual pollution cycle. Unfortunately, our children’s education was the first victim of the pollution response. While recognising the enormity of the pollution crisis and the risk it poses to our children’s health, we strongly urge the Delhi government to reconsider this decision and reopen schools.” “Schools are authorised to operate at 50% capacity in hybrid mode. This has reduced the extent of potential transport on the roads thus reducing any public health benefits of closing schools. Further, the hybrid nature of schooling offers parents with alternative modes of protection to make a choice about sending their children to schools. Majority of school-going children do not have access to methods of protection against air pollution such as air purifiers. Consequently, school closure presents no significant health benefits to most school-going children in Delhi, most of whom have suffered significantly from one of the longest pandemic-induced school closures in the world,” it further stated. Parents argue that due to Covid-19, children are wearing masks that will reduce their exposure to air pollution. “The long-term closure of primary schools is having a significant detrimental impact on the learning of our young children,” the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reopen-pvt-schools-parents-appeal-to-cm-lg-and-others/articleshow/87877291.cms||---
---||Delhi||Driverless operations to begin on Delhi Metro’s longest corridor from tomorrow||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro network’s longest corridor — Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar)— is all set to go “driverless” from Thursday. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said on Tuesday that Driverless Train Operations on Pink Line would be inaugurated on November 25 by Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot via videoconferencing at 11.30am. TOI was the first to report on November 15 that driverless operations on Pink Line were going to start by this year-end. With the addition of Pink Line, DMRC’s driverless network, which currently includes the 37km Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West), would stand at nearly 96km comprising 9% of the world’s total driverless Metro network. The driverless network would cross the 100km mark when the 12.5km Maujpur-Majlis Park extension being constructed as part of Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV project gets completed by 2023. Delhi Metro would be joining the world’s longest automated mass transit networks along with Vancouver SkyTrain (79.6km) and Dubai Metro (89.6km), and inching closer to Kuala Lumpur’s Rapid KL system (97.4km). In the next couple of years, Delhi Metro’s automated network would be among the world’s largest along with Shanghai Metro (101.8km) and Singapore MRT (199km). The corridor was inspected by Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety last week for driverless operations. Following the safety go-ahead, DMRC finalised the date for starting driverless operations for the public. Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the country’s first fully automated driverless train service on Magenta Line on December 28, 2020. It was expected that driverless operations would also begin on the 58.4km Pink Line in early 2021, but the target couldn’t be achieved due to the “missing link” at Trilokpuri where DMRC had been unable to construct a viaduct. The missing link was bridged in August and uninterrupted train movement on the entire corridor could finally begin. DMRC integrated this section with the rest of the corridor’s state-of-the-art signalling system on a war-footing, which allows automated driverless operations. With the Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling technology, driverless train operations are possible in both the Magenta and Pink lines. Compared with the technology used in older Metro corridors, CBTC allows more efficient and safe train operations. Driverless operations have been made possible due to changes in the existing general rules for running trains that take into account the presence of a driver and the guidelines of handling any emergency. The Metro Railway General Rules 2020 take into account driverless operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/driverless-ops-to-begin-on-metros-longest-corridor-from-tomorrow/articleshow/87876676.cms||Sidharatha Roy

However, Dimasa was not the only language to make a debut at Iffi this year. ‘Sunpat’ a film set in Uttarakhand is also the first in Gharwali language to be screened at Iffi. The non-feature film of 35 minutes duration, besides giving representation to Gharwali, also touches upon an important social problem facing Uttarakhand, that of out-migration. The film’s director Rahul Rawat and producer Rohit Rawat are themselves from Uttarakhand, who are at Iffi with their very first film. “The film is loosely based on migration, which has resulted in more than 1,500 villages turning into ghost villages in Uttarakhand. This figure is as per the government data and the actual figure is most likely much higher. Migration is a major concern in Uttarakhand, we are on the verge of losing our culture, our identity,” said Rahul. The film is set in the small village of Sunpat, in the beautiful mountains of Uttarakhand. The people of Sunpat seem to have lost their past and appear to have no future, said Rahul, describing the film’s backdrop. “In the film, twelve-year-old Anuj and his friend Bhartu set out to find if the girl Anuj likes pays any heed to him or not. As they plan out ways to propose to her, it’s through their journey that we see the emotional trauma that a large part of the villages in Uttarakhand are facing due to the long-prevailing socioeconomic migration,” said Rohit, who said the film does not talk about the problem but shows it. He said that the desertion of villages began more than two decades ago in Uttarakhand. “Threading many issues, the story portrays the innocence of friendship, struggles of villages in the mountains and the undesired uncertainty of life there in Uttarakhand,” said Rohit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/based-on-uttarakhands-ghost-villages-film-in-gharwali-to-debut-at-iffi-today/articleshow/87876640.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Heart attack patient’s kin fear ‘stigma’ around HIV||MUMBAI: Although HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence with the availability of medicines, there is still much stigma against the condition as the behaviour of a patient’s relatives in a private hospital recently showed. The family of a 63-year-old man brought him to Wockhardt Hospital, Agripada, while he was having a heart attack but took him away a few minutes later from the emergency room itself without giving any reasons. “An ECG report confirmed he was having a heart attack, his blood was collected for testing, and the family was told he would need an angioplasty immediately, but they suddenly said they don’t want any treatment and took discharge against medical advice,” said cardiologist Dr Naem Hassanfatta. Within 20 minutes, though, they were back saying the patient was highly breathless. “This time they agreed to an angiography and we immediately wheeled the patient to our cath lab. At this point, we received a call from the pathology department that our patient was HIV-positive and we needed to observe universal precautions to conduct the procedure,” the doctor said. The patient's anterior coronary artery was 100% occluded with a clot. The family didn’t mention the patient’s status until the next day. “The patient’s wife brought his antiviral medicines and shared his detailed history. I sensed in her words a deep fear of discrimination,” said the doctor. The patient is recovering well after the procedure. While surgery on HIV-positive persons is routine enough to not make it to the headlines, experts said the fear of stigmatisation at the workplace or healthcare hubs still runs high. “I have myself operated on HIV-positive persons but this time I was surprised at the extent of the family’s fears,” said Dr Hassanfatta. Dr Ajay Mahajan, who heads the cardiology department of KEM Hospital, Parel, said, “We use universal precautions such as using two pairs of gloves and discarding the biomedical waste separately. But operating on an HIV-positive person is absolutely routine these days.” The earlier fear that HIV would spread through touch is no longer there in medical corridors and doctors examine an HIV-positive person just as they would examine anybody else, said Dr Mahajan. Doctors operate on patients with Hepatitis B, which is the most infective virus. “We operate on Covid-positive patient these days, so there should be no fear or stigma faced by HIV-positive persons,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-heart-attack-patients-kin-fear-stigma-around-hiv/articleshow/87876647.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Hyderabad needs stricter green rules’||Last week, TOI asked its readers if they think Hyderabad has enough green cover and what more must be done — by the government and common citizens — to further enhance it. Here are some of the responses...MAKE WALKING, PLAYING SPACESThough there are some areas in the city that have adequate green cover, I believe that the administration and common people must work together to improve it and preserve it. Heritage structures alone cannot attract tourists to a city, it must also have enough green cover spread over its areas. There are cities in the world which cater exclusively to places for walking, relaxing and playing. It is the ‘natural medicine’ which helps cure both physical and mental well-being of an individual. Air pollution has always been a bane with the influx of people and invasion of motor vehicles. The government, with the help of people, should see to the maintenance of gardens, parks in designated areas and ensure authenticity of culture. —Anand MenonEVERY COLONY MUST CHIP INMy colony is getting new plants and soon it will become a beautiful place. The Secunderbad Cantonment is doing a great thing in my society. It is a great initiative by the Cantonment Board to make this society greener and look beautiful. It was lacking in this society so far. I would like to thank the SCB for making this possible. I also want to highlight that such measures are important as a green society not only makes the environment better but also adds to the visual appeal of a place. I think more and more societies must take up similar drives to collectively work towards making Hyderabad greener. – Manav ParikhCHOOSE PLANTS WISELYThe concerned authorities must plant more and more perennial plants using used tyres, plastic bottles/cans as planters. Example: Bougainville, money plants, lemon grass, spider grass, etc. Plants should be more like climbers (occupying less space), air purifying and oxygen giving, mosquitoes repelling and should need less maintenance. Also. lot of vegetation should be done under flyovers, on the road dividers. This will reduce the heat caused due to pollution too. Every gated community should compulsorily have at least 30% area as green zone with air purifying trees and plants. —Nidhi LohumiCUT ONE, PLANT TWOAt present, green spaces are being done away with and replaced by concrete buildings for the sake of modern civilisation. But we must realise it is leading to a serious situation. My suggestion to the government is simple -- Cut a tree, but plant two trees in its place. In this way there will not be any shortage of trees in the modern concrete civilisation. The slums in our cities are thickly populated but we can hardly see trees and plants because they don’t have the awareness of the consequences of a greenless future. We can spread awareness about green cover by voluntary associations, samiti meetings, posters, street dramas etc. We can also gift a plant on different occasions which is also a different way of promoting awareness about green spaces. Let’s all follow this afforestation equation and help not only save our trees but also increase the green cover of our city.  —Ayushman SahaDON’T FELL, TRANSLOCATEThere is certainly a need for more green cover all over our lovely twin cities. Ever since our city transformed into a concrete jungle with multi-storied buildings pushing out all the greenery, there is a dire need to protect nature. While sanctioning permission for these buildings, officials must insist on builders and owners taking extra care to not adversely impact the existing green foliage and plant more trees in and around the buildings. We also must put a stop to the mindless felling of tall trees that protect the flora and fauna, to make way for wider roads. It must be strictly ensured that trees, instead of being cut, are carefully translocated to areas where greenery is scarce. Citizens must also participate in promoting eco-friendly measures among people of all ages and inculcate those among children, to help enhance the city’s green cover. —Dr M S Krishna KumarPRESERVE THE WEALTHI’ve been living in Hyderabad since 2016 and in the last five years I have come to realise that Hyderabad is better than most cities when it comes to its green cover. Though it is one of the reasons why I do not fall sick as much as I used to in my previous place of residence, I think the green cover is limited to only some places. Along the highways, for instance, there is a lot of greenery, and the view is beautiful. The government has also helped by launching its largescale tree plantation drive -- Haritha Haram – that has worked towards increasing the tree cover in the state from 24% to 33%. What we, as common citizens, need to do now is maintain this by taking proper care of the trees planted in our neighbourhood, as much as possible, and do our bit to increase it further. – Nishtha RaghuwanshiPEOPLE MUST BE RESPONSIBLEI personally feel that a lot needs to be done to make the city greener and beautiful. Almost all residential colonies have ongoing construction work of all kinds and many of them cut down trees. Even the electricity department in the city cuts down trees or branches of larger trees at random, for the sake of so-called protection of electricity wires. Hyderabad needs more green coverage in the form of trees and parks, especially in residential areas. The government should reinforce a ban on cutting down trees for any purpose and help in building more parks with proper grass. Apart from roads and highways, we also need greenery in our neighbourhood. People should also take responsibility for not only planting more trees in their respective areas but also curb any illegal cutting of any kind of greenery. Awareness and a sense of responsibility is required by all. —Asra AhsanLEARN FROM CHANDIGARHIt is sad to see that our city’s green cover has shrunk due to rapid urbanisation. Hyderabad lacks planning in the developed/developing areas. Residential colonies, neighbourhoods, and IT hubs like Gachibowli, Hi-Tec City hardly have any green spaces. We must realise that public open spaces/parks can drastically improve the physical and mental health of people. Our city needs to try and emulate Chandigarh to increase the green cover. Chandigarh has an impressive 46% green cover which is 13% more than the national target of 33%. The Gachibowli stretch from Infosys to Wipro circle hardly has trees on the sides of the road. Sadly, this is a similar story in many areas of the city. There are only big flowerpots in the middle of the road with decorative plants which hardly helps. If we can have trees planted on both sides of the road, it will lower the temperature, provide shade, and improve air quality. —Haritha BommakantiAPPOINT TREE GUARDSTo improve the green cover in Hyderabad, strong legislations are needed for banning tree cutting above 5- 6” girth. When cutting becomes necessary, trees must be translocated elsewhere. Alternatively, 10 healthy saplings must be planted for each tree that’s cut. Building and road plans must be approved without cutting existing trees. Yearly pruning of trees must be done at the end of summer to reduce green weight, prevent property loss due to tree fall and uprooting in rains. Depending on road width, small, medium and large size trees must be selected. Vacant public land should be used for growing fruit bearing, fuel and timber producing saplings for local consumption. Tree guards must be fixed around saplings up to a certain age to prevent stray cattle from eating them. Tree bases must be kept free from cement, coal tar etc and they should not be used for hanging boards (for advertisements) etc. Finally, every citizen must be urged to adopt at least one tree. – G S S MurtyUSE OPEN PLOTSMany old trees that once dotted the sides of the main roads of Secunderabad have now been felled to build flyovers and widen roads. Even on the outskirts of the city, a lot of agricultural lands have been converted into space for housing complexes. Though the Haritha Haram programme is in vogue, the survival rate of those plants is poor due to improper plantations. To combat the changing climatic conditions it is very important to create well-planned greenery in all open places wherever possible. In Secunderabad Cantonment there are several open plots -- meant to be used as lung spaces – that have turned into garbage bins. Mass greening of these areas should be taken up with the constituency development funds involving politicians and public in the interest of global cooling.  —M Surender KumarTAKE PUBLIC OPINIONThough Hyderabad never had trees like Bengaluru, about 40 to 50 years ago one could walk along streets like MG Road or RP Road on a summer afternoon comfortably with trees along the road even if not many. Where are the trees now? They have been cut and this continues even today. Under the ruse of development huge trees -- 50 to 100 years old -- are being cut. The government may argue that for every tree cut 10 samplings are being planted. True, but out of the 10 only two may survive. After planting they are not being looked after or maintained. Look at what was going on at KBR Park. Fortunately, the felling there has been stopped by the court. Citizens should have a say in them as stakeholders. It must be made a rule that authorities cannot allow a single tree to be cut without people's acceptance. —S RaghavanNO TREES, NO HOMEThe government has taken up a lot of green measures in the last six years, but a lot more still needs to be done. Though it has rolled out Haritha Haram, the project has failed to achieve its target. In my opinion, a few things must be done to supplement this project. For instance, while constructing a new house or an apartment, GHMC should specify an area mandatory for plantation along with its construction plan. Old premises should be inspected by GHMC frequently for plantations. Awareness programmes should be conducted in every area including schools and colleges about planting trees. The government must distribute pamphlets mentioning free samples of plant collections in every area -- social media platforms can be used for this. Lastly, the Government must ensure every household plants at least two to three plants within their premises. —Khulood ZaheerNEED STABLE POLICYAs compared to other cities, Hyderabad seems to be slightly better when it comes to green cover. However, at the same time a lot of green cover has been destroyed by haphazard growth in the name of development, real estate and infrastructure. Hyderabad’s green cover policy constantly changes colour along with change of government. While a lot of the taxpayers’ money was spent by various governments, all of them failed to bring the desired changes. It seems the rulers framing development policy were (or are) not hand in hand with those responsible for green policy. Many times, the policy gets tweaked under pressure from parties with vested interests. Also, common citizens, instead of haphazardly planting huge trees, need to concentrate and maintain small plants. The government’s green cover policy should remain the same and not change colour with every change in government. — N NagarajanINVOLVE THE YOUTHWith many trees cut indiscriminately in Hyderabad during the past three decades to give space for expansion plans, the city lost green cover to a large extent. Land sharks compounded the problem by literally turning it into a concrete jungle by uprooting many trees mindlessly step by step. As green cover and landscape is essential to enhance the beauty of a city besides giving much-needed breathing space to its citizens, the government besides keeping up the momentum of planting saplings in and around the city must go all out to involve corporate groups, schools and colleges in a big way to expand the green drive. Also, it must look at involving the younger generation that is more aware about the importance of green cover and can work with the government to prevent indiscriminate felling of trees. – Srinivasan Ramaswamy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-needs-stricter-green-rules/articleshow/87876645.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dadri MLA murder case: After DP Yadav, Uttarakhand HC acquits another accused||By Sonali MishraNAINITAL: Two weeks after Uttarakhand high court (HC) acquitted former MP Dharam Pal Yadav in the murder case of Ghaziabad MLA Mahendra Singh Bhati -- setting aside the conviction order of a special CBI court saying there was no 'concrete evidence' to establish guilt -- the court on Tuesday acquitted another co-accused, Pal Singh, due to lack of evidence. A division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma ordered the release of Pal Singh, currently lodged in Haridwar jail, saying there are “contradictions” in the evidence presented by CBI. On the evening of September 13, 1992, Bhati was shot dead at Dadri railway crossing in UP’s Ghaziabad district. The MLA's aide, Uday Prakash Arya, was also killed in the attack. Subsequently, DP Yadav and Preneet Bhati, Karan Yadav, Tejpal Bhati, Jaipal Singh, Maharaj Singh, Aulad Ali and Pal Singh were named as accused in the case. In 2015, a CBI court convicted DP Yadav, Preneet Bhati, Karan Yadav and Pal Singh under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and sentenced them to life imprisonment. While four of the accused -- Tejpal Bhati, Jaipal Singh Gujjar, Maharaj Singh and Aulad Ali -- have died, the HC verdict on the other two accused is likely to be pronounced in the coming days. TOI had earlier reported that the family of MLA Bhati is dissatisfied with the HC verdict on DP Yadav and said they would file an appeal in the Supreme Court against the HC order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dadri-mla-murder-case-after-dp-yadav-hc-acquits-another-accused/articleshow/87873950.cms||---
---||Goa||‘OTT platforms are like mafia, they keep regional films out’||PANAJI: Union minister for Information & Broadcasting Anurag Singh Thakur, speaking at the 52nd International Film Festival of India (Iffi), said he wants to take good Indian regional films to international platforms. However, the chairperson of the jury for the Iffi Indian Panorama section, which is for regional films, had a different take on OTT platforms and their attitude towards regional cinema. This is the first time Iffi has collaborated with OTT platforms. A National Award winner, SV Rajendra Singh Babu, said that OTT platforms were operating like a mafia in India and are keeping regional films out. He said there are already good regional films being made in India, which need a platform that OTTs can provide, but are not inclined to provide. “OTTs are like a mafia today. They do not have any offices in cities like Bengaluru and Chennai. How does a regional language filmmaker even approach them? How does a producer know whom to contact? There are four to five agents in between and one has to pay up at each stage,” said Babu. He said he has already discussed the issue with the Union I&B minister who has agreed to address the problem. “Regional films are losing their identity. Already there are no theatres for regional films. Now the OTT platforms have a lot of subscribers in places like Karnataka, but no offices in the state where filmmakers can approach them. I am not saying show all regional films, there are bad and ugly films too. But at least give a platform to some good ones,” said Rajendra Babu. “Another suggestion I have given to the I&B minister is that the number of films selected for India Panorama section should be increased. Earlier, 25 films in each of the feature and non-feature film segment was fixed based on the number of states. Today we have more states,” said Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ott-platforms-are-like-mafia-they-keep-regional-films-out/articleshow/87876660.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Locals took to social media and posted pictures of the polluted river and demanded that Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) get it tested. The river supplies water to over 40 lakh residents in Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Badlapur and many villagers. Ravindra Lingayat, member, Ulhas Nadi Bachao Kruti Samiti, said, “We appeal to people to avoid directly drinking the water. We want authorities to check where untreated industrial effluents are released.”  Shashikant Dayma, another activist, said, “We called MPCB several times and sent emails since morning but it sent a team at 5.30pm by which time the colour had returned to normal. MPCB should find out who is responsible for pollution in the river.” S L Waghmare, executive engineer of MPCB, Kalyan division, said, “The primary probe shows the river colour did not change due to chemicals. We have collected samples and a laboratory report will confirm the reason for the change.” MPCB officials suspect resorts along the river may have discharged untreated water in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-polluted-ulhas-river-gets-muddy-colour-mpcb-collects-samples/articleshow/87877978.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Talking with TOI, SHO of the area concerned said the boy had failed in Class X board exam last year and was pursuing his studies from an open school. He allegedly decided to take to extortion to make money after his parents refused to give him hefty pocket money. He picked up tips on how to make extortion calls on social media and allegedly sought Rs 20 lakh as extortion money from three jewellers of the city. The boy’s father is a contractual employee in power dept, and mother a housewife, police said. During interrogation, the boy told police that he was inspired by an article about extortion of a businessman. He scanned social media to learn how to talk like a gangster and make calls using the Internet so that his IP address could not be tracked, the SHO said. He procured the numbers of the jewellers from their hoardings and he called them via the Internet. Three jewellers -- one at Guru Nanak Bazaar, and two with showrooms on Sardhana Road -- received the calls within a span of one week “He had asked for Rs 5 lakh each from two jewellers and Rs 10 lakh from the third one. We had then formed a team to crack the case,” the SHO added. The boy claimed he planned and executed the crime on his own and no one helped him. It took the police 10 days to track and arrest him. He was sent to the juvenile home on the orders of the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/boy-17-makes-extortion-calls-to-3-jewellers-for-pocket-money-arrested/articleshow/87875940.cms||Ishita Mishra

The allottees said that DDA had asked them to make full payment within two months even though work was going on to complete the flats. DDA had launched a housing scheme in January 2021. Among the 1,354 flats on offer, the 348 MIG flats in Dwarka 16-B turned out to be the most sought after. DDA, however, couldn't finish construction on time and the apartments, which cost between Rs. 1.1 to Rs. 1.2 crore could not be handed over due to ongoing work. Arun Aggarwal, one of the allottees, said that DDA has issued demand letters and asked for full payment by January 17, 2022, while the work at the site is still going on. Aggarwal claimed that though DDA officials have not responded to their queries, the construction will take six more months. DDA didn't respond to a questionnaire sent by TOI and didn't respond to subsequent phone calls and messages either. “DDA has charged 10% surcharge on the land premium, construction cost including grid charges and development charges on MIG category, which they have equated to the same surcharge of 10% which applied on High Income Group (HIG) category for Jasola as well,” Aggarwal said. “DDA's objective is to give affordable housing for the masses. The authority applied surcharge on the MIG category, which affects the middle class,” he said. “The work of the sewage treatment plant is still going on and horticulture work has not yet started,” said Ashish Sehgal, another allottee. Sehgal claimed that the complex is yet to get a No Objection Certificate from the Delhi Fire Services. “Without a fire NOC, they can't hand over the flats, but we haven't received a clear answer from DDA on this,” he said. The allottees said that if they had to make the full payment to get possession of the flats, the situation would become tricky. “Even the registration amount of Rs. We paid two lakh while applying for the scheme that is stuck since February 2021,” Sehgal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/allottees-of-dwarka-mig-flats-in-a-fix/articleshow/87877358.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Goa||Goa: ‘In 3 months, 14% Covid cases among kids, but no hospitalisations, deaths’||PANAJI: Over the past 12 weeks, children have constituted 14% of all Covid-19 infections detected in the state. The directorate of health services has revealed that of 5,381 cases between August 23 and November 16, the 0-17 age group makes up 767 cases. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida told TOI that the statistics are not unusual, and added that none of the children who contracted Covid during this period died. “None of the children (even) had to be admitted to hospital,” she said. “The few who were at GMC were admitted for other procedures, and Covid-19 was an incidental finding. They didn’t have Covid symptoms, and were found to be positive only after they were screened. It’s safe for children to return to school. Considering children are the only unvaccinated section of the population, we are keeping a close eye.” The directorate has also been monitoring Covid statistics for the 15-17 age group after physical classes began for them, and found that they comprised 27% of all children infected during this period. “There was no significant rise in Covid-19 infections in this age group despite classes for them being held in the offline mode,” she added. Dr Sushma Kirtani child, newborn and adolescent paediatrician and member of the Indian Association of Paediatrics, too says it is safe for children of all ages to return to school and nurseries, and that this must be done without delay. “Children have better innate immunity and adaptive immunity due to exposure to other viruses. They have healthier lungs and immature ACE receptors. Cases of severe Covid-19 pneumonia and adverse outcomes are usually seen only in infants, children with comorbidities, and those who are immuno-compromised,” she said. Parents are at their wits’ end trying to educate and discipline their wards, and children are frustrated, presenting with behavioural problems and falling back on their studies, said Kirtani. “Children from economically-poorer backgrounds are being pushed into child labour and will forever lose out on education if schools continue to be closed. This will have consequences in the form of child marriages, teenage pregnancies, infant mortality and several associated problems,” said Kirtani, who also served as former chairperson of the state commission for the protection of child rights. “All schools and even nurseries must start following all protocols in a staggered manner, even for a few hours three times a week, and slowly increase, while being monitored,” she said. She has other suggestions too: Parents shouldn’t be allowed inside, children must wear masks and carry sanitisers, canteens must stay closed (with children asked to bring their own food), sharing of water and food should be prohibited, and talking in corridors banned. She also said that midday meals could continue as long as there’s no overcrowding. Also, importantly, children with any respiratory infection should be asked to stay home. “If 100% seating capacity is being permitted in closed air-conditioned theatres for Iffi, why should children suffer by not returning to schools where chances of infection spreading is very low, with windows and doors open?” she asked. “Children have to get back into the routine of going to school. and if they don’t, they will struggle with their studies as they proceed to higher classes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-3-months-14-covid-cases-among-kids-but-no-hospitalisations-deaths/articleshow/87876694.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Goa||Margao civic body to hold drive to evict illegal vendors||MARGAO: After pressure from the Gandhi market vegetable and readymade cloth vendors association to get rid of illegal vendors squatting around the market area, the chairperson of Margao municipal council, Lyndon Pereira on Tuesday said the municipality council will hold a drive against illegal hawkers and vendors this week. “The chief officer and myself have taken a decision to conduct the drive this week against those selling illegal items on the road. Shopkeepers don’t get business because of these illegal vendors. This is happening around Gandhi market and the new market,” he said. Pereira said the illegal vendors restart their activities within a day or two of such drives. When asked why the drives are not ongoing, Pereira cited staff shortage. The council that used to have four market inspectors, now has two who also have work in the office to issue income certificates. When asked about supervisors, he said only one market supervisor remains and added that the chief officer will instruct the market inspector to appoint a supervisor for tackling illegal activities. The association submitted a memorandum to the council, giving it 15 days to act against illegal vendors eating into their business, failing which it has threatened to hold a morcha. President of the association Rajendra Ajagaonkar told mediapersons that those selling vegetables are losing business and hence their perishables get spoilt. “The illegal vendors are selling vegetables everywhere, so what will they do? For two months we have been telling the council to conduct a survey to identify illegal vendors and take action, but nothing has been done. They acted against one vendor near KTC bus stand. They have our full support, but why act against only one vendor? he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/margao-civic-body-to-hold-drive-to-evict-illegal-vendors/articleshow/87876682.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Read the write act for your children at Bookaroo||NEW DELHI: For children aged 4-14 years, the coming weekend has a lot in store. Bookaroo, the festival of children’s literature, is making a comeback after a year. The two-day event from November 27 will be held at the National Rail Museum and offer workshops on art and craft and storytelling sessions, among other interesting pursuits, to Delhi’s kids. To bring back a sense of normalcy in the pandemic era and to move the children away from the computer screens, Bookaroo has nearly 50 sessions lined up outdoors. Swati Roy, curator of the festival, said, “These programmes have been designed for all ages and the content is varied enough to cater to all interests. There are several first-time authors this time and several book launches too.” Last year, Bookaroo had been planned across five cities but had to be cancelled due to Covid. And though 75 online sessions were organised, festival curator M. Venkatesh the children’s interest flagged after continually sitting in front of the screens. “Many of them told us the sessions ended up being extensions of the online classes they were attending,” revealed Venkatesh. “This year, we are moving outdoors. It has been almost 20 months that the children have been in their homes.” However, foreign authors will not be participating at this year’s festival. Even then, the curators said that because they wanted to provide children with an experience that is beyond the virtual world, no online sessions have been planned over the two days of the festival. Said Roy, “We did not want parallel online and offline sessions because this would only add to the confusion among children while also diluting the impact of the event.” Hand sanitisers have been installed at all the locations of the event, and visitors are advised to wear face masks at all times in compliance with anti-Covid protocols. Entry to the festival will also be on a first-come-first-seated basis. “Only a limited number of children will be permitted to attend a particular session,” informed Roy. “We hope Bookaroo is also an opportunity for new readers, such as those visiting the Rail Museum, to join the festival and attend the various sessions if they wish to.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bookaroo-read-the-write-act-for-your-children-here/articleshow/87876696.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Handled key cases even after suspension: Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: Two sensational disclosures were made before the Justice K U Chandiwal Commission probing into the former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s letter bomb. Dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze told the commission that even when he was under suspension, he was directly involved in investigation and detection of crucial cases during Singh’s tenure. Secondly, Singh’s counsel, Abhinav Chandrachud, disclosed that the letter is based on hearsay. Waze was cross examined by Sanjeev Palande’s counsel, Shekhar Jagtap, who sought information from him on his activities during the prolonged period of suspension. Waze submitted that when he was under suspension, since on the instructions of Singh, he was associated with detection and investigation of key cases. “Even during suspension, I was assisting not only Param Bir Singh, but senior officials of Mumbai police and at the national level too,’’ Waze said. On his appointment as head of the CIU, Waze disclosed that it was not Singh, but the then joint commissioner had appointed him to lead the CIU. Further, Waze stated that he was reinstated at the instance of the then home minister Anil Deshmukh and not by Singh. During the course of proceedings, there was discussion on whether Singh can be cross examined as a witness, since the entire case is arising out of the letter written by him to the chief minister on March 20. It was felt that even if he does not want to be cross examined or provide additional information and he has nothing to say, still there was a proposal for Singh’s cross examination, following which Abhinav Chandrachud submitted that the letter was based on hearsay and it was written on the basis of information given by his officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/handled-key-cases-even-after-suspension-in-mumbai-waze/articleshow/87878035.cms||---

And it has also made the town that has been making the finest of handmade ‘dhows’ for the past 400 years richer by around Rs 10 crore. Resplendent in its colossal three-storey structure, everything about the 18-ft tall vessel is royal — believed to have been ordered by Dubai’s royal family for pursuing their hobby of fishing on high seas. “We got the order to make this fishing ship from Ibrahim Abdul Razak Ustadi,” said veteran ship-maker Ibrahim Mistry, who with the help of 36 workers took three years to build the huge vessel. “It is almost ready and will sail off to Dubai in a month. I have come to know that those who have placed the order are connected with Dubai’s royal family,” Mistry told TOI. The fishing ship can house eight boats measuring 60-ft each and has consumed around 23,000 cubic metre imported wood from Malaysia and Indonesia. It has nine air-conditioned rooms that can accommodate 32 persons as well as refrigerated storerooms to keep the catch fresh. Once the ship reaches the destination, the purchaser will fit the engine that will run on diesel. The initial cost of the ship was Rs 6.5 crore, but owners’ customization added another Rs 3.5 crore to the bill. Mandvi, the ship-making town in Kutch, has been honing its skills since the 16th century. Over the centuries, the workers here have perfected the art of making finest handmade, wooden boats known as ‘dhows’. Generally boats used in cargo handling are made here. “This is the first time Mandvi got a fishing boat order. The boat will be towed by a big ship to its destination within the next 15 to 20 days,” Mistry added. Haji Junja, a leading trader of the Mandvi ship building industry, said, “This is a rare order. Generally we get orders to make cargo ships. This order has been placed by a royal family of the Gulf who wants to pursue their hobby of fishing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mandvi-builds-longest-wooden-boat-at-rs-10cr/articleshow/87875956.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

We will continue to sell fish, but we will not pay sopo if issues of electrification and cleanliness are not resolved. We will not be responsible for not paying sopo and for any law and order situation that takes place. The responsibility will lie with the sopo contractor and PDA,” president Ibrahim Musa told mediapersons. The wholesale fish market from where fish is transported to markets and five-star hotels throughout Goa is in a pathetic state, Musa said, adding that assurances of a full fledged concretised market haven’t been fulfilled yet. “Nobody will want to eat the fish if they see the state of the market and the muck here. One of the members of our association got a cut and his foot turned septic as a result, and now he has to amputate it,” he said. The lack of lighting in the market has resulted in people taking advantage of the darkness to carry out illegal activities and giving duplicate notes while making payments to vendors, Musa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wont-pay-sopo-warn-fish-traders/articleshow/87876697.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Quicker intra city mobility crucial in future||Though cities in Kerala have begun thinking of Metro projects, those are meant for inner city mobility. For a state like Kerala, quicker intra city mobility is going to be important in the future. As we develop and become a more vibrant economy, faster mobility is going to be the keyword. Cities presently have the major issue of congestion coupled with pollution making mobility slower and tedious. The cities like Bogota and Curitiba showed to the world that when road space becomes limited, other options have to be thought of. Various other cities opted for the Metro as it was the only mode that assures time-bound mobility. If we look at examples like that of the UK, the cities there have realized the importance of working as clusters and the ‘combined authorities’ facilitation enables cities to work together especially in areas like transport. This concept is equally important for a state like Kerala where from the north to the south many things are getting integrated increasingly. In fact, in the future the technical limits of one district separating it from the other are not going to be relevant when it comes to movement and economic activity. The National Capital Region is a classic example where the limits of Delhi do not have much relevance for people moving back and forth and all one is interested in is smooth and quick mobility. In a more or less straight line state like Kerala, thinking about the future and starting action for integrated mobility is extremely critical and this is where the proposed SilverLine project is critical for the future. The earlier we start making investments in critical future oriented infrastructure projects, the better it will be. With the Centre giving infrastructure push and in-principle approval and Railways being roped in as the partner in the process, this major employment generating economic activity is bound to be the trend setter for a better integrated, modern Kerala where we will not have to think of how to provide a seamless connectivity when other developments have taken place. By taking this up, Railways will not have to plan separately for further rail improvements as the requirement of fast north south connectivity would be addressed through this project. Also, there are going to be some township development activities as well. Of course, I would assume that the requirements of citizens who are affected by the project would be taken care of appropriately. On the financing side, the funds, if availed from international agencies like Jica, the interest rate would be much less. Also, given that the finances would be spread over a period of five to 10 years, which could be the anticipated completion period of the project, the impact is unlikely to be high on the state exchequer. Coupled with the revenue from the project once people realize the relevance of the project and ridership increases, the repayment may not be impossible.

Mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu, accompanied by senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal and deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi, launched construction of the slip road near Ivy Hospital on Tuesday. Authorities have been assigned to identify and propose places required for construction of flyovers in Mohali, said the mayor. Mohali Municipal Corporation is constructing slip roads at required places in Mohali to ease traffic load. The mayor said slip roads would help control the burgeoning traffic in Mohali. In the first phase, he said, a slip road would be constructed near Ivy Hospital in Mohali, two in Phase 5, one at Old Amartex Chowk and two in Industrial Area. After this, he said, more slip roads would be constructed at other places where needed and old slip roads would be repaired for public convenience and to check increasing traffic. He also said that authorities had been asked to make a proposal for construction of flyovers in Mohali where the traffic load was very high. Flyovers, he said, could be constructed in coordination with Gmada. The mayor also said that the construction of flyovers in the expanding city of Mohali was imperative. --||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-to-get-slip-roads-at-6-places-flyovers-to-follow/articleshow/87875966.cms||---

This small farmer, having just over 10 bighas of land, is a resident of a village in Shamli and was 36 when the Muzaffarnagar police booked him under the Arms Act for allegedly possessing four 12 bore bullets in 1995. Over the past 26 years and after 200 hearings, Salauddin maintains that the allegations levelled against him were "false" and that he had been "framed" by his relatives “out of personal enmity”. He was arrested in 1995 and he even served 20 days in jail. "My whole life was spent attending court hearings. The case sucked up my earnings as well. What should I say? I am thankful to god," Salauddin said. Chief judicial magistrate Manoj Kumar, in his order, observed that the prosecution did not testify the charges nor produced any evidence before the court during the course of the trial. Their right to testify was withdrawn in 2019. Salauddin's son, Ashu Ahmad, said his father developed thrombosis in the foot, which caused him intense pain when he walked long distances. "As a result, he had to take painkillers before going to court and this caused him immense discomfort,"Ashu said, adding that he was just two years of age when the case was slapped against his father. Salauddin says he had to bear substantial legal expenses when he just earned roughly Rs 20,000 a month. He also had the responsibility to feed a family of five, besides spending on his medicines. Ending the long-drawn trial, the court in its judgment order on November 9 said, "Now that the prosecution could not prove the charges against the accused, Mohd Salauddin is given the benefit of doubt and, hence, is exonerated of all charges made against him under the Arms Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/26-yrs-200-hearings-later-court-lets-off-farmer-booked-for-possessing-4-bullets/articleshow/87875999.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Hyderabad||Found joy in creative pursuits||By Tejashree Deshmukh When the lockdown and WFH was imposed, it was exciting to get some free time at the beginning. But the excitement did not last for long. Back in my bachelor days, I used to love painting and pencil drawings. I used to go to yoga classes after office hours. However, I got disconnected from it all eventually due to the busy schedule and binge-watching shows. Post lockdown, I started spending some time on acrylic painting, Mandala art tutorials and started practicing over weekends. I kept practicing and eventually got better at it. The process itself was very engaging and satisfying. Purchasing new colours and art stuff was fun and looking at each completed artwork brought a smile to my face. Earlier, while coming back from office, I used to watch zumba classes going on in my society but never really tried to take out time for it after office hours. Now that the commute time was also saved, my husband and I started yoga at home. Although it was tedious and difficult at the beginning to work out and we had to push ourselves many times, we kept at it and eventually started enjoying it. Spending time on art and yoga is the new normal for me and it has helped me stay positive and calm and helped in coping up with the stress of the pandemic. It also gave me a new perspective that we can lead a life pursuing our interests, focus on personal health along with managing our daily household/office work – all we need is some dedication, inspiration, and willingness to act on it.

The index and dashboard are a result of NITI Aayog-GIZ and BMZ collaboration focused on driving SDG localisation in cities, under the umbrella of Indo-German Development Cooperation. Shimla tops the index, followed by Coimbatore and Chandigarh. The SDG Urban Index and Dashboard ranks 56 urban areas on 77 SDG indicators across 46 targets of the SDG framework. The data on these indicators have been sourced from official data sources of various ministries, and other government data sources. Out of 56 urban areas ranked in the index, 44 are with population of above one million. Twelve are state capitals with population of less than a million. For each SDG, the urban areas are ranked on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 implies that the urban area has achieved the targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that it is the farthest from achieving the targets among the selected urban areas. Overall or composite urban area scores are then generated from the Goalwise scores to measure aggregate performance of the urban area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-ranked-third-in-sdg-urban-index/articleshow/87875988.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

It is the only case of fodder scam pending in Bihar, CBI sources said. “The court has fixed November 30 as the next date of hearing in the case. The court has exempted Lalu ji from personal appearance due to his poor health. He is willing to appear whenever asked,” his counsel Sudhir Kumar Sinha said. The CBI had filed chargesheet against 44 accused in this case on March 31, 2003. The FIR was registered on May 15, 1996. Half of the accused have died while the trial is still at the evidence stage. The special CBI court-III had ordered on November 16 for the appearance of all the accused to know who are alive and dead. Lalu was the only one to appear physically before the court while the rest 21 were represented by their lawyers. CBI sources said there was strong evidence against Lalu in the case. “All the withdrawal took place on the basis of forged allotment letters and fake medical bills showing purchase of veterinary drugs,” a source said. He said one Shailesh Prasad Singh is an approver in the case. The trial of the case had been affected for a long time as Lalu was unable to appear before the special court in Patna due to his incarceration in Hotwar jail at Ranchi after being convicted in other fodder scam cases lodged in Jharkhand after the bifurcation of Bihar. Among the other main accused who appeared before the court through their lawyers were former MLA RK Rana, Beck Julius and Fedrick Kerketta. Prominent accused who died included Mahesh Prasad, Nawal Kishore Singh, Phoolchand Singh, Raghunandan Poddar, former CM Jagannath Mishra and K Arumugham. The fodder scam is related to fraudulent withdrawal of over Rs1000 crore in the 1980s and 1990s from several treasuries in undivided Bihar. Lalu, who was the CM of undivided Bihar between 1990 and 1997 was first convicted in the Chaibasa treasury case. He spent a considerable time behind bars in Ranchi, until his release on bail granted by the Jharkhand high court earlier this year.

The Election Commission of India is holding the election as Patel’s tenure as MLC is ending on January 1 next year. Both Patel and Wani filed their nomination on Tuesday, the last day of the filing of the nominations. While Patel hails from Shirpur in Dhule district, Wani hails from Taloda in Nandurbar. He is an elected member of the local civic body in Taloda.As many as 396 elected members of local civic bodies in the twin districts of Dhule and Nandurbar would exercise their franchise in the polls. Apart from the duo, three independents and another Congress leader, Shamkant Senar, too have filed their nominations. Apparently, Senar has filed his nomination as a safety measure in case Wani’s nomination is rejected by the poll authorities during scrutiny. Patel exuded confidence to continue with his winning streak in the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bjp-mlc-versus-cong-in-nandurbar-poll/articleshow/87875299.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||RTE reinforced general education in Kerala: Study||Kochi: Admission, attendance rate and performance of learners in government schools have improved significantly and the rate of dropout is also negligible in primary schools, says a research study on ‘Right to Education Act 2009: Present status in Kerala’. National University of Advanced Legal Studies (Nuals), Kochi, and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) conducted the collaborative research. The study report, accessed by TOI, shows that Kerala follows the inclusive education policy, according to which children of migrant labourers, children with disabilities, slow learners, etc, receive education along with the main stream children, without suffering any kind of discrimination. Right to Education Act (RTE) ensures free and compulsory education for children between the age of 6 and 14. The study was conducted at selected 101 schools, from 6 districts — Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Wayanad and Kasaragod— with regard to the three main components of the RTE Act i.e., access, equity and quality. Students are admitted to schools and the subsequent learning process is carried out irrespective of religion, caste, gender or community. The study emphasizes that the RTE Act has strengthened the general education system in Kerala, but it was found that the headmasters, teachers, parents and students face many difficulties in the successful implementation of the law. The final report was submitted to the minister for general education V Sivankutty at a function held at SCERT, Thiruvananthapuram, last week. The English version of the report was handed over to the minister by Nuals vice-chancellor KC Sunny and the Malayalam version by then SCERT director J Prasad. The study focuses on all aspects of education and the schools like academics, infrastructure, extra-curricular activities, quality of teachers, role of LSGs and school management committees, etc. The study found that even though schools have enough toilets for students, there is a need to increase the number of toilets for boys in schools. It is also found that the facilities available to differently-abled children are inadequate. The study points out an urgent need to increase facilities like ramps and rails, adapted toilets, hearing aids, Braille and sign language in every school. “Handling different subjects by the same teachers in the primary classes, shortage of suitable teaching/ learning resources for curriculum transaction, inability of parents of tribal and coastal students to pay attention to their children’s education, negligible attention given to the fields of education such as health — sports, arts — work experience, etc, non-availability of resource teachers, inability to handle various physical-mental problems of students, etc, are a few examples,” the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rte-reinforced-general-education-in-kerala-study/articleshow/87876730.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The NMPML is the transport wing of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). With schools reopening after Diwali vacations, the transport utility has issueda 920passes to over 1,200 students in the last five days. As the students have to pay less for the passes, the response has been so encouraging that the authorities had to open new pass centres to cope up with the rush.The students will get a 50% concession on certain routes for a month and a 66% concession for 3 months.The NMPML, which at present has four centres for issuing bus passes to the students, is opening two more centres in the city for the convenience of the students. Milind Band, the general manager of the NMPML said, “We are getting an overwhelming response from the students and on average, around 200 students are opting for bus passes daily since past few days.”Apart from students, the NMPML has also introduced bus passes for general commuters in three categories – 1-day, 3-days and monthly. The 1-day passes are available for Rs 75 and 3-day passes at Rs 200. While 7-day bus passes are issued for Rs 400, the monthly passes cost Rs 1,500.“We are receiving good responses for 1-day bus passes for general commuters. We have been selling around 1,000 1-day passes a day on an average for the past few days,” said NMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmcs-new-bus-service-a-big-hit-with-students/articleshow/87875303.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Operators’ whims at play as auto fare rises arbitrarily||KOLKATA: Auto routes across the city have raised fares at least by Rs 2 per stage, even though gas prices have not been revised since October. Auto gas price, which was revised on October 1, stands at Rs 58.21 a litre. But auto operators claimed that loss of earning owing to less passenger demands because of the work-from-home mode and limited reopening of schools had forced them to hike fare. In the last few days, autos have brought parity with the bus fare as far as base fare is concerned. In intra-city routes, the entry level fare was raised from Rs 8 to Rs 10 (unofficially by bus operators), following successive hikes of diesel prices. “There has been a tradition that if bus fare rises, auto fare also jumps. For the last few months, auto fare was less than the bus fare. So, we also brought auto fare to the same level,” said Mohammed Dilshad, a member of Behala Auto Route Committee. Most other auto routes have cited the spiralling gas prices and inflation, with each route charging anything between Rs 2-Rs 7 more on each stage. LPG gas prices have shot up by 78.5% since the last fare revised officially, said union leaders. “When the fares were hiked in 2018 on our route, a litre of auto LPG gas cost Rs 28, but the price has since risen to Rs 58 a litre. “Including oil costs, an auto driver incurs a cost of around Rs 70 per litre,” said an union leader on the Beliaghata-Sealdah route. The union has increased fares from Rs 12 to Rs 15-Rs 17. The Behala Chowrasta-Oxytown route jacked up fares from Rs 11 to Rs 15 and from Rs 9 to Rs 12 between Behala Chowrasta and Shakuntala Park. Similarly, the ride from Esplanade to Lohapool has increased from Rs 18-Rs 20 to Rs 23-Rs 25. The Burrabazar-Sealdah route is now charging Rs 15 from Rs 13 previously. The fare for carrying goods has also risen substantially. Passengers — a huge section of whom are still reeling under the financial impact of the pandemic—- stated that even after the hike, the fares have hardly been fixed. Since the fares were revised without the sanction of the union centrally, there are fluctuations and whims at play. The evening fare is invariably higher than the morning fare. “I paid Rs 15 while travelling to Sealdah. While returning in the evening, I had to shell out Rs 17 from the same stand,” said Ranajoy Mitra from the Raja Rajendra Lal Mitra Lane. Similarly, passengers travelling to Burrabazar from Sealdah shelled out Rs 15. But while returning back, they had to pay Rs 20. For those travelling from Behala Chowrasta to Behala police station in an auto, the fare for the 2km journey was Rs 11. In the late evening, the auto drivers charged Rs 13-Rs 14. The popular Salt Lake Karunamotee to Ultadanga route is currently charging Rs 20. The previous official fare was Rs 16. “We are relieved since the post-lockdown phase saw them charging Rs 30,” said Alok Banerjee, a Salt Lake resident. The Ultadanga-Airport route is charging Rs 30 per passenger. “This route did not increase fares now. But they have retained their post-lockdown fares unlike other routes,” said a regular passenger. Among the routes against whom complaints have come are the Jadavpur-Taratala, Taratala-Thakurpukur, Ultadanga-Karunamoyee and Ganesh Talkies-Phoolbagan routes. Subhajit Sengupta, a commuter, to Twitter to share his angst. “You told us that autos will operate with old fare. But they are not following your instructions. As for example, auto drivers of Taratala Thakurpukur demanding additional fares as random as upto Rs 10 even when carrying 4 pax,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/operators-whims-at-play-as-auto-fare-rises-arbitrarily/articleshow/87876009.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Rossiya Airlines has booked slots at Dabolim international airport and the first charter from Moscow will arrive in Goa on December 30. India though started issuing visas from mid-November, and bookings from the UK and Kazakhstan had commenced, there were delays from Russia due to the worsening of the pandemic situation in its country. Until 2019, a majority of charter tourists that Goa received came from Russia. During a season, Goa would receive three to four charters from various destinations in Russia. Tour operators in Goa said the bookings from Russia will pick-up in January when Russians celebrate Christmas and New Year. “I feel that starting from January, when Russians celebrate Christmas and New Year, more flights will be introduced,” said Ernest Dias, chief operating officer (COO), Sita Travels. Airport director Gagan Malik said whenever any of Goa’s charter market have a lockdown with the pandemic taking a worse turn, it is natural that India and Goa will feel the impact. “I have been saying that commencement of charter operations will depend on conditions in other nations and the government of India’s protocol on that day,” he said. As things stand today, Goa is set to receive its first charter of the season on December 9 from Kazakhstan, while from the UK on December 13. During normal times, Goa’s charters season would take off by mid-October and conclude in May, with 800 to 900 charters landing during a season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-charter-from-russia-to-land-in-goa-on-dec-30/articleshow/87876711.cms||---

On realising that he had been defrauded, the complainant approached the cops. While tracking the call records of the ‘IRDA officer’, police figured that the number had forged KYC records. A sales executive of a phone service provider was found to be involved. He was picked up from Ghaziabad in UP. On further investigation, police found that he had links with a SIM card seller. It turned out that the accused used genuine documents belonging to customers, approaching the SIM card seller's shop for activating SIM cards in their names. These SIMs were used to defraud people via insurance scams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-five-arrested-in-insurance-fraud-worth-nearly-rs-20l/articleshow/87878038.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Dead fish spotted again in Lake, KMDA plans to inject liquid oxygen into water||KOLKATA: Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is planning to pump liquid oxygen into Rabindra Sarobar’s water to increase the dissolved oxygen content in the lake water and prevent the death of fish. Even on Tuesday, morning walkers reported sighting of dead fish floating in the water. The dissolved oxygen experiment comes after KMDA had to dismantle three fountains that it had set up in the lake to increase aeration after vociferous protests from rowing clubs that use the lake. The fountains had posed a threat to the safety of rowers and their equipment. KMDA officials on Tuesday held preliminary talks on the plan to inject dissolved oxygen into the lake’s water with an agency that will conduct a feasibility study. “The concept needs to be implemented. We have to now see if there is a viable technology available to do it. The agency will carry out a feasibility study and place a proposal. We will also discuss the plan with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board,” said a KMDA official. Officials said that the technology is an advanced one that has not been carried out anywhere in the country so far. “This technology has been used at a few places abroad as we have heard. Pipes will need to be installed on the Sarobar water body through which the liquid oxygen could be injected and pumped in,” said a KMDA official. Officials said that the level of dissolved oxygen in the water body mostly comes down the period of three to four months from November to February. “If found feasible and viable, it would be planned out whether the technology can be used for only these three to four months and only if the dissolved oxygen level of the water body gets reduced, as it is much costly to be conducted throughout the year,” said an official. To increase the dissolved oxygen level of the Sarobar water body, KMDA had recently installed a few fountains to generate oxygen. However, the fountains were removed in a few days following objections from the rowing clubs, which said they were creating obstruction for rowers. Environmentalists have been saying that taking up lake management strategies like nutrient remediation, aeration and hydro-raking can help prolong the lifespan of the water body for many years. “The authorities can consider coming up with a lake conservation policy like taking steps to remove the toxic layer from the top soil of the lake and planting more fruit trees,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh, a lake regular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dead-fish-spotted-again-in-lake-kmda-plans-to-inject-liquid-oxygen-into-water/articleshow/87876020.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Goa||‘Film on Goa’s freedom struggle needed’||Panaji: A film on Goa’s liberation must be made and lack of funds shouldn’t be a deterrent, said filmmaker Shoojit Sircar while speaking at the 52nd edition of Iffi on Tuesday. “The reason why people are not making enough films on Goa’s struggle is not lack of funding. Money never defines whether films are to be made or not. There are many films that have been made wherein people have sold their assets and belongings to produce it. It is expensive, but there are various ways in which a film can be made,” he said. He was speaking on the sidelines of his masterclass wherein he was talking about his film Sarkar Udham which is based on the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre during India’s freedom struggle. Goa’s struggle for liberation from the Portuguese rule having lasted much longer than that of India’s efforts to break away from the colonial rule of the British, the filmmaker was asked about a possibility of directing a film on the liberation movement of the state. “Whenever a film is made, the most important thing for a director to look for is not just the idea but also a script. If I can tell a story over a course of two hours, I will. There have been many people that have made short films on this subject (Goa’s liberation movement) but it is never too late to make a full length film,” he said. India gained its independence on August 15, 1947 after nearly 200 years under the British Raj as opposed to Goa which struggled for freedom till December 19, 1961 after being under Portuguese rule for 450 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/film-on-goas-freedom-struggle-needed/articleshow/87876717.cms||---
---||Delhi||Tactical urbanism trial: Rajghat crossing to serve as model for pedestrian safety||NEW DELHI: The traffic intersection at Rajghat has been converted into a pedestrian-friendly zone with a continuous and enlarged space for free movement of walkers marked by yellow and blue lights. On Tuesday, transport minister Kailash Gahlot inaugurated the ‘tactical urbanism trial’, which will go on for two months. "Two years ago, a similar urbanism trial was also conducted at Bhalswa Chowk, which yielded positive results and reduced accident fatalities,” said Gahlot. “With these trials, Delhi Government aims to transform high-fatality intersections into safe intersections.” The Rajghat junction is an accident-prone zone and saw six accidents in 2019 according to available data. The transport department has identified 13 intersections for such measures. After the trial at Rajghat, similar arrangements will be made at other locations. SaveLIFE Foundation, a road safety and emergency medical care NGO, carried out a study of the Rajghat intersection for nine months and recommended certain redesigns in the past fortnight to make the space pedestrian friendly. This included making the footpath continuous and moving the zebra crossing to another section because it was earlier difficult for pedestrians to spot it. SaveLIFE will similarly analyse other locations and make appropriate recommendations for the trials. These trials, which also involve Delhi Traffic Police, Public Works Department and SWAYAM Charitable Trust, will be conducted for two months. Tactical urbanism trials are temporary, quick and relatively low-cost interventions to test urban design, transportation planning and infrastructural changes to boost the safety for all road users. As Gahlot said on Tuesday, “Delhi’s roads belong as much to pedestrians and cyclists as to the motorist. Delhi Government is committed to making the roads safer for all road users. With this in mind, we launched the Delhi Road Safety Policy in 2018. The tactical urbanism trials, earlier at Bhalswa Chowk and now at Rajghat, aims to showcase small interventions that you and I can take up to drive the behaviour change needed from commuters and the general public to enable safe road practices in cities.” Ashish Kundra, transport commissioner, added, “The objective of these trials is to insert safety elements at high-risk locations. Since 2016, the Rajghat intersection and Rajghat bus depot have collectively seen 47 accidents, 13 fatalities and 51 injuries.” Piyush Tewari, CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, said, “Our zero-fatality corridor model extensively uses evidence to determine the best solution to save lives. At Rajghat, we have followed a six-point intervention strategy to redesign the junction. All the elements focus on either reducing the speed or minimising conflict. Through these interventions we have managed to reduce the pedestrian exposure distance by around half and pedestrian exposure time by 30%.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tactical-urbanism-trial-rajghat-crossing-to-serve-as-model-for-pedestrian-safety/articleshow/87876733.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: One more suspected dengue death in Bidhannagar area||KOLKATA: Swapan Mistri, a 57-year-old resident of Baguiati who was admitted to a private hospital off EM Bypass a few days back with dengue, as claimed by family members, died on Tuesday morning. This is the second case of dengue death in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area this year. BMC board of administrators member Pranay Roy went to visit the family at their home in Baguiati Saha Para area on Tuesday evening. “Whether he died of dengue is yet to be confirmed as we have not seen his death certificate so far but family members said that he was suffering from dengue. We are taking all precautionary measures, including cleaning up the area, spraying larvicide and fogging,” Roy said. It was on November 8 that 33-year-old Satabdi Saha, a resident of Baguiati’s Ashwininagar, died from dengue shock syndrome in Baguiati, which falls under BMC. Several wards here have become dengue hot spots. Areas in Baguiati, Kestopur, Prafullakanan, Raghunathpur, Tegharia and Kaikhali have always been dengue-prone. Several dengue deaths have been reported here since 2016. From an illegal cowshed in the locality to clogged canals with stagnant water, there are many places across Baguiati and adjacent areas where mosquitoes breed. “At some localities, there are dengue patients at almost every alternate house. The drains are clogged with stagnant water in many places and there are vacant plots dumped with garbage where mosquitoes breed. The civic authorities have only recently started spraying larvicide and fogging but this needs to be done round the year and particularly during monsoon when water accumulates after rains,” said Biswajit Samaddar, a local resident of Baguiati. Dengue cases in the BMC area had been very low last year and till early September this year, only 10 cases were reported in entire BMC area. The number of cases started to jump from October 1, with about 137 dengue cases reported in October alone. Over 100 fresh cases have been reported in November. Currently, the number of dengue cases in the BMC area stands around 290 till date. With the spike in the number in dengue cases, BMC has formed six quick action teams comprising civic officials, health and conservancy workers. These teams are inspecting localities and conducting anti-dengue and Covid drives. “We are finding stagnant water and mosquito larvae at several households. We are warning the households to keep the premises clean. If mosquito larvae is found for the second time in the same houses, notice boards will be put up mentioning that mosquito larvae has been found from that house and appropriate steps will be taken,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1-more-suspected-dengue-death-in-bidhannagar-area/articleshow/87876017.cms||Suman Chakraborti

By reaching out to the left out beneficiaries from 2,952 homes on Monday, the dedicated drive has now covered 1,00,558 houses situated within the municipal limits of Aurangabad. Thanks to the drive, the city is consistently crossing daily 10,000 vaccination-mark in the recent past. The city has a target population of 10.5 lakh, out of which 6.9 lakh (66%) have received at least one dose of Covid vaccine, whereas 4.1 lakh (39%) beneficiaries have received both the doses. Launched by the central government on November 3, the Har Ghar Dastak campaign reaches out to beneficiaries who have not taken either first or second dose of Covid vaccine and encourages them to get inoculated on priority. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, immunization Officer for Aurangabad, said the campaign would be intensified further to cover maximum houses before ending on November 30. “The campaign has yielded desired results so far by reaching out to left out beneficiaries. The remaining pockets in city areas where vaccination coverage is still low would be covered during the remaining period of the drive,” she said. Appealing to the citizens to get their both vaccine doses as early as possible, Nalgirkar said the vaccine coverage is essential in the wake of multiple waves of Covid-19 in some parts of the world. The civic administration has been operating over 50 centres for free Covid vaccination from 10 am to 5 pm. However, vaccination centres at Kaisar Colony, Meltron Hospital, CIDCO N-8 and Silk Milk Colony operate between 7 pm and 11 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/1l-homes-covered-under-har-ghar-dastak-drive/articleshow/87875315.cms||---

Officials of DB Marg police station on Saturday arrested Anup Devnani (49) for cheating and forgery. Devnani was produced in a court which has remanded him in police custody. Devnani is the second to be arrested in the case. Earlier, the police had arrested Srikant Bhosle, a native of Satara. Another person, Ketan Shah, is wanted. The complainant in the case is Prashant Bhosle, a businessman from Satara who deals in purchasing and developing property. Prashant wanted to avail a loan of Rs 5 crore to buy some property in Satara and to develop it. He came across Srikant, a financial consultant. Srikant told him that he could arrange for the finance from any financial institution and the processing fee and other charges would be 9% of the sanctioned loan amount. While the charges worked out to Rs 45 lakh, he promised to reduce it to Rs 20 lakh and Prashant agreed.  Later, under some pretext Srikant extracted Rs 26 lakh as processing fee from Prashant. “Srikant also took Prashant to Ketan Shah through Devnani and they held several meetings at Shah’s office at Opera House in south Mumbai and made him pay the processing and other fees by assuring that the loan amount has been sanctioned and duped Prashant,” said a police officer. The police said that the complainant had paid up almost the entire amount of Rs 26 lakh through bank transactions and that there is evidence of financial transactions between Devnani, Srikant and Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fin-co-director-offers-rs-5cr-loan-held-for-duping-bizman-of-rs-26l-in-mumbai/articleshow/87878058.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||15% jump in applicants for engineering seats in Maharashtra this year||MUMBAI: The emerging branches of engineering such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data science may pull some aspirants back to the course this admission season. The state’s CET cell witnessed a rise in the number of applications from aspirants this year. While in 2020, 96,337 candidates registered for the centralised admission process (CAP) in the state, the numbers have gone up by almost 15% in the current year. Officials are expecting the numbers to translate into an increase in enrollment too. Around 1.1 lakh students registered for the centralised process this year, till Tuesday. In 2020, of the 96,337 who registered for CAP, 68,451 eventually took admissions. With more computer-related courses being offered by the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the enrollment in engineering is likely to increase. The council has also been promoting these courses since last year. A CET cell official said that with classes moving online most students are now acquainted with the online medium. “While the AICTE is promoting new courses, students are also researching a lot online. There is more awareness about the new courses available,” said the official. During last year's engineering admissions, computer and IT-related courses ruled the charts. After the Covid pandemic, vacancies in these courses also dropped to 10-15% from the previous year's 30-35%. Seats in new branches such as AI, machine learning and data science, introduced last year, also got filled. On the contrary, courses in mechanical, civil and electrical engineering reported around 60-70% vacancies. "Interest in emerging and allied areas in computer and IT are picking up among students. AICTE has also given approval to many colleges to offer these new courses from the last academic year. Even in the first year, most of the seats got filled in almost all colleges. There are plenty of jobs available in these areas post pandemic with decent pay packets,” said principal of DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering, Hari Vasudevan.

On Tuesday, over 600 patients reported at the OPD of the hospital which had only four doctors on duty, including a radiologist, two osteopaths and one pediatrician. However, as per the health department records, the total number of sanctioned posts for doctors in the centre is 34. The hospital currently has no physicians on duty and due to absence of a gynecologist, women are forced to return without consultation. Sharing her disappointment with TOI, a diabetes patient Mamta Sharma said, “I am suffering from chest pain and swollen legs for the past six days. I had gone to the district hospital on Saturday but no doctor was available. Today, the doctor told me to go to Aligarh to get proper treatment. What is the use of a hospital if it cannot treat patients?” A 60-year-old kidney patient Rajveer Singh said, “I suffer from kidney malfunction and weakness caused due to Anemia. Last week, I was referred to the Aligarh medical college from the district hospital as they could not admit me due to shortage of beds. Today, on visiting the hospital, I was asked to re-visit on Thursday. I am exhausted from taking rounds to the hospital.” A construction worker Hemant Kumar said, “My wife is pregnant and suffering from high fever. I took her to the district hospital but no gynecologist was available. Now, I’ll have to borrow money for her treatment in a private hospital.” Chief medical superintendent of Kasganj district hospital, Dr SP Singh said, “At present, five doctors are working in the hospital. The only female doctor, who has gone for training, will be back to work soon. The issue regarding lack of doctors and para medical staff has been brought to the notice of higher authorities. Due to lack of specialists, we are left with no option other than referring patients to higher medical centres. We are trying to get more doctors attached to the district hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/only-4-doctors-at-kasganj-dist-hosp-patients-suffer/articleshow/87876048.cms||---

The session will start at 11am and “continue until the business fixed for the day is concluded”, a bulletin issued by the assembly stated. The session may also be extended, “subject to the exigencies of business”, it added. While leader of opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri alleged that “the AAP government has shrunk the winter session into a one-day special session”, speaker Ram Niwas Goel clarified that the Friday session won’t be the winter session. “The winter session is likely to be held in December,” he said. Bidhuri said the one-day session would amount to “the murder of democracy” because so many issues affecting the public, such as air and Yamuna pollution, collapse of the public transport system, non-reduction of VAT on petrol and diesel, and new excise policy, were to be discussed and the government had not kept time for all these issues. “The AAP government does not want to face the opposition in the House. It is running away from discussing the problems of the people,” the BJP legislator alleged. A meeting of the BJP legislature party was held on Tuesday where the MLAs said the information about a session should be given 15 days in advance as per the rules and the issues to be raised should be invited from the members. No visitor will be allowed due to the pandemic. The MLAs have been asked to wear face masks, practise social distancing and carry the final vaccination certificate as precautions against Covid-19. They have also been requested to display their identity cards while wearing masks inside the complex. A Covid-19 negative report issued not earlier than 48 hours prior to the beginning of the session is also a must. The facility for rapid antigen test will be available at the assembly secretariat, but the members themselves will have to get the RT-PCR tests done. To follow the social distancing norm, the existing seating arrangement will not be applicable for this session. “Seats shall be reserved for the chief minister, deputy CM, ministers, deputy speaker, chief whip and the leader of opposition. The members should take their seat in the House on a first-come-first-served basis,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-calls-special-single-day-assembly-session-bjp-cries-foul/articleshow/87876748.cms||AlokKNMishra

The decision by Justice Mohammed Nias CP came on a petition by Avinash Anil Kumar of Thrissur through advocate Thiyyannoor Ramakrishnan. A case registered against the petitioner by Guruvayoor police in 2014 was challenged before the court. He was booked for obstructing an officer from discharging his duties, under Section 117(e) of Kerala Police Act. It was alleged by police that the petitioner obstructed the duty of civil police officer Unnikrishnan while he was pasting a sticker for paying fine for parking violation on the petitioner’s car. A report (Annexure-A4) filed by assistant commissioner (special branch) before Kerala State Human Rights Commission finding fault with the police officer in not wearing his uniform was produced before the high court. The petitioner contended that he was not aware that the person was a police officer. In the judgment delivered on November 5, the court said, “It is clear from Annexure-A4 report, the veracity or content of which is not in dispute, that the Civil Police Officer was not in his uniform. Resultantly, there is no question of the petitioner knowing that he is a police officer and as a sequel since there was no such knowledge, there cannot be any intention for preventing the police officer from discharging his duties. I hold, accepting Annexure-A4, that no offence is made out under Section 117(e) of the Police Act.” Before parting with the case, the court emphasized the need of policemen wearing uniform while on duty and said it need to be enforced without exception. Citing such a requirement under sections 43 and 44 of the Act, the court directed the state police chief to issue appropriate directions to comply with the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cant-book-citizen-for-questioning-authority-says-hc/articleshow/87876767.cms||---

Relaxing the present system, the top brass has allowed special sub-inspectors (SSI) to carry revolvers unlike earlier when officers in the ranks of sub-inspector of police and above only were eligible to carry guns.The top cop announced this after visiting the house of SSI S Boominathan, 50, who died in an attack by three goat thieves he caught hold of after a chase on the Trichy-Pudukottai border in the wee hours of Sunday. The DGP called on Boominathan’s wife and son at their house at Chozhamadevi near Navalpattu and saluted his portrait.“Police personnel and police officers are advised to carry revolver loaded with bullets when they patrol in secluded areas. Going by the rules, they can use them for self-defence in case of any brutal attack on them. Police need not hesitate to safeguard their own lives when they come under attack,” Sylendra Babu told reporters in Trichy. “We have started giving firing practice to all police personnel in batches from September onwards,” he later told TOI.The officer said that after catching the thieves SSI Boominathan followed laws and seized the weapons from them before speaking to the mother of one of the suspects about the incident. As the trio hacked Boominathan to death, the policeman who accompanied him failed to chase the suspects as they disappeared into the bushes. A 19-year-old man and two boys aged 14 and nine have been arrested for the crime. Inquiries revealed that Manikandan and his juvenile relatives stole goats from Trichy and sold them at meat shops in Pudukottai.Terming his demise as martyrdom in the line of duty, the DGP said Boominathan proved that Tamil Nadu police were known for their valour, prudence and kindness to minors. Stating that attack on policemen has been happening for ages, the DGP stated that while duty of the police is challenging it is important as to how they face it. “Boominathan faced it boldly and upheld his duty,” DGP said. Sylendra Babu said the investigation into the murder was completely based on evidence which showed that all three were involved in it. He also assured to put an end to incidents of goat theft in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/carry-pistol-on-night-patrol-use-when-under-attack-dgp-to-cops/articleshow/87876749.cms||---

Corporation sources said that the numbers include a section of people who received their first dose of Covishield and Covaxin before May. As of November 23, approximately 70,000 people were found out to have deliberately skipped their second dose as per the data from the CoWin portal. A health official said that a majority of those were Covishield takers due to the 85-day waiting period between doses unlike Covaxin, which is just 30 days. People have also become apathetic to the fall in fresh infections and near normalcy, and are hesitating to take the second dose.“Our health workers are calling those skipping the second dose based on the details they furnished while taking the first dose. A section of them is showing up at the vaccination camps after the calls,” Dr M Yazhini, city health officer said. After the calls, health workers are modifying the second dose vaccination backlog data as some of the residents claim that they have taken the vaccine elsewhere. People who have not answered the calls shall be highlighted for further followup. The civic body is also sending SMS reminders to senior citizens. As the bulk texting mode backfired last time, a civic body official said that they are being cautious in sending the invites now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/70k-skip-second-dose-jab-in-trichy-many-due-since-aug/articleshow/87876751.cms||Deepak Karthik

Sahaya Francis, special station officer at the Cantonment fire and rescue unit, said that a distress call was received seeking support for evacuating a bed-ridden woman in JK Nagar. “The woman’s family sought our help to relocate her to a nearby house. We had water up to our thighs. We used a stretcher and lifted her all through the stagnant water to a safe place,” Francis said. As the Kottapattu tank on Pudukkottai highway is filled with rainwater, the bunds that have weakened post the heavy rain and surplus water from the catchment areas had breached residential parts of JK Nagar, Khajamalai and KK Nagar. As the inundation has not receded for a week, algae growth and bad odour have become additional reasons to worry for JK Nagar residents. “Autorickshaws and cab operators are refusing to reach our streets. We are afraid of reptiles entering our houses through the stagnant water. The inundation is not receding quickly due to sporadic rain,” said Aravind Raj, a resident of JK Nagar. Trichy Corporation sources said that the excess water from the Kottapattu tank is being drained. Meanwhile, fire service department personnel in Ariyalur district on Tuesday rescued 66 cattleheads stranded in the Kollidam river passing through Kodalikarupoor village bordering Thanjavur district. Accompanied by the villagers and using safety ropes, firemen brought the stranded cattle safely to the shores. The cattle were taken in the river by the owners when the water flow was minimal. As the flow increased gradually, the owners sought the support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/overflowing-tank-inundates-jk-nagar/articleshow/87876754.cms||---

The government has sought information from the railways regarding the proposed pilgrimage programme and is also finding out the procedure involved because the pilgrimage will involve the ministry of external affairs too. An official said the talks were only at the nascent stage and the move might take time. Under ‘Mukhya Mantri Teertha Yatra Yojana,’ Delhi government provides free pilgrimage to senior citizens to various religious destinations. After Jagannath-Puri, Ujjain, Shirdi, Amritsar, Vaishno Devi, Dwarkadhish, Tirupati, Rameswaram, Haridwar, Mathura and Bodh Gaya, Ayodhya has also been included in the list of free pilgrimages for Delhiites. The government is going to soon restart taking Delhiites on pilgrimage to various religious destinations. ‘Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana,’ which started in mid-November 2019, was on hold due to the Covid pandemic. The first trip of the senior citizens of Delhi to Ayodhya is scheduled to be organised on December 3. The AAP government recently started accepting applications from senior citizens for a pilgrimage to Ayodhya. “For the Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi trip, a large number of people have applied. Around 1,000 people will be going on the pilgrimage on December 3. The pilgrimage will be by train and the government will fund transportation as well as stay for the senior citizens,” said an official. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to flag off the first Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi pilgrimage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-plans-free-pilgrimage-to-kartarpur-sahib-for-seniors/articleshow/87876752.cms||---

However, passengers from Kolkata will have to undergo seven-day quarantine on arrival. Also, travellers need to take prior permission from Singapore authorities even if they have a visa. Fully vaccinated passengers arriving in Singapore on flights from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have been exempted from the quarantine rule and are part of the island nation’s vaccinated travel lane (VTL) initiative. The travel trade community in Kolkata, while happy that the city will be reconnected with South-East Asia and have a daily connection to Singapore, are disappointed with the mandatory quarantine condition as that will discourage tourist traffic. Only those with family members or friends living in Singapore will want to travel. Apart from Kolkata, fights from Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi have also been denied VTL. To restart the flights, Singapore Airlines is offering a 50% fare with all-inclusive return trips starting at Rs 13,100. Tickets at this rate will be sold between November 23 and 30 and will be applicable for travel before December 31, 2020. Customers who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents and wish to travel on the VTL services, need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) prior to their visa application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-spore-daily-flight-from-nov-29/articleshow/87876056.cms||---

---||Patna||Dhanarua CDPO house raided, Rs 2cr DA unearthed||PATNA: The Special Vigilance Unit (SVU) of state police on Tuesday unearthed assets worth at least of Rs2 crore disproportionate to the known sources of income of child development protection officer (CDPO) Jyoti Kumari. The SVU sleuths, armed with search warrant issued by the court, raided the residential flat of Jyoti in Everest Apartment at RPS Mor in Rupaspur, Patna, and recovered deeds of four plots in Patna and neighbouring areas, two flats, including the one on which raid was conducted, Rs5.5 lakh in cash, jewellery worth around of Rs5 lakh, besides papers of two cars with approximate value of Rs14 lakh, details about two bank lockers in Bhagalpur, bank accounts, fixed deposits, insurance and other investments. The CDPO, posted at Dhanarua in Patna district, has amassed these properties within ten years of her service period, the SVU sources said. The SVU raid was conducted after registering a DA case against her on November 22. At the FIR stage, her DA was calculated to be around Rs51.36 lakh, but after the raid, it increased up to Rs2 crore, sources said. They said the DA of Rs2 crore is a conservative estimate and will increase as the market price of her properties is much higher than the deed values on the basis of which calculation has been done. More movable properties are expected to surface, they said. SVU sources said the deed value of four plots of land in Patna and neighbouring areas is around Rs1 crore. “Their actual market value is much higher,” a senior SVU officer involved in the raid said. He said the value of Rupaspur flat as per the deed is Rs70 lakh. “Its market value is at least double than the price shown on papers. In addition, a hefty expenditure amounting to rupees several lakhs has been made inside the flat to furnish and decorate it,” the officer said. Another source said the CDPO owns another flat in Bhagalpur, whose deed value has been shown as Rs25 lakh. “The Bhagalpur flat has not been disclosed in her annual returns and asset details submitted to the state government. This flat is also of higher price than the deed value,” he said. When contacted, SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan told TOI that the bank authorities in Bhagalpur have been directed to seal the lockers which would be opened after court permission. Khan said details of more assets can surface after opening the lockers. He said further investigations are in the case. “Raid has been concluded. The DA case was registered after receiving several complaints against her,” he said. Sources said the SVU has sought details of all bank accounts of the CDPO from bank authorities to know the exact amount deposited therein.

TOI had on Tuesday reported how only 24% of the Rs 799 crore in the Maharashtra CM’s Covid fund had been utilised. The information was obtained through the Right to Information Act. BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it was shocking that while the state government was flush with funds, it continued to hurl stones at the Centre, seeking help for stuff from masks to ventilators. “In two years, the Thackeray government has only done recovery work. It has admitted it collected crores from the public in the name of Corona Relief Fund but used only 25% of it. Nearly Rs 15 crore has been spent by the state on ads. The balance Rs 600 crore continues to lie unused even as the corona-hit population is suffering from financial hardship,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, instance of corruption have been exposed, he said, including the Lokayukta announcing an inquiry into setting up of the BKC Covid centre. “We need to know the outcome of the inquiry, and whether files were suppressed,” said Upadhye. He reminded the government had announced financial aid of Rs 50 lakh to families of local self-government body employees who died in the line of duty during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-demands-probe-as-cms-covid-fund-is-under-utilised/articleshow/87878075.cms||---

The industry hub over 100acre will form part of Ayodhya Master Plan-2031 being hammered out by the development authority. ADA vice-chairman Vishal Singh told TOI the master plan is expected to be finalised next month and will be sent for state government’s approval. Unlike other development projects, ADA won’t acquire land from farmers. “Industrialists will directly buy plots from land owners and ADA will provide infrastructure. The industry hub will cover an area of 100acre,” he said. The new master plan straddles 65km from Ring Road with proposed industrial corridors along both sides. Around 114 development projects approved by the state government have been incorporated in the master plan. Amid construction of Ram temple, Ayodhya is undergoing a makeover with modern infrastructure and facilities. The town soon will have grand gates called 'Ram Dwaars' at all entry points along with gardens with invoking the ambience of Treta Yug. Principal secretary, housing and urban development Deepak Kumartold TOI that project deadlines will be met on a war footing.

However, the relief was short-lived as the calm wind conditions prevailed in the evening, and the air quality again slipped into the “very poor” category by 8pm. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “The wind speed picked up to 8-12kmph during afternoon, but calm wind was recorded during evening hours.” Another Met official said, “Strong winds blew on Monday and the speed even touched 25kmph. Due to relatively better winds on Monday, the air quality started improving from Monday afternoon. Hence, the 24-hour average AQI of Delhi improved to the ‘poor’ category on Tuesday at 4pm. The wind speed again deteriorated on Tuesday evening, and calm wind leads to accumulation of pollutants.” According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” or the lower end of “very poor” category on Wednesday and the “very poor” category from Thursday. “The wind speed is expected to be low for the next three-four days,” said Jenamani. The visibility at Safdarjung, the city’s base station, and Palam was in the range of 1,500-2,200 metres. Track the pollution level in your citySystem of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the air quality might remain “poor”. “Winds at transport level are likely to slow down and also change direction from northwest to south/southeast on Wednesday and north or northwest on November 25, leading to further improvement of air quality within ‘poor’ category. Local surface winds are also relatively low for the next three days that reduces dispersion of pollutants,” it predicted. SAFAR added, “Surface winds are likely to increase from November 27. So air quality is likely to be within ‘poor’ category for the next three days. From November 27, local surface winds are likely to increase, resulting in improvement of air quality, but it’s expected to be in the ‘poor’ category. The effective stubble fire count is 770 and its share in Delhi’s PM2.5 is 3%.” Meanwhile, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas conducted a review meeting with the states on Tuesday. The states submitted an action-taken report to the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pollution-gets-second-wind-after-some-relief/articleshow/87876768.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||India||UPA should have hit back after 26/11, says Tewari; angry Congress plans action||NEW DELHI: Senior Congress member Manish Tewari's contention in his new book that the Manmohan Singh government should have militarily retaliated against Pakistan after the 26/11 attack on Mumbai has angered the party leadership, even as BJP seized upon it to renew its charge that the Congress-led UPA dispensation was soft on the hostile neighbour. In his book, "10 Flash Points; 20 Years - National Security Situations that Impacted India", Tewari, who was a minister in the UPA government, criticised it for not actioning a "kinetic response" to the deadliest terror strike on Indian soil that left 166 people dead. As Tewari himself tweeted photographs of excerpts from the book, which generated political heat, there was buzz in Congress about disciplinary action against him. The head of the recently constituted AICC disciplinary committee, A K Antony, met Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday afternoon, just as the controversy flared in the media. There was no confirmation of the party's course of action. Congress leaders, however, claimed the party may wait for the release of the book to check its content and may then want to hear from the author. BJP was swift in attacking Congress. Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said Tewari's views confirmed that the "Congress-led UPA government was insensitive, useless and was even not concerned about national security". "What Manish Tewariji said in his book, which we all have seen in the media...it would not be wrong to say that the facts that have come out. It would be appropriate to call it a confession of the failure of Congress," he said. An excerpt tweeted by Tewari read, "For a state that has no compunctions in brutally slaughtering hundreds of innocent people, restraint is not a sign of strength; it is perceived as a symbol of weakness. There comes a time when actions must speak louder than words. 26/11 was one such time when it just should have been done. It, therefore, is my considered opinion India should have actioned a kinetic response in the days following India's 9/11." Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury slammed Tewari, saying, "He should be focusing more on China that has captured many of our areas in Ladakh and built villages in Arunachal Pradesh. He is regaining consciousness now. Why has he not talked about it that time." BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya said, after Salman Khurshid, another Congress leader "throws UPA under the bus to sell his book". "Manish Tewari in his new book slams UPA for weakness in the name of restraint post-26/11. Air Chief Marshal Fali Major is already on record saying IAF was ready to strike but UPA froze," he tweeted. Responding to BJP's criticism, Tewari said, "I am rather amused at BJP's reaction to one excerpt from a 304-page book that tries to dissect responses to national security situations that impacted India. I wonder would they (BJP) react similarly to some hard analysis about their handling of the national security remit also?" Union minister Pralhad Joshi said Congress should introspect on what Tewari has said. Watch Will Manish Tewari face action from Congress for criticising UPA over inaction after Mumbai attacks?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/upa-should-have-hit-back-after-26/11-says-tewari-angry-congress-plans-action/articleshow/87878368.cms||---

In the altogether 36 road accidents recorded at various police stations in Salcete from January to September, 45 people sustained injuries. Maina Curtorim police station registered the highest number of accident cases at 13, while the lowest number of accidents was reported at Colva at 4. Eight cases of accidents were registered at Cuncolim police station, while Margao and Fatorda police stations booked 5 and 6 cases respectively. The 15 cases of fatalities include four each booked at Colva and Cuncolim police stations, two at Margao police station, three at Maina Curtorim police station and two at Fatorda police station. Police officials attributed the high number of accidents to reckless driving, over-speeding and bad condition of roads at various places. Police sources said that cases of drinking and driving have also been on the rise. Sources said that large number of potholes also contributed to rise in accidents involving two-wheelers. Sources also pointed out how bus stands have turned into accident-prone areas as buses compel passengers to alight on the main roads before taking the vehicles inside the bus stands. Roland Martins of Goacan, a consumer network organisation, attributed the high number of accidents to the lack of professional supervision in road construction from the point of view of road engineering and traffic safety aspects. He also stressed on the need of eliminating threats in areas prone to accidents. Martins, at a recent meeting with senior police officials, had urged police to release data of traffic accidents every quarter so that causes of accidents are properly analysed and action taken to prevent them. The police were also urged to ensure compliance of ‘don’t drink and drive’ signages at bars and restaurants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salcete-records-15-road-accident-deaths-in-jan-sept/articleshow/87876845.cms||---

Twenty-six comorbid persons were unvaccinated. Of the 127 comorbid Covid patients, 101 received at least one dose while 88 of them were fully jabbed. The overall comorbidity rate comes to around 79%. It is 69% for fully jabbed positive patients.  Of the 145 persons, 45 received their second dose between February and June. An analysis of the data provided by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department also showed that 49 were unvaccinated. Though 41 of them needed hospitalization, they remained mild symptomatic cases. During this period, just two needed ICU. One of them turned critical but recovered.  No Covid death of a Nagpur district resident has been reported in the city since August 12.  The data lacks a proper format and each category had to be manually calculated. Earlier, TOI had reported the data from Aug 25 since when the NMC started recording the vaccination status of new cases.  Most of the new persons testing positive are placed in compulsory institutional quarantine by the civic body since Aug 25. New patients are given the option of shifting to civic hospitals or AIIMS. Some symptomatic patients were also admitted to private hospitals where moderate to severe cases from outside the district too are referred. Overall, 357 people tested positive between Aug 25 and Nov 5. Of these, 247 persons were having some form of comorbidity which comes to over 69%. Also, 83% or 299 vaccinated people are among the positive cases. The unvaccinated are a meagre 16% or 58 persons.  Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a member of the district task force, said there may be many minor comorbidities associated with each case. “We need to see how severe is the comorbidity. Comorbidity per se is not the only reason for acquiring Covid though it is an accepted fact that comorbid persons face more issues,” he said. Dr Sarnaik added that comorbid persons have to be very careful even after vaccination as their condition can deteriorate anytime. Regarding unvaccinated people remaining mild cases, he said, “They maybe under 45 years of age,” he said. Many new cases are mostly detected because they had to get a Covid test done for some reason. He also said that vaccination has reduced hospitalization, severity of the disease and mortality. On people testing positive after the passage of some months, Dr Sarnaik said, “After six months, weaning of immunity is reported from US and Europe. That is the reason the booster dose has been approved there. We are yet to cover the second dose for a large number of people,” he said.

---||Lucknow||BJP tweets video depicting 2017 discord within SP camp||Lucknow: In a fresh salvo at the Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Uttar Pradesh BJP on Tuesday tweeted a video that highlights the raging infighting that erupted in the SP camp, just before 2017 assembly elections. In what transpired as an attempt to drive a wedge in the SP camp, ahead of UP assembly elections, the 1.5-minute video, titled ‘Aisa Koi Saga Nahi Jisse Akhilesh ne Thaga Nahi’, depicts Akhilesh as a “sarve-sarva” (all-powerful) SP leader who got “satta” (power) in “virasat” (inheritance). The video incorporates a clip reportedly from SP’s national executive, which was convened by Mulayam on October 24, 2016, to bring warring factions within the party on one dais. The stinging 15-second shot shows an angry Akhilesh snatching microphone from Mulayam even as party MLC Ashu Malik tries to assuage him. A voice over in the background then rolls in — “Jin Akhilesh ji ko unke pita ne satta dilwayi thi unke hi saath unhone ye durvyavhaar kiya tha.... (Akhilesh misbehaved with his own father who gave him the power)”. The SP brass was quick to dismiss the video as deceitful and an attempt by BJP to malign Akhilesh’s image to divert people’s attention from its failures. “BJP is getting worried and is staring at an inescapable defeat in the forthcoming assembly elections,” said SP MLC and Akhilesh’s trusted aide Udaibir Singh. “BJP itself has been witnessing a rift between its top ranks. It is therefore peddling frivolous content against the SP and its leadership,” he said. The development came a day after Shivpal Yadav, during celebration of Mulayam’s 83rd birthday in Saifai, set a week’s deadline to Akhilesh to strike an alliance with his party, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia). Experts said the possibility of coming together of Akhilesh and Shivpal could pinch the BJP that seeks to return to office after elections early next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-tweets-video-depicting-2017-discord-within-sp-camp/articleshow/87876778.cms||Pankaj Shah

The court directed the Centre and the state to file their reply affidavits before the next date of hearing. The petitioner, Peter Myaliparampil, has contended that he had paid for the two doses of vaccine and therefore, the certificate was his “private space” with his personal details on record and therefore, it was inappropriate to intrude into the privacy of an individual. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-seeks-govts-response-on-plea-against-pms-picture/articleshow/87876781.cms||---

Scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, which has developed DSS, said air quality could have reached the “severe” category on November 18 and 19, but remained “very poor”. Sachin Ghude, head of IITM’s air quality forecasting group, tweeted, “Imposing these slew of measures by CAQM managed to improve air quality in Delhi by about 18-22 per cent.” Gaurav Govardhan, another scientist, said, “Apart from forecasting the contribution of different local and regional sources to Delhi’s PM2.5, DSS has different scenarios on the impact on Delhi’s air quality. We conducted our analysis considering the restrictions in a scenario.” Among the directives were shutting most thermal power plants in a 300km radius; banning entry of trucks not carrying essential commodities and most construction, and ordering work from home for 50 per cent government staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/curbs-helped-improve-air-quality-by-22-study/articleshow/87876780.cms||---

The DoE has said that heads of institutions and management can take their own decision about reopening “taking into consideration available infrastructure and local conditions”. The directorate has told schools that, if required, they can initially follow a hybrid mode of teaching, using a combination of online and offline classes. However, if some students choose not to attend physical school, recorded lessons or any other online mode of teaching has to be made available, the directorate has instructed. School functions and assemblies are also to be strictly avoided till a further advisory is issued, the DoE has said. “The government, after consultation with the expert committee, has decided to allow reopening of schools from Class VII to VIII (physical classes) from November 25, 2021, by following mentioned guidelines/SOP. In cases where more than one school is in the same locality or in case of cluster, schools may have staggered timings or may choose to have classes on alternate days,” the circular by director Bhushan Savaikar states. Offline sessions are already on for students from Class IX to XII, and physical classes for VII and VIII as well will mean more students on institute premises. Schools, if required, may schedule classes in two shifts, taking into consideration available infrastructure and local conditions, the directorate has said. “The time table should be prepared in such a manner that there will be no crowd in the school. The school shall sanitise every place/classroom to be used before opening. Only vaccinated staff (teaching & non-teaching staff) shall be allowed on the school premises. Those who cannot produce a vaccination certificate shall be allowed after producing a negative report of the RT-PCR test. Such report shall be valid for seven days, and a fresh report shall be produced after the seventh day,” the guidelines read. DoE has said that checking for face masks, temperature and sanitisation of hands of students will be mandatory at the entry gate. Teachers have to ensure that students wear masks at all times when in schools, state the SOPs. Schools have been told to ensure that all the adult members associated with schools, including the teachers, nonteaching staff, support staff, commute drivers, attendants and school visitors, have received at least one dose of any Covid-19 vaccine. “Those eligible for receiving the second dose should have been administered the same. High risk children (those suffering from chronic diseases like asthma, kidney diseases, disabled children, children on steroids, etc) should consult their pediatrician/physician before joining school. Students/teachers/ staff having symptoms of Covid-19 shall be advised to test immediately,” the circular states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/schools-to-decide-if-classes-vii-viii-will-return-to-campus/articleshow/87876775.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The saffron camp has also announced to begin another phase of agitation from November 27 against the delay in holding panchayat polls, which are pending for almost a year. BJP announced its agitation schedule during its state working (executive) committee meeting on Tuesday here. The party’s Jharkhand in-charge Dilip Saikia, former chief ministers — Arjun Munda (currently Union tribal affairs minister), Babulal Marandi, Raghubar Das — are among other top brass who attended the meeting which was held through hybrid mode. All district unit office bearers attended the meeting virtually. Addressing the media after the daylong meeting, the party’s state general secretary Balmukund Sahay and spokesperson Pradeep Sinha said, “The party hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s work done during the Covid-19 to provide a slew of assistance to crores of marginalized people and the poor in the country and its Covid management measures along with the effective vaccination strategy among others. Most importantly, the Modi government by declaring November 15, the birth anniversary of tribal icon Birsa Munda, as Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas to be celebrated nationally every year, is a matter of pride for all tribals in the country.” Taking a dig at the Soren government, the party spokesperson added that the meeting pondered on ways to corner and expose its “lies to the people since coming to power”. “We passed many political resolutions on how the current state government is exploiting the public through its failed promises and corruption among others and our commitment to expose them,” said Sahay, adding that the party also expressed concern over the “failing law and order” in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-to-hit-the-streets-against-non-reduction-of-vat-on-fuel-price-delay-in-panchayat-polls/articleshow/87875890.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Cops lathicharge civil service aspirants||Ranchi: Police lathicharged on hundreds of aspirants led by opposition MLAs as they attempted to march to the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) office here on Tuesday. The protesters, mostly unsuccessful candidates, were demanding cancellation of the preliminary results of the combined civil service examination of the JPSC declared earlier this month and re-examination. The protest also sparked a political row with the JMM terming it as BJP sponsored and advising the students not to get misguided. The BJP MLAs condemned the lathicharge on the students. The JPSC held the preliminary test of combined civil services examinations in September for filling up 252 posts. After declaration of the results, the unsuccessful candidates claimed anomalies in the evaluation process and pressed for its cancellation. They had raised five issues related to the examination before the JPSC for which they were called to the office on Tuesday. The aspirants gathered in large numbers at the Morabadi ground and marched to the JPSC office to meet its chairman Amitabh Choudhary. BJP legislators Naveen Jaiswal and Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Ajsu’s Lambodar Mahto were leading the procession. The police put up barricades to stop them stating that no permission had been given for the procession. The aspirants got into a scuffle with the police and managed to break the barriers and move on. Subsequently, the police resorted to mild lathicharge to push back the protesters. The aspirants then sat on a dharna on the road. An aspirant Pravin Choudhary said, “There have been irregularities in conducting the examination. We demand an inquiry and cancellation of the examination.” Hatia MLA Jaiswal alleged, “The state government has filled up JPSC posts with relatives of office-bearers of ruling parties. The exercise to sell the JPSC civil service seats has begun. The students were going to meet the JPSC chairman but were lathicharged. The government cannot suppress the youths.” Later, a delegation, including the BJP MLAs, met Choudhary. He said, “The five issues raised by the protesters have been replied point-wise. They raised more issues today which would be explained in two to three days. The demand for the cancellation of examination is without basis.” The agitation was withdrawn after Choudhary sought time to clarify the issues raised during the meeting. The aspirants said they would decide on the future course of action based on his reply. Reacting to the development, minister and JMM lawmaker Mithilesh Thakur said, “This is a BJP-sponsored procession. The students should not be misguided by the politicians and use a proper platform to voice their grievances.” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the entire protest was caused by the provocation of BJP leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cops-lathicharge-civil-service-aspirants/articleshow/87875744.cms||---

---||Goa||Funds available, but biz appetite hit by poor customer confidence: Bankers||Panaji: Even though the country’s economic engine has restarted, customer confidence and risk appetite among entrepreneurs remains poor, say bankers. Bankers point out that demand for working capital loans and loans for expansion remains muted. Bankers at the recently held special State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) meeting said that availability of funds in the state remains adequate, but business proposals are not encouraging. A special credit outreach program saw various banks disbursing Rs 11 crore in loans to 45 different borrowers. “No bank, let me assure, has been short of liquidity. There has been enough and more liquidity in the economy, but yes good proposals are not coming in,” general manager, Reserve Bank of India-Goa, N J Nampoothiri said. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have urged bankers to look at small borrowers, self-help groups, small and medium enterprises and others. “Bankers say that customer confidence is yet to develop. The Capex or the expansion, which some of them are hoping to happen, has yet to happen. So bankers are ready, it’s just that good proposals have to come,” Nampoothiri said. Nabard general manager Usha Ramesh said that bankers should focus on the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) so that farmers can avail of cheap loans while Goa’s credit deposit ratio can also increase. “Around 10,000 farmers in Goa are not covered and our efforts should be to reach out to them and get them covered under KCC. We have about 6,000 self-help groups, but only about 300 have obtained credit,” Ramesh said. Ramesh said that many self-help groups stay away from banks or resort to internal lending. “The rates of interest for internal lending goes from 22% to 24%. Credit from banks is easily available and at much cheaper rates,” Ramesh said. Bankers have been advised to act with alacrity and increase credit to sectors wherever they sense a business opportunity. “In Goa look for small borrowers because large corporate borrowers are not here. So look at MSMEs, SHGs, look at the opportunities such as clusters,” Nampoothiri said. Just a day earlier, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman urged companies to boost investments and expand capacity without waiting for risks to vanish. Sitharaman said economic revival requires the government and industry to work together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/funds-available-but-biz-appetite-hit-by-poor-customer-confidence-bankers/articleshow/87876792.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Ranchi||Jail admin recommends judicial inquiry into prisoner’s ‘suicide’||Ranchi: The state jail administration has recommended a judicial inquiry into the alleged suicide by a murder accused, Virendra Munda (32), inside the Birsa Munda Central Jail on Saturday. The order has been issued given the serious nature of the incident and also other factors like the writing on the leg of the deceased, blaming the jailor, Mohammad Naseem, for the incident. Munda was found hanging with a towel from the door of his cell at about 10 PM. He was rushed to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) where doctors declared him dead. A message written with a pen claiming that the jailor murdered him was found on his leg. The central jail authorities said they would provide all documents and material demanded by the judge during the inquiry. Munda, who was arrested in July this year for murdering a vehicle driver, belonged to the Mukhyar criminal gang. According to the jail authorities, he was suffering from depression in the recent past. Inspector general (prisons) Manoj Kumar said, “A request has been sent to the judicial commissioner, Ranchi, to appoint a judge for the inquiry. All procedures in the case are being conducted according to the penal provisions and the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).” It may be stated here that in cases of custodial death, an inquest is done by a magistrate and the post mortem is conducted by a medical board in the presence of a magistrate while the entire proceeding is video-recorded. The viscera are also sent to the forensic science laboratory. The reports of the medical board, FSL and the judicial inquiry are sent to the NHRC, which will decide on whether to proceed with the case or close it. Meanwhile, the state jail administration has also issued a show-cause to the jailor asking how the inmate managed to strangle himself when the security guards are supposed to be patrolling the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jail-admin-recommends-judicial-inquiry-into-prisoners-suicide/articleshow/87875816.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||BSL begins revamp of roads in its township||Bokaro: The Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) began construction of roads in different localities in its township on Tuesday. The roads were damaged in the recent months because of poor upkeep and rain. The estimated cost of the work is about Rs 9 crore. For a long time, residents and local political parties have been demanding the repair of the roads. BSL’s chief of communication, Manikant Dhan, said, “The BSL’s management has begun the road construction process in three phases. The work will be completed by February next year. We are taking up the roads based on their importance and current condition.” Officials said in the first phase, a 5-km stretch is being constructed from Nayamod (Birsa Chowk) to Mansa Singh Gate (Railway Bridge ARM Office). Thereafter, another road will be made inside the City Centre from December. Thereafter, the construction of a 7.1km-long road will start in January. They said before beginning work, site inspection and quality studies have been undertaken to ensure that the newly made roads don’t face issues of inundation and waterlogging. “Along with construction of the roads, BSL has also awarded contracts to build drains along the roads,” Dhan said. Official sources said BSL, a once cash-strapped company, has now emerged as one of the most profitable units under the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) with good production and sale of products despite the Covid-19 pandemic. SAIL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 4,339 crores in Q2 of the current fiscal. BSL has performed well by contributing Rs 2,033.92 crores profit before tax (PBT) to SAIL in the second quarter. It is one of the five steel plants under SAIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bsl-begins-revamp-of-roads-in-its-township/articleshow/87875836.cms||Divy Khare

In 2020, the state had procured a little over 6 lakh metric ton paddy during the Kharif season. “Paddy procurement commenced from the second week of December in 2020. The preparation for paddy procurement has been completed by the department already and the registration of new farmers is underway. We hope to begin procurement around the same time this year as well,” Himani Pandey, secretary of the food, public distribution and consumer affairs department, said. In October this year, the state cabinet approved a proposal of the department to cap the maximum procurement from one farmer at 200 quintals. This was done to ensure that greater numbers of small and marginal farmers are brought under the ambit of the paddy procurement scheme. The state procures paddy from a farmer at Rs 2,050 per quintal. More than 1.03 lakh farmers are expected to turn up at the paddy procurement centres this year. “Unlike other states such as Bihar, farmers in Jharkhand take up transplantation late. So, while many states have begun procurement, our farmers are still harvesting their yield,” a senior officer said. Thousands of men, who work in different states, return to their homes in rural Jharkhand during the harvesting season every year. While state health mission director Ramesh Gholap did not respond to TOI’s calls, senior officers in the state health department claimed the district administrations have been asked to remain vigilant. “All incoming passengers at railway stations, inter-state bus terminus and entry points are tested for Covid-19 long before the festive season. The exercise is being continued. Though the Covid-19 graph in Jharkhand is low at the moment, there can be no room for laxity,” a senior official said on anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-procure-8-lakh-metric-ton-paddy-this-year/articleshow/87875846.cms||---

The 51-member CWC unanimously agreed to hold the convention in Ranchi on December 18. It was last held in 2018 in Dhanbad. “The CWC, which met after a long time, discussed ways to strengthen the organisation. The preparations of the scheduled Panchayat polls in the state were also on the agenda alongside the general convention. That apart, ways to publicise the social welfare schemes of the government, which were rolled out in the past two years, were also discussed,” state water resources minister Mithilesh Kumar Thakur told mediapersons after the meeting. However, Thakur said the CWC did not debate the recent issues such as the party’s aggressive stance against the Tata Sons in Jamshedpur and the dissenting tone of its Jama legislator Sita Soren, who is also the party’s general secretary and a CWC member. “It was purely an organisational meeting,” Thakur said. Sita, who recently took to social media to criticise the party and accused that its reigns were being controlled by touts, participated in the meeting along with other JMM legislators such as Stephen Maranchi, Dipak Birua, Lobin Hembrom, Sudivya Kumar, Hafizul Hassan and Savita Mahto. She put forth her suggestions and blended in with ease with the others. “Whatever may be the rift between the (Soren) family, Sita looked relatively relaxed during the two-hour meeting. She met every one with a smile, laughed and joked over lunch and posed for photographs,” a CWC member, who attended the meet, said on anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dissenting-sita-attends-jmm-cwc-meet/articleshow/87875874.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He, along with others, was shifted to Ranchi jail on Monday. Kishan Da’s wife and CPI (Maoist) central committee member Sheela Marandi has been housed in the general ward for women. All the six Maoists were shifted to the central jail in Ranchi owing to health and security reasons. The Saraikela jail administration had requested that the six be shifted to another jail with higher medical facilities and security. Jail inspector general (IG) Manoj Kumar said, “We can treat Kishan da who is suffering from several ailments in the jail hospital or in the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences as per need.” The IG said that Kishan Da would be segregated from other inmates inside the jail. He added, “His cell is being kept under round the clock surveillance with the help of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras to prevent anyone from meeting him. It is important as a large number of extremists are stationed in the jail. There are around 200 CCTV cameras inside the jail campus.” Kishan da is likely to be taken in remand by police of various districts and states in the future. Kishan Da, his wife along with Maoists Virendra Hansda, Raju Tuddu, Krishna Bahanda and Guruchanran Bodra were arrested by the Saraikela district police on November 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kishan-da-kept-in-high-security-zone-in-birsa-jail/articleshow/87875805.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Former BJP MLA dies, CM, other leaders offer condolences||Jamshedpur: Prominent BJP leader of Kolhan division and former Ichagarh MLA Sadhucharan Mahato passed away on Tuesday at Rabindranath Tagore Hospital, Kolkata, where he was undergoing treatment for renal problem. The 48-year-old politician recently underwent kindey transplant at the same hospital. His wife, Sarthi, donated one of her kidneys to him. Chief minister Hemant Soren, Union tribal affairs minister Arjun Munda and host of other political leaders expressed their condelences over social media. "He was doing well after the kidney transplant, but suddenly developed complications on Monday resulting in his death," said a close aide of the leader. Popular among the people of his constituency for being available whenever required, Sadhucharan was known for his sustained campaign for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the scores of villagers of Chandil who were displaced by the Subernarekha Multipurpose Project. "Sadhucharan always served the people of Ichagarh with commitment," said Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Baran Mahato, while condoling the death of the former legislator. Beginning his political journey with JMM in early 1990s, Sadhucharan came close to the then Congress strongman and Singhbhum MP Vijay Singh Soy. After joining the Congress, Sadhucharan was made president of the district Congress committee of Seraikela-Kharswan between 2005 and 2008. In 2009, Sadhucharan joined BJP, and unsuccessfully contested his first election from Ichagarh assembly constituency that same year. In 2014, Sadhucharan tasted success by defeating Sabita Mahato of JMM by an overwhelming votes from Ichagarh on BJP ticket. However in 2019 state elections, he lost to Sabita. He was known to be a strongman when it came to getting things done for the people of his constituency. In 2018, he underwent treatment at Tata Main Hospital (TMH) while he was in police custody for over three months after he was arrested for allegedly slapping land revenue official, Deepu Kumar, in Nimdih. Sadhucharan faced several cases in his early life, four cases were pending against him in 2019, as per the affidavit filed by him before ECI during the assembly polls. Most of the cases are related to unlawful assembly, insult intended to breach of peace and deterring public servant from discharging duty. Sadhucharan's fluency in Bengali made him popular among the Bengali voters of his constituency. The Ichagarh assembly segment is anchored on the borders of Purulia district of Bengal. The Adityapur Small Industries Association (ASIA), President, Santosh Khetan, said Sadhucharan was close to the entrepreneurs. Resident of Sridungri in Adityapur, Sadhucharan shared a good rapport with local industralists. Family sources said Sadhucharan's body will be brought to his Sridungri house on Tuesday for conducting the last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/former-bjp-mla-dies-cm-other-leaders-offer-condolences/articleshow/87875833.cms||---

We all know that the spine has discs and we are all familiar with the problems of slip disc. But very few know that the spinal column also has real joints, just like the knee or elbow, called facet joints. Like knees and elbows, these joints also develop cysts; which is a very rare condition – to detect as well as to treat. Recently, a case of facet cysts was detected and surgically treated at Wockhardt Hospital. Spine surgeon Dr Priyesh Dhoke, who performed this process, said the patient, who is is 72 years old, had developed acute symptoms like severe pain while walking and standing. “People around him suggested that it could be due to advanced age. A retired professor with an active lifestyle, it was a shock for this gentleman to stop his daily activities,” said Dr Dhoke. Interestingly, the cyst was not detected by doctors even after the MRI. “In this case, MRI reports had no mention of the facet joint cyst. The radiologist had reported degenerative condition of the spine. As a treating doctor, I examined the MRI films in great detail and detected that it was a facet cyst,” said Dr Dhoke. After a successful surgery, a huge cyst was removed and sent for histopathology biopsy for confirmation. After this, all the pressure on the spinal nerves was removed. The patient informed TOI that he started walking the very next day. “I was able to walk without pain confidently for a long distance in the next two weeks. It’s like a new life for me. I was bound to the bed a few days back and was feeling helpless. My life has changed,” he said. After multiple consultations, his symptoms were attributed to his age. A senior surgeon from government medical college and hospital confirmed that facet cyst is a rare condition where the synovial swelling arises in the facet joint and compresses the spinal nerves to cause pain, numbness or weakness in the legs. “Sometimes, it is also associated with paralysis in the legs and difficulty with urine and passing stools. Surgery is the effective solution for this condition,” he said. THE RARE CYST: SYMPTOMS * Pain and cramping in lower back and legs * Pain radiates from back of leg to foot * Numbness or tingling in legs * Increased pain while standing or walking * Diagnosis of cyst most important step towards treatment * Surgery can be a solution for which pre-operative planning & advance infra needed * Advance anesthesia care, high-end operation microscope, special drilling instruments and good post operative care too must for successful surgery||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/72-yr-old-starts-walking-again-after-rare-spine-surgery-treats-facet-cyst/articleshow/87876815.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The video clip of Lourenco leaving the 5-star hotel past midnight came in the backdrop of speculations of politicians changing colours as elections are coming closer. With a lot of buzz on social media, Lourenco had to hold a press briefing along with state party president Girish Chodankar to clear the air over the incident. Lourenco denied having met Fadnavis and said he was not aware that Fadnavis was staying in the same hotel where he went for dinner. He said that he went to the hotel to meet a poll strategist but moved out immediately after he saw the BJP party persons there. Asked why he went for dinner at midnight, the two-time Curtorim MLA said that he got delayed in campaigning in the constituency and then went for a small bite before leaving for Panaji. “I saw all the BJP party members and I decided to move out,” he said, adding that there is nothing political to the incident. “I didn’t want to create doubts in people’s minds. I am very clear. There is no politics to it. Am loyal to Congress,” he said Chodankar also said that he had discussed with Lourenco about the poll strategist. Fadnavis also said Lourenco had not met him. “No, he didn’t meet me. You can ask the chief minister.” Lourenco said he had met the chief minister last time for jobs, but till now not a single job has been given to him (for his constituents). Lourenco came under severe criticism from Aam Aadmi Party. The party took the opportunity to hit out at Lourenco alleging that he met Fadnavis in the hotel for poll setting. Last month, there were speculations that Lourenco was to join AAP before he changed his mind to stay put in Congress. “BJP-Congress tandem is known for post-poll setting but this time they are busy with pre-election setup,” alleged AAP’s Amit Palekar. Venzy Viegas said that there were others but only Lourenco was seen on camera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seen-at-same-hotel-as-fadnavis-reginaldo-courts-controversy/articleshow/87876811.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Congress can’t manage 4 MLAs, how will it handle 21: Devendra Fadnavis||QUEPEM/VASCO: BJP central observer and former chief minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday likened Congress to a small car — a ‘Nano’ party — with only four MLAs as its occupants. “But unity being lacking among them, they are driving in different directions,” Fadnavis said. “If Congress cannot manage their four MLAs, how will they form the government with 21 MLAs?” he said while addressing two workers meetings, first at deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar’s residence in Betul, and later at Vasco. Referring to Kavlekar as a true leader of the masses, he said that his defecting from Congress with 10 MLAs left the party more desperate. Kavlekar will win the coming election with a thumping majority, Fadnavis said, adding that it was the deputy minister’s connection with the masses that prompted him to request him to organise a meeting at his residence at such short notice. The BJP central observer hit out at both Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC), alleging that the latter was an “extortion industry”. If the people of Goa elect TMC then they will destroy the image of the state, which is considered an international tourist destination, he said. Attacking Delhi CM and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, he said that Delhi is a half state and that the AAP government looks after only the health, education and electricity department, while the rest of the departments and infrastructure work are handled by the central government. He reminded the gathering that it was former chief minister Manohar Parikar who had brought Goa’s infrastructure to international standards. “BJP will follow his legacy,” Fadnavis said. Party president Sadanand Tanavade and NRI commissioner Narendra Sawaikar, among others were present at the meeting. Meeting worker’s at Mormugao, Fadnavis urged the party worker’s to strive hard to achieve satisfactory success in the upcoming assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-cant-manage-4-mlas-how-will-it-handle-21-fadnavis/articleshow/87876875.cms||---

A post attributed to IS said "Muslims were being targeted in Tripura and the community has to take revenge by breaking false Gods (sic)". Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra told TOI: "Since Monday evening, we've provided adequate police security for the temple and asked the Uttara Kannada SP to coordinate with the cybercrime section to identify the source of the photograph."

Rodrigues also holds the legal metrology portfolio. Congress has demanded that all posts of the legal metrology for which results were declared recently be scrapped and the minister be sacked immediately, failing which the party will launch a statewide agitation. “The corrupt BJP government is all out to deprive qualified and deserving candidates government jobs. This exposes the grand job scam in the legal metrology department,” Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar alleged. He said that 1,128 candidates had appeared for the post of inspector of the legal metrology department and that the written exams were held in September and results were declared on November 19. “The marklist had four candidates scoring 100 out of 100 and of one the four who scored full marks was Bhupendra Umesh Dessai, the personal assistant to Rodrigues,” he said. Another candidate who has scored cent per cent, Chodankar said, was Azen Rio Rodrigues from Dramapur in Salcete which happens to be the constituency of the minister. The third such candidate is Aditya Rajendra Parab from Kothambi in Pale from chief Minister Pramod Sawant’s constituency, and the fourth candidate is Colaco Swezel Urminda from Raia Salcete, he said. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. We will further probe into the results in detail and ensure that deserving, qualified and eligible candidates get justice,” the Congress president said.

Dilip Koradoya, a resident of Rajkot's Dhoraji, had to approach Rajkot district consumer dispute redressal commission after the insurance company deducted half of the bill amount of his son Meet's treatment for viral pneumonia citing the government's circular capping hospital charges for Covid hospitalisation. It was only after the insurance firm was sued that it settled the dispute and paid the amount to Koradiya. Koradiya had bought health insurance worth Rs 7.25 lakh for his family from Star Health & Allied Insurance Co Ltd. His son, Meet, fell ill on September 29, 2020, and was admitted to a hospital in Surat. He was treated for pneumonia and discharged on October 5. The bill was Rs 2 lakh. In the discharge summary, the hospital stated that the patient suffered from viral pneumonia and was not Covid-positive. A day after the discharge, Koradiya sought reimbursement from the insurer. The insurer approved Rs 1 lakh amount and deducted Rs 1 lakh citing the Surat Municipal Corporation's circular regarding hospital charges for Covid-19 to justify chopping reimbursement by half.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-some-are-out-to-prove-their-pneumonia-isnt-covid/articleshow/87878404.cms||Saeed Khan

Nadda will arrive at 7.30pm on Wednesday and start his tour of the state the next day, on Thursday, at 9.15am with a visit to the Shree Mahalaxmi Temple in Panaji. From the temple, Nadda will head to a BJP karyakarta melava at the community hall in Valpoi, which will start at 11am. The national BJP president will then proceed the same afternoon to Bicholim for a karyakarta sammelan to be held at the Hirabai Zantye Memorial Hall, at 3pm. In July, Nadda had visited Goa to kick off preparations for the 2022 assembly election. On Monday, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the assembly elections in Goa are expected to be held in early February 2022 and the code of conduct will be implemented by January. During his July visit, Nadda held marathon meetings with ministers, MLAs and office bearers to understand the political situation in the state. In 2012, riding on a Manohar Parrikar wave, BJP for the first time got 21 seats in the 40-member House. Though in 2017, it failed to win a majority, Parrikar was quick to form a coalition government. The 2022 elections will be the first time that BJP will go to polls in the state without Parrikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-natl-prez-nadda-on-2-day-visit-from-today/articleshow/87876981.cms||---

The chair was inaugurated by chief minister Pramod Sawant. It has been instituted at the university under the Manohar Parrikar School of Law, Governance and Public Policy. “Extremely glad to inaugurate the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Chair at Goa University. It is envisaged to bring together academics from across the world to GU to deliver talks, hold seminars and workshops, and offer advanced programmes,” Sawant said. The chair will therefore act as a knowledge hub providing great benefits to students, faculty and the general public, he said. Research will also take place under the chair, revolving around governance and public policies, the chief minister said. Goa University vice-chancellor B Harilal Menon thanked the chief minister for establishment of the chair. Director of higher education, Prasad Lolayekar, spoke about a new scheme created to help improve Goa University’s national ranking. The scheme will help enhance research and publication output, he said. Soon, proposals under the scheme will be invited from the university and other institutions, Lolayekar said. The Manohar Parrikar School of Law, Governance and Public Policy at GU encompasses the disciplines of law, public administration, women’s studies, tribal studies, and social work. The school was set up to create an academic entity within Goa University that will conduct policy-relevant research and offer advanced programmes in applied social sciences, thereby contributing to the creation of a well-trained cadre of public policy professionals in Goa. Currently, the Manohar Parrikar School offers programmes that lead to both MA and PhD in Women’s Studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shivaji-chair-to-bring-academics-from-world-over-together-sawant/articleshow/87876998.cms||---

As a part of this campaign, 500 individuals of seven indigenous fish species were released into the temple pond, which is considered as a method of in situ conservation. Scientists are now looking at doing the same in ponds of religious importance in Goa and other coastal states. The conservation of indigenous fish germplasm in temple ponds would be vital for the development of live gene banks across the country, Sreekanth G B, scientist, fisheries resource management at ICAR-CCARI, said. Trivesh Mayekar, a scientist in the area of fish genetics and breeding, highlighted the importance of conservation of small indigenous fishes and their role in providing food and nutritional security to the rural population. K D Sadhale from Nirmal Vishva, an environmental NGO, spoke on the importance of fish in human life, water quality management, and highlighted that such conservation efforts are also required in open water systems such as rivers, creeks and canals. An extension folder titled, ‘Promoting indigenous ornamental fishes of Goa: Breeding and seed production of the melon barb, Haludaria pradhani for conservation and management’, was released and posters displaying the freshwater fish of Goa were also distributed to tourists, students, villagers, and staff of Mangueshi devasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scientists-make-efforts-to-conserve-indigenous-fish-release-500-individuals-in-temple-pond/articleshow/87877012.cms||---
---||Noida||Traffic stops on Noida expressway as farmers protest||GREATER NOIDA: Traffic on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway was hit for an hour and a half after a group of farmers gheraoed Dadri MLA Tejpal Singh Nagar, who was headed for Jewar, where chief minister Yogi Adityanath was reviewing arrangements for the Noida airport project’s launch on Thursday. Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan, the farmers sought to know what Nagar had done for them in the past five years. They also demanded a 40% job quota for youngsters in local companies. It was around 2.30pm that the group of farmers in their cars stopped Nagar near zero point. The posse of policemen accompanying the Dadri MLA stopped the farmers from moving towards Jewar and asked them to speak to him at zero point itself. As the farmers questioned the MLA on their demands, the line of vehicles kept growing longer. The leader of the outfit, Sukhbir Khalifa, said they were on the expressway only to question Nagar. Some, however, claimed they planned to go to Jewar and gherao the chief minister as well. On Monday, members of the same outfit had flocked to the residence of Noida MLA Pankaj Singh and started a protest. The farmers have also been demanding that abadi land be increased from the current 450 sqm. “We wanted to protest outside the Dadri MLA’s house, but came to know that he would be leaving for Jewar. The cops accompanying the MLA stopped us at zero point and told us to speak to him there itself. We told him that it had been 5 years since he had visited us last. He keeps saying he attends all functions and weddings. He assured us he would accompany us when we meet minister Satish Makhana. In the end, he agreed that all our demands are genuine,” Khalifa said. The farmers said they had been protesting over their issues for the past 90 days, but to no avail. “They are our local representatives. Why are they not presenting our demands before the chief minister?” Khalifa asked. The MLA, however, claimed he visited them regularly. “I will present their demands before the chief minister. I have spoken to the Greater Noida Authority to ensure that local companies employ 40% youngsters from the villages. The land leaseback in Greater Noida villages, which was pending for so long, has now been approved by the government,” he said. As the farmers protested, it was the commuters who bore the brunt. Frustrated with the wait, a woman came out of her car and shouted at the protesters to vacate the area as she needed to go to Tappal, where her mother had died. “I am also a farmer’s daughter. I have to travel home because my mother has died,” she said. After heated arguments, the farmers decide to leave around 4pm. After a few minutes, traffic resumed on the expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/traffic-hit-on-noida-e-way-as-farmers-protest/articleshow/87877373.cms||Shikha Salaria

A 72-year-old East Delhi mason had eight children, two sons and six daughters, and is living in a 30 sq yard house in Krishna Nagar with his eldest son's family. The house has already been partitioned between family members. Thanks to the married daughters who bequeathed their share in the house to the father, the mason has a place in the small dwelling unit. But, when it came to sustenance, the sons did not help the father who now finds it difficult to earn a living from masonry work, which is beyond his physical means. The mason, in 2015, moved the family court under Section 125 of Criminal Procedure Code seeking maintenance from his contractor-cum-real estate dealer son. The court initially granted Rs 6,000 per month as maintenance and asked the son to pay arrears of 1,68,000, accrued since 2015. He paid only Rs 50,000. The trial court enhanced the maintenance to Rs 10,000 per month with a direction to pay arrears at the new rate. But the son kept filing petitions in various forums, from the district courts through Delhi high court to the Supreme Court, to stall the payment. Expansive excuses were dished out before the court — father is affluent enough to maintain himself; the son is not earning enough to give Rs 10,000; and, finally the son told the SC on Tuesday that the trial court mistook his wife's wealth as that of his. The son’s counsel argued before a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli that it would be legally wrong to ask the son to pay maintenance to the father from the daughter-in-law’s income. But, the bench saw through the ruses and uphelding the order. “It is the moral duty and legal obligation of a son to maintain his old parents. Your father is 72 years-old and you are dragging him from court to court over a maintenance of Rs 10,000. What has happened to you? No one should drag old parents to court. No elderly person should see such a day in his life. We must take care of them,” the CJI-led bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-moral-duty-and-legal-obligation-of-son-to-provide-sustenance-to-parents-in-old-age/articleshow/87876707.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||India||Covid: ‘Booster call may hinge on immunity levels’||NEW DELHI: The decision to administer booster shots will depend on waning immunity and effectiveness of vaccine, say official sources, though India may have surplus Covid vaccines by the end of the year and several countries with high vaccination rates have already started administering them. Most countries with mRNA vaccines have started giving booster shots. However, experts say mRNA jabs are essentially three dose vaccines. However, going forward India may consider giving booster shots to select population who are immunocompromised or are highly vulnerable to infection. In India, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has assessed the real-life data from sero prevalence studies. One of the findings are that extended gap of at least 12 weeks between two doses of Covishield - which accounts for around 88% Covid immunisation in the country- has resulted in a better immune response among majority of vaccinated Indians, subsiding any immediate requirement for booster shots. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin has also been found to be effective against Delta variant - which continues to be most prevalent. Experts say the second wave in India has also helped people gain natural immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-not-in-rush-to-give-booster-doses/articleshow/87878482.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt red-faced after its failure to file caveat gets Param Bir Singh SC protection||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court order granting former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh protection from arrest in cases against him in the state, has come as an embarrassment to the MVA government. To make things worse, it has now emerged that the government missed the opportunity to press its case against Singh in the apex court -it had not filed a caveat in response to his appeal. If the state had filed a caveat, the apex court would have to give it an opportunity to be heard before passing an order. Instead, the apex court passed the order and issued a notice to the state government to respond by the next hearing on December 6. Singh has been granted protection until then and has been asked to join the investigation. Sources say a high-level meeting was held in Mantralaya to discuss the oversight. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil and additional chief secretary (home) Manu Kumar Srivastava did not respond to queries on the issue. In September, the Bombay HC had dismissed Singh's plea seeking to quash the state government's preliminary inquiries against him. Call on Param’s suspension only after Uddhav’s returnThe HC had dismissed Singh’s plea to have the PEs quashed on the grounds that he should have approached the Central Administrative Tribunal instead. Singh filed an appeal against this order in the Supreme Court.The state is also yet to act on a second proposal for Singh’s suspension sent by director general of police Sanjay Pandey earlier this month. Sources said a decision on the proposal will only be taken after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray returns from hospital. The first proposal was sent in September for the suspension of Singh and 25 police personnel named for extortion charges. The proposal was returned by the home department to the DG office. The latter was asked to provide specific details since all of them may not be facing the same level of charges. A modified proposal was then sent seeking the suspension of Singh and a deputy commissioner of police, earlier this month. Singh last attended office in May and then went underground, refusing to respond to multiple summons and warrants. He was declared proclaimed offender by a magistrate’s court in Mumbai last week. In the SC hearing, on Monday his lawyer finally revealed that he was in the country and willing to submit to a probe by the CBI or another agency, but not the Maharashtra Police. Singh had accused former home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption but later told the Justice Chandiwal probe panel that he has no evidence to back his claim. So far, five FIRs have been registered against Singh in the state on charges of extortion. He also faces two inquiries by the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau. Besides, the Chandiwal panel which is probing Singh’s allegations had also issued warrants against him when he did not appear before it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-red-faced-after-its-failure-to-file-caveat-gets-param-bir-singh-sc-protection/articleshow/87878494.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Coimbatore and Chandigarh were ranked second and third respectively among the top 10 urban centres, while Dhanbad was the laggard and placed among the bottom 10 centres. In 2015, the UN General Assembly had set the target of meeting 17 SDG goals by 2030. The latest index measures urban centres in India on 15 out of the 17 goals. Out of the 56 urban areas ranked in the index, 44 are with a population of more one million. The remaining 12 are state capitals with a population of less than a million. For each SDG, the urban areas are ranked on a scale of 0-100. A score of 100 implies that the urban area has achieved the targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that it is the farthest from achieving the targets among the selected urban areas, according to a statement issued by the government think tank. Among the top10 performers, eight centres scored between 70% to 75.5%, indicating good progress, while the score for the bottom 10 ranged from 52.4% to 58.6%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shimla-tops-nitis-urban-sdg-index/articleshow/87878495.cms||---

The timing of the launch of the airport, the Yogi government’s showpiece infrastructure project, is crucial as UP heads to polls early next year. The airport, which is set to start operations in 2024, is expected to yield investments worth Rs 10,000 crore and create about 1 lakh jobs. The CM reviewed arrangements at the airport site for the November 25 eventWhile addressing a news conference, the chief minister wasted little time to attack the opposition, saying that successive governments kept planning the airport for the past 30-35 years but failed to implement the project. “Akal se paidal kuchh log aise ho chuke hain, jo kisi bhi project ke lokarpan pe kehte hain ki humne bhi socha tha isko karne ke liye (before the launch of any project, some brainless people say they, too, had thought about it),” Adityanath said. A road to the airport site being levelled During the recent launch of the Purvanchal Expressway, the SP had claimed credit for the project, which BJP rubbished. Adityanath said the airport, which would make Delhi-NCR the first region in the country to have a dual airport system, would massively improve UP’s connectivity with the rest of the country. “Before 2017, airports in UP were connected to just 25 locations. But now, more than 80 locations are connected to the state. This airport in Jewar will further strengthen the position of the state and benefit the residents of NCR, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Aligarh equally,” he added. The Noida International Airport has a commissioning date of October 2024. Adityanath listed other big ticket infrastructure projects that are under way in the Yamuna Expressway region, such as the Film City and medical device park. Adityanath also emphasised that his government was working on a war footing to set up an electronics city near the airport. Adityanath held a meeting with project officials for around 90 minutes and discussed preparations for the November 25 event. He left for Lucknow around 6.30pm. Officials in the district administration and NIAL, the special purpose vehicle of the UP government for the airport project, claimed that the launch ceremony would be a “grand” one. Around 2 lakh people are expected to attend the event. BJP workers and supporters from Noida and nearby districts are likely to reach the venue in around 1,500-2,000 buses. A parking lot is being created to accommodate the buses and at least 10,000 private cars. Four helipads are also being readied by leveling the fields near the main stage. Officials said the dais would accommodate 25-30 dignitaries, such as the governor, and Union and state ministers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to reach by noon and stay there for around two hours. Senior executives of Zurich AG, the Swiss company building the airport, will also be there. Officials said mini models of the airport would be installed and 50 giant screens would share the live proceedings of the main stage with those seated on the ground. Arun Vir Singh, NIAL’s chief executive officer, was confident of a successful event. “Rehearsals are being done at the site. We are going to showcase the key features of the airport before the dignitaries and the audience. They will get to know that the most advanced airport of the country is going to come up in their neighbourhood,” he said. The project’s journey so far, right from the days of land acquisition to its launch, will be portrayed through four short films.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/50-giant-screens-4-helipads-2k-buses-jewar-project-set-for-a-mega-launch/articleshow/87877367.cms||Shalabh

This incident adds to an already swelling list of controversies, clashes and police cases involving the two parties as they fight to wrest or protect political turf. Amid all the fighting on the sidelines of Thursday's poll battle, BJP had some internal friction to contend with as former minister and sitting MLA Sudip Roy Barman appeared to take a swipe at chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb for the incidents. "A pervert paradropped leader is defaming the saffron party and PM Narendra Modi as well as making a mockery of democracy," he said. Barman alleged that "anti-social elements from CPM" had found refuge in BJP and were now perpetrating violence in the state. "They are attacking those who brought an end to 25 years of communist rule by voting for BJP," he said at a presser, accompanied by party colleague and MLA Ashis Kumar Saha. TMC candidate Gouri Majumder alleged that BJP's Ranjit Majumder attacked her at her Agartala home around midnight on Monday, hours after Union home minister Amit Shah reportedly assured Trinamool parliamentarians in Delhi that there would be no more violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-man-fired-at-me-agartala-tmc-candidate/articleshow/87878523.cms||---

Signage like this will greet you soon at Bodaki, which the government proposes to rename Greater Noida station, as the facility is upgraded for the multimodal transport and logistics hub (MMTLH) in the region and preparations are afoot to run 16 express trains from the station. The proposal for the name change was sent by Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) on Tuesday through the district magistrate to the state government, which will move it to the railway ministry for approval. The Integrated Industrial Township Greater Noida Limited (IITGNL) is developing the transport hub around Bodaki which will include an interstate bus terminal (ISBT), a proposed metro connection on the Aqua Line corridor and the junction of the eastern and western freight corridors. The station at Bodaki is expected to benefit those travelling to eastern UP, Bihar and West Bengal. “Since Bodaki will be the hub of MMTLH, it will be developed into a state-of-the-art railway station with an ISBT and metro connectivity. The ISBT at Bodaki will offer an alternative to the Anand Vihar bus terminus while the metro will provide connectivity to Delhi-NCR and Jewar airport. The detailed project report (DPR) is ready for the hub and tender is expected to be floated by December,” Narendra Bhooshan CEO GNIDA told TOI. The railway station at Bodaki in Dadri will have 16 tracks to cater to the huge traffic flow from eastern to western parts of India, Bhooshan added. “There will be 16 express trains halting at the station. There were none earlier. We will also try to have a halt for Lucknow Mail sometime in the future. A yard will be built for this,” the GNIDA CEO said. He added that IITGNL has already approached Uttar Pradesh Transport Corporation (UPTC) for constructing the proposed ISBT. The multimodal transport and logistics hub is being developed under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) project, now renamed National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (NICDC), as an integrated industrial township across 800 acres in Greater Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/bodaki-set-to-be-renamed-gr-noida-railway-station/articleshow/87877223.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The Centre has also not given any clarity on the quantity of paddy it would procure in the current season. However, the NDA government assured a ministerial delegation led by industry minister KT Rama Rao that it would enhance paddy and rice procurement to some extent. The Telangana government said the Centre's move, in future, would make 'boiled rice' disappear in the state. The Centre informed the Telangana government that a final decision on the quantity of paddy to be procured will be announced on November 26 after holding another meeting with agriculture and public distribution system (PDS) department officials. The ministerial and official delegation comprising KTR, agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy and civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar met Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal and union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar separately on the burning paddy procurement issue on Tuesday. The government delegation held discussion with the Union ministers for about three hours. KTR talks of setting annual target of paddy procurement Officials said though Goyal was busy with an American delegation, he took time to meet the state delegation. During the meeting, KTR talked about setting the annual target of paddy procurement at 120 lakh metric tonnes and enhancing the current rabi season's procurement from 40 lakh MTs to at least 70 lakh MTs. On fixing the annual target of paddy procurement, purchase of 90% production in the current season, the Centre said it would work out the figure with senior officials of agriculture and PDS departments on Wednesday and come up with an estimation by Thursday. While the state government has been claiming that acreage of paddy cultivation in the state in the Kharif season was 62.13 lakh, the Centre pegged the number at 58.66 lakh. KTR informed the Union minister that once they get some clarity on the issue, the state would plan accordingly and advise the farmers not to go for paddy and suggest alternative crops. The state government appealed to the people to wait for the clarity from the Centre on paddy cultivation in the coming Rabi season. The NDA government agreed with KCR's suggestion that the Centre should announce the annual procurement target. While accepting that it was a good suggestion which needed to be implemented across the country, the Centre said from next year, it would announce an annual target for all the states. Chief minister KCR is camping in Delhi since Sunday evening to sort out paddy procurement issue. He had asked for PM's appointment to apprise him about the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wont-buy-boiled-rice-from-telangana-clarifies-centre/articleshow/87878539.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Allahabad||'Oral sex with minor not aggravated assault': Allahabad HC cuts convict's time in jail||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has held that oral sex with a minor amounts to "penetrative sexual assault" under Section 4 of the Pocso Act, but can't be treated as "aggravated penetrative sexual assault" that invites stricter punishment under Section 6 of the same law. In making this observation, the court reduced the jail term of a man convicted of forcing oral sex on a child from 10 to seven years. Hearing the appeal filed by Sonu Kushwaha, who was convicted by a Jhansi court, the single-judge bench of Justice Anil Kumar Ojha said, "After going through the records and provisions of the Pocso Act, I am of the considered opinion that the appellant should be punished under Section 4...because the act done by the appellant falls in the category of penetrative sexual assault." Kushwaha had offered Rs 20 to the survivor to keep quiet. He threatened the child with dire consequences if anyone came to know about what happened. The trial court pronounced him guilty of aggravated sexual assault, as defined by Section 5 of the Pocso Act, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. The high court ruled that the offence couldn't be categorised under sections 5 and 6 of the legislation as the act of oral sex was not "aggravated penetrative sexual assault", as defined by the law. It said the quantum of punishment should, therefore, be determined by Section 4 of the act rather than Section 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/oral-sex-with-minor-not-aggravated-assault-hc-cuts-convicts-time-in-jail/articleshow/87878558.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Hyderabad||Poor students make IIM, NIT cut, but fund crunch keeps them out||HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday ordered IIT-Bombay to admit a young Dalit boy who had collected the fees with great difficulty, but was not given admission simply because the payment was delayed due to a technical glitch. But what about those hundreds of students who get admissions to premier educational institutions but can't study with the best brains in the country simply because they can't muster up the fees? Despite securing a seat in some of India's top institutions - like the IIMs, NITs, NALSAR - several students from marginalised sections of Telangana are unable to pursue course there. TOI spoke to some of these students who, after attending special coaching classes and putting in over six months of preparation to crack these tests, had to drop out at the last minute for failing to arrange the fees. "I will always have to live with the regret of not being able to join the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research's (NALSAR) Integrated Program in Management (IPM), despite making the cut," said B Divya Vani, who secured AIR of 125 rank in the IPM admission test. 100 students settled for collegeswith lesser fee, records reveal She stood second in Scheduled Tribes category in the exam. While Vani's parents - her father works as a contract driver in Mancherial - made every attempt to arrange Rs 30 lakh for the five-year course, they eventually fell short. The student is now pursuing a BCom from a private college in Karimnagar. "Though my teachers said I could get a scholarship, I was not sure what percentage of the fee would be covered. And while waiting for the fee money to be arranged, I even missed the Degree Online Services, Telangana counselling. I, therefore, had no option but to take up BCom," she added. Like Devi, there are at least 40 students, mostly from SC and ST community, who missed their chance to attend premier institutes, despite securing top marks. In fact, records with social welfare officials show in the last couple of years, another 90 to100 settled for colleges with lesser fee. And this was after they cracked the test for leading institutions such as AIIMS; Central Institute of Technology, Kokrajhar; BHU; Indian Institute of Science Education and Research; National Forensic Sciences University; and Rashtriya Raksha University. "I had to pay Rs 2.3 lakh as first-year fee to secure my admission in NFSU. For the five-year course, it would cost at least Rs14 lakh. We couldn't arrange the money as my mother, a farmer, is the only earning member in the family," said P Archana, who secured admission even in RRU. "But there too the fee was equally steep." Also compelled to give up her place at NFSU was, S Samiksha, as her parents who work as daily -wage labourers could not arrange the money. She is now waiting for ICAR counselling. "We asked everyone around to help with the fee amount, but nobody did anything," she said. Ramavath Venkateshwarulu, programme in-charge of the state's higher education training camp (for social welfare students) said every year at least 85% students, shortlisted and give special coaching, make it to top institutes. Yet, many are forced to forgo their seats ultimately, mainly owing to a fund crunch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poor-students-make-iim-nit-cut-but-fund-crunch-keeps-them-out/articleshow/87878573.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Trinamool district chief Anubrata Mondal said: “Both the groups who were involved in the clash are our supporters. But the incident was not at all political. There was a long-standing dispute over a football ground. Today, when officials came to conduct a survey, the clash broke out. Police should take necessary action.” Sources said the clash broke out when a team from the BDO office went to conduct a survey regarding the housing scheme ‘Bangla Abas Yojona’. BJP MLA Anup Saha said: “TMC leaders are trying to suppress the fact. This is a clash between two groups of TMC who are involved in corruption.” Birbhum SP Nagendranath Tripathi said: “Seven persons have been arrested. The situation is now under control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/6-injured-in-clash-in-birbhum-7-arrested/articleshow/87876899.cms||---
---||Kolkata||State moves division bench over CBI inquiry into SSC appointments||Kolkata: The West Bengal Central School Service Commission and the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education on Tuesday moved the division bench against a Calcutta High Court order of a CBI inquiry into the ‘irregular’ appointments of 25 Group-D staff. Counsels mentioned the case before a bench of justices Harish Tandon and Rabindranath Samanta, preferring an appeal against Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay’s Monday directive. The division bench allowed the aggrieved parties to file petitions that are likely to be taken up on Wednesday. SSC counsel Kishore Dutta said the order for a CBI inquiry went against the federal structure of the Constitution. He argued that state agencies should conduct the investigation and dissolve the SSC board if any irregularity was established. Dutta submitted that the alleged irregularity in appointments was not a matter of national importance. “The state can hand over the investigation to the CBI if it deems fit,” the senior counsel said. Justice Gangopadhyay had on Monday observed that it was giving the responsibility to the CBI “without showing any disrespect to the state police”. “I am passing the order only for the reason that both the authorities, the commission and the board, as also the police authority are controlled by the state,” he observed. During Monday’s hearing, the counsels had pleaded for an investigation by state police or a court-monitored investigation under a retired high court judge. But the HC didn’t yield to their arguments after going through the board’s affidavit. CBI, on the other hand, has started preparations for the inquiry as there was no stay on the order that directed it to file a preliminary report by December 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-moves-division-bench-over-cbi-inquiry-into-ssc-appointments/articleshow/87876879.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||Tripura TMC candidate alleges murder attempt, BJP MLA lambasts own CM||KOLKATA: A woman Trinamool candidate for the Agartala civic polls on Tuesday accused a Tripura BJP functionary of firing a bullet at her that she somehow managed to “dodge”, prompting BJP MLA Sudip Roy Barman to lash out against the Biplab Deb government. “A pervert paratroop leader is defaming the saffron party and PM Narendra Modi as well as making a mockery of democracy,” he said. Alleging that there was no democracy in Tripura, Roy Barman urged people to rise against the hooliganism by exercising their voting right. Addressing a press conference at the garage of the MLA hostel in Agartala, Roy Barman — with another BJP MLA Asish Saha by his side — slammed Deb, also the state home minister, and the state election commission for the alleged lawlessness in Tripura. Trinamool lapped up the statement, with party MP Sushmita Dev saying Roy Barman was a “responsible politician” and state education minister Bratya Basu daring BJP to “act” against him. “Sudip babu has admitted what we have been saying for days that BJP is a party of hooligans. If the party has the guts, then show it and expel Sudip babu,” said Basu. TMC Bengal general secretary Kunal Ghosh said: “Taking cue from Sudip babu’s statement, we urge voters to come out without fear and vote. We just want you to come out and vote for us.” The civic polls are scheduled to be held in Tripura on Thursday. TMC candidate Gouri Majumder alleged that BJP's Ranjit Majumder attacked her at her Agartala home around midnight on Monday. Without naming CM Deb, Roy Barman said: “A paratrooper leader had once demanded the names of all CPM goons and got them arrested. Now they are the ones who have changed jerseys and are attacking people. They are not BJP karyakartas, but CPM-turned-BJP goons.” The BJP MLA also slammed the hooliganism prior to elections and the way opposition parties were being attacked. Targeting Deb, Roy Barman said: “Law and order is a state subject and how can the state home minister not issue a statement after all these? I can tell you that his days are numbered.” “Election in Tripura was earlier celebrated as a festival. But what we are witnessing these days is shocking and I resent that. Our party’s motto had been ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. But that is not happening in Tripura. If this was about ‘vikas’, elections would have been held on the issue of development. Had it been on ‘vishwas’, then all these attacks, threats and thwarting people heading to vote wouldn’t have happened. BJP prioritises motherland above anything else but in Tripura just the reverse is happening because of an individual paratrooper leader,” said Roy Barman, adding that he was speaking for thousands of BJP karyakartas. Hooligans were bringing a bad name to BJP because of one paratrooper leader’s mistake, he said. Dubbing the BJP leadership in Tripura as a “childish leadership” which has “failed to identify the main political opponent”, Roy Barman added: “If some party member leaves BJP and joins some other party then we should try to convince and bring him back but instead they are physically assaulting them and further distancing them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tripura-tmc-candidate-alleges-murder-attempt-bjp-mla-lambasts-own-cm/articleshow/87876893.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Kolkata, Howrah to kick off phased civic polls, SEC tells HC||KOLKATA: The State Election Commission in its affidavit to the Calcutta High Court on Tuesday stated its decision, in consultation with the state government, to hold municipal polls in phases beginning with Kolkata and Howrah. The SEC affidavit to Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava was in response to a petition filed by BJP leader Pratap Banerjee praying for single-day municipal elections across the state. In his petition, Banerjee urged that counting of votes be held in one day even if elections were held in phases. The SEC told the court that it wanted to hold civic polls to Kolkata and Howrah first because most residents of these two cities had received Covid vaccine shots. The HC will hear the matter some time next week. In the afternoon, the state election commissioner called on the Bengal governor at Raj Bhavan, a day after the former held an all-party meeting on the upcoming civic polls. Later, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeted: “During the hour-long meeting with West Bengal state election commissioner Sourav Das, the governor emphasized that the SEC in its authority was at par with the Election Commission of India and it should be non-partisan, independent and effective and not an extension of the government.” The West Bengal State Election Act, 1994, provides that the SEC will have powers for “superintendence, direction…conduct of municipal polls” like that of the Election Commission. Section 8 of the Act empowers the state government to issue the election notification in consultation with SEC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-howrah-to-kick-off-phased-civic-polls-sec-tells-hc/articleshow/87876933.cms||Debasish Konar
---||India||SC comes to rescue of student with disability||NEW DELHI: After coming to the rescue of an IIT aspirant who was denied admission for not depositing admission fee on time, the Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the National Testing Agency to remedy the injustice caused to a student who was denied compensatory time of one hour in NEET 2021 despite suffering from dysgraphia and directed it to consider various options including grant of compensatory marks, reports Amit Anand Choudhary. The medical aspirant, suffering from 40% permanent disability, secured an All India Rank of 1721 out of 2684 in the PwD (people with disability) category who qualified in the exam despite not being granted an hour extra which she was entitled to. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna rejected the plea of NTA which alleged that it would not be possible to undo the injustice done to a single candidate as it would change the merit list of 15 lakh students which appeared in the medical entrance examinations as the result has already been declared. "It is no answer for an authority bound by the dicta of law and the Constitution, to throw up its hands in despair, instead of attempting to remedy the injustice which is caused to a student," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-comes-to-rescue-of-student-with-disability/articleshow/87878620.cms||---
