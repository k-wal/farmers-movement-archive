Jury selection began in the case of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who, joining vigilante groups opposed to the protests and rioting, shot two men dead and wounded a third on the night of August 20, 2020, drawing condemnation from the left but support from then-President Donald Trump. Carrying a semi-automatic assault rifle, he had opened fire during the march against police mistreatment of African Americans, killing two men, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and badly wounding a third, Gaige Grosskreutz. All three were white. The circumstances of the shootings, which were partly filmed by bystanders, are at the heart of the case: did Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, intend to kill people when he went to the protest, or did he shoot the men in self-defense? The judge in the case, Bruce Schroeder, underscored that question and angered liberals when he ruled last week that the people shot in the case could not be called "victims," but could be labelled "rioters," "looters" or "arsonists" if defense attorneys can show they had engaged in such acts. "Those of you who are selected for this jury are going to hear for yourselves the real evidence in this case," Schroeder told potential jurors Monday, suggesting that some of the reporting on the case had been "irresponsible and sloppy." Rittenhouse is charged with five felony counts, including first-degree homicide. Anti-police protests erupted in Kenosha after a white policeman grievously injured and paralyzed a Black man, Jacob Blake, shooting him in the back repeatedly during an arrest attempt. A resident of Antioch, Illinois, Rittenhouse drove the 20 miles (30 kilometers) to Kenosha where he joined dozens of others who said they were there to protect local businesses from looting and damage after rioting. Several videos captured his movements that night. On one of them, Rittenhouse seems to flee just before another young man falls to the ground with a gunshot wound to his head. On another, he is seen being chased by a small group of protesters. He falls down, then points his weapon. The sound of shots being fired is clearly audible. Since then, Rittenhouse has become a hero-figure in some right-wing and pro-gun circles, where the protests of 2020 were blamed on violent radicals. Protesters "violently attacked him," Trump said during a Kenosha visit in early September. "He probably would have been killed." After his arrest Rittenhouse was freed on bail of $2 million, raised by supporters across the country, including prominent supporters of Trump. Prosecutors are expected to depict Rittenhouse as a right-wing extremist who had come to Kenosha with the specific intention of clashing with anti-racism demonstrators. His own lawyers will say he acted in self-defense, shooting only to protect himself from rioters pursuing him. If convicted during the trial in Kenosha County Circuit Court, Rittenhouse faces a possible life sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trial-opens-in-killing-of-us-anti-racism-protesters/articleshow/87473311.cms||---

And as winter fast approaches, threatening to worsen further the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, Taliban spokesperson and ambassador-designate to UN Suhail Shaheen also told ToI Taliban will welcome aid at this critical juncture. "We are open to receiving all diplomats and committed to providing security for their routine diplomatic functions," said Shaheen, responding to a query by ToI on whether or not Indian diplomats can return to Afghanistan. "Similarly, we welcome humanitarian aids in this critical time as the winter is around the corner," he added, when asked about India's aid offer to Afghanistan on the margins of the recent Moscow Format talks. Unlike their silence on the first official engagement with India in Doha in August this year, Taliban were quick to confirm the meeting with an Indian delegation in Moscow last month. They also said that India had offered humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in the Moscow meeting and that both sides felt it was necessary to take into account each other's concerns and improve "diplomatic and economic relations". The Indian government is likely to focus on humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people in a conference of national security advisers it has proposed to organise next month. India has also been in exploring the possibility of delivering humanitarian aid to Afghans via the Wagah-Attari land border. Significantly, the government sought to know last month from Pakistan, which prevents India from exporting to Afghanistan through the aforementioned route, if it would allow India to transport a large consignment of wheat (around 50,000 MT) and medical aid to Afghanistan. While it will be interesting to see in the coming days whether or not Pakistan facilitates this initiative, India first has to ensure there is an assurance of non-discriminatory distribution of food and medical aid once it reaches Afghanistan. India believes such an exercise must be monitored by the UN. Shaheen's remarks also come amid a renewed pitch by the Taliban government in Kabul to seek international legitimacy. The Taliban last week warned the US and others that if their demands for recognition were not met and if Afghan funds abroad remained frozen, it could become a problem not just for the region but the world. "Our message to America is, if unrecognition continues, Afghan problems continue, it is the problem of the region and could turn into a problem for the world," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid was quoted as saying. India withdrew its diplomats from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover of Kabul and has so far ruled out official recognition for the Kabul government saying it's not inclusive. Even Russia, while working closely with the Taliban, has maintained it's in no hurry to recognise the Taliban and will wait to see if they fulfil their pledges. While Pakistan too hasn't officially recognised the Taliban government, it allowed Taliban diplomats to take control of the Afghanistan embassy in Islamabad last week, according to media reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/open-to-receiving-indian-diplomats-humanitarian-aid-taliban/articleshow/87473524.cms||Sachin Parashar

On October 28, additional secretary (exploration) in the ministry Amar Nath wrote to ONGC chairman Subhash Kumar saying the company give away 60% PI (participating interest) in these fields and operatorship to international partners as the current production was low. Mumbai High is the country’s crown jewel and Bassein the largest gas source. The offshore fields together account for 50% of domestic gas and over 23% of oil production. Read AlsoHow Bombay High was almost soldNEW DELHI: But for one man who swam against the tide, ONGC's Bombay High offshore oilfield-which supplies 14 per cent of the country's oil requirement and accounts for almost 38 per cent of all domestic oil production-might have been handed over to a global oil giant.Nath’s letter draws on a move made during Rao’s government when Satish Sharma was the oil minister. On March 31, 2004 TOI had reported how a two-member committee set up in 1992 by ONGC, which was then a commission and the government exerted greater control over it, had recommended handing over Bombay High to another company to operate. That committee was set up to examine a proposal from US exploration major Occidental, which sought to operate the field in return for some investment. The plan was scuttled by a whistleblower. In the latest instance, the sales pitch has been expanded to include Bassein and its satellites. This is the second time since April that Nath, who joined the ministry as joint secretary (exploration) in 2014 and is the longest-serving government director on the ONGC board, has pushed the company to hive off producing fields. He also repeated the recommendation to hive off ONGC’s in-house drilling and technical services departments, which will raise costs and leave the company at the mercy of private service providers. Nath’s main argument is that global majors will be able to raise production from ONGC’s ageing fields with their expertise and technology. In his letter, Nath argues that improving or replacing ageing infrastructure will be a challenge for ONGC as it will not be able to take quick decisions due to the procedural aspects of decision-making. Nath’s letter ignores the fact that the procedural aspects are all set by government statutes in a parliamentary system. He also wrongfully states that ONGC has been able to recover only 45% of the Bassein reserves. The fact is that 65% has been produced from Bassein, the oldest field, while output from satellites was ramped up gradually as they came to production sequentially.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/oil-ministry-tells-ongc-to-cede-mumbai-high-bassein-fields-to-foreign-cos/articleshow/87473405.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||Mumbai||Can’t injunct film release on surmises of copyright infringement, says HC; allows release of Zombivli||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court recently rejected a plea to restrain the release of Zombivli, a Marathi film saying “it is not possible to grant injunctions on surmises or suppositions.” It is a well-known proposition that there is no copyright in an idea and “pleadings must be precise and the facts must be clearly shown,” said Justice Gautam Patel. “When two ideas are developed, there are bound to be similarities. A sure test is to see whether a viewer or reader having seen both works unmistakably concludes that the later work is a copy of the original. Even if the two works are thematically the same, but treated and presented differently, there may be no question of copyright infringement. Incidental co-incidences are not copyright infringement. Infringement is established only by clear and cogent evidence,” said the HC. Tarun Wadwa, an independent filmmaker claimed that Saregama had illicitly used his material to make a Marathi film on zombies. Justice Patel said, “Wadhwa makes two claims. First, that the Defendants (separately, “Saregama Ltd and “Iyer”) illicitly used Wadhwa’s material, communicated in circumstances of confidentiality, to make a Marathi film. Second, that (they) infringed Wadhwa’s copyright in one, or possibly three, published works.” The film in question is called “Zombivli”. “To my very great disappointment, this is not a documentary about town planning in areas to the north of Mumbai. It is described, instead, as something called a ‘ZomCom’. This is explained to be a comedy about ‘zombies’. Though there may be some romantic elements, the film is not portrayed as a ‘ZomRomCom’. That, I am told, would be difficult to imagine,” started out the judgment by Justice Patel. Wadhwa through his counsel Rahul Ajatashatru argued that his work was since April 2018 about zombies and that in May 2018, he even registered a synopsis on ‘Haila! zombie!’ with Screen Writers’ Association (SWA) and then shared it with Saregama through its division, Yoodle Films. He said he was then asked to submit a fully developed and complete screenplay when ready, which Wadhwa had done. He said he did this. Saregama later said that it had no interest in continuing with it. In July 2020, Saregama announced its forthcoming film Zombivli, and Wadhwa said it was based on his submissions. The HC order observed, "We meet here a protagonist, Bhuvan, a brilliant science graduate but unemployed by choice since his career ambition is to become something called a ‘YouTube Star’, or, as Mr Ajatshatru puts it, a ‘YouTuber’. Apparently, this is now an avocation..." Saregama represented by Senior counsel Virag Tulzapurkar and advocate Hiren Kamod argued that there was neither any infringement of copyright nor confidentiality. Kamod, the HC said, told the court “quite authoritatively, that it is ‘well-known’ that a zombie is a re-animated corpse, brought back to some form of locomotion or movement. It has been described as a ‘mythological undead corporeal revenant’, a creature that has no will of its own.” Justice Patel found that the controversy was not over the “question of ‘originality’ in the work per se but the dichotomy between an idea and its expression in copyright law (as distinct from confidentiality law). There is no copyright in an idea. It exists only in a particular expression of an idea, that is to say, how individual elements, none of which are in themselves susceptible to copyright protection, are put together." Noting that there is a distinction between copyright infringement and confidentiality violations the HC said, “Copyright is a right in rem, but a confidence obligation is entirely in personam. Copyright has a statutorily defined term. Confidence does not. There is no copyright except as provided by the statute, and infringement is also prescribed by statute. A confidence obligation is one in contract or equity (or both). There are statutory defences to a copyright infringement action. These do not apply to a breach of confidence action. The distinction between copyright and confidence assumes importance where, say, a manuscript has been submitted for publication. An obligation not to use the submitted manuscript may be implied and enforced under confidence law, and may extend to a plot or a developed idea that may not otherwise be protected by copyright..." The HC said for any allegations of infringement of confidentiality “there must be originality, and there must be completeness. All the required elements of confidentiality must be shown. It is not enough to show only some of them.” Wadhwa immediately had filed an appeal against the October 21 order before a division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav which on October 28 after briefly hearing his counsel Ajatashatru and Saregama senior counsel Tulzapurkar scheduled it for hearing after Diwali vacation on November 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-injunct-film-release-on-surmises-of-copyright-infringement-says-hc-allows-release-of-zombivli/articleshow/87473260.cms||Swati Deshpande

The incident took place on Sunday morning at 9.12am on platform number 4/5 at Kalyan railway station. Jaspal Singh Rathore, CTI Kalyan said, "A married couple was trying to board running Udyan Express train (01301) and fell into the gap between platform and train". An alert on-duty TC, Ranjit Kumar, immediately rushed for help and alerted the passengers inside the train asking them to pull down the chain. The train stopped after a few seconds. However, three to four coaches had passed. Later, Kumar with help of other passengers pulled the couple outside. Miraculously, the couple did not suffer any injuries. Rathore said, "Since both had caught hold of the platform, they survived without any injuries." Another railway official, who did not wish to be named, said, "If TC and other passengers at the station had not rushed immediately for help and stopped train, it could have been fatal for the couple who were stuck inside the gap". A senior railway TC of Central railway said, "It is found that many passengers do not check coach positions in advance boarding train due to which such incidents happen."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/kalyan-alert-tc-passengers-save-couple-from-being-crushed-by-train/articleshow/87473794.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Disciplinary committee chairman and BJP spokesperson Sunil Sethi said that the notice was served to the former MLC after a video went viral on social media in which Randhawa was seen making reckless remarks promoting hatred against a particular community. “This is unacceptable to the party and has brought (us) embarrassment to. Such type of conduct is likely to dent the party’s public image of the party,” Sethi said. As per the notice, J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina had asked the disciplinary committee to initiate proceedings against Randhawa for his offensive conduct. Randhawa was asked to explain his position on the issue within 48 hours besides issuing a public apology. He was also directed against addressing the media till the proceedings were over. Randhawa was earlier served a similar notice after he levelled corruption charges against Union minister Jitendra Singh over the issue of mining policy, over which he had even threatened to immolate himself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-bjp-serves-show-cause-notice-to-ex-mlc-for-hate-speech/articleshow/87473994.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Guwahati||OPD services crippled in Assam as doctors go on strike||GUWAHATI: Largescale protests across districts by the Assam Medical Service Association (AMSA), a leading body of physicians, led to the complete disruption of healthcare service in the outpatient departments (OPD) of hospitals in the state on Monday. Hundreds of OPDs were closed during the prime hours between 8am and 1.30pm, marking the beginning of the three-day OPD boycott programme by AMSA for the non-fulfilment of their demands, including time scale promotion for doctors and regularisation of salaries of senior PG doctors. They said their demands have gone unheard after several rounds of meetings with the state health department and so they have decided to intensify their protests. The boycott programme is being supported by the Indian Medical Association (IMA). “Discrimination against senior doctors cannot be tolerated. We have been raising the issue of junior doctors getting more salaries than PG doctors or specialists since 2013. But the state government’s inability to resolve the issue has compelled us to take extreme steps,” AMSA general secretary, Dr Kanak Ch Talukdar, told TOI. In the morning when thousands of patients were denied treatment and there was chaos in the hospitals, the principal secretary of the state health department, Anurag Goel, called up AMSA asking them to withdraw the strike. Talukdar said a virtual executive body meeting was expected to be convened on Monday evening to discuss the matter. “The principal secretary assured us that the government is committed to finding a solution to our demands,” he said. Talukdar informed that no decision had been taken till the filing of this report to withdraw the OPD boycott programme. AMSA stressed that after serving in the posts of joint directors and sub-divisional medical officers for more than 10 years, many senior doctors have not been promoted. Earlier, on October 19, the OPD boycott call given by AMSA had severely hit the healthcare services in government hospitals. Later in the evening, state health minister Keshab Mahanta invited the doctors’ body for talks but the deadlock persisted. AMSA rued that the minutes of the October 19 meeting did not clearly mention any time frame to address the demands and this led to the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/opd-service-crippled-in-assam-as-doctors-go-on-strike/articleshow/87473989.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief (ENC) C Muralidhar in a letter to KRMB chairman said RDS head works and appurtenant works area were stated as outside AP and Telangana and not included in KRMB’s jurisdiction. RDS project was taken by erstwhile Hyderabad State in terms of June,1944 agreement between Hyderabad and Madras state to utilise Tungabhadra water on par with KC canal. “Project irrigates 5,879 acres in Karnataka, 87,500 acres in Telangana with allocation of 17.10 tmcft by KWDT-1,” ENC said. He said united AP government proposed modernisation of RDS works in 2005 and main canal to utilise allocated quantum of 15.90 tmcft water. Funds were deposited by erstwhile AP to Karnataka to take up modernisation. “Modernisation of anicut is being obstructed by AP government.

---||Mumbai||Cricket matches on big screens at city eateries add to the festive cheer||Two weeks ago, the Maharashtra government revised the 10pm deadline and allowed restaurants and eateries to remain open till midnight. This announcement came just at the right time as the cricket season took off with the T20 World Cup. Being one of the biggest sporting events after the complete reopening of restaurants, bars, clubs and theatres, it added to the much-needed zing to the already prevalent festive cheer in the city. With many restaurants and restobars putting up massive screens — just like in the pre-Covid times — Mumbaikars are seen enjoying the matches while they dine out. ‘There’s a different energy when watching a match with a group’Restaurateur Rachel Goenka, founder and CEO of The Chocolate Spoon Company, believes that there is something special about watching cricket on an extra-large screen. She says, “The World Cup matches are a breath of fresh air and people are enjoying stepping out to watch them. There’s a different energy when watching a match with a group, and we’re seeing that across all our restaurants where we’re screening the matches on projectors.” With the extended deadline and restaurants following SOPs laid down by the government, there is a considerable increase in the number of people going out to eat. Mayank Bhatt, brand head, Social, Impresario Handmade Restaurants, says, “Our restaurant has always been one of the coolest venues for sports viewing across the country.” And the lure of big screens and watching matches with a group of friends, after being in isolation for over a year, is exciting for most Mumbaikars. “I have made plans with my friends for the season already. There are quite a few interesting eateries in the city that we plan to visit to watch matches in groups. Cricket is so much better when you have good food and a bunch of friends to enjoy it with,” says the 28-year-old Bhavin Gada, an executive who’s working from home. ‘With more people now vaccinated, there’s confidence to step out’Rachel says, “We are following all COVID protocols and maintaining social distance. As more people are now vaccinated, there is an increased confidence to step out and that’s an encouraging sign for the festive season.” There are Universal Pass holders going out to enjoy the eateries they have waited to visit for so long. “I began ‘revenge eating’ and dining out compulsively almost as soon as I got both my vaccine shots. And this cricket season, my friends and I have already made plans for cricket-watching on the big screen,” says Shashwat Singh, 30, a medical representative. Cricket and eating out: A match made in heavenZorawar Kalra, managing director, Massive Restaurants, believes cricket is a religion in India and the only form of entertainment more famous than cricket is eating out! “This is a match made in heaven and we are screening the matches across our restaurants around the world. We have special offers during the course of the match, especially when India hits sixes and takes wickets. It helps bring fervour and patriotism in the atmosphere and even the team enjoys this thoroughly,” he says, adding, “We have also seen our bar sales go up significantly.” There are cool deals to welcome patronsThere are restaurants in the city that have curated special editions on their menus, and added exciting on-the-spot offers. Mayank says, “We have added a quirky T-20 spin on our signature cocktail and a host of on-the-spot offers to make the match viewing experience even more memorable.” Amrish Arora from Flamboyante, Cuffe Parade, adds, “People enjoy going out and the matches ensure they have something interesting to watch. This is surely a booster for restaurants and the general mood post the pandemic-induced restrictions.” ‘We are being stringent about safety protocols’Restaurants that are using projectors for viewing matches are expecting more footfall, and they are trying to follow all safety norms. “We are being stringent about the protocols. There are groups of friends coming in to watch the matches together, and we ensure they follow the SOPs,” shares a restaurant owner from the suburbs. “We are taking all precautions like checking temperature, ensuring masks are on, double vaccinations of our servers, etc,” adds Amrish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cricket-matches-on-big-screens-at-city-eateries-add-to-the-festive-cheer/articleshow/87473843.cms||Debarati S Sen

So, if you haven’t bought one yet, take a walk down the street markets that have pretty festive kandeels of every kind. One such place is Kandeel Galli at Mahim, which gets all lit-up for Diwali each year. Shimmering away in different shapesYou'll be spoilt for choice here We caught actress Preeti Jhangiani there, who was browsing for lanterns for her home. She said, “This is my first time at Kandeel Galli and it’s absolutely beautiful. I wanted to buy a lantern and I’m spoilt for choice here as there are so many varieties.” From stars and pretty globes strung up on trees to neon rhombus-like box kandeels placed on the ground and paper kandeels fluttering away, this entire stretch is like a magical fairyland. Make sure you have time on hand to wander around and then make your pick. It doesn’t take long to discover the one of the hottest items here — the akash kandeel — mostly made at home by local folks. Says Nidhi Pokhare, whose stall has been here since the past 18 years, “We have different types of kandeels, some of were made from a factory. But we prepare the akash kandeels at home.” How many do they make a day, we ask? “About 500 if we all sit down together to do that,” she replies. Sari kandeelFor something unique, ask for the sari kandeel. Like its name, it’s made from saris and is sturdier. Informs vendor Mayank Patil, “This kandeel is prepared from cut-piece saris and is made by order. It takes only 25 minutes to create.” Another long-lasting variety is the wooden kandeel, which can also double up as a décor item! Ramdas and Sonali Patil, who have it on display at their stall, say, “This kandeel has two uses. Place a tealight in it for Diwali and use it as a corner piece at home after the festival.” Also popular are the pretty stars made with glimmering foil, ruffled and origami styles, kandeels with a peacock pattern border, round ‘fireball’ kandeels and a few elongated, 3-D style ones, too! ‘This year, business is better and that’s such a good feeling’The run-up to the Festival of Lights usually sees brisk business here, but last year the footfalls had been impacted owing to the pandemic. This year, the local sellers are a hopeful for improved sales. Says Sameer Pagare, “As things are open now, it’s been great to see people shopping for Diwali. We saw more customers towards the weekend and we will have lots of buyers even last minute. It’s a good feeling to see that business is better.” Kids love cartoon character kandeelsAnother lamp seller, who specialises in making lanterns with cartoon characters, adds, “Now let’s look ahead.

---||India||PM Modi resists 2050 net-zero goal pressure, commits to 2070||GLASGOW: India on Monday committed to become a ‘carbon neutral’ country through a ‘net zero’ goal by 2070 with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing this major target at UN climate conference (COP26) and appealing to world leaders to make ‘lifestyle change’ issue a global movement – World LIFE - by shunning “mindless consumption” and adopting mindful utilisation of resources. Hitting out at developed countries for their unfulfilled promises of mobilising climate finance of US$ 100 billion per year by 2020, Modi reminded them of their responsibilities and asked them to mobilise US$ 1 trillion to support developing countries. He said the world cannot achieve newer targets with old goals of climate finance. The announcement of ' net zero' was backed by Modi by spelling out how the country would take four other key steps – climate actions – to achieve ‘net zero’ through a clear timeline for other sectoral targets. Though many developed countries including the US, the UK and EU nations had been pitching for bringing India on board to commit 'net zero' by 2050, the country preferred to meet this goal by 2070 -- 10 years after what the biggest polluter China has committed. India's other goals include a target to have 50% of its total energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030, reducing one billion tonnes of carbon equivalent of greenhouse gases (GHG) from its projected emissions by next nine years, reducing carbon intensity (carbon emission per unit of GDP) by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels, and increasing the share of renewable energy from 450 GW to 500 GW by 2030. Read AlsoIndia says it will go net-zero by 2070, what does it mean?India will achieve the goal of ‘net-zero’ emissions by 2070, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced during his address to world leaders at the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow on Monday. So, what is net-zero? In simple terms, net-zero means that greenhouse gas emissions pumped into theReducing one billion tonnes of GHG is quite substantial, considering the fact that the country's entire GHG inventory is currently less than 3 billion tonnes and it is projected to be 4.5 billion tonnes in 2030. Calling these “five goals” and actions including ‘net zero’ by 2070 a ‘panchamirt’, Modi said it would be India’s contribution to the world for its fight against climate change, and, at the same time, appealed the affluent nations to mobilise US$ one trillion to support developing countries for taking adaptations measures. Modi’s announcement is clearly a marked progress on what India had committed in 2015 as its ‘nationally determined contributions’ (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This would clearly update the country’s NDCs by increasing its previous target of 40% share of non-fossil fuels in total energy mix by 2030 to now 50%; decreasing GHG emissions in absolute terms and increasing the reduction in carbon intensity from 33-35% to 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. Taking up the 'lifestyle' issue which refers to how mindless consumption and extravagant lifestyle of affluent nations is responsible for increasing emission in the atmosphere, Modi in his speech also underlined how India has fulfilled its promises made in the past as well as under the Paris Agreement, but many developed countries have failed to do it despite big promises. He said India was the only country among the major economies which fulfilled its Paris pledges (NDCs) and has been on track to achieve the rest of its goals, and appealed to the developed countries to do so in terms of climate finance and technology transfer. He said India’s contribution in climate change mitigation far outstrips its role in emissions. He said India which has around 17% of the world’s population is responsible for only about 5% of the total emissions. Earlier speaking on the sidelines of the leaders' summit, Modi said adaptation has not found its importance in the global climate debate and negotiations the way the mitigation (emission reduction) has got. Citing examples of how the climate change-linked extreme weather events have been affecting agriculture and farmers over the years, he said adaptation must become the key pillar of the world's fight against climate change. Noting that not giving adaptation an equal importance is an “injustice to developing countries, which are more affected by climate change”, Modi suggested three steps to end such discrepancy. “First, we have to make adaptation a key part of our development policies and projects. Projects like ‘Nal se Jal’- Tap water for all, ‘Swachh Bharat’- clean India Mission and ‘Ujjwala’- clean cooking fuel for all in India, have not only provided adaptation benefit to our needy citizens but have also improved their quality of life," he said, citing examples from India. The Prime Minister said, “Secondly, many traditional communities have adequate knowledge of living in harmony with nature. These traditional practices must be given due importance in our adaptation policies. This flow of knowledge must also be included in the school syllabus so that it is passed on to the new generation. Preservation of lifestyles in compliance with the local conditions can also be an important pillar of adaptation. Third, the methods of adaptation may be local, but backward countries should get global support for them.” He said India had taken the initiative of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) with this very idea of global support for local adaptation, and urged all countries to join this initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-resists-2050-net-zero-goal-pressure-commits-to-2070/articleshow/87474209.cms||Vishwa Mohan

He had appeared before the agency to record his statement around noon three days after the Bombay HC rejected his plea to cancel the agency’s summons in the laundering case filed against him. He had been evading questioning by the ED for months and had exhausted his legal remedies. In the last few months, ED had raided several places to trace Deshmukh, but in vain. Read AlsoPMLA case: Former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh appears before EDFormer state home minister Anil Deshmukh appeared before the enforcement directorate (ED) office at Ballard Estate area of South Mumbai on Monday to record his statement in a money laundering case.ED officials were also surprised with Deshmukh’s move as he appeared before them around noon along with his advocate. The investigating officer started questioning Deshmukh just after his arrival, and the agency’s additional director flew in from Delhi in the evening to supervise the process. Earlier, the ED had arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde for allegedly helping Deshmukh and his son Hrishikesh with money laundering. The ED said Deshmukh, through Shinde, had collected Rs 4.7 crore from (now-dismissed) assistant police inspector Sachin Waze in cash. Waze was then heading the CIU branch of Mumbai police and had collected the money from orchestra bar owners of Mumbai illegally for Deshmukh. Read AlsoMaharashtra: CBI arrests middleman in Anil Deshmukh corruption caseThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Thane resident Santosh Jagtap in a corruption case that the agency is investigating against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.After Deshmukh appeared before the ED, his team released a pre-recorded video message. In it, Deshmukh said ex-Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against him and had now fled the country. In the video, Deshmukh said, “I received ED summons, and the media wrongly reported that I wasn’t cooperating with the probe. Each time after ED summons, I replied to them stating my petition was pending before the HC and SC, after its outcome I would present myself before the ED. Me, my family and our staff cooperated with ED during the probe.” Deshmukh also released an unsigned statement that ED should act in a fair manner. “I’m today appearing before the ED, let the truth prevail, Satyamev Jayate,” he said. He said on account of a “witch-hunt campaign” launched at the instance of vested interests, false allegations have been levelled by persons who have “no credibility, honour or pride.” He said a false narrative has been created that he is evading or avoiding appearing before ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-arrests-former-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-in-a-money-laundering-case/articleshow/87474543.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||India||Green crackers allowed if ambient air quality not poor: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Residents of every Indian city can burst green crackers on Diwali if the ambient air quality remained better than 'poor' category, the Supreme Court said on Monday while setting aside a Calcutta High Court order imposing blanket ban on bursting of crackers exceeding the SC order restraining use of hazardous fireworks, mostly using barium salts. During a special sitting during the Diwali break of the court, a bench of Justices A M Khanwlikar and Ajay Rastogi said, "There cannot be a complete ban (on bursting of crackers). The Supreme Court as well as National Green Tribunal have in numerous orders clarified which crackers can be burst if the ambient air quality remained better than the poor level." Appearing for the PIL petitioner in SC Arjun Gopal and Petitioner before the HC Roshni Ali, advocates Gopal Shankaranarayanan and Rachit Lakhmani argued that the SC had noted in its October 29 order that majority of the cracker manufacturers have labelled their products as green with fake QR code and that the CBI found them to have used banned barium salts in manufacturing the polluting crackers. They said the HC had rightly imposed a blanket ban on bursting of crackers as the festivities in Calcutta was not confined to Diwali only and continued for a month owing to proximate festivals Chhatt, Kali Puja, Govardhan Puja and Christmas. Moreover, the HC has rightly cited the practical difficulties for executive authorities in differentiating between green and hazardous crackers. The bench led by Justice Khanwilkar said, "All states are following the SC order banning use of hazardous and polluting crackers. West Bengal cannot be an exception. This is not a new issue and has been dealt with extensively by both the NGT and SC repeatedly while passing numerous orders. The SC had gone into the practical difficulties and has issued directions to all authorities for effective implementation of its orders. Where is the question of the HC making a different case altogether for West Bengal?" Appearing for West Bengal, senior advocate Anand Grover informed the court that the state has taken strong action against those violating the SC imposed norms by bursting polluting crackers. He said the state police had lodged 190 FIRs last year in this connection and took action against 243 persons. However, the bench asked the state to strengthen vigilance and checking at inter-state border entry points to stop hazardous crackers from being brought into the state. "Markets, traders and dealers are not the places to verify the quality and potency of the crackers," the SC said. For petitioners comprising cracker dealers, senior advocates Sidharth Bhatnagar and malvika Trivedi said that all dealers and traders are ready to give undertaking before the court that they will deal only with green crackers, as has been mandated by the apex court. On October 29, a bench of Justices M R SHah and A S Bopanna had said, "It is made clear that there is no total ban on use of firecrackers. Only those firecrackers are banned, as directed hereinabove, which are found to be injurious to health and affecting the health of the citizens, more particularly the senior citizens and the children." It had said, "Any lapse on the part of the State Governments/State Agencies and Union Territories shall be viewed very seriously and if it is found that any banned firecrackers are manufactured, sold and used in any particular area, the Chief Secretary of the concerned State(s), the Secretary (Homes) of the concerned State(s) and the Commissioner of Police of the concerned area, District Superintendent of Police of the concerned area and the SHO/Police Officer in-charge of the concerned police station shall be held personally liable." On October 23, 2018, the SC, while banning use of barium salts in crackers, had directed, "The crackers with reduced emission (improved crackers) and green crackers only would be permitted to be manufactured and sold... On Diwali days or on any other festivals like Gurupurab, etc., when such fireworks generally take place, it would strictly be from 8 pm till 10 pm only. On Christmas eve and New Year's eve, when such fireworks start around midnight i.e. 12 am, it would be from 11.55 pm till 12.30 am only."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/green-crackers-allowed-if-ambient-air-quality-not-poor-supreme-court/articleshow/87474778.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||India's target of 500 GW renewable energy by 2030 significant contribution to climate goals: Shringla||GLASGOW: Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Tuesday that India's new target of 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2030, announced at the 26th session of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, is a "very significant" contribution to meeting the goals of the climate summit. "The Prime Minister spoke at the summit of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. By all means, this is a very very significant contribution to the overall area of climate change and in meeting the goals of the summit, considering that India comprises one-sixth of humanity," Shringla said in a briefing about India's National Statement at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow. Foreign Secretary also informed that PM Modi at COP 26 announced that by 2030, 50 per cent of India's energy needs would be met from renewable energy sources. "In Paris, our nationally determined contribution said that 40 per cent of our installed electricity would come from non-fossil fuel energy sources. The PM today announced that by 2030, 50 per cent would be met with renewable energy. So that's a significant announcement again," he said. The Prime Minister also stated that India will reduce its carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes from now until 2030, Foreign Secretary said. "Again one of the Nationally Determined Contribution announced in Paris was the emissions intensity of our economy would be reduced between 33 and 35 per cent by 2030, this is over 2005 levels. The Prime Minister today said that this would be reduced by 45 per cent. And for the first time, India has spoken about net-zero by 2070," he said. Shringla said that Prime Minister Modi delivered "a seminal statement" at the COP and highlighted the range and depth of climate actions taken by India along with future goals that the country has set for itself. "The highlight of the day was the Prime Minister's National Statement on COP26. You would all agree this is a seminal statement. This is a very significant contribution by India towards global action on the climate change agenda," Shringla said at a press briefing. "It (speech by PM Modi) not only highlights the range and depth of climate actions taken by India but also future goals that India has set for herself," he added. During his COP26 address on Monday, Prime Minister Modi announced five "amrit tatva" including the target to attain net-zero emissions by 2070. He stated that India is the only major economy that has worked and delivered on the Paris commitments both in letter and spirit. The high-level segment of COP26 is titled the World Leaders' Summit (WLS) and is being attended by heads of state or government of more than 120 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-target-of-500-gw-renewable-energy-by-2030-significant-contribution-to-climate-goals-shringla/articleshow/87474855.cms||---

PM Modi thanked his Australian counterpart and “dear friend” Scott Morrison for “recognition of India’s Covaxin.” “It is an important step forward in the post-Covid partnership between India and Australia,” he said. While WHO emergency use listing for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine is awaited, 16 countries have so far recognised Covaxin for travel purposes. These include Australia, Estonia, Greece, Iran, Mauritius, Mexico, Nepal, Oman, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Australia’s high commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell on Monday tweeted that the country’s drug regulator has “determined that Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech) vaccine would be ‘recognised’ for the purpose of establishing a traveller’s vaccination status. Importantly, recognition of Covaxin, along with the previously announced recognition of Covishield (manufactured by AstraZeneca), means many Indian citizens, as well as other countries, will now be considered fully vaccinated on entry to Australia.” The Australian health ministry website says the “recognition is for travellers aged 12 and over who have been vaccinated with Covaxin.” Sources at Bharat Biotech told TOI that the company had been submitting rolling data to Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) over the past couple of months, and this has culminated in the recognition. “Similarly, the company has been submitting data to regulators of many other countries to facilitate recognition of the vaccine to ease travel barriers for those who have taken Covaxin,” the source added.

Data released by the finance ministry on Monday showed GST receipts in October were 24% higher than the revenues in the same month last year, and 36% over 2019-20. Revenues from import of goods was 39% higher, and revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) were 19% more than the revenues from these sources during October 2020, the finance ministry said in a statement. This is the fourth straight month of receipts crossing Rs 1 lakh crore. The highest collection so far was in April this year. “This is very much in line with the trend in economic recovery. This is also evident from the trend in the e-way bills generated every month since the second wave,” the finance ministry said. “The revenues would have still been higher if the sales of cars and other products had not been affected on account of disruption in supply of semiconductors.” Since the lifting of curbs after the second Covid-19 wave, revenues have been robust, thanks to the economic rebound. The ministry said the mop-up has also been aided by the efforts of the state and central tax administration, resulting in increased compliance over previous months. It said that in addition to action against individual tax evaders, this has been a result of the multipronged approach followed by the GST Council. Measures taken to ease compliance include nil filing through text messages, enabling the quarterly return monthly payment (QRMP) system and auto-population of returns. “Overall, the impact of these efforts has ensured increased compliance and higher revenues... more steps to restrict fake ITC (input tax credit) are under consideration of the GST Council,” the ministry’s statement said. In the past year, GSTN — the IT backbone — has augmented the system capacity considerably to improve user experience. The council has also taken various steps to discourage non-compliant behaviour, like blocking of e-way bills for non-filing of returns, system-based suspension of registration of taxpayers who have failed to file six returns in a row and blocking of credit for return defaulters. Economists expect the healthy trend to persist in the months ahead. “The six-month high GST collections of October 2021 are a reflection of the healthy pickup in GST e-way bills in September 2021, led by pre-festive season stocking, as well as improved compliance,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA. “With the October 2021 GST e-way bills expected to exceed the level seen in the previous month, the headline GST collections are slated to remain healthy in a range of Rs 1.25-1.35 trillion in November 2021. Overall, we expect CGST collections to exceed the government FY2022 budget estimate of Rs 5.3 trillion by up to Rs 500 billion. “Although the supply issues related to semiconductor availability could continue to constrain the performance of GST compensation cess, we do not expect the budget estimate of Rs 1 trillion to be missed, with Rs 0.6 trillion already raised in the first seven months of this fiscal,” said Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/october-gst-collections-at-1-3-lakh-crore-second-highest-ever/articleshow/87474959.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Avail 30 transport services from home in Karnataka||BENGALURU: In what could spell relief for motorists in the state, the government on Monday launched contactless/faceless transport services. The initiative includes 30 transport services, including 19 Vahan (to do with vehicle registration) and 11 Sarathi (driving licence). Transport department officials said this will reduce crowding at RTOs by around 70% and save around 70 crore papers per year. CM Basavaraj Bommai said nearly 60 lakh people visit RTOs across the state in one year. “With this move, the number of those visiting RTOs will reduce,” he said, adding they have now given authority to dealers to register new vehicles online to reduce delay. “We will give permission to 10 dealers first. Based on the pilot, it will be extended across the state,” the CM said. The TOI report, ‘Six months on, transport dept yet to adopt contactless services’ (September 28), had detailed the consequences of delay in implementing Aadhaar authentication-based contactless services. Officials said the services (see box) include issuance of learner’s licence, registration of motor vehicle with fully built body, change of name in LL, transfer of ownership of motor vehicle, issuance of duplicate registration certificate and change of address in RC. Senior IAS officer convinced CM?In March 2021, MORTH issued a notification listing several transport-related services that can be availed via Aadhaar authentication without visiting RTOs. Sources said a section of officials in the transport department was reluctant to implement the move in Karnataka. However, sources said Rajender Kumar Kataria, principal secretary, transport department, convinced the CM. “Citizens will be able to avail these services from the comfort of their homes. This will reduce crowding at RTOs,” said Kataria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/avail-30-transport-services-from-home/articleshow/87475176.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||India needs ease of doing research & science funding framework: Gagandeep Kang||BENGALURU: Reiterating that funding for science research in India is insufficient, microbiologist and virologist Gagandeep Kang said the country lacks a coherent framework for science funding. “A lot of money goes into creating PhDs, but there is no mechanism to ascertain what kind of research actually happens,” she told TOI. Kang was in Bengaluru ahead of the Infosys Science Foundation annual science awards, where she is the chief guest this year. Kang also urged the government to focus on creating ease of doing research. “...Understanding what research funding is going for is important. A lot of government funding goes to institutions which have a mission to produce PhD students. Now, increasing the number of PhDs is obviously important but it’s also important to see where those PhDs land up and whether their scientific education is used for the purpose for which it is intended, and then think about whether the funding that we are providing is truly fit for our purposes or not,” Kang said. It is imperative, therefore, to think about what goes into education, what goes directly into research, what goes into basic research, what goes into applied research. “All of this is important and we don’t have an overall framework. That’s what I’ve been asking for — a funding strategy, and we don’t really have that at the moment,” she said. Pointing out that unfortunately, our educational system tends to make science a subject that’s difficult to get very excited about, she said what we really need is people with passion and people that are willing to engage for the long term. “The recognition that science is for the long haul and that you may have occasional successes along the way, but most likely what you are doing will pay off only in a very long term is not something that we are entirely ready for in every field. Some fields have been able to build themselves up to get there, but many fields have not,” Kang said. She further said that thinking global when it comes to research is feasible, but what requires fixing in some areas of Indian research is the ease of doing research. Citing her own example — she is still filing reports for a small grant she had availed in 2006 — Kang said the requirements that a lot of research funding agencies have in India, keeps researchers occupied with just the paperwork for years. “I think the government needs to think about what the costs of all these over burdensome requirements are. It really stops people from doing something that is productive. There are also barriers to international collaboration, less in industry and quite high in some areas of academia. The government really needs to think about not just funding the research, but also about not blocking people from doing research. There are aspects that can be addressed to make things easier without necessarily putting more money behind it, though that would be welcome as well,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/india-needs-ease-of-doing-research-science-funding-framework-gagandeep-kang/articleshow/87475178.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Doorstep delivery of 58 govt services launched in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The government on Monday launched doorstep delivery of 58 government services in Bengaluru under the Janasevaka programme to commemorate the 66th Kannada Rajyotsava. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai inaugurated the programme in Malleswaram constituency, saying the government will expand it across the state from January 26, 2022. Started on a pilot basis in 2019, the initiative was extended to four constituencies in the city — Dasarahalli, Bommanahalli, Rajajinagar and Mahadevapura — and then to Yeshwantpur in January 2021. The pilot project has seen 93,000 applications raised till date. It was put on hold during the pandemic and was resumed earlier this year. On Monday, it was rolled out across 27 segments in Bengaluru (excluding Anekal) with services being provided by six major departments. The agencies include revenue department, BBMP and Karnataka building and other construction workers welfare board, and the services include police verification, Karnataka Arogya health card, senior citizens card and APL card. The services will be provided on all days (8am to 8 pm) at a delivery cost of Rs 115 (excluding departmental service charges). Citizens can contact the Janasevaka call centre at 080-44554455 or use the mobile app Mobile One. They can also log on to www.janasevaka.karnataka.gov.in. Bommai said the Janasevaka concept also involves delivering ration to BPL families at their doorsteps. “The programme is the beginning of Karnataka government’s efforts to minimise the bureaucracy-driven service delivery system, wherein the common man had to pay more than the actual service cost to get his or her work done,” he said. Doorstep delivery of ration will be extended to all 28 assembly constituencies in Bengaluru Urban, including 198 municipal wards, the CM said.

---||Bengaluru||Many throng Jayadeva hospOPD to check heart health||Bengaluru: Close on the heels of Sandalwood star Puneeth Rajkumar’s death, there is a sharp rise in the number of youngsters seeking basic cardiac medical tests at the government-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research (SJICSR) here. The hospital had 1,600 people visiting its OPD on Monday, against a normal day’s turnout of 1,200.According to Dr CN Manjunath, director, SJICSR, healthy individuals seeking tests and check-ups over the last three days seems to have been triggered by Puneeth’s death. While the numbers at the OPD started seeing a rise on October 30 itself, there was huge rush on Monday. “These are panic visits and knee-jerk reactions. It’s not enough if such an evaluation is done once. One has to be cautious. Following Puneeth’s death, there is a 20-25% increase in OPD visits,” said Dr Manjunath.Dr Manjunath suggested people with a strong family history of heart ailments and multiple risk factors like smoking and diabetes go for a CT-Coronary angiogram, an imaging test that looks at the arteries that supply blood to the heart. “It can indicate cholesterol and calcium deposits in the artery, if any. If there is calcium deposition in the artery, it means that the cardiac disease has begun. However, CT-Coronary angiogram should not be repeated annually as it is a source of radiation,” he said, adding that it is reserved only for those who have multiple risk factors and are considered high-risk and vulnerable. Incidentally, 275 people sought master health check-ups that includes all blood investigations and treadmill tests at the hospital on Monday. The hospital usually sees nearly 175 persons seeking master health check-ups daily. The hospital’s staff also said that because of huge crowd, Covid-appropriate behaviour too went for a toss. A similar trend was seen in Mysuru and Kalaburagi units of the hospital too. The Mysuru OPD had 1,000 people seeking consultations on Monday, as against the usual 600-700.While private hospitals did not seen such huge crowds, doctors at Manipal Hospitals admitted that they did come across specific cases of healthy individuals wanting to get checked to ensure they were fine. Dr Ranjan Shetty, interventional cardiologist, Manipal Hospitals, said 15 youngsters from the age group 20-40 years appeared slightly panicky and underwent tests like CT-Coronary angiogram. “It is good to be aware of health status, but it has to be sustained and not be a reaction to one incident. It is important to lead a healthy lifestyle,” said Dr Shetty. “For a week, youngsters will rush in and then they forget it all,” he said, adding that a similar trend was seen when actor Sidharth Shukla died in September at a young age following heart attack. No such significant rise was seen in people seeking cardiac consultations at Narayana Health, the hospital said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/many-throng-jayadeva-hospopd-to-check-heart-health/articleshow/87475187.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Auto drivers in Bengaluru say LPG rate doubled in 16 months, yet no revision in fares||BENGALURU: Autorickshaw drivers in the city want a fare revision, given the rapid rise in LPG cost after a financially difficult year because of the pandemic. The price of auto LPG has gone up from Rs 58.18 a litre last month to Rs 66 a litre on November . In May 2020, the price was Rs 32.51 a litre, which means an increase of Rs 33.4 a litre in 16 months. “This month, the price of auto LPG went up by Rs 9.7 a litre, compared to October. Our business has declined after Covid and the fare is not being revised. How are we going to survive?” said C Sampath, general secretary of Adarsh Autorickshaw Taxi Drivers’ Union. Autorickshaw union members said fares in districts such as Udupi and Davanagere have already been revised but it has not been done in Bengaluru since 2013. They said the government was not giving them any subsidy to shift to environment-friendly and cheaper alternatives such as electric or CNG autos. In December 2013, the auto fare was raised to a minimum of Rs 25 for the first 1.9km and Rs 13 for every subsequent kilometre. Now, the Road Transport Authority has proposed increasing the minimum charge to Rs 30 and Rs 16 for every subsequent kilometre. Department officials said the proposal to revise the fare is with the transport minister and he is yet to take a decision. The price of a commercial 19-kg LPG cylinder has also gone up by Rs 266 from Monday. This will particularly affect restaurants, eateries and tea stalls in the city that use commercial cylinders. A 19-kg commercial cylinder will cost Rs 2,062.50. Ramesh Kumar, secretary of the All India LPG Distributors Federation, said: “Normally, rates of commercial cylinders are being revised by Rs 50-100 a month but this is a steep hike. After Deepavali, prices of domestic cylinders will also increase further.” The price of a domestic LPG cylinder is already high. A 14.2-kg cylinder in the city cost Rs 902.5 in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/auto-drivers-say-lpg-rate-doubled-in-16-months-yet-no-revision-in-fares/articleshow/87475204.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Soro keen to tap players’ enthusiasm||Bengaluru: Talk of water sports in the country, the first thought drifts to swimming thanks to Srihari Nataraj and Sajan Prakash, who made the ‘A’ cut for the recent Tokyo Olympics. In contrast, water polo has gradually faded into the background but there is no denying India’s history in the discipline.India was once an Asian powerhouse, winning the gold in the 1951 Asian Games and making the podium on two more occasions at the quadrennial event with a silver in 1970 and a bronze at home in the 1982 Asiad. The downfall began thereafter and the men’s team haven’t made it to the Asiad since 1986.The women’s team, on the other hand, made its only appearance in 2010 in Guangzhou, finishing last among four teams. Water polo for women was introduced in that edition of the Games and India’s participation was courtesy China, who urged and supported Swimming Federation of India (SFI) to field a team because without a minimum of four teams the event would have been scrapped.After decades of lull, the SFI has decided to revive the sport in the country. To start with, Serbia’s two-time Olympic medallist Slobodan Soro has been roped in as a consultant. It is hardly surprising that SFI has turned to a Serbian to resuscitate the sport — they are the reigning Olympic men’s champions and the U-21 World Champions.But the process of getting water polo back on its feet will be a long-drawn process with both players and officials needing to start from scratch.Assessing the level of the players in the country, the Soro, 42, pointed out, “The timeline of water polo has changed from the mid-80s. Europeans became professional and countries like India lost out. The level is low. I understand the situation, it's not easy to have a higher level because of the conditions for the players and infrastructure. But I see the players are enthusiastic, they want to play and there is passion for the game.”But Soro, who retired as a player recently, was quick to add that there is hope. “With goodwill, energy and time there can be good results. India were winning medals at the Asian Games in the 80s, so there is some tradition.”Outlining the challenges of the sport, Soro said, “It's a unique sport, all the muscle groups used during the matches are different. You must learn specific movements and practise that muscle group, it is complicated. Even Neeraj Chopra won't be able to throw the ball more than 10m in the water. It's a team sport, physically and mentally a tough sport.” Soro, who was in the city last week to scout for talent at the Nationals for next year’s Asian Games camp said he was looking at getting on board coaches from Serbia to train the players.“My idea is to bring someone working with the junior team to start from the beginning and teach them to understand the game better. There is not much time before Asian Games but we will do our best to improve the Indian level."Plans are on to send the probables to Serbia. “Coming to Serbia for training camp, one of the main ideas is playing with Serbian teams — young kids or second division — so that they can have more games and that is the best way to improve skills, tactics and physical condition,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/soro-keen-to-tap-players-enthusiasm/articleshow/87475273.cms||Manuja Veerappa

Karnataka got off to a slow and shaky start with opener S Shubha (8) being dismissed in the seventh over. Vrinda (104) and Divya (54; 61b, 9x4) then stitched together a 113-run association for the second wicket to put Karnataka back on track. Vrinda's 113-ball innings was highlighted by nine hits to the fence. Karnataka lost a couple of quick wickets in the middle, but Prathyusha's unbeaten 30-ball 40 (7x4) and Shreyanka Patil (31 n.o, 21b, 6x4) added momentum to their innings.In reply, Pondicherry lost wickets in quick succession. By the 12th over they were reduced to 14/5 but dour resistance from Rebecca (79-ball 27) delayed the inevitable. The Pondicherry scoreboard would have been poorer if not for the 17 wides conceded by the bowling unit. For Karnataka, medium-pacer returned 3 for 9 in nine overs, while another medium-pacer Rameshwari collected 3 for 16 in 10 overs. Leggie C Prathyusha too accounted for three wickets.

---||India||WhatsApp hackers busted by Delhi police unit, Nigerian held||NEW DELHI: A syndicate that was hacking into mobile devices and WhatsApp accounts of people using custom-made malware has been busted by the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Op (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police. The mastermind of the syndicate, sources said, had recently hacked the WhatsApp account of a senior bureaucrat following which a full-fledged investigation was launched. According to DCP (IFSO) KPS Malhotra, the mastermind of the module, identified as Chimelum Emmanuel Aniwetalu alias Maurice from Nigeria, has been arrested. His associate has also been identified and raids are on to nab him. “The syndicate was sending malware through WhatsApp and thereby accessing call logs, SMSs and contacts and control of the targeted WhatsApp account. After hacking the account, they would pose as the original WhatsApp account holder and communicate with the contact list thereby further hacking into more contacts,” DCP Malhotra said. The gang not only blackmailed the victims using their WhatsApp chat content but also made distress calls to demand money on various pretexts from their contacts. The syndicate had been operating from Delhi and Bangalore. “We had received a complaint that a person’s mobile phone was hacked by some unknown persons. Taking over the control of the WhatsApp of the complainant, they started demanding money from the contact list of the complainant by sending various distress messages. The accused had also provided a bank account to the contacts of the complainant for transferring the money," DCP Malhotra said. An FIR was registered at IFSO and a team comprising ACP Raman Lamba and inspectors Vijay Gahlawat and Bhanu Pratap was formed to investigate the case. Technical investigation comprising analysis of IP addresses (IP-DR) and human intelligence led to the identification of one of the accused who was apprehended during a raid. A laptop and 15 phones were seized from him. The analysis of the seized laptop reveals that the gang used applications to design and spread various malware links. The accused had sent specially-designed malware disguised as application to the victim’s devices. “The accused created a dedicated application for each victim which when downloaded and installed on the victim’s phone, sent contacts, call logs and SMSs on the accused’s server,” DCP Malhotra further said. During interrogation and forensic analysis of the devices, it was revealed that the accused had various modus operandi — most prominent of them being impersonating a girl and befriending men on various social media profiles. Once they had established trust, the gang would then send a link to let him or her join a group of like-minded friends. “Once the person clicked on that link, he or she would lose the control over their social media profiles. Thereafter, the gang used to operate the social media accounts to make money,”the DCP added. Mastermind Maurice has been found overstaying in the country even after the expiry of his tourist Visa in 2018. The inquiry also suggested that he was duping people on pretext of selling herbal seeds online. He also befriended elderly men by posing as women from foreign countries. The suspect, cops said, has created a fake document calling himself a UN-approved asylumseeker. In this regard, a separate case has been registered at Mohan Garden police station. The house owner, who had rented his premises to the foreigner, has also been booked. “Delhi Police appeals to people for being cautious while communicating on social media and avoid clicking on any random web link or URL sent on any social media platform,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-hackers-busted-by-delhi-police-unit-nigerian-held/articleshow/87475217.cms||Raj Shekhar

According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the business development cell has been assigned with the task to explore market for the products and goods for the business community of the state. Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Bihar Industries Association have been roped in to help railways in transporting goods outside the state faster under the ‘destination to destination’ loading and unloading policy, he said. Under the new goods transportation policy, aggregators will approach businessmen either involved in household production or transporting raw materials from Bihar to other parts of the country, he said, adding that the Patliputra Industrial Area, Fatuha, Biharsharif and Nawada have been the main places from where goods are transported in large quantities. Railways has allotted a space for the kiosk to the aggregators at Patna Junction. Besides, railways has floated a tender for auctioning at least 150 compartments of the luggage vans in 49 passenger trains. The loading points are Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur station, the CPRO said, adding railways will then easily transport goods to places like Delhi, Mumbai, Howrah, Bengaluru, Pune, Secunderabad, Chennai and Ahmedabad. According to Kumar, railways has decided to carry trolleys of parcel goods through separate pathways being built at Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Patliputra Junction and Danapur station. Segregated pathways are being built over railway tracks at east and west ends of Patna Junction to ensure smooth movement of parcel trolleys from one platform to another, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-sets-up-biz-devpt-cell-in-danapur-divn/articleshow/87471099.cms||Kumod Verma

Walking through a stretch of six kilometres along the river from the Collectorate to Gai ghat, the DM found about 50% of the lights non-functional and immediately directed the general manager of PESU to get them repaired and ensure that the transformers work properly. He also ordered immediate cleaning of steps as the receding water level of the river has left piles of silt. Since the festival is likely to witness congregation of thousands of people, he instructed the officials to put up signage at all important places. The majority of 45 permanent toilets were found in deplorable condition. Many had their water taps missing while others were without doors. Irked over the condition, the DM asked the PMC officials to make them in working conditions within two days. Finding Anta ghat as dangerous, Chandrashekhar ordered putting up red curtain and signage as a dangerous site for people to avoid it. He also found slabs of some minor drains damaged and directed their repair at the earliest. He also ordered immediate repair of potholes at Gandhi ghat. “From November 7, altogether 45 tankers will supply Ganga water in all the localities of the town to help the devotees get the holy water for performing the Chhath rituals. These tankers will also fill water in dozens of ponds and water bodies being spruced up for Chhath Puja. He said, a Chhath app with details of all facilities and number of officials to be contacted would be activated soon. The DM said all the magistrates deputed at ghats were directed to monitor the development works both at ghats and approach roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-directs-pesu-to-repair-all-lights-along-ganga-ghats/articleshow/87471086.cms||VK Tripathi

The CM received the guard of honour from state police department and paid floral tributes to freedom fighter Potti Sriramulu, whose highest sacrifice, he recalled, resulted in the formation of the state in 1953. Later, Andhra state was merged with Telangana region to form Andhra Pradesh in 1956. Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan also paid rich tributes to Sriramulu. “Andhra Pradesh is enriched with abundant natural resources and fertile lands with conducive agro-climatic conditions. The state is one of the largest producers and exporters of marine products, accounting for 40% of the country’s exports and stood first in the country in export of marine products in volume and revenue in 2020-21, despite the difficult conditions created by the pandemic,” the governor said. The chief minister later conducted a review meeting on agriculture at his Tadepalli camp office. Directing officials to bring in a strict policy for paddy procurement, he asked them to ensure that it is done right at the farm gates through rythu bharosa kendras (RBKs). He also emphasised on transparent procedure for paddy procurement without any irregularities to provide remunerative price to farmers. “There should be no involvement of millers in paddy procurement and officials should keep tabs on payments, irregularities, e-kyc, and e-crop booking to make timely payments based on Aadhaar numbers. Create awareness through agriculture advisory boards and volunteers by distributing pamphlets to every farmer and displaying the details of the procurement in every RBK. Paddy procurement should be done in front of farmers through RBKs and strict measures should be taken to ensure transparency in checking the grain quality,” he said. The government is moving with a new approach to benefit farmers in achieving good returns, Jagan said. “All farmers should receive minimum support price without any exceptions and appropriate steps should be taken to increase awareness of farmers on paddy procurement,” the CM added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-ap-marks-formation-day-cm-remembers-sriramulus-sacrifice/articleshow/87473243.cms||Gopi Dara

Responding to media query after ‘Janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme, said though majority of civil and police officers were performing well and catching those involved in spurious liquor trade, it was difficult to claim that everything would be okay. I always say certain people, either in the government or private sector, have a tendency to committing something wrong,” he said. The Nitish government banned alcohol across the state on April 5, 2016. When asked that around 70 people died due to consuming spurious liquor in Bihar since January this year despite prohibition, Nitish said, “Such incidents (hooch deaths) are happening because people are getting indulged in drinking wrong things despite the state government’s severe and repeated warning that liquor is bad for health.” Nitish said the total prohibition was enforced on the women’s demand and the state legislature unanimously passed the law. All legislators and government servants had taken a pledge to support liquor ban. “I will once again call upon people not to consume liquor as it is a dirty thing,” the CM said. Nitish, however, avoided direct reply to a question on rising inflation because of the frequent increase in the prices of petroleum products. “It is a countrywide phenomenon. It is not a Bihar specific issue,” Nitish said. Earlier, the CM heard the grievances of altogether 187 people who had come to the janata darbar programme from different districts. Nitish asked the officials concerned to look into their complaints and take appropriate steps to resolve them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/liquor-smugglers-are-being-punished-cm/articleshow/87472117.cms||Madan Kumar

Reviewing the status of MGNREGS-related works here, Nitish also asked the officials to ensure timely wage payment to labourers engaged under the scheme. The CM also reviewed the ongoing works under the Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Abhiyan and asked the officials to expedite works. He also instructed the officials concerned regarding the budget, expenditure and progress of works under the MGNREGS. “During the Covid-19 period last year, a large number of people were provided employment under the MGNREGS. Labourers are paid directly through the direct benefit transfer (DBT),” Nitish said. Earlier, RDD’s principal secretary Arvind Kumar Choudhary informed the CM about the works taken up under the MGNREGS, its budget and the status of expenditure. He said altogether 10.37 crore man-days have so far been created against the budget of 20 crore man-days sanctioned by the Centre for financial year 2021-22. Choudhary also informed him that payments to labourers have been made till August. CM’s principal secretary Deepak Kumar, chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, additional chief secretary (finance) S Siddhartha and the CM’s principal secretary Chanchal Kumar attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/seek-addl-funds-from-centre-under-mgnregs-says-cm/articleshow/87472147.cms||Madan Kumar

The registrar general also submitted a memo with details of ‘Punch Prabhakar’ and the objectionable comments made by him after a recent hearing of the high court. While the CBI, which is probing the matter of objectionable comments made against judges and judiciary by some people on social media, had submitted in the earlier hearing they do not have details of Prabhakar, the HC registrar general submitted his address, place of work, phone number and e-mail. In the suo moto contempt petition, advocate general S Sriram told the bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice K Lalitha that there is no dispute about the fact that some individuals made objectionable comments against the judiciary. He said some of them have tendered an unconditional apology and some others have filed affidavits in the matter, while notices have also been served through newspaper advertisement to those who did not receive the notices physically.

Taking up suo moto contempt for non-implementation of orders in the petition seeking removal of other structures within the premises of educational institutions, the high court made serious observations for utilising the services of teachers for other works. Justice Battu Devanand said teachers are being used to maintain stock records of eggs and also cleaning of toilets. “Teachers are doing all works of the government other than teaching students. Poor students in government schools will be the ultimate sufferers,” he observed. The court, after hearing a batch of petitions filed challenging the construction of rythu bharosa kendras, village and ward secretariats in premises of schools, directed the government to remove all offices not connected to the educational institutions. Justice Devanand observed that the municipal administration department acted promptly and removed the offices from schools. “But panchayat raj and school education departments are still passing on the blame to each other as if they are not responsible,” he said. Advocate general S Sriram urged the court to give one last chance to officials for complying with orders. He suggested special government pleader C Sumon file a joint status report by the school education, panchayat raj and municipal administration departments.

---||Chandigarh||Cong hiked tariff, rolled back only 35% of it: Akalis||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has accused Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi of defrauding Punjabis by merely rolling back 35% hike in power tariff which had been affected during the Congress regime. The opposition party said the state government would still be taking Rs 3,791 crore more from power consumers by reducing power tariff by Rs 3 per unit instead of implementing the 800 units per bill cycle free power commitment of the SAD-BSP alliance. SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the two separate events at the Punjab Bhawan addressed by the chief minister and at the Congress Bhawan by state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu were a testament to the real intentions of the Congress government. “Sidhu has exposed the Congress government by telling that it only wants to fool people during the last two months in office, besides asking the government to specify from where it would come up with the money to honour its promise,” said Cheema. The chief minister should clarify his stand to his own state party chief if not to the opposition, he added. The Akali leader said the chief minister announced that people would believe him only if they were able to get one subsidised bill during the remaining part of the Congress government. The state government departments alone owe Rs 2,231 crore to PSPCL, indicating that the additional revenue has been frittered away due to corruption and mismanagement. Cheema also asked Channi to clarify how he proposed to implement his promise as the latest announcement had raised the subsidy bill to Rs 13,934 crore. Cheema asked the chief minister to take decision regarding cancellation of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) of private thermal companies. He said the cancellation of GVK’s PPA was irrelevant because the company had collapsed and had become a non-performing asset. He said the government had promised to take administrative action by cancelling the other PPAs, but the chief minister was now talking of taking the issue to the legislative assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-hiked-tariff-rolled-back-only-35-of-it-akalis/articleshow/87474187.cms||---

The value of transactions has risen by more than Rs 1 lakh crore on a month-on-month basis. This has made the figure the highest UPI payments recorded in a month in this fiscal year. The volume of transactions rose 15% to 421 crore, from 365 crore in previous month, according to the National Payments Corporation of India’s monthly transaction data on the Unified Payments Interface. In India, it is all about festivals for the month of October, where this time period also drives the highest value and volume of digital transactions in the country. “UPI has seamlessly integrated with all forms of payments such as scan & pay, Pay to Contact, online shopping, BillPay, IPOs & investments. Not surprising that we see month-on-month growth, and we recorded nearly a 3x growth in UPI Pay to Contact in the Kotak mobile banking app over the last quarter,” said Kotak Mahindra Bank president & chief digital officer Deepak Sharma. From March to September 2021, the average monthly growth rate of UPI transactions was about 5.8%. And for the October month, it was up 17% MoM, as compared to the 2.3% rise seen in September. In the same period, the average ticket size of UPI transactions saw a marginal increase of Rs 1,832 from Rs 1,792. And on a year-on-year basis, the UPI transaction volume has more than doubled, as compared to Rs 3.86 lakh crore in October, 2020. Its value of transaction grew more than double, as compared to 207 crore a year ago. With more kirana stores adopting offline digital payment options, a recent research conducted by ACI Worldwide and YouGov said it has found that digital payments continue to be most preferred payment method of choice for festive season spending, comfortably ahead of cash and debit and credit card payments.And other modes of digital payments like Immediate Payments Service (IMPS) have also touched an all-time high both in terms of number and value of transactions, at 43 crore transactions worth Rs 3.70 lakh crore in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/upi-transactions-over-100bn-in-oct/articleshow/87474515.cms||Mamtha Asokan

During January to October of 2021, PE-VC firms have already invested a total of almost $60 billion compared to $40 billion in the whole of 2020. While Hexaware’s $3-billion investment from Carlyle and Tata Group’s fundraise of $1 billion for its EV business contributed 40% of the month’s total tally, investments by PE firms in new IPL franchises also made up around $1.7 billion of the total value as CESC Ventures poured $946 million in the Lucknow franchise and CVC Capital invested $751 million in the Ahmedabad team. The number of mega deals (deals over $100 million in value) grew 5x in October to 19 compared to 4 in the same month last year and 10 in September. Private markets are enjoying the momentum of a hot funding market which has led to a marked rise in average deal sizes across stages and we have also seen consumer tech startups close large and multiple rounds in the year in follow-on funding, Arun Natarajan, founder and MD, Venture Intelligence, said.As per Venture Intelligence’s data, average deal size at the growth stage (Series C to Series D funding of institutional investments) grew to $10 million in October from $6 million in the same period last year. Similarly, late stage companies continue to gain the most out of the unprecedented rise in liquidity. Investments in such firms clocked $1.6 billion in October, a 4X rise from September. Byju’s, for instance, has raised close to $1.6 billion across three deals this year. Social commerce startup Meesho has seen its valuation double in less than six months as it raised almost $870 million this year.IT/ITeS businesses emerged as the biggest gainers of the tailwinds of the pandemic and made up almost 60% of the total investment by PE-VC firms in October at $5.9 billion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-10bn-pe-vcs-put-8x-more-in-oct/articleshow/87474521.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

In addition, there are first-time investors in the country, including funds that are focused on the technology sector. The anchor round, which is bigger than many of the recent initial public offerings (IPOs), will open and close on November 3. The company’s IPO will open immediately after Diwali on November 8 and close on November 10. The shares are expected to list a week later.

The company will be selling shares in a price band of Rs 2,080-2,150. Stock markets have seen a strong rally following better-than-expected results of companies in the second quarter and improving macro numbers. But recent days have been volatile after indications from the RBI that it will begin to normalise liquidity in the market even as it continues with its accommodative stance. In the current week, the mood of the markets is expected to be influenced by the outcome of the US Fed’s forthcoming meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/blackrock-gic-cppib-in-paytm-anchor-round/articleshow/87474467.cms||---

The day’s gains came on the back of strong global cues and also news that GST collections during October was Rs 1.3 lakh crore, the second-highest figure on record. A section of the market players, however, believed that Monday’s rally was more technical in nature, which came after three consecutive sessions of fall that had wiped off over 2,000 points from the index. The day’s lower closing came on the back of a Rs 202-crore net selling by foreign funds, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 116 crore, BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-gains-832-pts-after-3-days-of-loss/articleshow/87474285.cms||---
---||Patna||4 SIMI men get death for 2013 Modi rally blasts, jail for 5||PATNA: A special NIA court on Monday awarded death sentence to four members of banned terror outfit SIMI for triggering serial blasts that killed six persons and injured 89 at the ‘hunkar’ rally of then PM candidate Narendra Modi at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on October 27, 2013. The court of ADJ-XV Gurvinder Singh Malhotra also awarded rigorous life imprisonment to two, 10 years’ jail to two and seven years’ imprisonment to one in the same case. The court had held nine accused guilty in the case and acquitted one Fakkruddin for lack of evidence on October 27. The quantum of punishment was announced on Monday. Modi was the Gujarat CM that time. Altogether six serial blasts with the help of timers had taken place in and around the Gandhi Maidan. Fourteen unexploded time bombs were recovered from the venue later. These terrorists had planned suicide bombing to assassinate Modi, but gave up the plan due to his extremely heightened security. Then they triggered serial blasts in his rally. Among the convicts, Haider Ali alias Black Beauty, Numan Ansari, Mujibullah Ansari and Imtiyaz Ansari were handed over capital punishment while their associates Umer Siddique and Azharuddin Qureshi were awarded rigorous life imprisonment. The court sentenced Ahmad Hussain and Mohammad Feroz Aslam to 10 years’ imprisonment and awarded seven years’ imprisonment to Mohammad Ifteqaar Alam. A juvenile was also involved in the case. His case was handled by JJB. He is still in a remand home for being accused in a case with Raipur police in Chhattisgarh. As per the NIA, Umer was the amir (head) of SIMI in Chhattisgarh. Haider was the Jharkhand head of the terror outfit. The duo with Azharuddin and others had held several meetings in Raipur and Ranchi to plan the terror attacks. Haider, Imtiaz, Umer, Azharuddin and Mujibullah are already serving life imprisonment in the Bodh Gaya Mahabodhi Temple serial blasts case of July 7, 2013. Haider, Umer and Azharuddin hail from Raipur while Fakkruddin and Ahmad belong to Mirzapur and rest to Dhurva in Ranchi. Special public prosecutor (NIA) Lallan Prasad Sinha said the four were awarded death as they had carried the time bombs from Ranchi in a bus and planted at the rally ground, killing six persons and injuring 89 to make it a rarest of the rare case. Sinha said the NIA had demanded death penalty for Umer and Azharuddin as well, but the court showed leniency as both had confessed to their crime and limited role of conspiring from Raipur. The court also slapped Rs90,000 fine each on Haider, Numan and Mujibullah and Rs80,000 fine on Imtiyaz under relevant sections of IPC, including 120B (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 121 (waging war against state), The Explosive Substances Act and The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Umer and Azharuddin have also been slapped with Rs60,000 fine each under relevant sections of IPC and The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act while Ahmad and Ifteqaar were fined Rs10,000 each under The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Section 201 of IPC, respectively. They have to undergo one month’s additional simple imprisonment in case of failure to pay fines. Sinha was assisted by NIA’s additional public prosecutor Pramod Kumar and counsels Sanjay Kumar and Manoj Kumar in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-sentenced-to-death-for-serial-blasts-at-modis-poll-rally-in-2013/articleshow/87472569.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Pune||Maharashtra: High Covid vaccination rates, sero-prevalence causing trial shortage volunteers||PUNE: High vaccination rates and antibodies from previous Covid infection in a chunk of the population are making it increasingly difficult for hospitals to get volunteers for clinical trials of newer and upcoming vaccines in India, hospital sites told TOI. Hospitals conducting Covid vaccine trials told TOI that a major exclusion criteria for trial volunteers was the recent history of Covid-19 infection within three months from screening or a volunteer already having received a vaccine to prevent the infection. Maharashtra public health department data revealed that over 98% of the population in Mumbai and over 93% in Pune had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Institutions participating in various clinical trials, such as Corbevax, Covovax and India’s first mRNA vaccine against Covid, HGCO19, told TOI that difficulties in getting a CoWIN certificate in the past were an issue with the trial volunteers. Dr Sidram K Raut, director of Noble Hospitals, one of the trial sites for mRNA vaccine HGCO19, told TOI, “Due to the shortage of trial volunteers after an increase in vaccination rates in the population, the trial sponsor allowed us to recruit volunteers who had Covid antibodies in their serum. However, 90 days should elapse after the Covid infection for such participants to be eligible.” He said, “Those who have taken a Covid vaccine are also not eligible for such trials. We recently recruited 73 volunteers for HGCO19 Phase II trials at our site. Getting this number was difficult. Most willing volunteers had either been vaccinated or had antibodies from a recent Covid infection. We had to search for volunteers in the inner circle or known relations of the hospital staffers and authorities.” Till last year, Dr Raut said, getting volunteers for new vaccines under trial was not a problem. The principal investigator of the HGCO19 vaccine trial at another hospital in Pune district told TOI, “In the Phase III trials of the vaccine, we need to enroll 400 volunteers at our site. But getting 400 non-vaccinated people is becoming very difficult because almost all in Pune have received at least one dose of the vaccine. We are now trying to get volunteers from rural areas where the vaccination rate is relatively lower than in the urban hubs.” Dr Akash Khobragade, principal investigator of the Corbevax trial at the Grant Medical College and Sir J J Hospital in Mumbai, told TOI, “Before being enrolled in a trial, the volunteers are screened for their immunogenicity — to check for a past Covid infection that they were not aware of. If they test positive for antibodies, then they cannot be included in the study.” He said, “In our recent phase III Corbevax trial, we had screened nearly 1,200 volunteers and could ultimately get only 207 who were eligible to participate in the trial. This means that almost 1,000 volunteers had antibodies either from the past infection or vaccination. Many sites have thus been facing a shortage of eligible volunteers in most recent clinical trials on newer vaccines.” An official from TN Medical College and BYL Nair Hospital, which is undertaking Covovax trials in children, however, cited other reasons for the dearth in willing volunteers. He said, “We are not witnessing a response from children for the trial. The fear of Covid seems to have gone now. With schools opening up, we thought that parents would be keen to get their children vaccinated but somehow, the response has been poor. Also, vaccines such as ZyCoV-D and Covaxin are already slated to be used for children in the near future. As a result. people feel that they would get their children inoculated as part of the government drive.” The official said, “As of now, we are recruiting children in the 12-17 age group. There were 460 children to be recruited at 10 sites from this age group for the Covovax trials. But the recruiting process has slowed down because of low response from the volunteers. A small number of children are yet to be enrolled to complete the target.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-covid-vax-rates-sero-prevalence-causing-shortage-of-volunteers-in-trials/articleshow/87473317.cms||Neha Madaan

The Kondhwa police said they have identified the car and its driver and will soon take action. Mohsin Mujawar, the father of the deceased boy, Zaid, lodged a complaint with the police. The father is an employee of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). The Mujawars, residents of Sangvi, had gone to a relative’s place in Undri and were returning home when the accident occurred, police said. Senior inspector Sardar Patil of the Kondhwa police told TOI, “Mohsin, his wife Reshma and Zaid had gone to their relatives’ place in Undri. After meeting them , the family was returning home on their motorcycle when the father lost his way and took a wrong turn in the Mohammadwadi area. After asking passersby for directions, he decided to take a U-turn. However, as soon as he took a turn, a speeding car hit the motorcycle.” Patil said Mohsin and Reshma fell on the road while Zaid landed in front of the car. “He was dragged a few metres before the car stopped. Passersby took the family members to a nearby hospital,” he said. The police have registered the case of rash and negligent driving and death due to negligence against the car driver. “Further legal action will be initiated against the car driver after studying the entire accident in detail,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-yr-old-boy-dies-parents-injured-as-car-hits-bike-in-undri/articleshow/87473344.cms||Gitesh Shelke

As many as 17 companies from Gujarat have yielded returns above 100% since last Diwali, which fell on November 14, 2020. Riding on the stock market rally, Gujarat-based 10 companies’ share prices have galloped more than 200% from their price levels on Diwali last year. Out of these star performers, seven firms trebled their investors’ wealth. Prominent among them are Ganesh Housing Corporation Ltd, R&B Denims, Monarch Networth Capital Ltd, Adani Total Gas Ltd (ATGL), Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL), Nandan Denim and PG Foils Ltd. Apart from this, seven companies’ stock prices have jumped in the range of 100% to 183%. These firms include Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd (GNFC), Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Ltd (GACL), Gujarat Gas Ltd and Deepak Nitrite Ltd. According to stock analysts, realty, chemicals, city gas distribution (CGD) and denim companies from Gujarat have put up a very good show on bourses since Diwali last year. “Several companies have seen their valuations going up largely on account of the overall rally in the stock market. Be it Indian or global bourses, stock markets are moving up as more and more liquidity is flowing in the stock markets worldwide,” said Nilesh Kotak, a citybased stock analyst. Benchmark equity index sensex has offered a handsome 38% return to investors as the index rose from 43,637.98 points on November 14 last year to 60,138.46 points on November 1 this year. According to stock analysts, immense liquidity flowing into the market, entry of new investors with more money in hands and strong investor sentiment have fuelled stock market rally. Lower interest rates and unavailability of other suitable asset classes have made investors rely more on equities for investments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diwali-to-diwali-17-guj-cos-rewardinvestors-with-returns-above-100/articleshow/87473486.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Business||Bankers question arrest of ex-SBI chairman Chaudhuri||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Bankers have come out in support of Pratip C Chaudhuri, the former SBI chairman, and have questioned the way he was arrested in a case involving Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company and an aggrieved borrower. “Prima facie, it appears that the norms have been ignored. This is not the way it is done, without giving an opportunity to a person to be heard... It does not appear to be a case of corruption,” former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar told TOI. He said that the case involved a dispute between an ARC and the property owner and one person seems to have been singled out. “It is not about an individual. Today it is him, tomorrow it may be someone else,” Kumar added. Arundhati Bhattacharya, who succeeded Chaudhuri and was the first woman to head the country’s largest bank, too backed her former boss. “I can attest to the fact that Mr Chaudhuri is absolutely and scrupulously honest and there is absolutely no wrongdoing on his part. This is an unfortunate day for bankers when a senior banker is taken to task like this without doing anything wrong,” she told TOI. Ironically, the arrest came a day after the finance ministry’s norms on uniform staff accountability framework for non-performing assets (NPA) accounts of over Rs 50 crore, meant to protect bankers from bona fide business decisions that prove wrong later. Bankers have been wary of action by law enforcement agencies, prompting several of them to go slow in sanctioning loans, a concern that had prompted even Prime Minister Narendra Modi to step in and comfort them. “Absolutely pathetic, is the system being gamed again by defaulters despite all efforts by Modi govt, time for overhaul of judicial processes to improve transparency and introduce accountability,” tweeted former SBI deputy MD Sunil Srivastava. Reacting to Kumar’s comments to a news platform, Mohandas Pai took to social media to seek government intervention. “Shocking, @FinMinIndia (finance ministry) and @RBI (Reserve Bank of India) should intervene to protect banks and its employees,” he tweeted. Several bank executives said that Chaudhuri’s arrest will once again raise fears, not just in sanctioning loans but even in the recovery process, where lenders and borrowers often opt for settling the dues and waive the penal interest. SBI sources alleged that the borrower has sought to frustrate the bank’s attempts to recover the dues for a long time. Executives also pointed out that given the size of the transaction, it is unlikely that it would have been Chaudhuri’s decision. “Also, even in smaller loans, it is never one person who decides on the recovery action” an SBI executive said. “If a defaulter can send a former bank chairman to jail on an allegation, how can bankers be expected to do this? The government has repeatedly assured us that authorities cannot pick up a banker without reason. The case has been filed just before the courts are closed for Diwali — this appears to be premeditated,” said a senior banker. Another banker pointed out that a defaulter is given all the opportunity to repay. “In this case, several years have passed since the default and the final sale. You cannot compare current real estate value with an older value. Also, when assets are sold in a distressed condition, the valuations are always lower.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bankers-question-arrest-of-ex-sbi-chairman-chaudhuri/articleshow/87474270.cms||---

While leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav left for Darbhanga on Monday to monitor the counting of Kusheshwar Asthan assembly, RJD’s state president Jagdanand Singh went to Munger to look after the counting process at Tarapur assembly constituencies. Apart from Tejaswhi, senior RJD leaders Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Bhola Yadav are also camping in Darbhanga. Former assembly speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary is already camping at Tarapur. Before heading for Darbhanga, Tejashwi said that no malpractice in counting will be tolerated. He said the administration is not making it clear as to how the counting will be done as there is no clarity about the number of rooms which will be used or the process of ballot papers.“I have already said that I am closely monitoring be it the head of the government, his ministers or officials. What they did in previous assembly election, everyone knows. CM Nitish Kumar can do anything to save his chair,” Tejashwi said. He further said in many places contract employees were given counting-related duties and he has a list as to who is placed where. “We are winning, that is for sure and we will not let any malpractice happen,” Tejaswhi added. However, JD (U) sources claimed that the younger Yadav scion is aware of his defeat and hence giving such statements. “ All election-related management is done by the Election Commission. RJD leaders are making excuses as they know that they are losing,” JD (U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said. Meanwhile, RJD chief Lalu Prasad has once again raised the issue of inflation. On Monday, he uploaded photos of mustard oil bottles showing its MRP. “Wait, the impact of three black farm laws will be clear after two to four years,” tweeted Lalu. Even on earlier occasions, he had raised the issue of inflation and pointed towards the increase in the price of fuel and mustard oil. Lalu had even talked about the price rise while campaigning at the two assembly constituencies earlier this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-visits-darbhanga-to-monitor-counting-process/articleshow/87472513.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||SBI says it was not party to ARC case||NEW DELHI: SBI on Monday said that it was not a party to the case where Alchemist ARC director Pratip C Chaudhuri, a former chairman of the country’s largest lender, was arrested and the court may not have been “briefed correctly” on the sequence of events. The bank said that Chaudhuri had retired from SBI in September 2013, and all directors, who joined the ARC board a year later, have been named in the case. “It appears from the copies of the proceedings now accessed by us that the court does not appear to have been briefed correctly on the sequence of events. In as much as SBI was not a party to this case, there was no occasion for the views of SBI being heard as part of this proceedings. SBI would like to reiterate that all due processes were followed while making the said sale to ARC. The bank has already offered its cooperation to the law enforcement and judicial authorities and will provide further information, if any that may be called for from their side,” SBI said in a statement. Garh Rajwada, a hotel project in Jaisalmer, was financed by SBI in 2007 and it remained incomplete till its key promoter died in April 2010. Two months later, the account turned into a non-performing asset and the bank initiated several moves to recover the dues. In March 2014, the dues were assigned to an ARC. “This sale to ARC by the bank was done through a laid down process as per the policy of the bank. We further understand that the borrower was subjected to IBC process by the said ARC and the asset has been acquired by an NBFC in December 2017, again through due process under the orders of NCLT, Delhi,” the statement said. While the borrower had initially filed an FIR with the police against the sale to the ARC, the entity subsequently filed a “protest petition” in the court of the chief judicial magistrate as it was “aggrieved against the negative closure report filed by police”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-says-it-was-not-party-to-arc-case/articleshow/87474492.cms||---

---||Patna||Met: Overcast skies likely to prevail in Bihar till tomorrow||PATNA: Patna and few districts in the state observed partly cloudy skies on Monday. Weather experts have predicted that overcast skies are likely to prevail till Wednesday, following which further plunge in temperature is expected. A nip in the air is being observed for the last few days. The minimum temperature has come down below 20 degrees Celsius at most places in the state. The minimum temperature in Patna on Monday morning was recorded at 17.6 degrees C, while it stood at 14.6 degrees C in Gaya, which was two notches lower than the normal. Nevertheless, officials at the Patna meteorological department ruled out any strong weather system behind the partly cloudy or hazy skies on Monday. “It is mere convergence of humidity into shallow cloud formation due to reduced wind speed. It is a temporary phenomenon and the sky will become clear within a day or two, following increase in the speed of dry and cold north-westerly winds in the region,” said Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist. Asked about the expected maximum and minimum temperatures in Patna over the next few days, he said, “Based on the prevailing weather conditions, the maximum temperature is likely to hover in the range of 28-30 degrees C while the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 17-18 degrees C. The mercury will gradually plunge hereafter." The minimum temperature in Gaya, on the other hand, is likely to remain around 14-15 degrees C over the next five days. Weather experts claimed that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is expected to release a seasonal outlook bulletin in a few days which will enumerate forecast for intensity of weather this winter season. “The intensity of winter conditions in northern plains is mostly influenced by western disturbances that bring snow and rain in the Himalayan region in north India and cold and dry westerly winds over the northern plains,” Sanjay said. The winter season normally sets in Bihar around the first week of December and is at its peak between December 20 and January 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-overcast-skies-likely-to-prevail-in-state-till-tomorrow/articleshow/87471549.cms||---

The doctors advised people, whose lungs have been weakened by the Covid-19 infection, to stay indoors and wear face mask as the polluted air from firecrackers may hinder the healing process. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal in-charge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, suggested that people who suffered from severe respiratory illness should stay at home during Diwali and avoid huge gathering. “In the second wave, most of the patients suffered from lung and breathing problems and many of them are still coping with post-Covid symptoms. In such a situation, pollution by bursting of crackers will add to their trouble,” he said. He cited a recent study on people with post-Covid symptoms, which revealed that some of them were experiencing hearing loss. “Bursting of crackers also creates noise pollution besides emitting hazardous smoke. Noise pollution can affect the inner parts of ear. Those who wish to burst crackers should use the one which emits less smoke and not causes noise pollution. But do not cause trouble to the vulnerable people,” Dr Sanjeev said. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, an epidemiologist at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna, said those who were severely infected with Covid-19 in the second wave should wear mask most of the time to keep them safe from polluted air, especially during Diwali. “It takes almost six months to over one year for the lungs to recover. If people fail to take precautionary measures, it will be dangerous and harmful for their health,” he said. “People should avoid fireworks during Diwali, especially those who have asthma, citizens above 60 years of age, small kids or have recovered from severe symptoms of Covid-19,” he advised. Dr A K Ashu, joint director at Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), advised Covid recovered patients to be more cautious during Diwali as many of them developed pneumonitis which has severely scarred their lungs tissue. “Scarring of lungs tissue could be permanent if they are not sincere towards their health. They have to keep themselves away from pollution, especially harmful pollutants released from fireworks. They should also put on mask and avoid gathering as virus transmits through the air,” he said. The data reading from some areas having continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations have from poor to moderate AQI level, which was 212 in Rajvanshi Nagar and 210 in Samanpura. The overall AQI level of Patna was recorded 171 at 4pm on Monday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-who-recovered-from-covid-19-should-stay-indoors-on-diwali-doctors/articleshow/87471054.cms||Faryal Rumi

Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) will also remain alert with operation theatres and other facilities for meeting any emergency situation in the festival during which thousands of devotees visit different ghats for offering prayers to Sun God. Patna civil surgeon (CS) Dr Vibha Kumari said the list of doctors and paramedics to be deployed has already been prepared. Each ghat would have one medical team while temporary hospitals would be set up at three to four major ghats where a large number of people participate in the festival, she said. “While we have sent request letters to PMCH and NMCH to make their advance preparation for the situation, direction has been issued to other urban government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) in rural areas to be on alert,” she said. About 40 ambulances with medical staff have been kept ready for deployment on the important approach roads to different Ganga ghats between Danapur and Patna City. Dr Vibha said as several people in suburban and rural areas now prefer to offer arghya in ponds, lakes and other water bodies, the district health department has directed all its PHCs to depute their teams there and keep the ambulances ready. “Though the health department is doing its best to make available medical facilities at all places during the festival, we sincerely seek help from volunteers serving at different ghats to act promptly in case of any health emergency and inform the medical team and facilitate the movement of ambulances,” said the CS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/medical-teams-to-be-deployed-at-all-chhath-ghats-civil-surgeon/articleshow/87471072.cms||VK Tripathi

---||India||Tightrope walk ahead for India at COP26 climate summit||NEW DELHI: India has to negotiate a tightrope in pursuing its climate goals as COP26 gets under way in Glasgow with three parallel tracks emerging in recent months — an ambitious ramping up of clean energy goals; resisting pressure to announce ‘net zero’ targets; and taking the ball to the developed countries’ court on their commitments and now raising its demand for full nuclear suppliers group membership. India successfully staved off demands, largely by the UK, to make a ‘net zero’ pledge at Glasgow even if the road to that goal was vague. The Indian government’s sense was that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was looking for good headlines for the summit — but that isn’t India’s game. And linking of climate goals to NSG membership brings China squarely into the picture as it is the only hurdle in the way, acting out of its desire to hold back India’s growth and promote ally Pakistan’s interests. The reference to China comes at a time when there was some discussion that the two countries could find something in common on climate issues despite the border tensions and the very different emission scenarios. It indicates, the Modi government's preparedness to take on China despite the border face off remaining unresolved rather than soft-pedalling things in the hope of getting Beijing to call back its troops. China has announced a ‘net zero’ pledge by 2060 but no clear roadmap of how to get there. Meanwhile, China’s latest five-year-plan says it will build over 43 coal-fired thermal plants and 18 new blast furnaces, according to a new report. India is not about to let China get a free pass on climate pledges, by painting itself as a developing country. Meanwhile, India is probably the only country to actually put its commitments on the ground — both with the 450GW of renewable energy pledge and the green hydrogen alliance along with a green afforestation program. But India not likely to commit to a net zero target — instead the government on Sunday rolled out a new website, Climate Equity Tracker, which highlighted the emissions gap between not only the developed world and India but even between China and India. “The website is intended to debunk the narrative provided by many developed countries, and global non-government organisations that focus attention continually on what developing countries must do, constantly demanding greater commitment and action from them,” the MOEF said. The government will use the website to monitor the performance of Annex-I Parties under the UNFCCC (developed countries) based on the “foundational principles” of the Climate Convention, namely equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC). “India historically stands at 4.5% total emissions and to make it actually work, developed countries should do it before 2050. There should be a compensation mechanism and the expenditure should be brought by the developed nations,” government sources have said. When it comes to carbon emission, China emits 8.4 tons per person whereas the US emits 18.6 tons per person. The European Union emits 7.16 tons. India also cleverly brought in the NSG membership issue into the climate debate. It is now recognised that nuclear power can add solid heft to clean energy. India is on the path of building 10 PHWR nuclear reactors, but the lack of access to NSAG membership is proving a hurdle. The only country standing between India and an NSG membership is China. India’s stand therefore puts more pressure on China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tightrope-walk-ahead-for-india-at-cop26-climate-summit/articleshow/87475136.cms||---

Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram challenged the Centre and the Goa government to a debate on the justification for the increase in prices. Chidambaram, who is the All India Congress Committee senior election observer for Goa, described the Centre’s move to increase commercial gas prices by Rs 266 per 19kg cylinder as regressive. “There is absolutely no economic justification for the rise in prices. We are willing to debate it with any minister of this government,” Chidambaram said. He pointed out that the taxes being levied on petrol, diesel and LPG gas are higher than the corporate tax levied on large private sector firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pc-no-economic-justification-for-fuel-lpg-price-hike-by-govt/articleshow/87473382.cms||---

Riding on the sympathy wave generated due to the demise of its sitting MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar due to Covid, Congress has been sensing advantage in the election in its bastion. The aggressive campaigning by public works department minister Ashok Chavan across the Deglur assembly constituency had received a major boost due to the homecoming of veteran leader Bhaskar Patil Khatgaokar, who had ditched BJP to rejoin Congress. While BJP hopes to recreate the magic of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, which saw Chavan lose. In order to get a similar result, it had given a ticket to Subhash Sabne, a former Shiv Sena MLA who switched his loyalties considering new political equations in the wake of the formation of the MVA government. The BJP is also counting on the alleged anti-incumbency factor and bickering among the MVA partners to win another bypoll after Pandhapur. The bypoll had witnessed 63.9% polling, which is more when compared to 60.9% polling recorded during the 2019 assembly election. Both camps have already claimed increased voter turnout in their favour. As per the official arrangement, the counting of votes will take place at 14 tables involving a workforce of 150. Around 30 rounds of counting of votes are scheduled to take place with the first round slated to begin at 8 am, as per an official release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/all-eyes-on-outcome-of-deglur-byelection/articleshow/87471635.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Commission officials claimed that the accused had apparently sodomised the boy once while he had forced him to perform sexual acts orally multiple times. The child’s medical examination was done on Sunday though officials refused to divulge the details. The accused had also allegedly threatened the child with rape threats against his mother in order to keep the incident under wraps. Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) Sangeeta Beniwal said that, “We have asked for a detailed report of the case from the authorities and our child welfare committee is continuously monitoring the situation. I am in touch with the child and his family.” The boy along with his elder brother and mother stays in Bharatpur where he came in contact with the accused when he used to go to play tennis. “The boy stays with his single mother and brother. In one-and-a half month, the accused had supposedly sodomised the boy once but allegedly forced him to perform oral sex many times. It is unclear if others also sexually assaulted the boy and we have ordered counselling for him. It appears that initially he had been given edibles which were laced with sedatives so that he would not fight the accused who also threatened to hurt his family if he told anyone about the assault”, said an official of child welfare committee in Bharatpur. The child rights body also asked for the copy of the FIR along with the statements of the complainant under CrPC section 164 and the measures taken for providing financial aid to the girls under Victims Relief Fund. Apart from this the police have been asked about the development in the arrest of the accused.

---||Hyderabad||Softer gold prices fuel demand on Dhanteras||HYDERABAD: After a gloomy Dhanteras 2020 brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, jewellers are gearing up for a dazzling Dhanteras this time, riding high on the buoyant customer sentiment this year. “We are seeing very good sales. People are very happy and in a mood to buy. Last year, those who purchased 2-5gm gold coins are lapping up 5-20gm coins this year. We expect at least 20% higher sales than even 2019 Dhanteras,” said an ebullient Pavan Mor, proprietor, Pavan Mor Jewellers, busy juggling customers and queries from TOI. “The sentiment is so good this festive season that we hope to recover the sales that we lost over the past couple of years,” said an optimistic Darshan Gupta, partner, Mangatrai Jewellers, while grappling with the customer rush a day ahead of Dhanteras. “Sentiment was down last year due to Covid and floods and the income crunch also was weighing on the minds of people, who had been waiting for a good period. Now the enthusiasm is back to rebuild lives, splurge and enjoy the festival,” he added. Jewellers pointed out that a key factor boosting this positive sentiment is lower and stable gold rates. “While prices were in the Rs 4,000 per gm range (24k) during Dhanteras 2019, they peaked to around Rs 5,800 per gm during the pandemic but have softened to the Rs 4,800-4,900 per gm range now. Though this is a 20% rise over 2019 prices, it’s still over 15% drop from last year’s peak which is why people are comfortable buying now,” explained Avinash Gupta, director, All India Gems & Jewellery Domestic Council. Such is the sentiment, Arun Narayan, VP-category, marketing & retail, Tanishq, pointed out, that customers who had stayed away over the past two years are now back to flocking jewellery showrooms this year. “From around mid-June 2019, gold rates started spiking quite significantly, which is why a lot of customers stayed away. Last year too, gold rates started spiking pre-pandemic and remained high through it, only cooling post August 15 this year. Now prices are more or less in the psychological mark and there is nothing really to spook customers,” explained Narayan of Tanishq. Agreeing, Sachin Jain, managing director, DeBeers India, said pent up demand is driving sales this year and he is hopeful of a strong run till the first quarter of next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jewellers-gear-up-for-dazzling-dhanteras-as-stable-softer-gold-prices-lure-buyers/articleshow/87473401.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Mumbai||No wrongdoing: Khadse’s kin; ED may summon her next wk||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to summon Rohini Khadse-Khewalkar, daughter of former state revenue minister Eknath Khadse, next week as part of a probe into loans aggregating to Rs 50 crore granted by Jalgaon District Cooperative Central Bank to companies where she had interest. Rohini, however, denied any wrongdoing saying she had no interest in the firms that had received loans from the bank. Rohini said that granting the loans was a collective decision of the board and the bank’s audit had established that there was no misappropriation of funds. These loans later turned into NPAs, causing loss to the bank. Rohini stated that all the bank’s loans are secured and clean as certified by the auditors. “I have no connection with the firms to whom the loans were sanctioned. It’s a false allegation.” She added that an independent consultant had checked the details of the applicants on the basis of which the loans were sanctioned. She said Jalgaon District Cooperative Central Bank had granted Rs 30 crore secured loan to a sugar mill after taking Rs 58 crore worth of its assets as a mortgage. She claimed that the mill has not defaulted on repayment. She also denied helping her parents in identifying the MIDC land in Pune. The ED has submitted a chargesheet against Eknath Khadse, his wife Mandakini and their son-in-law Girish Chaudhari on charges of money- laundering in its sale. The Khadses are out on bail and Chaudhari is in jail custody. During the money-laundering case investigation, the ED came across information that Rohini had allegedly helped her parents in identifying the MIDC land after which they decided to examine the details of a firm associated with her. Rohini had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly election on a BJP ticket as the party decided to field her in place of her father in Jalgaon district. Khadse was at loggerheads with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. Last October, Khadse and Rohini left the party to join the NCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-wrongdoing-khadses-kin-ed-may-summon-her-next-wk/articleshow/87474231.cms||Vijay V Singh

A few operators that had received bookings for November after India started issuing visas mid-last month will be either cancelled or postponed. “Starred hotels as well as tour operators handling domestic clientele are doing well, while other operators are affected,” said Aloo Gomes, chief operating officer (COO) of Trail Blazer India (TBI) Pvt Ltd. Gomes, however, said that the situation is dynamic, and nothing can be predicted. He also said that India cannot risk not taking measures when other countries are facing the worst of the pandemic. Ernest Dias, COO, Sita Travels said they have not received any bookings from Russian destinations, but got some from the UK, including a few for November. “I had a few bookings for November 14 as we planned to bring clients through scheduled flights, but with the extension of the ban, those arrivals have been deferred,” said Dias. While tour operators dealing with international tourists have been a hit, the safety aspect can’t be ignored, he said. The pandemic situation in Russia is also of great concern. “The problem is grave as many have not taken the vaccine in Russia and the country is in lockdown,” said Dias. Goa is set to receive the first charter of the season from the UK on December 13, provided the conditions don’t change, but tour operators estimate international tourism will pick up either mid-December or in January next year. More than half of the charters that land in Goa are from Russia and other CIS countries. Abida Kumar, vice-president operations, Minar Travels (India) Pvt Ltd, said they too have not received any bookings from Russia where Covid cases have shot up. “I think the season will be delayed, but it will happen for sure. Tourists will not miss out on this opportunity as other countries are also not fully opened,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-bears-brunt-as-flight-ban-extended/articleshow/87473416.cms||---

Congress’s Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken was present in the flight. After circling in the sky for some time, flight number 6E-2338 left for Delhi. Maken was to attend the Congress membership drive at the PCC headquarters here. PCC chief and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, along with some Congressmen, waited for Maken to arrive but had to leave after the flight returned to Delhi without landing here. Jaipur airport’s operations were recently taken over by the Adani group. Minister Khachariyawas said, “It’s a new world now. Airport authority is now in the hands of private operators. It (Central government) has privatised airports but its communication gap with the Adani group is not understandable.” On being asked if the flight was deliberately not allowed to land, Dotasra told reporters, “We can’t say. We were told only this much that the flight was not allowed to land. What could be the reasons behind this no one knows.” An airport official told TOI, “The runway is closed every day for maintenance between 2.30pm and 4.30 pm. During this period, no flight lands there. The Indigo aircraft asked for permission to land around 2.45, so we told the pilot that we will try to facilitate but, in the meantime, he decided to return. Even though the runway is closed daily for these two hours and the surprising part was that the aircraft was permitted to take off from Delhi despite this fact.” The Congress membership drive was later launched by chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief Dotasra. Just seven ministers and around 18 MLAs reached for the event held at the Congress headquarters in the afternoon. The indifference of ministers and legislators towards the Congress programme became a subject of discussion in the party circles. All ministers, MLAs, MP and MLA election candidates, all party office bearers and outgoing district presidents were called for the meeting. Ministers who attended the event included, Dotasra, Khachariyawas, Bhanwar Singh Bhati, Bhajan Lal Jatav, Tikaram Julie, Sukhram Bishnoi and Pramod Jain Bhaya. Rajya Sabha MP Neeraj Dangi was present too. Independent MLA Babulal Nagar too joined the event, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maken-misses-membership-drive-as-aircraft-fails-to-land/articleshow/87474211.cms||---

Nearly 1,000 buses have already made trips across the state till Monday. GSRTC had launched ‘ST at your doorstep’ programme for those travelling to their native places during Diwali festival a few years ago. Buses will be transporting passenger to various districts of Saurashtra, central Gujarat, north Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. “There is a huge demand for buses during Diwali. People were earlier dependent on private transport a few years ago,” said Sanjay Joshi, divisional controller, GSRTC. “In the last four years we have gradually developed a comprehensive model in which the passengers can get a bus from their doorstep in the city and it will drop them at their village,” Joshi told TOI. The ‘ST at your doorstep’ programme is giving tough competition to private bus operators with affordable fares and better connectivity, he added. GSRTC plans to run over 1,500 buses this festive season to different routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gsrtc-to-run-600-special-diwali-buses-today/articleshow/87473413.cms||---

Many working professionals packed their bags to travel to their native places. “I have taken a day off on Friday and will be heading to Nalgonda district on Wednesday night to celebrate the festival with my wife and son,” said Srivatsav A, a techie working in a multinational company in the city. Another resident, Lalitha M, who will be heading out for Diwali with her family said, “All our extended family is in Bhadrachalam. We will be going to the village and will stay there for four days.” Getaways and staycations nearby have also been popular with hotels and resorts in and around the city filling up fast. “I enquired with a resort, which is a couple of hours away from the city, and was surprised to find that it was filled. So, I decided book myself into one of the top hotels in the city this weekend,” said Rahul V, a private employee. Staycations seemed to be a preferred option especially among those trying to avoid travelling during the pandemic. For residents trying to make a small trip, having spent most of their time indoors the past couple of years, data from GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd showed that popular domestic destinations included Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru among metro cities; and Vizag, Patna and Raipur among Tier II cities. Tirupati and Shirdi were preferred destinations among pilgrimage travellers while Goa, Jodhpur and Port Blair were popular among tourist destinations, the data showed. “I have not taken a vacation since the pandemic started two years ago. With many talking about the impending third wave, I decided to take a vacation this week and will be heading to Goa with friends,” said K Sai Kumar, a techie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/diwali-travel-residents-explore-a-bag-of-options/articleshow/87473408.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

With the 1.48kilometre flyover from Thaltej to Sola bridge already functional since June 27 this year, a total of 4.18km-long flyover has become functional from Monday, connecting the Gota flyover to Sola Science City flyover. The state government plans to convert the 44km national highway from Sarkhej in Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar city and Chiloda (in Gandhinagar district) to a six-lane road with service roads on both the sides, at an investment of Rs 913 crore. Out of the total 13 flyovers to be constructed as part of the project, seven had already become functional. The elevated corridor is the eighth to become functional with its inauguration on Monday. The remaining five flyovers are under-construction. “The elevated corridor will directly benefit commuters using the SG (Sarkhej-Gandhinagar) highway that falls under Shah’s parliamentary constituency of Gandhinagar, by connecting it to four important road junctions, namely Sola Bhagwat, Kargil Petrol Pump, Janata Nagar and Zydus,” a release from the state chief minister’s office said. People coming to the Gujarat High Court or the Sola Civil Hospital will benefit as they will directly get connected to it from National Highway No. 147 using this elevated corridor, the release added. Shah visits temples On the second day of his state tour, Union home minister Amit Shah visited two temples dedicated to Lord Swaminarayan and a famous temple of Lord Hanuman in Gujarat’s Botad district on Monday.

The box girder of 40-metre span for the bullet train weighing as much as 970 tonnes is claimed to be the heaviest in the construction industry in the country. The girder is being cast as a single piece, which is without any construction joint, and made with 390 cubic metres of concrete and 42 tonnes of steel, according to an official release.  National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) is the project implementation agency while L&T is developing the project.  Union minister of state for railway Darshana Jardosh said, “The first trial run of the bullet train between Surat and Bilimora stations is expected to take place by July 2026.” “This is for the first time such a large girder will be cast in the country,” she added.  In a release, L&T stated that it will be setting up many casting yards. “L&T will be setting up 23 casting yards totally along the 508 km Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed rail route,” the release stated. “The 30, 35 and 40 metre full-span girders will be launched using the full-span launching methodology that will accelerate the overall construction by almost seven times as compared to segmental launching,” the release further added.

---||Delhi||Dengue spread in Delhi poses a fresh big test||NEW DELHI: Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed the dengue situation in Delhi, where the number of those with the mosquito-borne disease crossed 1,500 on Monday and the number of deaths touched six, as per official data released by the municipal corporations. The toll is likely to rise because some deaths at hospitals are ‘under review’. In Monday’s meeting, Mandaviya stressed on the need to scale up testing. He said many poor people were not diagnosed properly and their death went unreported. “Primary healthcare centres may prescribe anti-pyretic drugs to suppress fever symptomatically without testing or addressing the root cause. Since no dengue tests have been carried out, deaths in these cases will not be reported as such and dengue incidence will continue to be underreported,” he noted. Civic bodies are taking various measures, including fogging, to contain dengueThe meeting was attended by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, National Centre for Disease Control director Dr S K Singh and Delhi additional chief secretary (health) Bhupinder Bhalla. Mandaviya directed officials to ramp up testing and stressed on the need for effective coordination between the central and the state governments. Pointing out how some hospitals were overburdened with dengue cases while others had unoccupied beds, the minister requested Delhi officials to look into the possibility of repurposing Covid beds for dengue patients. Last week, Delhi government directed hospitals to use one-third of Covid beds for the mosquito-borne disease. “Dengue patients are flooding us with requests for admission but we can only admit seriously ill patients due to paucity of beds,” said a doctor at AIIMS. At Lok Nayak Hospital too, the doctors said both the OPD and IPD were crowded by patients suffering from febrile illness, mostly dengue. “We are seeing patients from all age groups, small children to adults and elderly. Unlike last year, many of them have severe dengue symptoms,” said a doctor at Manipal Hospital, Dwarka. Delhi is monitoring all fever cases, including those of suspected and confirmed dengue, state health officials informed Mandaviya. All hospitals are now zero-tolerant sites for mosquitoes because vectors acquire the pathogen from infected individuals and are able to transmit it in their offspring too, officials said. The meeting also discussed the new dengue vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dengue-spread-poses-a-fresh-big-test/articleshow/87474243.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Not penguins, hiked entry fee spiked zoo income, says BMC data||Mumbai: Footfall of visitors at Byculla zoo rose just around 30% after the opening of penguin exhibit in March 2017 but the income rose close to 500% as the BMC hiked ticket prices drastically the same year. The BMC claimed that income from the zoo had gone up due to the penguins.  After remaining shut for close to eight months, the Zoo reopened on Monday. There were 1,600 visitors on the first day and the BMC generated Rs 68,725 in revenue. The Byculla zoo was opened on February 15 this year, after the first lockdown, but was shut soon again due to the second Covid wave. According to data given by the BMC in a written reply to Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh, there were 12.51 lakh visitors during the year 2015-16 and the zoo earned Rs 70.03 lakh from ticket sales. In 2017-2018, visitors count rose to 17.57 lakh and the income rose to Rs 4.36 crore. The subsequent year, 2018-2019, number of visitors dropped again and was just 12.70 lakh but the income was Rs 5.42 crore. In 2019-2020, there were just 10.66 lakh visitors but the zoo raked in Rs 4.57 crore. In September, municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal defended the Rs 15 crore penguin maintenance tenders, saying that the zoo’s revenue had gone up by 12.26 crore after the penguins were brought in. Corporators from the opposition, including Shaikh, had sought a white paper on the income and expenditure of the zoo since 2017. “The data clearly shows that there has been no drastic increase in footfall and reason for the hike in revenue is not penguins but ticket prices. The BMC has said that it doesn’t even keep an exact count of visitors who enter the penguin enclosure. The BMC has misled people with bogus statistics. There must be a serious rethink on the Rs 15 crore maintenance contracts only for penguins,” Shaikh said. The BMC, in its reply, said that the footfall dropped in 2019 because the civic body was carrying out a revamp of the zoo and most animal enclosures were closed. “We had put up a board outside, stating that many enclosures are closed so the footfall dropped. There is no separate ticket for penguins so we can say that all visitors to the zoo saw the penguins after 2017,” the BMC has said in its reply. Apart from the penguin exhibits, the municipal corporation has spent Rs 167 crore on the zoo revamp since 2016. Chahal had claimed that after the arrival of the penguins, the BMC’s revenue from the zoo had increased drastically. The BMC claimed that the income from the zoo increased by Rs 12.26 crore from Rs 2.10 crore after the penguins were brought in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-penguins-hiked-entry-fee-spiked-zoo-income-says-bmc-data/articleshow/87474265.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The deaths took place between July and September and the total number of dengue casualties is now six. TOI had reported on Saturday that the various hospitals had reported a total of 13 dengue deaths, with a government official disclosing that six of those dead were residents of Delhi. These included a 35-year-old Sarita Vihar resident who died in a private hospital on September 26; a 9-year-old boy from Rangpuri Pahari who succumbed a day later ; and a 14-year-old boy from Punjabi Bagh West who died on October 23.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: GUVNL to buy power at revised tariff till December||AHMEDABAD: In a sign that the power crisis may not be over yet, the Gujarat government has allowed Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd to continue buying power from Tata Power and Adani Power at a higher tariff of Rs 4.5 per kilowatt-hour (kwh) for two more months. Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd , a subsidiary of Tata Power and Adani Power Mundra Ltd, have signed long-term power purchase agreements with GUVNL to supply 1,800MW and about 1,200MW respectively from their imported-coal fired power projects at Mundra. The companies recently stopped supplying power to GUVNL at the contracted rates, citing unprecedented rise in imported coal prices over the last few months that have made their projects unviable. In mid-October, when the stock of coal held by the country’s power plants were critically low, Gujarat government agreed to buy power from CGPL and APMuL at a fixed cost of Rs 4.5 per kwh or unit. “The earlier deadline was till November 5. This has been extended to December 31 looking at the present exigency and critical power supply position in the state and the interest of consumers and public at large,” said a government official close to the development. The state’s energy department has recently extended approval for off-taking of contracted power at fixed energy charge of Rs 4.50 per kwh and capacity charge as per the PPAs and supplementary PPAs as a purely temporary arrangement for a period up to December 30, as requested by GUVNL, said sources in the state government. “GUVNL has allowed companies to supply at revised tariff rates for another month. A final decision on whether to give further extension or not will be taken later depending on the state’s power scenario,” said another government official. As per the PPAs with Tata Power and Adani Power, the fixed energy charge is less than Rs 2.50 per kwh, according to sources. “Indonesian coal prices, which have been the main concern for imported coal fired power plants in the country, had shot up from $80-90 per tonne to over $200 per tonne recently. They are now showing signs of cooling down,” said an industry expert. Over the past few months, the country has been staring at a power crisis with a large number of thermal power plants across the country being shut down or working at lower capacities due to domestic coal supply problems. The deficit was highest in the month of October when it reached 20-25% of the state’s power demand on many days. In October, GUVNL purchased about 4,000MW power per day worth Rs 1,931 crore from the Indian Energy Exchange (IEE), the country’s power trading platform, with a weighted average of Rs 9.69 per Kwh, according to IEX data. In comparison, it bought power worth Rs 1,035 crore from the exchange for September. “The state’s power bill from IEE started going down from mid-October, after it resumed buying power directly from Tata and Adani,” said sources. Officials of Tata Power and Adani Power declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guvnl-to-buy-power-at-revised-tariff-till-dec/articleshow/87473461.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Vadodara||Four arrested for duping Ahmedabad businessman of Rs 30L||Vadodara: The Vadodara crime branch arrested four men including a bogus customs officer on Monday for duping an Ahmedabad-based businessman in the black dollar scam. The accused cheated Maulik Prajapati by promising to give him US dollars and took Rs 30 lakh from him last month. Prajapati approached the city police some weeks ago following which the crime branch started investigations and registered a complaint. According to the police, Prajapati was approached by one of the accused Bharat Gida who said that he knew a customs officer who had US dollars. Bharat arranged a meeting between Prajapati and the fake customs officer A K Malhotra in a hotel in the city in August this year. Malhotra then told Prajapati that he can give him US dollars worth Rs 7 lakh for Rs 51 per US$ that he can sell at higher rate. Prajapati said that he didn’t have that much money on hand and left. After some days Bharat again contacted Prajapati and said that Malhotra has a big amount of black US dollars. Prajapati agreed to invest Rs 30 lakh after Bharat said that he too would invest the same amount in dollars. In October, Prajapati met Malhotra in a hotel in Vadodara where the latter showed him how to use a chemical to convert black dollars into original currency. Prajapati then gave Rs 30 lakh but the gang didn’t give him the chemical to wash the black dollars following which he realised that he was duped. After Prajapati approached the police, they caught hold of Bharat, Malhotra, whose real name is Shahid Navdekar, Mahesh Vala and Imran Bhurani from Surat. “This gang dupes citizens by promising them lucrative returns on black dollars,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-arrested-for-duping-ahmedabad-businessman-of-rs-30l/articleshow/87473511.cms||---

While the people of Delhi is suffering, public money is being spent... in AAP’s expansion programmes,” alleged mayor Mukesh Suryan. Refuting the charges, a senior AAP functionary said, “This is the result of the growing popularity of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in other states. Fear is making BJP come up with such bizarre allegations, there is no truth in them.” Even as AAP councillors held a protest outside Civic Centre demanding timely payment of salaries to civic workers, BJP functionaries at SDMC reiterated their claim that the Delhi government had not released legitimate funds for the corporations, harming public interest and the civic fight against dengue. “The south corporation has been making all efforts to control the spread of dengue, malaria and chikungunya,” claimed Suryan. AAP also alleged the corporations didn’t even have enough drivers for pollution-controlling vehicles. “If BJP can’t run the corporation, they should learn from us. Employees who are busy cleaning the city have not received salaries for the past three months. It is painful that during festival time, they will not be able to celebrate.

---||Hyderabad||After Karnataka & Andhra Pradesh, neem trees in Telangana hit by ‘dieback’ disease||HYDERABAD: After causing havoc in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, ‘dieback’, a fungal disease, is now inflicting neem trees in Telangana. Thousands of trees have been hit badly in Warangal, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal, Mahbubnagar, Gadwal and other districts. A neem tree begins to dry up and its yield is hit once the fungus infects the tree. Ironically, neem that has become synonymous with providing good health to other trees, animals and people through its twigs, leaves, flowers, bark, seeds and fruits has been dying due to the rare pest first identified about three decades ago. Neem is a natural pesticide and now it has become a victim of the pest that attacks only neem trees. The infection caused by the fungus, technically called ‘phomopsis azadirachtae’, often kills the neem trees, particularly the old ones. The younger and stronger neem trees, however, survive the attack even though their branches dry up. According to experts, the fungal infection attacks after stemborer insect leaves holes in the branches. High humidity and change in climatic conditions are also blamed on the increase in attacks by the dieback fungus. In Hyderabad, scores of neem trees in Alkapur township are drying up with the infection killing the branches. Fresh cases of dieback infection were reported from Warangal city causing concern among environment activists. Though the infection was noticed more than two decades ago in Karnataka, it began invading neighbouring Rayalaseema in the last five years. From Rayalaseema, it entered Telangana. World Wide Fund (WWF) Telangana state director Farida Tampal emphasised the need for a thorough scientific study to pinpoint the actual reasons behind the spread of the dieback infection. She, however, felt that the neem tree has the inherent capability to fight back and survive the pest without any external intervention. “I have requested botanists and other experts to study the problem,” Farida told TOI, adding that she had been receiving numerous reports of dieback infection of late. She blamed humidity and climate change as some of the reasons for the infection in neem. Farida said apart from the dieback disease, neem is plagued by an epiphyte ‘loranthus’. She said this parasitic tree grows on the neem and draws its nutrition, depriving the main plant of its food. This ultimately kills the neem tree, she said. Senior scientist K Girish said the dieback disease is widespread and infects neem trees of all sizes and ages. Apart from fruit rot, it causes twig blight in neem. “Once infected, the fruit production falls drastically affecting several rural communities economically as they depend on neem seed,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-ktaka-ap-neem-trees-in-t-hit-by-dieback-disease/articleshow/87473498.cms||Syed Akbar

Police arrested the 31-year-old man Saeed Shaikh who had earlier claimed that his son Jakir accidentally fell from the Vivekananda bridge while clicking a selfie on Sunday. Jakir’s body was fished out by the fire department on Monday near Shital Cross Road on the river bank. “We suspected some wrongdoing as it was difficult to believe Shaikh’s claim that the boy was sitting on the bridge’s parapet wall,” said a police officer in Rander police station. Investigation so far revealed that Shaikh had developed a bitter dispute with his wife after which she went to live with her parents in Chikhli of Buldhana in Maharashtra five years ago. “Shaikh wanted to harm the child to take revenge from his wife as she did return. He tried hurting the child in the past too,” said a police official. He brought the boy to the city against the wishes of his wife, and on Sunday, he told his son that they will go to buy crackers.

They also hope to enable these volunteers to act as torch-bearers in their respective communities to prevent and arrest the spread of Covid-19. “These hygiene kits will not only help them but also inculcate in them proper hygiene habits, necessary during this pandemic,” said Bandaru Dattatreya, governor of Haryana, while inaugurating the event. While thanking the GHMC and UNICEF for their support, Arun Daniel Yellamaty, founder of Youngistaan, pointed out how garbage collectors do a lot for the community and are more vulnerable during this pandemic. “We will keep working with them even in the coming days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1500-hygiene-kits-given-to-garbage-collectors/articleshow/87473506.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Stairway to Gabbar hilltop at Ambaji to be restored||AHMEDABAD: The path leading from the pilgrimage town of Ambaji to the Gabbar hilltop is set to get a refreshing look with the temple authority taking up restoration and renovation work of the age-old footsteps along the trekking route. Confirming the development, S J Chavda, general manager of Shri Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust (SAAMDT) said plans are in place to restore and renovate the footpath that commences from Ambaji town and the 1,400-odd footsteps leading to the hilltop where the seat of the goddess Amba is believed to be originally located. “We do not know the exact age of these footsteps as they are very old. The project cost of rebuilding and restoring the existing footsteps is about Rs 15 crore. This is for the first time that such an exercise is being carried by the trust,” said Chavda. Over the years, the footsteps have worn out and rebuilding them will give respite to a large number of devotees who take the foot journey every year for darshana at Gabbar hilltop. Although there is a ropeway to reach Gabbar, many pilgrims prefer to walk their way to the top. The temple has seen a huge surge in donations recently with weekly contributions doubling as compared to pre-Covid times. From about Rs 30 lakh of weekly donations in pre-Covid times it touched Rs 60 lakhs in the first week of September. One of the main reasons for this has been the lakhs of pilgrims who took a journey on foot to the famous temple shrine. Every year this ritual takes place during Bhadarvi Poonam when the fortnightlong mela is organized at Ambaji. This year about 30 lakh devotees participated in the Bhadarvi Poonam mela, according to Chavda. In 2019, about 23 lakh devotees visited the Shakti Peeth on Bhadarvi Poonam and contributions to the tune of Rs 4.5 crore were received in this period. The contributions had plummeted last year due to Covid-19 related restrictions. According to the Indian scriptures, Gabbar Tirth, situated on the banks of river Saraswati in the hills of Arasur in Ambica forest is one of the 51 Shakti Piths in India. Devotees of Goddess Amba can undertake the entire pilgrimage of Shaktipeeths or temples as their replicas have been built about a decade ago, closer to the footsteps. The replicas include Hingula in Pakistan, Chattal, Kartopatat and Sugandha in Bangladesh, Indrakshi in Sri Lanka, Gandaki and Guhyashwori Peeth in Nepal and Mansarovar in Tibet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stairway-to-gabbar-hilltop-at-ambaji-to-be-restored/articleshow/87473518.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Meerut||Meerut: Message for Covid 'vaccination certificate' sent to kin of dead||MEERUT: Despite getting the first dose of Covid vaccine on March 20, Manju Goel (62) succumbed to the deadly virus on April 25. Similarly, Bhagchand Jain (69) got his first dose on March 16, but he, too, died of Covid on March 29. However, their families received SMSes informing them they have received their second dose a few days ago — almost six months after their deaths. To add to the families' pain, the health department in Uttar Pradesh's Meerut passed it off as "just a clerical error". “I received a message on my mother’s phone that she got her second Covid vaccination dose on October 29 - almost six months after her death. Initially, I thought that someone was trying to misuse her identity. But when I contacted the health department, they casually reported it as a clerical error,” said Manju Goel's son, Gaurav. Vineet Jain, son of Bhagchand Jain, also faced a similar situation after his 12-year-old son informed him about the SMS on his grandfather's mobile. “This came as such a rude joke for all of us. I tried to contact the health department. They only said that the matter will be probed,” Jain told TOI, while showing his dead father’s vaccination certificate. When contacted on Monday, chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Akhilesh Mohan said, “It seems to be a mistake as people with similar names were waiting for their second doses. The person uploading the data must have got confused with the same names.” This is not the first such case reported in the area. Earlier, the family of a 26-year-old girl, who had died in June, was informed that she had got her second shot in September. The health department had constituted an inquiry in the case and at that time, too, concluded that it was a "clerical error".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/six-months-after-their-deaths-families-of-2-covid-victims-get-smses-claiming-theyve-got-second-vax-dose/articleshow/87472598.cms||Ishita Mishra

The UoH has recently constituted a 13-member committee, headed by Prof Vinod Pavarala from the school of communications, on implementation of the NEP 2020. The committee has been given a brief to formulate a detailed roadmap for phase-wise implementation of NEP and work with all schools, departments and centres at the university to put together new programmes and corresponding structures where necessary. Setting the target of March 15 for bringing all such new initiatives to the academic council of the university for approval, UoH vice-chancellor professor BJ Rao announced that they would be implemented in the 2022-2023 academic year. At a meeting with heads and deans of the university, Rao had shared the university’s resolve to implement the NEP with all its key features for higher education, including multiple entry/exit options, more short-term programmes, mobility of credits across institutions, and enhanced internationalisation. “This would be done to the extent possible without disturbing the academic integrity of the institution and by incorporating the flexibility and autonomy offered by NEP to take the UoH to the next level,” the vice-chancellor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uohs-nep-initiatives-from-next-academic-yr/articleshow/87473502.cms||---

Surat city cybercrime sleuths nabbed a Cameroon national from Bangaluru on Tuesday for his alleged involvement in the online scamming racket. The accused identified as Nyongabsen Hilary Sylvester Dunga (24), works as a French language translator for a private company. He was arrested based on complaint filed by the 28-year-old woman who works in the IT sector. Police said that Dunga operated the bank account in which money from the victims was deposited. “Dunga worked as a translator and in his spare time, he managed the bank account for the gang. There are others involved in the online racket and we are working to nab them,” said a police officer of the Surat cybercrime police station. City police commissioner Ajay Tomar told TOI, “The victim was lured into buying a puppy of Golder Retriever online. We request people to act responsibly while doing financial transactions online.” According to case details, the victim, a woman, was searching online to buy a Golden Retriever puppy. She found a website selling puppies and when she clicked on the link she was directed to some other website where the puppy was available for Rs 13,000. Here she was asked to submit her details online, which she did. Soon after submitting details, the woman was contacted by a person over WhatsApp who asked her to transfer the money to a bank account. After the woman transferred Rs 13,000, she was informed that she will have to pay more money for insurance, her license as breeder and other charges. “Trusting the seller the woman paid the money. She was promised that the additional money will be returned to her after the puppy is delivered. But the woman never got the puppy, nor did she get her money back,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-cheated-of-rs-9l-with-lure-of-rs-13000-pup/articleshow/87494527.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Sunil Jadhav, the deputy chief public relations officer of MSEDCL, Aurangabad division, said penal action in such case, along with recovery of dues, has helped the state power utility collect revenue worth Rs 13.4 crore. “A special drive against power theft was conducted across Marathwada between April and September. A total of 1,829 suspected electricity meters were inspected during the drive, of which, 880 meters were found to be involved in power theft,” he said. Among three zones that have jurisdiction over the eight districts in Aurangabad division, Aurangabad zone has reported the highest number of power thefts (379), followed by Latur (255) and Nanded (246).  As per the section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003, in case of detection of ‘Unauthorized Use of Energy (‘UUE”), tariff equal to twice the tariff applicable for the relevant category is recovered if the MSEDCL authorities reach to the conclusion that unauthorised use of electricity has taken place. The section 135 of the act stipulates for initiating police action among other stern actions. “The drive against power theft would continue in future too. All consumers, especially those from rural areas are requested to refrain from indulging in illegal drawing of power. Such notorious act is not only an offence, but can also involves potential danger to human lives,” Jadhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mwada-msedcl-exposes-880-power-thefts/articleshow/87471746.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The elated topper said the fact that no one pressurised him to study or follow a particular timetable actually helped him to prepare for the test at his convenience and secure the first rank. But hours of confusion preceded the celebrations on Monday as NTA, which conducted the test, emailed the results to every candidate even before there was an official confirmation on the release of the results. This started from around 6 pm when many could not access their results on the official NEET website. “It would have been better if the results were made available on the website first. I was very tense as I couldn’t access my results, but all my friends got theirs,” said Rushil, a student from Sri Chaitanya, Vijayawada. He is one of 12 students from the country to secure all-India 5th rank. Rushil said he could access his results only around 9 pm. The institutes too said that students were anxious as they couldn’t access their results on the website. “It took us more than two hours to figure out that the topper was from our institute. The servers were down,” said K Seshagiri Raju, deputy director, Aakash Educational Services Limited (Telangana). Meanwhile, four students from Telangana-- Kasa Lahari, Emani Srinija, Dasika Sri Niharika, and Pasupunoori Sharanya — secured a spot in the list of top 20 female toppers in the country. Another Telugu student, Adireddi Srinivas, made it to top 10 male (person with disabilities) candidates list while several others from the two states figured in the toppers list in categories such as EWS, SC, ST, and OBC-NCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/confusion-for-hours-as-nta-mailed-results/articleshow/87473517.cms||---

The three, Subhajit Ghosh of Chandannagar, Sanat Das of Chinsurah and Biplab Dhole of Amta, had to spend 72 hours under snow cover. They had set out for Mayali Pass —which is often crossed by trekkers heading towards Kedarnath — on October 11. “The weather was good for the first five days and we reached the Upper Chowki area on October 16. We had crossed the Bhilangana river and it seemed easy. Little did we know what was in store for us,” said Ghosh. On October 16, the three snuggled inside their sleeping bags for the last time as weather started getting wet in the wee hours of October 17. Occasional rains are no exception in the mountains and the trekkers decided to move forward to the Mayali Pass. Around 10.30am the snowfall started and continued for the next 72 hours. “On October 18 morning we realized that everything was soaked in water. The temperature outside was - 12°C. Water continued to drip from the tent ceiling and we could not lie down for the next 24 hours. Nobody moved and we thought it was an end for us,” Ghosh said. “Avalanche started after a few hours and ice slabs started crashing on the ground. We got terrified with the deafening sounds,” said Dhole.  For the next 24 hours the three trekked continuously and stopped for small breaks. They reached the Bhilangana river and set up a tent. But the group was not out of danger yet. On October 21, they reached the Gangi area, 10 days after they had left the place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/close-shave-for-3-trekkers-trapped-in-72hr-snowfall/articleshow/87473516.cms||Rohit Khanna

There are around 8,000 teachers, 5,000 nurses, paramedics and health workers and thousands of other staff employed under the north corporation whose salaries have been delayed for two months. Opposition leader Vikas Goel said they raised the matter of pending salaries in a standing committee meeting last week, but the BJP-led north corporation had no answer. “They always give an excuse that Delhi government is not releasing the funds, but they never explain why they have failed to increase their revenue? And when there is no money, why are they waiving concessionaires’ revenue from advertisement and parking for Covid period?” he wondered. “We have Dhanteras, followed by Diwali, Bhai Duj, Govardhan puja and Chhath puja. But forget about bonuses, the north corporation has no money to pay even salaries,” said Goel further. The north corporation’s leader of house, Chhail Bihari Goswami, said if the opposition party was so concerned then they should pay the pending transfer duty rather than doing politics for votes. “We are making all efforts to arrange the employees’ salaries for September and October.” A group of teachers and horticulture department staff also held a protest nearby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-councillors-lead-protest-against-pending-salaries-of-n-corpn-staff/articleshow/87474300.cms||Vibha Sharma

We have shown this by implementing it in Delhi,” Kejriwa told reporters in Dona Paula a few hours after landing in the state on his third visit this year. This is the third promise that the AAP convener has made to Goans in as many visits. During his last visit in September, Kejriwal had promised employment to every youth, Rs 3,000 per month to one youth of the family till they get employed, Rs 5,000 per month to families left unemployed because of tourism and mining shutting down, to set up a skill university and 80% job reservation for Goa’s youths. Kejriwal had kickstarted the party’s campaign in July by announcing 300 units of free electricity per month to every Goan family along with a waiver of pending electricity bills and free power for agricultural purposes. He also accused BJP of protecting chief minister Pramod Sawant from corruption allegations made by the former governor of Goa Satya Pal Malik. “The allegations made by Satyapal Malik ji are very serious, but what is sad is that BJP is trying to save its chief minister. This means that it is openly encouraging corruption,” Kejriwal said. “This is the first time in 75 years since India’s independence that a governor has accused a chief minister of his own party of corruption. Satya Pal Malik ji is a very mature person. He has vast experience. The good thing is that he has shown the courage to talk about the rampant corruption in his party’s government,” he said. Hitting out at both BJP and Congress for indulging in corruption, he said the two parties haven’t sent anyone to jail on corruption charges and assured of doing so if AAP forms the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kejriwal-woos-goa-voters-with-free-pilgrimage-offer/articleshow/87474298.cms||---

After the ban was imposed on the sale and bursting of firecrackers till January 1, 2022 to combat air pollution, the licensing unit of Delhi Police stated that no new licences would be issued for sale of crackers and even licences of permanent shops would be cancelled in case they violated the norms. Senior police officers said firecrackers were not available in the capital, but the porous borders of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana make it easy for people to bring them to Delhi. Leftover stock as well as some brought illegally from factories producing them clandestinely were being brought by the accused men. DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said, “We have been doing constant surprise checks in several markets. Cops have been deployed in plainclothes at some locations. We seized 1,174 kilograms of firecrackers in three cases. These people were bringing the crackers from the bordering states to sell in the city.” In east Delhi, 81.1kg of firecrackers were seized with the arrest of four people in as many instances. “People are mainly getting smaller quantities to sell it in their known circle, but our teams have been working round the clock to ensure the ban is not violated. Most of the accused said they were doing this to earn quick money,” said DCP (East) Priyanka Kashyap. Earlier, an employee at a five-star hotel was arrested by Central district police while trying to sneak in crackers from Faridabad. He wanted to sell it during Diwali in the Walled City, which is a shopper’s paradise during the festive season and is usually packed with visitors. This makes it easier for people to quietly sell the crackers. Several police teams have been deployed in the markets and announcements are being made to alert people that strong action would be taken against violators. A 33-year-old Noida-based shopkeeper was arrested from Hazrat Nizamuddin in southeast Delhi for allegedly carrying 21.7kg firecrackers in his vehicle despite the ban, police said on Sunday. The vehicle used for carrying the firecrackers was seized from the accused, Heera Lal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4000kg-firecrackers-seized-so-far-by-police-26-arrested/articleshow/87474315.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Consumer court reprieve for jeweller in gold resale||VADODARA: You cannot be considered a consumer if you are selling the gold to the same jeweller from whom you had purchased the yellow metal earlier. This interesting observation about when a person can be called a consumer and until when does the liability lies on the seller was pointed out by a consumer court here while deciding a woman’s complaint filed against a prominent jeweller from the city. The woman named Bharati Mahale, a resident of Tarsali, had complained to the consumer court in 2009 that the jeweller who has a showroom on Jetalpur Road had purchased 40 grams of gold at the price of Rs 13,700 for 10 grams while the market rate was Rs 14,300. She said that due to the jeweller’s lower price, she suffered a loss of Rs 2,400, so she requested the court to help her get the amount along with compensation of Rs 25,000. The gold that Mahale had sold to the jeweller in February 2009 was purchased from the same showroom in August 2008. In response to Mahale’s complaint, the jeweller argued that the price of gold keeps fluctuating in the bullion market throughout the day and at the time when she purchased the gold, the price was Rs 13,700. The jeweller then questioned Mahale’s case that how can she be called a consumer because she had sold the gold and made a profit. It was also argued that Mahale had sold the gold by her own consent. The consumer forum considered the jeweller’s argument and turned down Mahale’s case. The court also noted that although the jeweller is a trader, but in the context of Mahale’s case, he is the consumer and since Mahale had sold the gold and made profit, she cannot be called a consumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/consumer-court-reprieve-for-jeweller-in-gold-resale/articleshow/87473543.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata jewellers expect steady dip in gold price to drive Dhanteras sales||KOLKATA: Jewellers in Kolkata are anticipating good sales for Dhanteras on Tuesday as the price of gold has dropped by nearly Rs 400 per 10-gram in the past few days. The dip in price has prompted many people to buy more gold this time. With the demand being expected to surge for the wedding season, jewellers hope for sales like pre-Covid times this Dhanteras. The situation looks better as enquiries for heavy jewellery and bridal collections have already started pouring in. Ajoy Chawla, CEO (jewellery division) of the Titan Company Ltd, feels that consumers are celebrating small milestones in their lives now. “Pent-up demand, the overall festive mood and wedding purchases are converging to create a surge in both gold and diamond categories,” he said. The marriage season, which contributes to the largest chunk of gold sales, is scheduled to start from November 15. Jewellers in the city feel that vaccination drives, along with a declining number of active cases, are gradually making an impact on the lives of people. “Gold prices have come down by nearly Rs 8,000 per 10-gram in the past six-seven months. What can be a better time to buy jewellery especially for marriages? We are witnessing that trend now,” said Rupak Saha, zonal member of Gem and Jewellery Trade Council of India. In the past seven days, gold price has reduced from Rs 47,470 per 10-gram to Rs 47,100 on Monday. “Since the marriage season is round the corner, people are making most of the offers provided by us for Dhanteras. A lot of people are also coming to buy gifts for the weddings,” said Anargha Uttiyo Chowdhury, director of Anjali Jewellers. Suvankar Sen, CEO, Senco Gold and Diamonds, said, “Our stores are expected to register an increase of 15%-20% in sales this Dhanteras. There are new collections, designs in gold, diamond, platinum for customers. We are encouraging everyone to return to the normal rhythm of life and planning to buy jewellery this festive season,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jewellers-expect-steady-dip-in-gold-price-to-drive-dhanteras-sales/articleshow/87473526.cms||Rohit Khanna

As per official data, around 3.64 lakh citizens aged above 18 years, of a total target population of 10.5 lakh, have so far received both doses of the vaccine. The number of beneficiaries, who have received at least one dose, has touched 6 lakh, which makes for 57% of the target population. Among different target groups, the population aged between 18 and 44 years has highest (1.55 lakh) fully vaccinated beneficiaries, followed by those aged between 45 and 59 years (1.02 lakh), senior citizens (60,895), frontline workers (25,293) and healthcare workers (20,863). Stating that the civic administration has sufficient stock of vaccine doses, health authorities have appealed to beneficiaries to get fully vaccinated at the earliest. “Although more than half of the target population has been at least partially vaccinated, a large number of citizens are still averse to undergo vaccination. The vaccine hesitancy among these citizens has no basis as it is scientifically proven that the vaccine is safe and offers the desired protection against Covid infection,” said Dr Paras Mandhlecha, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.

One of the buyers, Parimal Suthar, told police that the accused Hanni Dudhaiya finalized a deal of residential property in Bhayli with a couple living in Sankarda. On June 17 last year, he took Rs 5 lakh from the couple and prepared a bill of sale for Rs 15 lakh and got it notarized. Later he even gave possession of the property to the couple. But on October 6, Dudhaiya finalized another deal for the same property with Suthar. He took Rs 8 lakh from Suthar as a token amount and prepared a bill of sale for Rs 20 lakh. Later, when Suthar got to know that the property was already in possession of the couple, he asked Dudhaiya to return his money. But over the last one year when Dudhaiya did not return the money, he approached the police and an offence of cheating was registered at Vadodara Taluka police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/same-property-sold-to-two-by-kutch-broker/articleshow/87494540.cms||---

Wagh Bakri Tea group sponsored the project. CEE founder-director Kartikeya Sarabhai told TOI that it’s a great example of CSR for conservation of wildlife . “The new enclosures, made with specifications of the Central Zoo Authority guidelines, will be a great addition for visitors,” he said. The mini zoo was inaugurated by Bird Man of India Dr Salim Ali in 1979. The zoo houses over 10 species of snakes including pythons. Rishit Shroff, architect of the project, said that recycled containers were used to create frames of the enclosure. “We have kept the environs of each enclosure different based on the snake species. We have also arranged for climate control and natural sunlight,” he said. “The angles of the enclosures are such that the visitors would be able to see the snakes and pythons easily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-snake-house-at-sundarvan/articleshow/87473556.cms||---

---||Goa||Now, ‘tatkal’ system for same-day registration of property in Goa||PANAJI: Law minister Nilesh Cabral on Monday launched a ‘tatkal’ appointment service for instant property registration in the state. Property owners will be able to take out-of-turn appointments at the sub-registrar’s office and proceed with the property transaction on the same day. “Sometimes people are in a hurry because they may have forgotten or it is a last minute decision, but they don’t get time. We are launching the tatkal scheme for such instances where, after paying a special higher fee, a person can register the document on the same day itself,” Cabral said. He said that ever since the online system for property registration and registration of marriages started, the complaints from people have almost stopped. “Some things have been streamlined, but a lot more has to be streamlined,” the law minister said. “World over and in our own family, the registration department is known as the most corrupt department. I don’t have to say it and somehow we want to come out of it, at least in the state of Goa,” Cabral said while addressing the officers of the department at an event to mark Registration Day. The minister said that he has stayed away from corruption and has tried his best to keep the department’s officers away from corrupt practices by introducing online services. “I am not saying that we have succeeded 100%. It is not achievable. Sincerely we should take an oath ourselves. Temptations are at the door. We feel that money has to come through fast means and who the money comes from is immaterial. We have been striving to see how we can make the system open,” Cabral said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-tatkal-system-for-same-day-regn-of-property-in-state/articleshow/87474313.cms||---
---||Delhi||Celebrate Diwali without crackers, educate others: Delhi minister to school kids||NEW DELHI: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday urged schoolchildren to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali. Rai interacted with school students and teachers about the campaign ‘Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virudh’ and sought their support towards it. He appealed to the students to educate their peers and ensure that no one bursts crackers this year. Saying ‘diye se Diwali hoti hai, patakho se pradushan,’ Rai requested children to help reduce pollution in Delhi. Children have the most important role in this mission, the minister stated. “A lot of people say that the festival should have crackers. But in the first Diwali that our country celebrated, at the very beginning of this tradition, there were no crackers. It all started with the lighting of diyas. Crackers came into existence much later and got assimilated. Slowly, we started considering them as a part of our culture. We need to return to our old tradition and light more diyas. Both diya and Diwali start with ‘D’, while both pollution and patakhe (crackers) start with ‘P’. We need to remember this, and also spread the message to everyone around us,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic body plans four more ponds for Chhath rituals||KOLKATA: With Rabindra Sarobar remaining out of bounds for Chhath devotees and amid apprehension of large-scale gathering at major ghats along the Hooghly, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) brass on Monday approved creation of four artificial ponds for performing Chhath rituals. While two of these ponds will come up in Tollygunge, the other two will be created in the Ballygunge area. According to a KMC parks and squares department official, the civic brass on Monday gave nod to create four artificial ponds for Chhath devotees — one each at Panditiya Road, Jamir Lane (Ballygunge), Deshapran Sashmal Road and Jhaldar Math (Tollygunge). These places were selected as the neighbourhoods lack natural water bodies. These areas have a large concentration of Chhath devotees, pointed out a civic official. Over the next few days, the civic body will need to send around 200 water tankers — each with 5,000 litres — to fill up these four ponds up. Of the four makeshift ponds, the one to be dug up at Tentultala ground off Panditiya Road will be the largest one. Here, KMC will help create a huge temporary reservoir measuring 65ftx45ft. Three tankers measuring 30ftx25ft will come up at other selected places. The initiative was first taken by Debasish Kumar at Panditiya Road in 2019. Next year, Ballygunge ward coordinator Sudarshana Mukherjee replicated the idea and created an artificial tanker at Jamir Lane. “Today, we have obtained a green signal for digging four temporary reservoirs. We shall keep these reservoirs ready by November 9,” said a KMC engineering department senior official. The NGT had announced a ban on Chhath rituals at Rabindra Sarobar in 2017. But the ban was largely ignored that year and in 2018 in spite of the local authorities attempts to enforce it. According to a KMC official, the civic body faces a twin challenge this year as a fresh spike in Covid cases has made it mandatory for the civic body to discourage large-scale gatherings at ghats along the Hooghly. “We are keeping our arrangements ready for the devotees at major ghats but we need to motivate Chhath devotees to take advantage of either the natural ponds or artificially created ones for performing their two-day rituals beginning from November 10,” said a KMC official who has been assigned to look after Chhath festival at the Hooghly ghats. Besides, major ghats along the Hooghly — such as Ahiritolla ghat, Bagbazar ghat, Bajekadamtolla ghat and Doi ghat — KMC will create over 130 ghats across the city around natural water bodies for Chhath devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-plans-four-more-ponds-for-chhath-rituals/articleshow/87473538.cms||Saikat Ray

Taking a serious note of the incident, Amroha SP Poonam suspended SHO Satersh Kumar and constables Rahul Kumar and Sumit Kumar for “dereliction of duty”. The girl’s family had alleged that she was raped by one Monu Sharma of their village on September 25. The police failed to arrest him despite registering a rape case against him. Sharma and two of his relatives were threatening the girl, they claimed. Sharma and his relatives were arrested on Monday and murder charge has been slapped against them, the SP said. The probe has been handed over to the additional superintendent of police, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/day-after-minor-rape-survivor-is-found-hanging-3-cops-suspended/articleshow/87472651.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Goa||Goa govt doctors set to offer consultations on phone||PANAJI: Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, launched telemedicine — a digital platform for patients to access medical help without having to wait in a queue — at a function held at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), on Monday. The Union minister said a similar initiative had been launched in Nagpur, Maharashtra, and proved very effective during the Covid-19 pandemic, specially for the people of Gadchiroli, a tribal and underdeveloped district. Gadchiroli is more than double the size of Goa and is covered by dense forests. “The people of Gadchiroli are economically, socially, and educationally backward,” Gadkari said. “During the pandemic, they faced a lot more problems as the nearest hospital was in Nagpur with a travel time of five to six hours. Naturally, travelling that far was an issue, but with the help of technology, we have tried to reach them,” the Union minister said. “Telemedicine is an important platform to provide relief to poor patients, particularly those who do not have a health care facility.” Chief minister Pramod Sawant said having a telemedicine platform will not just help in early diagnosis and treatment, but will also save time and lives. “I expect the GMC doctors to treat the project as their own to help the whole state, particularly people living in villages who find it difficult to travel to the GMC,” he said. Recounting how several people had lost their lives to Covid-related complications as they were unable to seek timely medical help during the pandemic, he said telemedicine would be of great help in those types of situations. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the whole idea was to take healthcare to the doorsteps of the people. “The launch of a telemedicine service at the GMC will not alone boost health care centres in the state, but will give people access to quick consultation. The pandemic has taught us to look at the whole healthcare scenario differently,” he said. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said the GMC’s outpatient department had remained shut for almost two years due to the pandemic, affecting several chronic patients seeking timely consultation. As a result, many patients — particularly those suffering from strokes and cancer — presented late with severe symptoms. “As we reopened non-Covid OPDs, we saw a lot of patients with strokes and delayed oncological problems. This new facility will help patients who cannot visit a hospital,” Bandekar said. Dhiraj Sharma, who aided the GMC in setting up the telemedicine platform said it would catapult the state’s premier healthcare institute into a new league. “This is the first instance of any government institute or a medical college introducing a telemedicine facility, whereby doctors will be available to patients at the touch of a button,” he said. “The telemedicine platform will allow decongestion of the tertiary care hospital. A day will come when the senior GMC doctors will able to devote time for research and writing medical papers of the toughest cases, while junior doctors will do procedures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-doctors-set-to-offer-consultations-on-phone/articleshow/87474334.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Delhi||Potters in Delhi hope wheel has turned full circle||NEW DELHI: With Diwali only a couple of days away, potters at Uttam Nagar’s Kumhar Colony are hoping they will be able to revive a business that has been almost dormant since the Covid coronavirus travelled to Delhi in March last year. The demand for earthen lamps, idols and other items, the potters say, isn’t what it used to be in pre-pandemic times, but the takings are better than last year. When TOI approached Sunita Bansiwal at the colony on Monday, between rushed forays from home to shop to home, she said, “Business has been good this time.” Bansiwal, who has been involved in the family business for over a decade now, said, “We are on our way to recovery. Thankfully, there is a good demand this year and business has improved immensely since last year. People have shown a bigger interest in decorative items this time.” In place of the usually humble and plain lamps, there were colourful diyas on display. Families apparently have been painting the diyas to attract more customers and cater to the changing demands. “Earlier, the plain diyas sold well at Diwali, but that is not the case now,” said Shyam Sunder, who has been in the business since 1978. “People want painted items and so we have had to repackage our products. If we offer coloured diyas instead of the natural mud ones, we are able to gain a few extra rupees. This is welcome because business has been really poor in the past two years.” Stating that the pandemic had affected the potters immensely, Sundar added, “I will need four more years of decent business before I can put the losses I have suffered during the pandemic behind me. Last year, there was absolutely nothing in terms of earnings. Now we are trying our best to restore our business. Our products are often sold online or by retailers at ten times the price, but we don’t have a share in that profit.” Another colony potter Phoolchand added, “This year, there was a lot of rainfall in the city which hampered our work. While sales are picking up, the situation is actually still grim for us. Some of us will need 10-15 years to recover, especially those who ended up selling their house and property to meet their mounting debts.” For 17-year-old Sangeeta, who helps her family with the business when she doesn’t have school, things appear better now. “The customers have started coming again. Our family does not make diyas, but there are many other earthen items that we make, such as stools and potpourris,” she said, before adding with a relieved sigh, “Fortunately for us, the demand for such products has been good in recent months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/potters-hope-wheel-has-turned-full-circle/articleshow/87474347.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Vadodara||Dengue cases spike in Vadodara, symptoms more severe||VADODARA: The city is reeling under an unprecedented dengue wave. Not only are the numbers historically high, but if doctors are to be believed, the symptoms are unexpected and severe this year. Till Monday, the city had seen 2,177 officially confirmed dengue cases. The numbers include only those cases that were confirmed by an ELISA test and not those who tested positive in rapid tests. In the outbreak in 2016, the city had seen 1,514 dengue cases. After this, the only time when the city witnessed dengue in four figures before the this year was in 2019 when 1,247 cases were reported. VMC officials said that the disease had not reached unprecedented levels in the community. “The numbers seem higher due to better ttesting and better reporting,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. Apart from higher numbers, doctors in the city point out that some symptoms that were not common in Dengue earlier were more prevalant this time. “Neurological, lung and lever involvement was more prevalent this time,” said infectious diseases expert Dr Hiten Kareliya. He said he had come across cases with in which kidneys get infected, cystitis of the urinary bladder, lever abscess, meningitis and some other conditions. “In previous years, classic symptoms were fever, rashes and reduction in platelets,” he said. Dr Niraj Chawda of Nand Hospital also said this time there were not many cases of haemorrhagic fever. “We have come acrosss cases of lung involvement and encephilitis,” said Chawda. Dr Chawda added one of the reasons for the severe symptoms could be that some persons were getting infected the second time. “The disease in severe in such cases. Dengue was not very prevalent in the city till a few years back. There are chances that some people are getting infected the second time as a larger population has already been infected once,” he said. A VMC health official said, “The way Covid-19 can effect organs in the long term is well-known. Severe or unusual dengue cases may have had Covid earlier, but there is no record on this,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dengue-cases-spike-symptoms-more-severe/articleshow/87473567.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Varanasi||Banaras Hindu University scientists decipher link between diabetes and Covid-19||VARANASI: The scientists at Banaras Hindu University claimed to have deciphered the link between diabetes mellitus and SARS-Cov-2 infection through differential targeting of microRNA in the human pancreas. The associate professor of Bioinformatics at the Mahila Mahavidyalaya of BHU, Dr Rajeev Mishra and his team of research scholar Bhavya and ex-researcher Dr Ekta Pathak investigated the link between diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The finding was published in the ‘Journal of Endocrinological Investigation’, a reputed Springer-Nature. According to Dr Mishra, a correlation has been found between diabetes and the SARS-Co-V-2 infection as a part of this study. The researchers led by him have examined the RNA from single-cell infected pancreatic infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. “There is some evidence to suggest that therapeutically useful artificial microRNAs can be created and injected into infected cells so that they bind to and inhibit viral genome function and differential targeting of host cell micro RNAs, as demonstrated in our study,” he said. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has been found in a variety of human organs, including the pancreas, and Covid-19 patients with diabetes have the highest fatality rates, he added. According to him, the hospitalised Covid-19 patients show the highest mortality with diabetes as comorbidity. “In this work, we have investigated the role of human pancreas microRNAs in linking diabetes to Covid-19. We have noted that in the SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreas tissue, 26 and 4 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. Among them, we have found that four up-regulated genes are associated with type 1 diabetes while two up-regulated genes are associated with the term “insulin”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-scientists-decipher-link-between-diabetes-and-covid-19/articleshow/87474336.cms||---

Dr Amit Patwa, principal investigator (chemistry) and Dr Parth Pandya, principal investigator (life sciences) have been awarded Rs 40 lakh funding under core research grant for their project on ‘oligonucleotide amphiphile based supramolecular systems for targeted drug delivery for cancer therapeutics’. The project is mainly focused on the design and synthesis of novel molecules for targeted cancer treatment. According to the duo, current therapies for cancer treatment are beset with side effects. Designing a novel molecule for targeting these cells is therefore the need of the hour. “Our research will open new avenues of selectively targeted therapy using these novel molecules,” they said. Besides a junior research fellow, the investigators will also involve masters and PhD students of the School of Science in the project to expose them to cutting-edge research. Patwa did his PhD from National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, pursued post-doctoral research at Bordeaux, France for more than five years and at Boston University, United States. He is currently working as an assistant professor at NU. A PhD in zoology, Pandya is working as an assistant professor and has an ongoing DST project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/researchers-bag-goi-grant-to-study-cancer-treatment/articleshow/87473587.cms||---

Stating that it was an attempt to “distort history,” SFI said, “Savarkar, who not only wrote mercy petitions on multiple occasions and expressed his notorious wish to the British by giving an undertaking that he shall refrain from participating in any struggle for freedom, deserves no glorification.” Further, the statement read, “SFI DU strongly opposed this proposal of naming colleges after Savarkar and will continue to expose the hypocrisy of RSS-BJP.” Neeraj Kundan, national president of NSUI, said, “If DU has to name the college, then they can keep it after Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose, Indira Gandhi and Pranab Mukherkjee, who are eminent personalities in India.

---||Goa||‘Will approve electricity-based public transport system in Goa’||PANAJI: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Monday asked CM Pramod Sawant to plan an entirely electricity-powered public transport system for the state. Gadkari said that his ministry would grant funds for the project. Gadkari said that even the possibility of using technology like Elon Musk’s futuristic magnetically levitating pods should be considered. “Shirodkar (Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar) said Goa should get a metro. The PM has now handed me responsibility of rope-way, cable car, funicular railway as well,” Gadkari told Sawant. “You must be aware that Elon Musk has unveiled a new technology using which you will be able to travel between Delhi and Mumbai within two hours in pods. You now plan Goa’s transport system entirely on electricity, and submit the proposal to me and I assure (you) my support,” the Union minister told the CM after Shirodkar demanded that Goa should get a metro train. He said that Goa should also explore new research findings for implementation, like the use of old tyre shreds in roads to reduce costs massively. “There is a T-road near the Goa airport which acts as a bottleneck, and I have already told officials to come up with a solution for it. We can either construct a vehicular underpass or flyover and make the junction signal-free soon,” said Gadkari. He said he was happy that the new bridge over the River Mandovi has resolved the issue of traffic jams. “Whatever Manohar Parrikar proposed for Goa’s development, I agreed to,” he said. “He wanted the new bridge approved over the River Mandovi. I told him I could approve central funds, yet he said he would get it done with state funds. When he got ill, he told me now Goa does not have funds to complete the project. My secretary said it is difficult to provide central funds now to complete a state project. But I told him it has to be done as it is Parrikar’s last wish to see the bridge ready. I then allotted Rs 400 crore for the Mandovi bridge project.” The decision to construct the new airport at Mopa was also taken under Parrikar as CM, said Gadkari. “Several hurdles surfaced. Once this airport is complete, there is the need for a link road. Actually, construction of the road had to be carried out by the state. But Pramod Sawant came to me and said how will we raise so much money. So, we declared this road national highway and spent Rs 1,200 for construction of this six-lane 6km-long elevated road,” said Gadkari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-approve-electricity-based-public-transport-system-in-goa/articleshow/87474344.cms||---

Chief medical officer (CMO) Kanpur Nagar Dr Nepal Singh said that pathology samples of a 42 year-old woman from Shiv Katra, sent to the KGMU lab in Lucknow and National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune tested positive for Zika virus on Monday. So far, 11 people including three IAF staff from in Chakeri area have tested positive for Zika infection. “The surveillance team took the sample of the woman, who is asymptomatic, and sent it for test. She has been kept under observation. Samples of her family members, relatives and people in contact will be collected on Tuesday. Anti-larva spray, cleaning and fogging will also be done by the surveillance teams in the area,” said the CMO. In a statement, district magistrate Visakh G Iyer said that there is no need to panic. “Zika virus does not spread by contact or aerosols instead it is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which also causes dengue and chikungunya. It can easily be curtailed by strict surveillance and awareness,” he said. The DM also visited Shyam Nagar area from where cases of Zika virus have been reported.

---||Trichy||Petrochem project: AIADMK accuses DMK of double standard||Trichy: Opposition parties on Monday intensified their protest against the state government’s proposal to establish a petrochemical cluster at Nagapattinam with the AIADMK led by its coordinator and former chief minister O Panneerselvam slamming the DMK government for its ‘double standard’.MSME Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau (M-TIPB) called for a bid for preparing a detailed project report (DPR) at a cost of Rs 50 lakh for establishing the cluster. The government planned to establish the cluster around a 90 lakh tonnes capacity refinery being constructed by Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in Nagapattinam at an estimated cost of Rs 31,580 crore.Panneerselvam recalled chief minister M K Stalin’s queries on the protected Agriculture Special Zone Bill when he was the opposition leader. “Citing Section 4 (2) (6) in the Bill that the Act will not control ports, pipelines, road, telecom, energy, water supply and other utilities, the then opposition leader and the current chief minister asked what is the assurance that petrol and gas will not be brought under the other utilities. He also wanted to send the bill to the select committee,” said Panneerselvam.The AIADMK coordinator pointed out the remarks of the present minister for industries department Thangam Thennarasu as MLA in 2020, when he asked as to how the Act will prevent the multinational companies or ‘giants like Reliance’ from establishing petrochemicals, fertilizers and other chemical industries in the zone.“The DMK government is promoting a business that they were opposing before they came to power,” said OPS. Quoting a comment of a top official that petrochemicals do not figure in the list of banned industries, Panneerselvam suggested the state government to include petrochemical industries on the banned list by invoking Section 22 (2) of the The Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act, 2020.“People and the AIADMK want the state government to safeguard the zone by amending the Act by applying the provisions. Keeping in mind that the law is for the people but people are not for the law, the DMK government should drop the attempt to establish a petrochemical cluster,” said OPS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/petrochem-project-aiadmk-accuses-dmk-of-double-standard/articleshow/87474349.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Woman seeks transfer of case, withdraws plea later||Vadodara: In a fresh twist, the 24-year-old rape survivor law student filed an application in the district court to transfer the bail plea hearing of accused CA Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt to some other court. She alleged in the application filed on October 29 that Jain’s bail application was not being heard properly in the court of sixth additional district judge P T Patel and she feared that the accused may harm her if they come out of jail. However, by Monday evening, the girl withdrew her transfer application. “The complainant has filed another application to withdraw her transfer application. The court will decide on it now,” said Anil Desai, government pleader and added that he has been giving his best in the case’s hearings. The law student had alleged in the transfer application that government pleader Desai didn’t argue properly during the bail application of one of the accused. The girl has said in her application that Kanji Mokaria, who was arrested for helping rape accused Raju Bhatt in escaping from the city, was given bail by the court. “I had objected to the bail of Mokaria and filed an affidavit too. But government pleader Anil Desai didn’t argue properly during the bail hearing. Despite having strong evidence against him, Mokaria was granted bail and now rape accused CA Ashok Jain too has filed a bail application,” her application read. She further claimed that the possibilities of Jain getting bail too have increased and if he is released then he may kidnap and kill her as he is powerful. “I have no trust left in the court of the sixth additional district and sessions judge P T Patel and hence the bail hearing of Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt should be transferred to some other court,” her application stated. She added that if the bail hearing isn’t transferred to the other court then it will be injustice to her. “Jain’s bail application hearing was kept on Monday and the girl seems to have filed the transfer application to prejudice the case and ensure that he doesn’t get bail,” said advocate Hitesh Gupta, Jain’s lawyer. The rape survivor, who studies in a private university, has claimed that she was an intern at Jain’s CA firm and he had helped her get a flat in Diwalipura area where she was raped later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-seeks-transfer-of-case-withdraws-plea-later/articleshow/87473618.cms||---
---||Delhi||A Whole New World Reopens For Kids||New Delhi: Lovely Sharma moved up from primary to secondary school a year and a half ago. But the 12-year-old had the actual experience of new classes only on Monday, when her school reopened after the lengthy closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For the Class VII student, the priority on the first day was to make new friends and explore the school. On Monday, the institutions that resumed classes — with musts like separated seating, face masks and sanitisers — were mostly Delhi government and municipal corporations schools and smaller private ones. The bigger private schools plan to call back students only after Diwali. “My parents asked me to wait a few days, but I told them I had to return to school,” giggled Sharma. “Online classes posed a lot of problems.” Sharma studies in Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School at Sector 4, Ambedkar Nagar. While Sharma was eager to make new friends, Swati, also a Class VII student, already had friends and was eager to meet them. She excitedly babbled, “While entering the school, I saw a cycle, fountain and many things to play with.” Her principal, Aruna Anand, indulgently smiled, “You have lots to see. We have birds, rabbits, ducks, even a treehouse, in the school.” After the parents dropped the children at the gate, teachers checked the body temperature of the students and asked them to sanitisise their hands. The youngsters were escorted to the classes where a sole person sat per desk. They were also instructed to sit in the same seat and not change places and reminded not to share their food. All classes have been divided into two groups and each will attend classes in person three days a week. Despite these precautions, the attendees were still pleased to be back. Khushi,10, of Class IV narrated, “I got up at 7am to prepare for school. My papa dropped me.” She was wearing her sister’s old school uniform, but quickly explained, “My mother is taking me to buy the uniform after classes today.” At South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s primary school in Ghitorni, only 42 of the 778 students returned on Monday. For Dev Lohiya, it was his first day in the school, having only been admitted in Class V earlier this year from a small private school. “Papa ne wahan se naam katwa diya,” the youngster said. Ashish also transferred from a budget private school. “For online class, three of us were using one phone,” said the son of a security guard. The Class IV student happily spent most the day in the school’s new library. Teachers constantly shepherded the young children. There were no more than 12 kids in each class. For those who hadn’t carried food, the school arranged some snacks to avoid food sharing. Many parents of students who didn’t return on Monday visited the schools to inquire about the to-dos and schedules. At the SDMC primary school, parents got the consent form at the school gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-whole-new-world-reopens-for-kids/articleshow/87474370.cms||Shradha Chettri

With this, Kanpur became the 71st domestic city to be connected by IndiGo flights. The six new flights connecting Kanpur with the three metro cities will operate on all days except Sundays. On the occasion, Scindia said, “It is our endeavour that Kanpur emerges as a commercial centre so that it gets the title of ‘Manchester of the East’.” Referring to the revolutionary history of Kanpur, Scindia said, “It is a land of renunciation, penance and sacrifice. Kanpur has been given what it wanted, we will build a terminal building here in time.” “With the connectivity of the city with three major cities, the aircraft movement will jump from 20 to 41 per week, giving impetus to the industrial and business activities and also generate employment. As far as the infrastructure for aviation is concerned, the new terminal for the Kanpur city will be ready soon within the stipulated time at the cost of Rs 106 crores,” the minister said. Scindia said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s historic and far-sighted approach has led to the launch of UDAN scheme, which has enabled the common citizen also to fly on planes and brought about democratization of the sector. “The airfares have dipped substantially and are now less than long-haul trains. Under the scheme, 100 new airports will be constructed, and 1,000 new routes will be started,” he added. Scindia said that the country had just 75 airports earlier, but in the last seven years, 62 more airports have been added. Regarding Uttar Pradesh, he said that there were two operational airports in the state, but the number has now gone up to nine, covering 80 destinations. “Soon, the number of operational airports will jump to 15 in the state. There were only two international airports in Uttar Pradesh, and the third one was added recently in Kushinagar and soon two more at Ayodhya and Jewar will be coming up,” the minister said. Chief strategy and revenue officer, IndiGo, Sanjay Kumar, said: “These new routes will connect the Industrial City (Kanpur), which is also a major financial centre in the north, to the rest of the country through key hubs in western and southern India while augmenting trade and commerce within these regions.” Minister of state for rural development Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, minister for civil aviation, UP, Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’, minister for industrial development Satish Mahana and members of Parliament Satyadev Pachauri and Devendra Singh Bhole were present in the virtual event. The officials of the ministry of civil aviation, UP government and senior IndiGo executives were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/scindia-virtually-launches-flights-from-kanpur-to-mumbai-hyd-bengaluru/articleshow/87474362.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Meerut||Meerut police seize 117 bike engines from Sotiganj market||MEERUT: In a fresh raid on Sunday to crack down on two-wheeler theft, police discovered and seized 117 bike engines from one Mohd Afzal's house in Sotiganj market in the city. According to police sources, the engines -- ranging from 150cc to 500cc -- were hidden in trunks, boxes, and even a defunct washing machine. The police have identified a 13-member gang that steals two-wheelers primarily from Delhi-NCR, and subsequently, dismantle them. Seven engines have been identified, out of which six were from Delhi and one from Haryana, based on FIRs lodged, said Suraj Rai, additional superintendent of police. Rai has been leading the crackdown in the infamous Sotiganj market, where an entire car is known to be dismantled within 15 minutes once it has been stolen. The kingpin of the four-wheeler auto mafia here, Haji Galla, is already behind bars, along with his four sons. In all, 32 have been slapped with charges under the Gangster Act, and 17 have been charged under the Goonda Act. The police have now turned their attention to the two-wheeler mafia. They believe that the recovery of a large number of engines from just one house on Sunday could be the "tip of the iceberg". Notably, Delhi alone accounted for 35,019 auto thefts in 2020 (according to the National Crime Record Bureau's latest data), which is the highest in the country. The whopping figure was recorded at a time when the country was under strict lockdown for months altogether due to the Covid pandemic. In 2019, the figure was slightly higher at 46,725. "The number would be much higher per year if we include NCR districts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, from where stolen vehicles make their way to the Sotiganj market," Rai said. "It is not possible to ascertain the quantum of trade taking place here as two-wheeler engines and other spare parts are easier to hide, as compared to four-wheeler engines, because of their smaller size. We have raided just one house and that too on the main Sotiganj road. There would be many more in the bylanes," he added. As of now, 13 persons have been identified against whom cases will be registered and charges under the Gangsters Act have been slapped on them, Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/crackdown-on-auto-theft-police-seize-117-bike-engines-from-sotiganj-market/articleshow/87472673.cms||Sandeep Rai

Meanwhile, autorickshaw drivers are hoping that their business will revive with the reopening of schools.As the price of diesel has drastically surged on a par with petrol compared to the fuel price when the schools were open, the auto drivers have increased the travel fare for a student shuttling to and from school per month by around Rs 200.“Parents want to send their children in autorickshaws but the surge in fare is stopping them,” Arif Ahmed, a driver from Bhima Nagar said.

The family has made a rare rudra veena studded with American diamonds, hand painted and is covered with gold foil. This rudra veena, which depicts the epic Ramcharitramanas, the poetic classic written by Goswami Tulsidasji, was donated by a Delhi-based woman to Ram Katha preacher Morari Bapu on Sunday. Inspired by the beauty of rudra veena, which she had heard during a discourse by Morari Bapu, the Delhi-based woman had approached the Mistry family which is one the few families in the country involved in making of string instruments since 1873. “Rudra veena is a rare instrument of our country. In fact, it has very few players around the world. It is after 150 years, that we have made a hand-painted rudra veena,” said artist Dhaval Mistry, adding that his great grandfather Bapulal Chhotalal Mistry and the latter’s uncle Mansukh Raghunath had prepared a painted rudra veena before 150 years. “The devotee had approached us stating that she wanted a rudra veena which cannot be made for another 100 years. She had already made inquiries at Kolkata and Maharashtra, where there are traditional hubs that make classical musical instruments but nobody was ready to make such rudra veena,” said Mistry. “We have made this traditional rudra veena whose speciality is its dand which is made of bamboo and its frets that are fixed with the help of wax. Since, it was to be gifted to Morari Bapu who is known for his Ram Katha, we got it hand painted depicting ten episodes of Ramcharitramanas starting from Lord Ram’s birth to Lord Ram’s darbar. It has gold foil on the pumpkin and the dand,” Mistry, 30, who has also done masters in tabla from M S University’s Faculty of Performing Arts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/american-diamonds-studded-rudra-veena-donated-to-preacher/articleshow/87473637.cms||Prashant Rupera

The boxes were part of a game that helped the kids find their seats in the classroom. Each child had to choose a box that contained a picture of an animal. The teacher asked them to find the same picture pasted on the desks and the students had to match them to find their seats. Once seated, each of them had to imitate the sound or walking style of the animal they got and briefly talk about it. The game was one of the many activities planned by schools in the state as part of Praveshanotsavam. The education department directed the teachers to focus more on non-academic activities in the initial days, especially for small kids, to get them adjusted with the school atmosphere. “Besides the game, K N Kutty, a magician from Thripunithura, dressed up in a mascot costume to provide sanitizer to the students at the school gate. He carried posters and placards to create awareness about Covid protocols among the kids. We have set up a mini park for the kids with funds collected from the teachers,” said Sreelatha AK, headmistress of Government KMUPS, Eroor. In some schools, kids were seen wearing traditional Kerala attire as part of Kerala Piravi day.

---||Delhi||Delhi HC steps in, stays removal of 60-year-old peepal tree||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has stepped in to stay removal of a 60-year-old peepal tree on urgent plea of a lawyer who alleged it is illegally being cut. The court recently directed North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), Delhi Police and the office of deputy conservator of forest not to remove a 60-year-old peepal tree in Inderpuri till its next order. The high court acted on a letter petition seeking direction to NDMC, Delhi Police and the office of the deputy conservator of forest restraining them from cutting the tree. Moved by senior advocate N Hariharan, the plea said the tree near his residence is being illegally cut. The lawyer told the court that he was in a hearing in court when he was informed that the tree near his house was being cut. He then mentioned the matter and hastily drafted a handwritten petition seeking immediate intervention of the court. Justice Rekha Palli, in the order, noted that “In these circumstances, I am of the view that grave and irreparable harm will be caused not only to the environment but also to the residents of the locality if the said tree is permitted to be cut without examining the petitioner’s plea that the alleged action is not backed by any valid order.” The court further directed that till the next date, the authorities will ensure that the tree is not removed or harmed in any manner. The matter has been listed for further hearing on November 11. The Court noted that a formal petition incorporating the relevant facts and grounds is yet to be filed and granted time to the petitioner to do so. In response, NDMC submitted that an order has been passed by the office of deputy conservator of forest, permitting relocation of the said tree. However, the counsel for Delhi Police and the office of deputy conservator of forest could not inform the court if any such order was issued and sought time to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-steps-in-stays-removal-of-60-year-old-peepal-tree/articleshow/87474379.cms||---

He also suggested opting for organic farming in the region after setting up ‘Bundelkhand Organic Board’. Repeating his recent Tweet, Tikait said that on November 26 their protest will complete one year and they will be altering the worn-out camp by replacing them with new tents. Talking to reporters Tikait alleged, “Neither the Modi government nor Yogi government have done any constructive work so far for the farmers.“We have had no discussion with the Central government on farmer’s bill after January 22 till now as the government is busy roaming around. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not even put four bricks on his own, but is selling everything in the name of privatisation." He further said that “MSP is only on government papers while on ground it is zero”. “On the other hand, continuous rise in the prices of fuel is drastically affecting agriculture activities, especially for the marginal farmers,” he claimed. Talking about the farmers of Bundelkhand, Tikait said, “For their survival, it is important that their produce is purchased here itself by proper people who can give appropriate prices. It is important that a Bundelkhand Organic Board is formed as there is a lot of scope for the cultivation of organic crops here and it will help in the revival of farmers.” He further suggested promoting village tourism and ensuring proper price for the pulses and wheat produced here, which are in high demand in big cities. “These measures will help in stabilizing the farmers of Bundelkhand”. When asked about reasons behind rampant farmer suicide here, Tikait said that Bundelkhand is rich in minerals whose benefit is not being reap by the local people rather the money earned from the mineral resources are being syphoned to the influential moneyed people from outside the state. “The government is deliberately keeping this region underdeveloped so that people from here can be sent to big cities as cheap labour”. When asked about the reasons behind his organization being weak in Bundelkhand, Tikait admitted the fact. He said, “Since beneficial schemes of the government are not reaching poor farmers making them weak. As a result, they are not in a condition to fight back or support my organisation.” He suggested the farmers of Bundelkhand not to migrate but stay back and fight for their rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/farmers-dying-in-line-for-fertilizer-is-shameful-tikait/articleshow/87474374.cms||---

Mandhare conducted a meeting of the administration about providing the ex-gratia to the next of kin of those who died due to covid in Nashik district. He said that the state government guidelines on the issue were expected soon. The administration has to ensure that the data gathered is verified so that every family gets the government help. The disaster management office at Nashik district collectorate has been notified by the collector as the office that will accept the applications and process the same after the government spells out the guidelines for the relatives. Currently, the office is not accepting any applications but has been flooded with calls and personal visits by people, even from the remote areas of the district, enquiring about the applications to be filed. The office receives more than 300 calls daily with people wanting to know whether they would be eligible even if ‘Covid’ is not mentioned as cause of death. The other important query was whether the families of patients, who recovered from Covid, but died due to lung fibrosis or mucormycosis, would be eligible for the exgratia amount. As per the government orders, the applications will be processed only online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/make-proper-documents-of-covid-deaths-mandhare/articleshow/87471843.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Despite being aware of the reopening, Trichy Corporation has failed to initiate preparatory works in advance. Local people in the neighbourhood had to repair the roads to help kids go to schools easy.The Corporation Elementary School in E Pudur was giving a grand welcome to the parents, but the slippery surface at the entrance of the school was troubling people. As the civic body did not repair the faulty road, the road was repaired at a cost of Rs 20,000 by T Muthuselvam, ex corporation councillor who represented ward 40. “We procured gravel from a crusher and employed our workers to level the surface of the road,” he said.In Senthaneerpuram Corporation Middle School, water stagnation had prevented free access for the students. “The corporation should have done the repair works at least a day before the reopening. The school education department and teachers have restrictions in attending to such civil work independently,” B Ilango, a resident of Senthaneerpuram, said. While Trichy corporation had used the schools as vaccination centres, local people criticized the civic body for not paying back at a time of need. However, when contacted, the corporation officials promised to do maintenance work at the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-draws-flak-for-poor-condition-of-roads/articleshow/87474398.cms||Deepak Karthik

We have been collecting these but didn’t know what to do with them. Then it struck us to use these as Diwali décor,” said Mannu Dafali, a member of the NGO, called Harela Society. Dafali added that they cut the bottles into three pieces, turn the bottom portion into a diya, by painting the outer portion in traditional Kumaoni Aipan art and filling it with local chura ghee, and use the middle section as lamp shades. Sonu Sharma, another member of the NGO, said, “Last year also, we made eco-friendly diyas, filling them with chura ghee. We made a total of 250 diyas — in small, medium and large sizes — this year. They are available online as well as in Pithoragarh town and cost Rs 200 to Rs 500 a pair.” Once Diwali is over, people can use the diyas as decorative flower pots too, as the NGO is selling organic fertiliser and flower seeds along with the diyas, Sharma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pithoragarh-ngo-turns-bear-bottles-strewn-across-hills-into-diwali-dcor/articleshow/87472705.cms||Prem Punetha

Flight IX 695 will depart from Trichy International Airport at 9.05am and will reach Kuwait at 11.25am. In return, fight IX 696 will depart at 12.25pm from Kuwait and arrive Trichy at 7.45pm.Air India Express was operating only one weekly service on Saturdays in October. As there has been an increase in patronage, they have announced the additional services. Back then, Indian Airlines operated two flight services to Kuwait from Trichy, but it was terminated in October 2007 without stating any reason. The functionaries of Kuwait-Tamil Islamic Community (K-Tic), which has been working for the welfare of Tamils, have been making efforts to bring back the service in the sector. During the Covid-19 pandemic last year, 40 flights were operated between Trichy and Kuwait by Air India Express (15 services), Kuwait Airways (8), Jazeera Airways (8), Air India (6) and IndiGo Air (3) to bring back Tamils stranded in Kuwait, under Vande Bharat Mission and some special arrangements.Members of K-Tic have expressed happiness over the operation of four special weekly services in this sector. “The efforts put in, in the last 14 years, has turned into a reality,” said A B Khaleel Ahmed Baaqavee, general secretary of K-Tic. “We have been running pillar to post to bring back regular services on this sector for several years. However, the pandemic had made the airliners think about the resumption of services. Though the four services are special ones, they should be regularized. We hope that Kuwait and Jazeera Airlines would also launch new services in this sector,” Baaqavee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/more-flights-from-trichy-to-kuwait-from-november-1/articleshow/87474401.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Health dept goes the extra mile to endvax hesitancy in some rural pockets||Prayagraj: Officials of the health department are finding out the reasons behind the low vaccine coverage in the rural pockets of the district. Senior district health officials are visiting community and primary health centres and interacting with ground levels health workers like ASHA and ANMs to find out the reasons behind low vaccine coverage in rural areas. Officials are also asking the ground health workers about the difficulties being faced by them, particularly in villages and blocks where the rate of vaccination has not been satisfactory. Officials, however, admitted that ground health workers are over-burdened by the several health projects and schemes and that they are performing their duties in allocated areas with complete dedication. Health workers, ASHAs, told senior health officials, "Other routine programmes like routine immunization are once again on the track since there had been a decline in the Covid-19 cases. Besides, ground health workers were facing work pressure since a series of health programmes and awareness campaigns are underway. A senior health worker said, "We had conducted continuous surveys during the pandemic, distributed medicines, and are now actively participating in the Covid vaccination programmes.” She also added, “There has been additional pressure on ground health workers to increase vaccination in rural areas by the concerned CHCs and PHCs”. The startling fact is that people in villages and blocks, despite having interactions with ASHAs and ANMs and the positive feedback, have not been turning up at the vaccination centres. Health officials, meanwhile, claimed that the graph of vaccination has undoubtedly increased in rural areas but some rural pockets witnessed low vaccine coverage. However, the district authorities in a bid to increase vaccination in rural areas, have roped in gram pradhans, primary school teachers and aganwari workers. Moreover, ground-level health workers have also accused employees of other departments like gram panchayat, Rajgir Sevak, kotedars, teachers of not receiving the required support to ramp up vaccination in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/health-dept-goes-the-extra-mile-to-endvax-hesitancy-in-some-rural-pockets/articleshow/87474399.cms||---

However, due to easterly winds, the minimum temperature is likely to increase slightly from Tuesday. Before this, the lowest minimum temperature of the season was 14 degrees Celsius on October 29 at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. While Safdarjung recorded the lowest minimum temperature at 13.6 degrees Celsius on Monday, Ayanagar was the coldest station where the minimum dropped to 13 degrees. The maximum temperature at Safdarjung settled at 31.2 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said, “The minimum temperature dipped to 13.6 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung on Monday due to local radiational cooling as there is clear sky and lesser pollution. However, as the wind direction has changed to easterly, the minimum temperature is likely to rise slightly from Tuesday.” According to the IMD forecast, the night temperature is likely to hover around 15 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and Wednesday, and it may reduce marginally to 14 degrees on Thursday. “A weak western disturbance is affecting the area from November 1 to 4. Under its influence, wind direction has changed in Delhi while light showers are expected in hilly areas. The minimum temperature may not fall for the next two days,” said Jenamani. As the wind direction is predicted to change from easterly to north-westerly, the minimum temperature may again start falling and touch 13 degrees Celsius on November 5 and 6. However, a Met official said there won’t be any significant drop in the temperature in the next five days. In 2020, the lowest minimum temperature was recorded at 6.3 degrees Celsius in November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coldest-night-of-season-at-13-6c-but-temp-to-rise-a-bit/articleshow/87474406.cms||---

Many other activities were also organised to help children connect with their schools. All schools were closed for most classes due to Covid-19. “I am happy that after a long gap of 19 months, schools from nursery to Class VIII have reopened. School education had suffered tremendously. However, it is expected that after schools reopen, our teachers and parents will work together to fight this learning gap. An overwhelmingly positive response on the first day shows parents’ confidence in the school,” said Sisodia, who even played with younger children. He reiterated that the government was committed to ensuring children’s health and safety. “It will be ensured that the children are not burdened with studies as soon as they return to school. The focus will be on their social-emotional well-being through happiness classes and mindfulness to help them accommodate physical classes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-time-to-move-forward-now-say-kejriwal-sisodia/articleshow/87474392.cms||---

Justice S J Kathawalla directed petitioners’ through counsel Rajmani Varma along with advocate Prayushi Kapadia to file a rejoinder in three days thereafter and posted the matter to November 16, to be placed before the bench of the Chief Justice. The court asked the BMC not to carry out any cycle track activities till then. Varma said the HC in 2013 directed that in ‘wetlands’ in the Centre’s Wetland Atlas, there shall be no reclamation and no construction without court nod. He showed the HC a provision under the DCR and submitted that it mentions that “to prevent soil erosion and silting in lakes, an exclusive green belt of 100 m shall be provided around the periphery of Vihar and Powai lake, in which no construction whatsoever shall be allowed’’. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy appeared for BMC and opposing the PIL, questioned the petitioners’ submissions and ‘wetland’ argument, saying it was a man-made reservoir and the project was in public interest. The BMC said it is a ‘natural area’ and under DCR, amenable to laying of cycle track.

On Monday, the cyber police at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) issued warnings asking people not to fall prey to such frauds. “Scamsters are sending a scratch coupon in the name of Amazon (e-commerce company). Someone will call a prospective victim and talk about the jackpot. Once they gain the person’s trust, they will ask him or her to share bank details. The details are used to hack the victim’s account,” said a cyber police officer. In an online consumer forum complaint, a person identified as Veena Birla highlighted the fraud: “A caller introduced herself as an Amazon customer support executive, and told me that I had been selected as an Amazon lucky draw contest winner from Tamil Nadu. She offered me a promotional gift for which we have to order for Rs 4,999 and give a call back to claim the gift.” Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said users need to be very careful about freebies offered online especially ahead of a festival or a special occasion. Hackers use this as an opportunity to install malware on devices or to collect a lot of personal information which can later be misused. “One should also read the URL carefully and not simply click the link in excitement. Such links may have malware that gets executed in the mobile or laptop on clicking and will help the scamsters in stealing data,” said Bhatia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-beware-of-rs-10l-jackpot-cyber-police-warn-public/articleshow/87473666.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Luckily for them, state water transport department (SWTD) provided them a temporary passenger boat service on the first day of school reopening. This was after the PTA, school headmistress and the parents of these 50 students knocked at the doors of many authorities. The only mode of transport for the students to the nearest SNDP Higher Secondary school in Kanjiram, Kottayam district, is by boat. Earlier, the students depended on SWTD’s passenger boat service between Alappuzha and Kottayam. However, for the last six months, the service via Kanjiram has been stopped after five lifting-bridges in ward number 45 of Kottayam municipality were damaged. Shaji V Nair, director, SWTD, said that the boat service for the students is a temporary arrangement. “If the Kottayam municipality repairs the five bridges, we can resume normal boat services from Alappuzha to Kottayam via Kanjiram,” he said. Geetha P, the school headmistress, said that the students from these regions must leave school as per the boat timings. “Though class was till 12.45pm on Monday, the students from these regions had to leave by 12 noon as the boat left at that time,” she said. C S Reji, president, PTA, said that the temporary arrangements are only for two weeks. Najeeb, station master of Kottayam boat jetty, said that there were six services each from Alappuzha and Kottayam, earlier. The timings were convenient for the students, and they could avail travel concessions too, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lack-of-boat-service-hits-students-in-kuttanad/articleshow/87473667.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Allahabad||Dating sites no indication to judge one’s virtue: Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Denying anticipatory bail to a rape accused, who allegedly established physical relationship with a woman on the false promise of marriage after meeting her on a dating site, the Allahabad high court has observed that being active on dating sites is not a parameter to judge someone’s virtue. This assertion from the court came in response to the argument raised by the counsel for the accused applicant, who sought to draw a presumption as to the easy virtue of the victim woman while trying to derive the theory of consensual sex. In the case, the victim and the accused had met on a dating site and allegedly, on the false promise to marry, the accused had sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, he went back on his promise leading to the registration of an instant case against him by the woman. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that he and the victim met on a dating site. In view of this fact, it was submitted that within four days of their meeting, the establishment of physical relationship by the victim demonstrated that it was a case of consensual sex. It was also argued that there was no talk of marriage between the two and, therefore, the allegation that they had indulged in physical relationship in the name of marriage proposal was not made out. Declining to take into consideration the theory of consensual sex advanced by the applicant’s counsel, the court in its decision dated September 14 observed, “Dating sites are not an indication to have judgment on anybody’s virtues. Merely, two adults meet on a dating site, and on the third day of meeting him, exchange of words are able to garner confidence that the other party is willing to marry and in the name of marriage, if physical favour is sought, then that will not amount to characterizing a victim, as a person of easy virtues having consented to physical relationship without there being any provocation like promise to perform marriage.” While rejecting the anticipatory bail application of one Abhhey Chopra of Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida), Justice Vivek Agarwal said that the applicant is free to surrender before the court below and participate in the court proceedings. “He may also, if advised, apply for regular bail, which the court concerned shall consider on its own merits, without getting prejudiced from the order passed here,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-being-active-on-dating-sites-noparameter-to-judge-someones-virtue/articleshow/87474408.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Delhi||Two reasons why Delhi is gasping: Mercury dips and high pollution||NEW DELHI: As temperature dips and pollution goes up, hospitals say there is a significant increase in OPD visits from people suffering from respiratory health problems. Some of the patients who develop chest infection, wheezing and severe breathlessness are also requiring hospitalisation, they add. Track the pollution level in your city“In the past few days, pollution has increased significantly and so has the number of patients coming with acute exacerbation of bronchitis, asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Some of them are also getting admitted,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine at Max Saket. He added that elderly people and those with pre-existing respiratory problems should avoid morning walks. The earth science ministry’s Air Quality Early Warning System has predicted that PM2.5 and PM10 levels in Delhi may get pushed to 250 and 398 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively, on Diwali night. Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonology and critical care at Apollo hospital, said people suffering from lung issues should avoid going out for the next few days and advised them to wear a mask if they had to step out. “It would safeguard against both pollution and Covid-19.” Dr Chawla also advised that firecrackers be avoided as they added to pollution-related woes. According to Dr Shabnam Mir, consultant physician and head of clinical operation for Antara, prolonged exposure to air pollutants directly affects blood pressure and blood vessels, causing an increased risk of brain damage and stroke. “Poor air quality causes inflammation in the lungs, leading to stiffening of blood vessels, reducing flexibility, and overall weakening of the vessels. People with COPD, especially the seniors, have low immunity and they are more susceptible to airborne infections and exacerbations in respiratory illnesses,” she said. Santanu Sharma, who lives in Defence Colony, is fine most of the year, but during winter, he suffers from upper respiratory tract infections. “I cannot leave my job here, but the weather is torturous during this time. My biggest fear is what if the pollution level worsens further during Diwali because some people may burn firecrackers regardless of government orders,” he said. The 39-year-old has been taking nebuliser regularly for the past week and other medicines to manage cough, fever and other symptoms. Many people who are still recovering from lungs damage caused by Covid-19 are also facing additional problems, said Dr Sibasish Dey, who heads the medical unit of ResMed dealing in respiratory devices. “Many Covid patients are still requiring intermittent oxygen support. Increased pollution is likely to aggravate their condition,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-reasons-why-delhi-is-gasping/articleshow/87474431.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||Man rented out 300 bank accounts to Jamtara crooks, held||NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man has been arrested for opening over 300 bank accounts across the country and renting them out to cybercrooks of Jamtara to receive the money siphoned from victims of cybercrime. A full-fledged investigation has been started to learn how the man managed to open so many accounts. According to DCP (southwest) Gaurav Sharma, the accused has been identified as Ram Pravesh, a resident of Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. He was getting Rs 5,000 per month for each account used by crooks as commission, he said. Police started trailing the suspect after they started an investigation into a complaint of cyber fraud wherein a woman was duped of Rs 98,000. “In her complaint, the woman said that one of her payments on PhonePe app was not getting processed, so she searched for its customer care contact on Google. She found a phone number and called up. The receiver introduced himself as an employee of the company and asked her to verify her identity by conveying the OTP, which she had received on her number,” the DCP said. As soon as the woman conveyed the OTP, the money was deducted. An FIR was registered and a team led by inspector Yogesh Kumar was formed to crack the case. A raid was conducted, but the accused was found to be a resident of Hardoi and missing. Technical surveillance was mounted on the basis of information received locally and a raid conducted in his hometown. The accused was finally apprehended and Rs 25,000 recovered from him. “He has disclosed many names who are involved in this pan-India racket. Many other cases of online fraud are yet to be identified,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-rented-out-300-bank-a/cs-to-jamtara-crooks-held/articleshow/87474413.cms||---

---||Pune||One grand festival with unique ways of celebration by each community||Pune: One festival that is the greatest common factor, but the ways to celebrate Diwali range from one day to 11 days among communities. While Kali Puja is the highlight of the festival for Bengalis, Sindhis and Punjabis focus on Laxmi Puja during this time-- both different avatars of goddess Durga, Tamilians have just one day of celebrations, while Maharashtrians conclude Diwali with Tulshi puja on the 11th day. Asha Bagchandani said, “Laxmi puja is done by immersing silver coins in a bowl full of raw milk with flower petals, raw rice and other puja items, which is passed around. Every family member takes out a coin and touches it to their eyes. It is customary to prepare kheer-puri for dinner on the day of the festival. Sindhi festive delicacies include a variety of chikki made with coconut, peanut, and puffed rice.” “My grandmother used to make samosas with the filling of halwa for Diwali, we called it Sambosa,” Saaz Agarwal, another citizen said. Many trader communities such as Gujaratis, Marwaris as well as Sindhis keep their accounting books for puja during Diwali. “The priest draws the holy symbol on the first page of a fresh book after the puja to symbolise a prosperous start for the financial year,” Radhika Shyam Sachdev said. Traditionally, Bengali families light 14 diyas a day before Diwali and prepare 14 types of vegetables. “We fast for Kali puja and break it post midnight, and light 108 diyas like we do during Durga Puja. Some families prepare a feast of mutton and rice, but we cut pumpkin, sugar cane and ginger and distribute a vegetarian bhog of khichidi and chutney,” Madhumita Ghosh said. Among the Odiya community, jute sticks are burned as an invitation to their ancestors to visit them. “I have always found this one similarity between our ritual and the concept of Halloween, where we raise burning jute sticks towards the sky to guide our ancestors home as it is believed that they are granted this day to come down from heaven to visit this realm.,” Biswajit Mohanty said. In the Bihari community too there is a similar ritual. Saket Jha explained, “After the puja, we grab rice puff (khoi) in one hand and in other hand we take a particular kind of stick is called Santhi in Maithili. We burn the stick at the entrance of our house while dropping the khoi inside and outside the threshold. This is repeat three times by every member of the household with the belief of welcoming good luck.” Naraka Chaturdashi is widely celebrated among the South Indian communities of Malayalis, Tamilians and Kannadigas. “In our house, my grandmother and mother put a special kind of oil on our heads before we have a bath and sit for the puja in the morning. They also make maladu, sweet ladoos of gram flour fried in ghee and suhiyam made with chick peas and jaggery. Since my parents have been living in Pune for over 30 years, we also prepare local festive treats such as karanji, shankarpali,” Aadhirisha Ravindran said. Tulshi Vivah is an important ritual for Maharashtrians. “This is done on the 11th day of Diwali, when we witness a symbolic marriage ceremony of Tulshi (the plant) with Lord Vishnu, to commence the start of the wedding season. It is believed that goddess Laxmi took the form of a tulshi plant to remain on earth after slaying a demon. Throughout the 12-day long festivities, we enjoy a variety of faral such as chakli, karanji, shankarpali, and a variety of sweet ladoos. It is customary to bathe with uptan, a mixture of sandalwood paste with other ayurvedic oils and herbs, at dawn on the day of Diwali, but most families now use sandalwood soap.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-grand-festival-with-unique-ways-of-celebration-by-each-community/articleshow/87440496.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Agra||Man assaulted, forced to say 'Jai Shri Ram' in Aligarh village||Agra: A 25-year-old street vendor, Aamir Khan, was allegedly assaulted and robbed by two men on Sunday after he refused to chant “Jai Shri Ram” at a village in Aligarh. Circle officer of Atrauli, SP Singh told TOI that an FIR was registered at Harduaganj police station on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s father, Rahissuddin. However, the father did not mention that his son was forced to raise any slogans by the accused Devendra and his father Raju, said the circle officer. Police claimed that the man was beaten up following a clash between the two sides after an argument over the price of clothes. The accused have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC. Aamir, a resident of village Silla Biswan, claimed that the duo first asked him his name, then beat him with sticks and forced him to chant "Jai Shri Ram" when he reached his neighbouring village Nagla Khema to sell clothes. “They (the accused) also snatched Rs 10,000 and my mobile phone,” he alleged, adding that he had made a video of the incident. A local of Nagla Khema village, on condition of anonymity, said that some people are trying to create animosity between two communities by indulging in such acts. He added that the accused duo also misbehaved with the police. When police took the accused into their custody, they started chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and threw stones at a person who was recording a video of their arrest. Several such incidents have been reported in the state this year. In August, a muslim e-rickshaw driver was publicly assaulted and allegedly asked to chant “Jai Shri Ram” even as his minor daughter tried to save him. The video of this incident went viral on social media. In another incident in June, an elderly man, Abdul Sarad Saifi, accused four men of beating him up, clipping his beard and asking him to chant “Jai Shri Ram” in Ghaziabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-assaulted-forced-to-say-jai-shri-ram-in-aligarh-village/articleshow/87472743.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Jaipur||SBI ex-chairman sent to Jaisalmer jail for cheating, hotel-grab bid||JAISALMER: Former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri, arrested by Jaisalmer police from his residence in Delhi on Sunday over an alleged fraud involving the sale of a hotel in Jaisalmer at a hugely undervalued price, was remanded to judicial custody on Monday for 14 days after the chief judicial magistrate rejected his bail plea. He was sent to Jaisalmer jail. Chaudhuri sold the Rs 200-crore property for just Rs 25 crore, when the owners defaulted on a loan, to a company named Alchemist ARC, it is alleged. After retirement, he became one of the directors in the company that had bought the hotel. The CJM’s court agreed that selling the luxury hotel without getting it auctioned amounted to cheating. On October 23, the court issued arrest warrants against eight people, including Chaudhuri. The rest of the seven are yet to be arrested. Jaisalmer SP Ajay Singh said the CJM’s court had issued an arrest warrant against the eight under IPS Sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker…), and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy). Apart from the ex-banker, the other seven people are Alok Dhir, RK Kapur, SV Venkatakrishnan, Sasi Methadil, Devendra Jain, Tarun and Vijay Kishore Saxena. Chaudhuri’s advocate has filed another bail application in the district and sessions court; it will be heard on November 8. In 2008, the owner of Fort Rajwada Hotel, Dileep Singh Rathore, had decided to construct another hotel on Jaisalmer’s Khuhadi Road and took a term loan of Rs 24 crore from SBI Jodhpur. In 2010, he sought another loan of Rs 6 crore from SBI, but the bank denied him the loan. Later in the same year, Rathore died of a heart attack. Two months after his death, SBI converted the under-construction hotel into an NPA and seized the property. SBI had both hotels evaluated and exerted pressure on Rathore’s son, Harendra Singh Rathore, to repay the loan, it is claimed. Kanwraj Singh, advocate for Godawan Group Pvt Ltd, the owner of Rajwada Fort Hotels and Garh Rajwada (under-construction property), argued against Chaudhuri’s bail application. In the meantime, Chaudhari retired and within a month Alok Dhir, allegedly a middleman, became a director in the recovery company. The hotel owner learned of the plan to grab the hotel and lodged an FIR against eight people at Sadar police station in 2015. After a long hearing, the CJM’s court agreed that selling the hotel without getting it auctioned amounted to cheating. The court on October 23 issued arrest warrants against eight people, including Alok Dhir and Pratip Chaudhari, following which the Jaisalmer police arrested the former SBI chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sbi-ex-chairman-sent-to-jailfor-cheating-hotel-grab-bid/articleshow/87474446.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad alchemists dust jewel road for gold||AHMEDABAD: In one of Ahmedabad’s largest, busiest, and oldest bullion markets, some women scrape a living from street dust — what they collect may not glitter, but could still be gold. These streets of Ratan Pol and Manek Chowk in the Walled City are lined by 5,000 jewellery units which design, trade, and sell gold ornaments. At the break of dawn, much before the AMC sanitation workers arrive on the scene, a group of about 200 women — each armed with a brush and a dustpan — sweep these narrow lanes and dump dust into sacks. Their mission is to hoard specks of gold dust that the shops may have inadvertently discarded. As a matter of principle, these women do not accept money from the shop owners. The dust these women gather is sold to the ‘dhuldhoyas’ or dust washers. The women get a monthly salary of Rs 15,000. The dhul-dhoyas treat the dust with chemicals to extract gold. “Jewellers with manufacturing units do not allow anyone to sweep their premises. They collect garbage in buckets every day, which is stored in sacks,” said Chinubhai Choksi, president of Shree Choksi Mahajan, Manek Chowk, an association of about 220 bullion traders and jewellers. Choksi added: “Jewellers sell this garbage to the dhul-dhoyas. The garbage fetches the jewellers between Rs 10,000 and lakhs of rupees depending on the weight.” Sanket Shukla, the owner of a gold-cutting unit at Manek Chowk, said: “When we cut gold into strips, some portion of the precious metal is lost as it turns into microscopic dust, flies into the air, or gets stuck to workers’ clothes.” He added: “Some of this valuable dust glides out of the shops and get mixed with the dust in the street.” He said that this dust is sold to the dhul-dhoyas by the women. “Some jewellers collect dust from their shops for years and then sell it directly to wholesale buyers,” said Ashish Zaveri, the joint secretary of Gujarat Jewellers’ Association. He said that this is an age-old tradition in the Walled City. Wholesale buyers of dust also buy old cushions, doormats, and carpets from jewellers and pay them a lump sum, which runs into thousands of rupees. However, this tradition is fading away gradually with the advancement in jewellery-making technology. “Only 20% of the jewellery manufacturing units create handmade items these days. The rest have turned to moulding machines,” said Choksi. “Machine moulding minimizes metal loss during the manufacturing process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-alchemists-dust-jewel-road-for-gold/articleshow/87473676.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Adinath Budhwant, the deputy superintendent of police (ACB) said, “The arrested public servants are released on bail. However, they are temporarily suspended from their work. Repeated attempts to seek bribes may lead to permanent termination. We act according to the complaints we receive and ensure the raids occur in a fair manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-anti-corruption-bureau-nabbed-19-public-servants-this-year/articleshow/87471892.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The direct flight between Indore and Prayagraj will not only benefit businessmen, but also boost religious tourism between the two cities. On the maiden flight, 81 passengers arrived at the civil enclave of Prayagraj. The passengers coming from Indore were given a warm welcome at the airport by UP minister for civil aviation Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’ and BJP member of Parliament from Phulpur, Keshari Devi Patel. Gupta, who welcomed the passengers, said that the Civil Enclave of Prayagraj is setting new records for the past three years. “In a very short span of time, 12 important cities have got direct air connectivity with the Sangam city. In the coming days, direct air services would start from Prayagraj for some more cities. Before the formation of the Yogi government, there was only one flight from Prayagraj to Delhi, but now there are flights to 12 cities,” he added. After the construction of the new terminal here, a record was also made last month for the movement of more than 10 lakh passengers in one year. Earlier, Gupta and Patel also cut a cake to celebrate the occasion. On its journey to Indore, the ATR class flight from Prayagraj took off at 12.09 pm and reached Indore at 2.08 pm.

The total construction cost of these projects would be in the tune of at least Rs 100 crore — excluding the land cost — and are expected to add around 600 apartments in the next two to three years. An NMC official said the civic body had received 350 building plan proposals in October. Of them, 230 have been approved and the remaining too are being examined. “There has been a positive mood in the realty sector due to the festive season starting from Ganesh Chaturthi. The builders are keen to get their plans approved so that the construction work can start soon,” he said. Umesh Wankhede, a senior member of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association (CREDAI) Nashik, said the demand for housing sector has increased after the pandemic. “People have realised the importance of having their own house,” he said. Wankhede, who is also the chairman of the real estate committee of Maharashtra Chamber, said enquiries of customers have also increased. “Around 300 apartments worth Rs 120 crore were booked on the auspicious occasion of Dasara last month. Earlier, the demand was for the ready possession flats, but people are now booking new projects,” he said. “Builders have also started planning for the new building projects and submitting plans to the NMC for its approval. The price of steel, cement and other raw materials have also increased at large. Thus, the construction cost has increased by 20%. However, the builders have still not increased the cost and are selling flats at existing market rates. The cost of the flats may increase after Diwali. As a result, people are using this opportunity to buy homes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-approves-230-building-proposals-in-oct/articleshow/87471075.cms||Tushar Pawar

LCB sleuths had received a tip-off that the two were roaming around Nakhatrana and they have a bag with them in which some suspicious items are kept. Based on the information, cops found the two persons identified as Kaushik Patel, a resident of Nakhatrana, and Kishor Dataniya, who lives in Bhuj. On checking their bag, police found an antique metal jug on which there was an inscription of East India Company and 1818 and a design of scorpion was made. Two small tube lights, a battery and an electric circuit were also found in their bag. On questioning, the duo told police that they were planning to sell the jug to some gullible victim as a magical lamp. They would demonstrate it by connecting the tube lights to the circuit and battery, which would be hidden under the jug, and tell people how tube lights would light up because it was magical. Patel and Dataniya were handed over to Nakhtrana police station where an offence of cheating was registered. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-try-to-sell-antique-jug-as-magic-lamp/articleshow/87471929.cms||---

With corporate gift budgets slashed this Diwali, the demand for dry fruits has taken a major hit not just in Ahmedabad but also the entire state. Ahmedabad’s Madhupura market, which is a hub of dry fruit wholesalers, supplies dry fruits including almonds, pistachios, cashews, walnuts, raisins, apricots, berries and seeds to places across the state. The usual turnover during Diwali season roughly amounts to 300-400 tonnes which has reduced to 150-200 tonnes this year, suggest estimates by wholesalers. “The sale of dry fruits has surely improved since Navratri when compared to last year. However, the overall volumes remains low. While corporates have begun gifting this year, their budgets have shrunk. As a result, they have either placed fewer orders or ordered smaller quantities of dry fruits,” said Nilay Upadhyay, a wholesale trader in Madhupura market. Dry fruit prices have not seen a significant jump this time around. “There is a marginal 5% increase in prices and that is an effect of the surge in transportation charges due to costlier petrol and diesel. This is a bare minimum increase in price which is reported almost every year. Wholesale price of cashews have increased marginally while those for pistachios and almonds have declined. Walnuts and raisins have remained as it is in terms of prices. The only visible surge is in the prices of seeds and dried berries on which import duty has been increased,” Upadhyay added. Corporates are largely opting for hampers comprising multiple gourmet food products including handcrafted chocolate, cookies, biscotti, gourmet coffee and tea, sherbets and other confectioneries and savouries. “Clients whose budgets have been cut have opted out of getting dried fruits and have chosen more unique food items. This is simply because other products are relatively cheaper as compared to dry fruits,” said Ravi Parekh, founder of a city-based corporate gifting firm. Retail counters, too, bear a deserted look. “People have less disposable incomes at hand due to costlier essentials. As a result, they are spending on needs other than dry fruits. Even corporate orders are less compared to the usual,” said Ramesh Motiani, a dry fruit dealer. While dry fruit sales are better than last year, they continue to remain low against pre-pandemic times However, there are select few retailers who have gained business this year. “For our store, the demand has definitely remained good and certainly better than last year. Besides retail customers, we have also received orders from corporates in sectors including ceramic, real estate and insurance, among others,” said Rahim Somani, founder of a city-based dry fruit retail outlet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corporates-slash-budgets-dry-fruit-demand-dries-up/articleshow/87473687.cms||Niyati Parikh

Transport minister Kailash Gahlot laid the foundation stone for the city’s first public EV charging plaza at Delhi Transport Corporation’s (DTC) Nehru Place bus terminal on September 13. DTC has now started the process of completing EV charging stations at Nehru Place and Mehrauli bus terminals and Rajghat-I, Dwarka sectors 2 and 8, Kalkaji and IP depots. Gahlot had said the government was moving closer to its agenda of developing innovative charging infrastructure and EV ecosystem in Delhi and had collaborated with Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL). CESL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Efficiency Services Limited under the Union power ministry, comes with an expertise in EVs and charging infrastructure, and will develop public EV charging and battery swapping stations along with DTC. Each of the seven locations will have six charging points, three of which will be for two- and three-wheelers and three points for four-wheelers. Once functional, these locations, with their real-time status and availability of charging points, will also be available on Delhi government’s ONE DELHI mobile application. DTC’s designated electric bus depots at Rohini-I and II, Mundela Kalan, Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Hari Nagar, Sukhdev Vihar etc are nearly complete. Ashish Kundra, principal secretary-cum-transport commissioner, told TOI that in the current model, electric connection was given to the operator at the periphery of the depot from the 11kv or 33kv-level supply. The operator then has to create civil infrastructure within the depot to bring the connection to the centre of the depot through underground cables. The charging station comes up at a diagonal strip in the centre, and then buses are parked in bays in a “butterfly pattern”. Kundra said that as earlier elaborated by Gahlot, Delhi was looking at a transition to a completely electric public transport and EV ecosystem. “For this, an ambitious plan has been chalked out, assessment of depots and meetings with discoms are going on. Also, a PMU has been set up for overseeing the whole thing,” Kundra said. While buses operated around CNG stations earlier, the new fuel will be electricity, Kundra pointed out. “One of the critical success factors in the whole exercise is electrification of depots. You have to plan ahead,” he added. On March 26 this year, the Delhi cabinet approved the engagement of 300 low-floor electric airconditioned buses by DTC, and as per the schedule, 118 buses were to arrive in October 2021, 100 by November and 60 by December, but the plans got delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-moves-into-next-gear-in-its-e-mission/articleshow/87474450.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||381 pedestrian casualties in Delhi so far this year, just a slight dip||NEW DELHI: More than 40% of the deaths that took place on Delhi roads this year have been of pedestrians. The numbers have only marginally dipped over the last three years. According to road safety experts, the high percentage of pedestrian casualties is due to the absence of continuous footpaths on most arteries in the capital. According to police, most deaths occur at unmarked crossings or roads adjacent to pavements. According to data shared by Delhi Police, till October 15 this year, there were 914 fatal accidents in Delhi in which 945 people died. Of them, 381 were pedestrians. Last year, in 1,163 fatal accidents, 1,196 people died, with 505 of the dead being pedestrians. Even though two months of this year are left, the fatality figure is expected to be lower this year. This year, the percentage of pedestrians among road deaths was 41.7%, slightly less than 43.4% last year and around 47% in 2019. Ranbir Talwar, executive director, Indian Head Injury Foundation, noted that in the past decade, the number of road fatalities in the city had been gradually going down even though the death rate remained high across the country. “The prime reason for such deaths is infrastructural problems,” said Talwar. “Some roads don’t have a continuous footpath while most are illegally occupied, thus forcing people to walk on the main roads.” Talwar also felt that education would play an important role in preventing death. He pointed out people don’t use the zebra crossing to go from one side of the road to another and how they break down the central grilles to create a dangerous crossing point. “Drivers too don’t think it important to stop or slow down at zebra crossings,” he added. “Law enforcement agencies should levy higher fines and implement measures like in countries abroad to habituate people to using the zebra crossings.” Piyush Tewari, CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, had similar opinions about the drawbacks in road infrastructure. “The problem is that roads have not been built keeping the pedestrian in mind, only vehicle drivers,” said Tewari. “It is also a class issue that people think they can afford to not stop at the zebra crossing and speed past the marked passage. The other problems are road encroachments, faulty lane markings, faded zebra crossing lines. Pedestrian bridges have also been made with consideration only for the motorists, not the people on the road, such as those who can’t climb steep steps.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/381-pedestrian-casualties-so-far-this-year-just-a-slight-dip/articleshow/87474444.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh falsely accused me and fled India: Anil Deshmukh in video||MUMBAI: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh appeared before the ED on Monday to record his statement. The ED said Deshmukh, through his PA Kundan Shinde, had collected Rs 4.7 crore from (now-dismissed) assistant police inspector Sachin Waze in cash. Waze was then heading the CIU branch of Mumbai police and had collected the money from orchestra bar owners of Mumbai illegally for Deshmukh. From that money, Rs 4.18 crore was transferred to Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based educational trust through shell companies with the help of Delhi-based hawala operators Surendra Jain and Virendra Jain, showing it as donation. After Deshmukh appeared before ED, his team released a pre-recorded video message. In it, Deshmukh said former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh made false allegations against him and had now fled the country. In the video, Deshmukh said, “I received ED summons, and the media wrongly reported that I was not cooperating with the investigation. Each time after ED summons, I replied to them stating my petition was pending before the High Court and Supreme Court, after it’s outcome I would present myself before the ED. Me, my family and our staff cooperated with ED during the investigation. Earlier, on CBI summons, I went and gave my statement.” In July, the ED had attached assets worth Rs 4.2 crore (purchase value) in the case. That included a flat worth Rs 1.5 crore in Worli in the name of Deshmukh’s wife Aarti and 25 land parcels in Uran of his son’s company, Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd. The current market value of the Uran land is a few hundred crores. Earlier, Deshmukh had approached the apex court for protection from arrest in the ED case, but SC refused to grant him interim relief. The money laundering case is based on the CBI FIR where Singh has alleged that then state home minister (Deshmukh) had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners every month. CBI is also looking into former state intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla’s report where it was alleged influential people were promising desired postings and transfers to police officers. On Sunday, CBI arrested a Thane resident, Santosh Jagtap, in the case they are probing. He was remanded in CBI custody till November 4. Earlier, in a separate case, CBI had arrested its sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari and Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga for attempting to influence the investigation. Deshmukh released an unsigned statement that ED should act in a fair manner. “I am today appearing before the ED, let the truth prevail, Satyamev Jayate,” he said. Deshmukh said on account of a “witch-hunt campaign” launched at the instance of vested interests, false allegations have been levelled by persons with “no credibility, honour or pride.” He alleged these persons are themselves knee-deep in rackets of extortion, fraud and even murder. “The principal person, who held the high office of Mumbai police commissioner, is now wanted as an absconding criminal,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singh-falsely-accused-me-and-fled-india-deshmukh-in-video/articleshow/87473698.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Agra||UP: 75 years of independence, still no electricity in Etah village||LUCKNOW: As people start decorating their homes with colourful lights ahead of Diwali, a village in Etah district of Uttar Pradesh remains under darkness, with no power supply even after 75 years of independence. People of Tulai Ka Nagla, which falls under Pahara gram panchayat of Aliganj block, will be celebrating a "black Diwali" once again this year. This is despite the government claiming total electrification and last-mile delivery of electricity in every nook and corner of the country back in 2018. The village, with a population of only 300, has around 30 houses without an electric bulb. Villagers have to travel a distance of 2 kilometers to Raja Ka Rampur, just to charge their mobile phones. Students are unable to attend online classes and use candles to study in the evening. Women have to prepare dinner before sunset. "Since the past several decades, we have been trying to reach out to the public representatives and local authorities. Years passed and governments changed, but we remained in darkness. This year again, we will be celebrating a black Diwali,” 100-year-old village resident Rajaram said. Most families in the village depend on farming. Some work as farm hands and some cultivate the land taken on lease around the village. Over the past five years, 50 people have migrated from the village as there is no electricity. Youngsters working as labourers are staying in rented accommodation located outside the village. “As the night falls, darkness descends in the village. Life grinds to a halt -- work must pause and children must stop playing. Students are unable to study... I don't remember if anyone in our village has graduated,” said Chandrapal Singh, a farmer. In his Independence Day address to the nation in 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had noted that 18,500 villages in India do not have electricity, and promised to change that reality within the next 1,000 days. In September 2017, the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, or SAUBHAGYA, was launched, envisaging last-mile connectivity and total electrification by March 2019. In 987 days – short of the promised 1,000 – on April 28, 2018, the government claimed that the promise has been fulfilled. Modi had tweeted: “28th April, 2018, will be remembered as a historic day in the development journey of India. Yesterday, we fulfilled a commitment due to which the lives of several Indians will be transformed forever! I am delighted that every single village of India now has access to electricity”. Local resident Anita Devi said: “We don’t know about this government scheme and the PM’s statement; we only know that we live without electricity. After sunset, we use candles, diyas, torches and rechargeable batteries (solar lamps). Not everyone has rechargeable batteries." "The government has also stopped the distribution of kerosene under the PDS scheme. Sometimes we are forced to use our mustard oil to light diyas. However, it is too expensive,” said Ranjana Shakya, a villager. Sub-divisional officer of the electricity department, Aftab Alam, said: “A proposal for electrification of Tulai Ka Nagla has been prepared. We have sent it to the higher authorities for approval.” Talking to TOI, district magistrate Etah Ankit Kumar Agrawal said, “I took charge as DM of Etah around five months back. So far, no one from Tulai ka Nagla has raised the issue with me. I will look into the matter. We would take time-bound action to end the suffering of the villagers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-electricity-in-etah-village-even-after-75-yrs-of-independence/articleshow/87472771.cms||Deepak Lavania

Experts have emphasised the importance of early detection of breast cancer to reduce morbidity and mortality. Women should be made aware of advanced technologies like vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) which is highly beneficial for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, underline experts. Breast onco-surgeon Chaitanyanand B Koppiker of Prashanti Cancer Care Mission Pune, said, “VABB helps diagnose even the smallest of lesions which are often not sampled in regular biopsies. Additionally, VABB is one of the safest means to remove benign lumps which commonly occur among women.” VABB is a tissue sampling technique that can easily be accessed through a small and single incision. “The ability of VABB to collect multiple samples with a single needle has the potential to reduce procedure times for patients and may reduce discomfort during breast biopsy in a minimally invasive manner,” Koppikar said It ensures that tissue samples are taken from all parts of the lesion. The samples are then sent to the laboratory for detailed analysis and to identify if the lump is malignant or benign, experts have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vacuum-assisted-biopsy-can-detect-breast-cancer-early/articleshow/87440550.cms||---

He offered prayers before the photographs of his parents before starting for school. Alan’s father, Chulliparambil Subash, who was a clerk in the Manaloor cooperative bank, died five months ago, due to Covid. His mother, Jiji, had died a week prior to that while undergoing treatment for Covid. “I was very happy to go to school, and to meet my teachers and friends. The teachers advised me to study well. I want to become a police officer, so that I can punish who play mischief and help those in distress,” Alan said. His neighbours had provided him a school bag, umbrella and books a couple of days back itself. His class teacher Rincy said he did not appear much disturbed, though “we are taking special care of him”. Deputy director education Madan Mohan said there are four students in the district who have lost their parents due to Covid. Director of general education Jeevan Babu said the government has taken all possible steps to ensure education for the children who have lost both their parents due to Covid. The support of the PTAs and other institutions will be sought to ensure that they reach school. Director of women and child welfare department T V Anupama said as many as 86 students in the state have lost both their parents due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/alan-takes-a-step-in-new-direction/articleshow/87473716.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Param Bir Singh asked Sachin Waze to collect Rs 2 crore daily, say police||MUMBAI: Former city police commissioner and IPS officer Param Bir Singh had given controversial police officer Sachin Waze, who was subsequently dismissed from service, a target of Rs 2 crore to be extorted every day, the crime branch told a metropolitan magistrate’s court on Monday. Special public prosecutor Shekar Jagtap told the court that in the investigation into the complaint of businessman Bimal Agarwal, it has come to light that Singh started the extortion racket immediately after Waze was reinstated in service in 2020. “Singh reinstated Waze on June 9, 2020, and on the very next day he was given charge of the Crime Intelligence Unit. Thereafter, Waze started approaching businessmen, hoteliers and other establishments to extort money,” Jagtap told the court. In a telephonic conversation between Agarwal and Waze, which Agarwal recorded, Waze is heard asking him to hand over a list of BMC contractors so that he can extort them. “Waze is also heard saying that there is a lot of pressure on him from No. 1 (referring to Singh), who had given him a collection target of Rs 2 crore per day. Waze said No. 1 wants to recover the losses caused during the Covid pandemic,” said Jagtap. Interestingly, Singh himself had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, saying then home minister Anil Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants. In the events that followed, Deshmukh had to resign and face a CBI and Enforcement Directorate probe. Seeking 10-day custody of Waze, Jagtap said they want to interrogate Waze to find out the list of people from whom he extorted on behalf of Singh, who all were beneficiaries of the ring, they want to take Waze’s voice samples so that they can compare with the recorded audio, want to collect electronic evidence and want to know how many BMC contractors he contacted. The police said they are still looking for Param Bir Singh, one Vinay Singh and gangster Chhota Shakeel’s aide Riyaz Bhatti. Waze’s lawyer Sajal Yadav assisted by Raunak Naik opposed police custody for Waze and gave a list of do’s and don’ts given by the doctors as he has undergone a heart surgery, including no interrogation for more than two hours. The court remanded Waze in police custody till November 6. The case pertains to Agarwal’s complaint that Waze, at Singh’s behest, extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raids on two restaurants and bars in Goregaon where Agarwal is a partner. Agarwal also said Waze extorted two high-end mobile phones worth Rs 2.9 lakh from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-bir-asked-waze-to-collect-rs-2cr-daily-police/articleshow/87473709.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC probes judge over ‘child sex assault’; mom of kid writes to PM Narendra Modi||ALWAR/JAIPUR: The Rajasthan high court on Monday deputed a vigilance team to investigate a woman's allegation against a special judge of the Bharatpur district court that he drugged and sodomised her 14-year-old son for a month after befriending him at a tennis club. The judge has been suspended for now. The vigilance team arrived in Bharatpur a day after the boy's mother lodged a police complaint naming special judge Jitendra Singh as one among three people who allegedly sexually assaulted her son. She also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Ashok Gehlot and the state DGP, alleging that her family was being threatened and pressured to withdraw the case. Police are yet to record the boy's statements under Section 164 of the CrPC as the family moved out of the city after the complaint was filed. The police technically can't interrogate the special judge either without the high court's permission, SP Devendra Bishnoi said. The child underwent a medical examination on Sunday, but officials refused to divulge the findings. In her letter to the PM, a copy of which is with TOI, the boy's mother alleged that the Mathura Gate police station initially refused to register her complaint against special judge Singh and co-accused Anshul Soni and Rahul Katara. “An additional SP of ACB in Bharatpur threatened my family. The in-charge of Mathura Gate police station harassed us in the name of interrogation. We have no faith in Bharatpur police and thus we wish to migrate from the state,” she wrote. The woman alleged that her immediate family and relatives have also been falsely implicated in an extortion case. Asked if any extortion case had been lodged against the boy’s family, SP Bishnoi said, “We received the complaint of extortion on Sunday morning, prior to the family's arrival at the police station. We are probing both angles.” According to the complaint, judge Singh took the tennis-playing teenager to his residence and sodomised him, besides forcing him into oral sex multiple times over a month. Sangeeta Beniwal of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said the organisation would counsel the boy. “We have asked for a detailed report from the authorities and our child welfare committee is continuously monitoring the situation. I am in touch with the child and his family.” The boy lives in Bharatpur along with his elder brother and mother.

---||Delhi||Factory owner told to deposit Rs 34 lakh over 17 deaths in 2018 Delhi fire||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has directed the owner of a factory, which was engaged in the manufacture of firecrackers, to deposit Rs 34 lakh with the authorities as compensation for families of 17 victims who lost their lives in a fire incident at the establishment in Bawana in 2018. The court ordered that the amount be deposited with the commissioner of Employees’ Compensation Act of North East district, in two instalments by November and January. Justice Prathiba M Singh said subject to these two deposits being made, delay in filing of a petition by the factory owner shall stand condoned and the interim order in his favour would continue. “The deposit and release of the amounts are being directed to provide some succour to the families of the victims who lost earning members. The above deposits shall be subject to further orders in the present petition,” the court said. It was hearing a plea in connection with a fire incident that occured on January 20, 2018 in a cracker factory in Bawana, which was being run by petitioner Manoj Jain. An FIR was subsequently lodged under the Indian Penal Code and Explosives Act. Jain had moved the high court challenging the January 2018 notices issued to him by the commissioner under the Employees’ Compensation Act, by which he was directed to pay the computed compensation amounts to the legal heirs of the employees who died during employment in the establishment. Seeking condonation of delay, Jain attributed it to his lawyer who was stated to have advised the petitioner that the criminal trial, in respect of the FIR, was more important and proceedings under the Employees’ Compensation Act are civil. During the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel informed the court that in the course of the criminal trial, a sum of Rs 34 lakh was deposited by Jain’s son, against whom the FIR was registered, to show his bonafide in the matter. His son was arrested and granted bail by a trial court on the condition of depositing Rs 34 lakh.The court was informed by the counsel for the Delhi government and some of the victims that there was a third incident of fire at the petitioner’s three factories engaged in the manufacture of crackers. The high court said that under such circumstances and since delay in the present case is more than 1,100 days as per the petitioner and almost 2,000 days as per the Delhi government’s counsel, some conditions would be liable to be imposed for the continuation of the interim order and condonation of delay. The court made it clear that if the deposits are not made by the petitioner, the application seeking condonation of delay shall automatically stand dismissed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/factory-owner-told-to-deposit-rs-34l-over-17-deaths-in-2018-fire/articleshow/87474456.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP, BJP in blame game over Chhath Puja curbs||New Delhi: With the civic body elections just a few months away, both Aam Aadmi Party and Bharatiya Janata Party councillors are blaming each other for the lack of permission to celebrate Chhath Puja on the banks of Yamuna to gain traction among Poorvanchali voters. The councillors from both AAP and BJP stated that although the order does not allow any celebrations at the river, arrangements are nevertheless being made by them as the public is going to throng these ghats to celebrate anyway. While the south corporation has already allotted a maximum of Rs 40,000 for each ward for Chhath arrangements, BJP leaders question the delay in announcing funds. “Delhi government is doing low-level politics on Chhath Puja celebrations. It was because of the efforts of BJP after we created pressure that orders were passed allowing celebrations. We have announced the funds for the arrangements. AAP leaders are exposed in front of the public,” said SDMC mayor, Mukesh Suryan. “The DDMA order has created problems for us as people who want to celebrate will go to the ghats, and stopping them would not be easy. Hence, we along with our councillors are also making arrangements at the Yamuna bank so that everything is conducted in an organised manner,” said an AAP MLA from East Delhi. “BJP leaders should convince their own lieutenant governor (Anil Baijal) to make changes to the order and allow celebrations at the Yamuna river ghats. We will be making arrangements for the public at the ghats anyways” said Rajeev, AAP councillor from north corporation and member of the standing committee. North corporation’s standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that the corporation will give Rs 25,000 for the puja arrangements if a councillor makes a demand for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-in-blame-game-over-chhath-puja-curbs/articleshow/87474457.cms||---

On Monday, a case was booked against the directors of Topworth Steels and Power Limited following a complaint against them by IDBI Bank for a fraud in a Rs 63 crore loan case. Unknown public servants and private persons have also been booked in the case. The company has a steel plant and captive power plant at Umred. It manufactures the Lodha TMT brand of steel bars. The directors booked are Surendra Lodha, Abhay Lodha, Ashiwn Lodha and Nitin Golecha. It has been alleged that the accused entered into a conspiracy to avail loans in the form of letter of credit, trade credit, bank guarantee and cash credit limited. However, the account was classified as non-performing asset due to consistent irregularity in repayment. This has led to a loss of around Rs 63 crore to the IDBI Bank, according to a CBI release. Searches were conducted in Nagpur, Chhattisgarh and Mumbai. Earlier, another company of the same group — Topworth Urja and Metals Limited — was embroiled in the coal block allocation case. However, in September last year CBI had discharged the directors. Surendra was one of the accused in the case. The others booked were SK Mitra and AK Nevatia. They had taken over a company Virangana Steels, which was allotted the coal block, through allegedly questionable means. The company’s directors were discharged on the grounds that they had taken over the company when the coal block was already taken over by some other entity. In November, however, the enforcement directorate attached assets worth Rs 169 crore of Topworth Urja in the same case. Surendra is the director in both Topworth Urja and Topworth Steels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbi-books-loan-fraud-case-against-topworth-steels/articleshow/87472790.cms||---

The engineer, Umesh Patil, was employed but dissatisfied with his salary, police said. He would splurge the money he got from selling the chains on his girlfriend by taking her out to some of the wineries around the city, they said. Patil was partnered by one Tushar Dhikle (30) in 20 of the 56 chain-snatching cases. The duo parted ways from November last year after which Patil single-handedly snatched 36 chains. After Patil’s arrest on October 21, the police arrested Dhikle and four city jewellers. One of the jewellers was the link between the chain-snatchers and the other three jewellers to sell the gold chains. All six accused are presently in police custody. Speaking to mediapersons, city police commissioner Deepak Pandey said Patil was intelligent enough to ensure that he did not get caught. It was a challenge to track down a chain-snatcher who operated alone, he claimed. Deputy commissioner of police Amol Tambe said Patil is the son of a security guard who works in Mumbai. After completing his engineering course from a city college in 2015, Patil worked with a contractor but was not satisfied with his salary and decided to rob gold chains. Pandey said, “The Gangapur police led by senior inspector Riyaz Shaikh have done an outstanding job in nabbing Patil. Shaikh is the youngest among all senior inspectors in the force and took charge of the Gangapur police station just a few months ago. He studied the available CCTV footage to create a plan to nab Patil.” Shaikh said he identified a particular area for patrolling and keeping a vigil. Some of the area was patrolled by police vans and the remainder by plainclothes policemen. On October 21, police naik Milind Pardeshi and constable Ghanshyam Bhoye saw Patil going at slow speed on his motorcycle and followed him. When Patil took a U-turn on the road to approach an elderly woman wearing jewellery, the two policemen sped and rammed their motorcycle against Patil’s. All three fell to the ground and were injured but the policemen nabbed Patil. Patil was wearing two jackets over a T-shirt. When the police removed the top jacket, they found a bag strapped to his shoulders which had a two-wheeler number plate and a screw besides three masks. He apparently would change the number plate after a crime to avoid detection. During investigations, the police found 27 gold chains and Rs 2.5 lakh cash at his residence, totally worth Rs 29.32 lakh. Patil was apparently waiting for gold prices to rise before selling these chains. DCP Tambe said this was the highest number of gold chains ever recovered from any accused in the Nashik police commissionerate. From the money gathered by selling the chains, Patil had purchased a flat worth Rs 48 lakh and a car and had Rs 20 lakh in two bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-engineer-held-for-56-chain-snatching-cases-was-unhappy-with-salary/articleshow/87471950.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Faiyaz A Khudsar, in-charge scientist, Biodiversity Parks Programme, said, “Beavan’s Swift butterfly, which was sighted at both Yamuna and Aravalli biodiversity parks, has grasses as its host species.” The other rare sightings were Parnara Swift, Great Eggfly, Common Albatross and Psyche. “Psyche is a shy white-coloured butterfly and flies persistently, close to the ground with frail wing beats, never rises above the knee-level and is difficult to spot. This time, Psyche has a strikingly high population and the topmost butterfly in Northern Ridge Biodiversity Park. Capparis and Crataeva are its host plants,” said Khudsar. The survey was conducted between October 25 and 30 at Yamuna, Aravalli, Tilpath Valley, Northern Ridge, Neela Hauz, Tughlaqabad and Kalindi biodiversity parks. For six days daily from 10am to noon, 15 fixed nature trails as transects (varying from 500m to 2,000m) were walked by each group of 2-5 observers to count, enumerate and photograph the butterflies. “It was observed that butterflies become active after 10.30am when temperature rises above 24 degrees Celsius. Adult butterflies were seen basking in the sun and mud-pudding in their specialised habitats developed in the biodiversity parks. Their larvae and eggs were also observed on the host plants,” said an official. While 71 species of butterflies were seen in the seven biodiversity parks, the total number of known species recorded is 113. A maximum of 63 species were found in Aravalli Biodiversity Park, while a minimum of 15 species were sighted at Kalindi Biodiversity Park. Officials have decided to carry out similar exercises for birds, mammals and other species along with butterflies every year. “Spread over an area of more than 920 hectares in five districts, the DDA biodiversity parks now become a model for urban sustainability and resilience. Diversity and density of plants and animals are critical to establishing functional ecosystems, especially in the face of climate change and its impacts,” said Khudsar. Apart from Delhi, citizens, students and experts from Hindon river basin districts — Ghaziabad, Baghpat, Shamli and Saharanpur — joined this exercise by counting butterfly species in their respective cities. They observed 65 species from Saharanpur to Ghaziabad. Cabbage white butterfly, which migrates from Shivalik hills, was observed in Saharanpur and Shamli and was yet to reach Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-rare-and-the-beautiful-new-species-of-butterflies-bring-cheer/articleshow/87474459.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Joint commissioner of police (crime) Nilabja Choudhary told TOI, “Around 550 FIRs are registered against Asif Naseem and his absconding brother Rasheed Naseem in Uttar Pradesh alone, including over 500 in Lucknow and 50 in Prayagraj and Varanasi. As many as 375 FIRs are lodged at Gomtinagar police station in Lucknow.” A reward of Rs 5 lakh each was announced on the brothers and Rs 1 lakh each on their five absconding partners Ashish Kanojiya, Nitin Jaiswal, Jasim Khan, Abhishek Yadav and Mohammed Shahid, Choudhary added. Around 4,000 FIRs are lodged against the accused in Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Haryana, Punjab and UP for duping investors by promising them plots and flats in plush apartments at very cheap rates, said officials. Police sources said Rasheed, who is still absconding, is reportedly hiding in the Gulf. Asif was the managing director in the firm with 49% ownership. The cases lodged in Lucknow, Prayagraj and Varanasi are being investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of UP Police, the JCP said. EOW officials are collecting information about movable and immovable assets of the company and the accused. Asif was hiding in Mumbai and had come to Prayagraj to meet his relatives when he was arrested on Monday. Assistant commissioner of police, Gomtinagar, Shweta Srivastava said Asif and Rasheed, residents of Prayagraj, had started a real estate firm in 2013 from Lucknow. They launched several schemes offering plots and flats at cheap rates to lure investors and promised to give possession after a certain time. “In most cases, when investors approached them for possession, they used to convince them to invest the money in some other scheme. People then started realising the fraud and started lodging police cases. Close to 4,000 cases have been lodged against this company across the country,” the ACP said. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also lodged a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act this year and is conducting investigations against the brothers and the co-accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/realtor-named-in-4000-firs-carrying-rs-5l-reward-nabbed/articleshow/87474463.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Ex-CM Trivendra Singh Rawat stopped at Kedarnath, days ahead of PM Modi's visit||DEHRADUN: With the state government yet to take a stand on the Devasthanam Management Board Act — which gives power to bureaucrats to manage temples in the hill state, including the four Char Dham shrines — priests at Kedarnath on Monday denied entry to former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat under whose tenure the Act was passed in 2019. Rawat and his entourage of nearly 25 people, including Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal Gama, was met with stiff resistance as priests waved black flags at them while priests in Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines in Uttarkashi district, too, refused to perform any religious rituals to mark their protest. The locals extended their support and shops were shut in Gangotri and Yamunotri. While the government has already formed a committee to decide on the matter, priests had set October 31 as the deadline for the government to roll back the Act. The community has now threatened to oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Kedarnath on November 5. The PM is scheduled to visit the shrine to inaugurate the statue of Adi Shankaracharya. Trivendra Singh Rawat, meanwhile, told TOI he was “surprised” and “shocked” by the protest. “The temple belongs to devotees and not to any individual, caste or community. Such kind of behaviour and words have no place in a democracy or society.” The former CM alleged that priests had raised slogans about the unity and strength of a particular caste. “Giving such matters a casteist angle is not right. I pray to Kedarnath to give wisdom to these people,” he said. On Monday, health minister Dhan Singh Rawat and state BJP chief Madan Kaushik — who visited Kedarnath to take stock of preparations ahead of the PM's visit — were allowed to enter the shrine only after an hour-long negotiation. Several priests and local residents lay on the road to prevent them from moving ahead. Trivendra Rawat said the treatment meted out to senior leaders was “extremely derogatory”. The former CM pointed out that locals and staff of Triyuginarayan temple – which is close to Kedarnath – have “welcomed the decision on Devasthanam Board”. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, however, told TOI, “CM Pushkar Singh Dhami has repeatedly assured us action in the matter, but despite the commitment he has failed to do anything. After a committee was formed in the matter, we had given him time till October 31 to scrap the Board and now when the deadline is over, we are left with no other option than to express our disappointment over the matter.” Sati said the state government had asked for names of two priests from each Char Dham shrine to be included in the committee. “The names of priests as members were announced on October 25 and on the same day, committee chairman Manohar Kant Dhyani handed over the report to the CM. Secondly, the names included from Badrinath dham in the committee are not priests. When the government did not want to include the names given by us in the committee or the interim report was to be prepared without consulting us, then what was the point of having a committee?” said Sati. “We will oppose the visit of PM Narendra Modi to Kedarnath on November 5 and a similar protest would be staged before each prominent BJP leader visiting any of the four revered shrines,” said Sati. During a visit to Uttarkashi on July 15 this year, CM Dhami had announced the review of the Act. On August 15, he had formed a committee to look into the matter.

The tiny tots perhaps wouldn’t know that the school’s beloved teacher who readied the handmade bouquets for each of them was no more. In a heart wrenching incident, the teacher C Madhavi developed uneasiness during an online class last Wednesday night, and collapsed and died at her house soon after she wound up the Class 3 lessons at around 8:15pm. Just before her final moments, she told the students that she was coughing and feeling breathless and that they would continue the class another day, and wound it up after assigning homework. According to school authorities, she is believed to have died of a heart attack. The teacher had telephoned her nephew to come home as she was feeling ill. When he reached her house, the teacher was found lying on the floor. She was immediately taken to hospital, but was declared brought dead. School headmaster Krishnan T S said that Madhavi teacher had come to school on her final day and suggested that they spruce up the Praveshanotsavam by presenting the students of class 1 and 2 with colourful paper bouquets. “The teacher had personally made 12 bouquets on Wednesday. It was her desire to welcome the kids with bouquets and so the school’s ex-students made the remaining paper bouquets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/students-welcomed-with-gifts-made-by-departed-teacher/articleshow/87473749.cms||---

The accused Keshu Parmar, who is also a distant uncle of the boy, asked the minor to accompany him to the temple at around 1.15pm. The boy was playing alone outside his house when Parmar approached him. Since the boy knew Parmar, he went along with the accused on his motorcycle. Parmar, instead of taking the boy to the temple, took him to a deserted place near Ambedkarnagar. The accused started touching the boy inappropriately and also removed his clothes which made the boy uncomfortable, and he started shouting. Hearing his plea, people gathered at the spot and nabbed Parmar. The boy’s parents were called and informed about the incident. After his parents lodged a complaint of abduction and under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at Thorala police station, Parmar was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/52-yr-old-man-held-for-molesting-minor-nephew/articleshow/87471962.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Fewer takers, more wastage spur calls for single-dose vax vials||NAGPUR: With footfalls at even government centres falling, the doctors in charge at some centres have suggested that single dose Covid vaccine vials should now be made available to ensure beneficiaries don’t have to wait for enough recipients, or return in case the numbers fail to add up. Complicating the scenario further, Ambedkar Hospital centre received a batch of Covaxin vials having 20 doses each. As per the centre officials, 20 or 10-dose vials are not needed right now. A couple of days back, some citizens had to allegedly return without the jab as centre staff refused to open a 20-dose vial apprehending wastage. GMCH, where the first Covaxin centre was set up in Nagpur division, used to get 20-dose vials in the initial months, said medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande. He added they are now getting 10-dose vials. Among the 8 Covaxin centres run by NMC, it seems only Ambedkar Hospital and civic-run Isolation Hospital received 20-dose vials in recent days. According to NMC data, 480 doses of both vaccines were wasted across 100 centres on Monday. The day’s vaccination too fell to just 8,310 for whom 879 vials were opened. A senior administrative official from Ambedkar Hospital denied the allegation that some people were sent back, but admitted that it was getting difficult to utilize all doses. “We have not received any complaint. NMC has allowed wastage of just one dose. Unless we have maximum possible recipients, the staff doesn’t open a vial,” he said. The official added, “If single dose vaccines are available, no one will have to wait.” Officials from Ashi Nagar zone, which includes the hospital and 13 more centre, too admitted that both Covishield and Covaxin centre staff are in constant dilemma these days. “Usually we have requisite numbers in morning hours. Afternoon onwards, all centres keep shifting people to avoid wastage. If two centres have five each, then all are inoculated at one place,” they said. A zonal official too said vials with fewer doses are needed instead of 10 or more. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said instructions have been given to shift the doses instead of asking citizens to reach another centre in the vicinity. “One batch of Covaxin we received had 20-dose vials. Covishield is 10-dose vials only and available at most of the centres,” he said. Joshi said the city has covered nearly 85% of the target and remaining people are being covered in door to door drives. The mobile vaccination teams are carrying 10-dose vials, which are utilized within 4 hours of opening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fewer-takers-more-wastage-spur-calls-for-single-dose-vax-vials/articleshow/87472805.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Dehradun||On deadly mountain roads, overloaded vehicles adding to avoidable deaths||Dehradun: A day after 13 people were killed when the utility vehicle they were travelling in — crammed with passengers far beyond its capacity — fell into a gorge near Dehradun, the incident has again put the spotlight on the menace of overloaded vehicles navigating treacherous mountain roads, risking lives. The Chakrata-Tyuni route — the site of Sunday’s accident — lacks a well-connected public transport network, leaving passengers at the mercy of private-cars-turned-utility-vehicles which have found ways to tamper vehicle specifications to fit in more passengers. “Some drivers have changed the seat alignment in their cars. For instance, instead of horizontal seats, vehicles have vertical seating where passengers sit face-to-face,” a local driver on condition of anonymity told TOI, admitting that this could affect the vehicle’s balance, but that “they do it anyway since it means more money”. Another driver on the route, Neeraj Negi, however, said drivers were not the only ones at fault. “Drivers, too, die in case of an accident. It is the passengers who plead and put pressure on us to accommodate them,” he said. Local residents said that in the absence of public transport, they are forced to risk their lives and board crowded vehicles. Surveer Singh, village pradhan of Banyana village (Chakrata) said, “There have been several accidents in the past, but nothing has been done by the authorities. The villagers are dependent on utility vehicles as they provide last-mile connectivity which buses don’t.” On October 22, six members of a family travelling on the route had died after their car fell into a gorge. In June, 2019, six of a family, including a CISF inspector, had lost their lives. In 2017, after a private bus going from Vikas Nagar to Tyuni met with an accident, killing 45 people, the then-CM Trivendra Rawat had announced setting up of a mini bus depot in Kalsi but that remained on paper. Sushil Niranjan ARTO (Vikasnagar), who visited the accident site on Monday, told TOI that the “driver’s carelessness was to be blamed for the incident”. “The vehicle was carrying 15 passengers against its capacity of up to eight.” Sandeep Saini RTO (enforcement) added that a crackdown would be initiated against overloaded vehicles. “Strict checking will take place. We are also planning to put in a request for increasing the number of buses on the route.” Uttarakhand Transport Corporation general manager Deepak Jain told TOI that five roadways buses are operating on the route. “We are making efforts to increase the number of buses but it’s difficult to deploy more buses immediately,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/on-deadly-mountain-roads-overloaded-vehicles-adding-to-avoidable-deaths/articleshow/87472822.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, MLC and BJP city president Pravin Datke and MLA Vikas Kumbhare inaugurated the STP which has a capacity to treat 5,000 litre sewage water per day. Tiwari said that the work to install 14 such mini STPs in different gardens is in progress. “If all the mini STPs start functioning, the NMC can save 40 lakh litre of potable water in the city,” he said. NMC is the first municipal corporation in the country where wastewater recycling projects will be set up at 14 gardens. The water from the nullah flowing below the Gandhibagh garden will be recycled and used in the park, the mayor said. Every year there is a shortage of water in the gardens during summer seasons with depletion of water level in wells. “To overcome this, the NMC has undertaken this project and now greenery in NMC gardens can easily be maintained even during scorching summers,” he added. The entire system used for the wastewater treatment plant is manufactured by a Japanese firm. The work to install 14 mini STPs in other gardens is in the final stages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-starts-mini-stp-at-gandhibagh-garden/articleshow/87472828.cms||---

The Northeast Lifestyle Gallery at the museum has been revamped for the celebrations. Several dance performances and online lectures are expected to highlight the diverse artistic traditions and communities of the Northeastern states. “The gallery was last curated in 1989.

The plethora of exhibits include textiles, jewellery, utility tools and personal adornments. Textiles and costumes of the Naga, Mizo, Khasi, Adi, Mishmi, Rabha and Karbi communities celebrate the colour of unity of their ordinances and value the differences. “Gender equality, agriculture and mass traditions, Naga dancers, tangible and intangible aspects of the cultures are being celebrated here,” said Bhattacharya.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nawab Malik, Devendra Fadnavis trade allegations over drug and underworld links||MUMBAI: The political slugfest over the working of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) took another turn on Monday with allegations flying between NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. A day after tweeting a photograph of Fadnavis's wife Amruta with an alleged drug peddler, Jaideep Rana, Malik on Monday demanded a probe either by the CBI or a judicial inquiry into Fadnavis's alleged nexus with a drug peddler. "I have tweeted two pictures of Rana, one with Amruta and another with Devendra Fadnavis. It was not a coincidence or taken on the sidelines of an event. It appears that Rana knows the Fadnavis family for a long time. He was the main financier of the project (the River Anthem song featuring Amruta Fadnavis). A known drug peddler, Rana has been arrested under the NDPS Act and is currently in Sabarmati jail," Malik said. Soon after, Fadnavis hit back, alleging Malik had links with the underworld. Nawab Malik’s was a dud fataka, I will drop a bomb, says FadnavisNawab Malik attempted a ‘fuska fataka’ (dud cracker), but now, after Diwali, I will drop a bomb! I will expose his underworld links and will send all evidence to Shri Sharad Pawar ji too,” Devendra Fadnavis tweeted on Monday after Nawab Malik alleged the former CM had links with drug peddlers. Apparently, the picture of alleged peddler Jaideep Rana was taken during shooting of the River Anthem song, featuring Amruta, Devendra Fadnavis, then finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, and a few bureaucrats. Rana was allegedly finance head of the project. After Malik tweeted pictures of Rana with the Fadnavis family, his name was removed from the video description, Malik alleged. “It’s time to discuss the relationship between drug peddlers and BJP. I have reasons to believe it was during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis that Maharashtra witnessed a sudden growth in drug peddling,” Malik said. The former CM, who called a press conference, retorted, “Not only my wife, people clicked pictures with me as well. These people had come with the organisers of River March. Merely because pictures are clicked does not mean we are associated with them.” Fadnavis added, “Malik’s son-in-law was caught with drugs. This has happened in his house. The way Malik said that the entire BJP is associated with the drug mafia, then applying his ratio, does that mean the entire NCP is a drug mafia? To release a picture of my wife shows his mentality.” Malik said that Fadnavis was hatching a conspiracy to defame his political opponents and supervising appointments in probe agencies like the NCB “for cheap publicity”. “Look at the appointment of NCB’s Sameer Wankhede. Most of the raids conducted by Wankhede are fake,” he reiterated. Malik took a dig at vice-chairman of National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Arun Haldar, saying he had granted a clean chit to Wankhede without verifying documents. “I am told Haldar visited the residence of Wankhede, glanced through a few documents shown by him and granted him a clean chit. Why so much hurry, particularly when Haldar is holding a constitutional post?” Malik asked. Opposition leader in the council Pravin Darekar said Malik is a “complete failure and hence was making allegations. He demanded Malik’s resignation as minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nawab-maliks-was-a-dud-fataka-i-will-drop-a-bomb-says-fadnavis/articleshow/87473777.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Number of voters down a lakh in Delhi's new electoral roll||NEW DELHI: The draft electoral roll of Delhi published on Monday shows a fall of over 1 lakh voters, including over 59,000 deceased and 2,51,062 shifted out compared with the list published on January 15. A total of 2,16,702 new electors have been added to the roll. It’s quite usual for the number of voters to increase or decrease due to deletion necessitated by shifting, death and inclusion of new voters. The list published on January 15 showed 1,48,98,069 voters. The draft electoral roll published on November 1 had 1,47,95,549 electors, a fall of 1,02,520. The number of male voters decreased by 70,149 and female electors by 32,406. Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh on Monday said the special summary revision of the electoral roll with January 1, 2022 as the qualifying date had commenced in all 70 assembly constituencies. The primary objective of the exercise was to include newly eligible and left out voters who had completed or would be completing the age of 18 on or before January 1, 2022. Another reason was to give opportunities for correction in electors’ particulars and also to invite objections against any wrong inclusion. It’s not clear if deaths due to Covid-19 were a factor for the fall as the cause of death was not known to the poll authorities. Over 25,000 people died due to Covid-19 in Delhi. Claims and objections can be filed from November 1 to 30 and special camps would be organised at pollution station locations on November 6-7 and 27-28. A special camp would be organised for the homeless at DUSIB night shelters and other pockets on November 10 between 5pm and 9pm. The disposal of claims and objections would be done by December 20. The final electoral roll would be published on January 5. A person whose name has been deleted from the electoral roll wrongfully can file an appeal under The Representation of the People Act, 1950 within 15 days to the district election officer or submit Form-6 for inclusion of their name any time during summary revision of the electoral roll. Out of Delhi’s 70 assembly constituencies, Matiala is the largest with 4,28,340 electors and Delhi Cantonment the smallest with 1,10,255 voters. Tilak Nagar assembly constituency has the highest gender ratio of 950 and Tughlaqabad the lowest with 684.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/number-of-voters-down-a-lakh-in-new-electoral-roll/articleshow/87474497.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Her husband missing since April, cancer patient moves DCW||NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has ordered an inquiry on the complaint of a cancer patient who has claimed that her husband is missing since April this year when he was admitted for Covid-19 treatment at a city hospital. The woman has alleged negligence on the part of Delhi Police and hospital authorities. However, the police said the man was taken to a hospital by them and since he was Covid positive, he was referred to another hospital that has no record of him. The commission said that the woman stated that after around two weeks of her husband having gone missing, she was informed by Delhi Police that her husband was found in an unconscious state in Punjabi Bagh on April 13 by a PCR van, which took him to Acharya Shri Bhikshu Hospital in Motinagar. Preliminary medical tests there revealed that he was Covid-19 positive. Thereafter, the man was transferred through CATS (Centralised Accident & Trauma Services) ambulance to Lok Nayak Hospital. However, when she rushed to Lok Nayak Hospital to meet her husband, he was not there and she has heard no news of him ever since, the woman said in her complaint. DCW said in a statement on Monday that during a preliminary inquiry, it has been verified that her husband was referred by Acharya Shri Bhikshu Hospital as he was Covid-19 positive. “Further, CATS has also informed the commission that the patient was taken to Lok Nayak Hospital, though it is not clear whether he was admitted by the hospital or not. The commission has been informed by Lok Nayak Hospital that no record of the man is available with them,” said the panel. The statement further said that the commission has “instituted an inquiry and issued notices to all concerned to find out the whereabouts of the man and fix accountability of the hospitals, CAT ambulance and police in the matter. Acharya Bhikshu Hospital has been asked to give reasons on the need of transferring the man and whether any contact was established with LNJP Hospital before doing the same. CATS has been asked for details of the handover of the patient in Lok Nayak Hospital.” CATS has also been asked that in case they left the patient outside the hospital, who sanctioned the act? Delhi Police has been asked about the details of their role in the matter, it said. Further, Lok Nayak Hospital has been asked to conduct an inquiry and inform the commission as to what happened to the man. Swati Maliwal, chairperson, DCW, claimed that the cancer patient was being made to run from pillar to post to find her husband. “Accountability needs to be fixed...the commission will assist her in her struggle for justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/her-husband-missing-since-april-cancer-patient-moves-dcw/articleshow/87474499.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Air ‘very poor’, crackers will turn Lucknow into a gas chamber’||LUCKNOW: The air pollution levels in the city once again worsened to ‘very poor’ category on Monday, making it 10th most polluted city in the country. Experts warned that the situation may deteriorate further if people do not exercise restraint in bursting crackers and the city would turn into a ‘gas chamber’ on Diwali night. Lucknow’s Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 308 in the past 24 hours — an increase of about 100 points in comparison to Sunday. The PM2.5 concentration in the city’s air was more than three times of the permissible limit of 60. Track the pollution level in your cityThe AQI between 301-400 is regarded as ‘very poor’ and prolonged exposure to such air leads to respiratory illness. The rise in air pollution levels is being attributed to change in weather conditions. As the winter is around the corner in north India, the mist formed in the night combines with particulate matter in the air to form aerosols which hang in the atmosphere for a longer period, thus increasing AQI. The emission of pollutants is high at present because of heavy vehicular movement for festival shopping. Environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta said, “Air pollution has gradually increased in the past 10 days due to heavy traffic because of festivals. People need to take care of the environment and prefer walking to nearby markets or use public transport.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/air-very-poor-crackers-will-turn-city-into-a-gas-chamber/articleshow/87474490.cms||---

This is in contradiction to an earlier order that made the TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) certificate valid for lifetime. The decision taken in June 2021 was a big relief for the students as they didn’t have to appear for the tests after every 7 years to get their TET renewed. However, this time, the state government is only considering candidates, who have TET certificates not older than 7 years, for 2,287 vacant teaching posts in the state. Meanwhile, the state education department has said that the TET certificate’s validity will be considered for lifetime when the next recruitment process takes place. The ongoing recruitment process was on hold for a while and thus, it will be carried out according to earlier provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/those-with-tet-certificates-older-than-7-yrs-not-eligible-for-recruitment-process/articleshow/87472843.cms||Mohammad Anab

Of these, 423 were from the city.From October 22 to 31, the district case count rose to 1,228 (including 926 from the city), with 648 (503 of the city, which comprises 77.6%) more cases recorded in the 10 days. In the period, the number of cases from rural areas increased from 110 to 215, which is 16.2% of the total cases of the district. The rural areas of Ludhiana comprise Raikot, Samrala, Hathur, Koom Kalan, Malaud, Machhiwara, Manupur, Pakhowal, Payal, Sahnewal, Sidhwan Bet and Sudhar. In these days, Jagraon and Khanna reported 40 cases, which is 6.17% of the total cases.Civil surgeon Dr S P Singh said, “Growing number of dengue cases is a cause of concern and steps are being taken to check it. Fogging is being done extensively and monitored by the deputy commissioner. We destroy the larvae during checking of houses, among others. Fogging is the only way to destroy adult mosquitoes.” Residents said the municipal corporation should have done extensive fogging right from the start of the dengue season. “Because of the authorities’ delays, people suffer. Had the municipal corporation (MC) started fogging at the right time, the case jump could have been prevented,” said Rohit Aggarwal, a businessman of Barewal.Another resident said, “This is sheer negligence on the part of the department concerned. As the required steps were not taken in time, residents are at the receiving end.”Meanwhile, municipal corporation authorities claimed that fogging was started in time. MC commissioner Pradeep Sabharwal said, “We are doing our best. Fogging is being done at a number of places with pumps and 25 vehicles are also involved in the process. It was started in time.”  “Mosquitoes are breeding in potholes too. Fogging is not being done adequately, even in my area. It could have contained the disease,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal. Senior epidemiologist Dr Clarence Samuel, who is vice-principal of CMCH, said, “The cases will continue to increase till November. A lot of children are getting affected and their cells are dropping very fast. People should wear full clothes, don’t allow water to accumulate in their vicinity and use mosquito repellents.”Dr Anurag Chowdhary of community medicines department at DMCH said, “Fogging is important when there is an outbreak of dengue as it eliminates adult mosquitoes, which are infected. Larvae and pupa can be checked and destroyed with larvicide, oil, among others. People should ensure that there is no artificial accumulation of water around them.”Rise in patients admitted to hospitalsThe number of patients admitted to hospitals in Ludhiana was 148 on October 21 evening.

Condemning the DMK for turning a blind eye to the hindrances caused by the Kerala government, Panneerselvam said that the date of the demonstration to protect the interests of the farmers, would be announced after consultation with the party’s deputy coordinator and former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.A consultative meeting headed by AIADMK coordinator Panneerselvam was held at Madurai on Monday in order to discuss the Mullaperiyar dam issue. AIADMK district secretaries from Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram participated. Addressing mediapersons after the meeting, Panneerselvam said that the AIADMK government led by late CM J Jayalalithaa has taken several steps to protect the rights of the farmers from the five southern districts on the Mullaperiyar dam, by taking legal steps to increase its water storage level to 142 feet. He said that the AIADMK government had created history since the water level at the dam had touched the 142 feet mark thrice.However, Panneerselvam said that the situation has now changed after the DMK government led by M K Stalin came to power. Though the Kerala government is causing several hindrances to store water up to 142ft mark, the DMK government had turned a blind eye on the issue.Earlier, Panneerselvam paid respect to the statue of the Marudhu brothers near Mariamman Teppakulam in Madurai and to the statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar at his memorial in Pasumpon in Ramanathapuram district on Monday.Panneerselvam also deposited in the bank locker, the golden armour which was adorned to the statue of Muthuramalinga Thevar to mark his 114th birth anniversary and 59th guru puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-to-organise-protests-on-mullaperiyar-dam-issue/articleshow/87473782.cms||---

---||Business||Premium non-payment can get claim rejected: SC||NEW DELHI: An insurance claim can be rejected if the policy has lapsed on account of non-payment of premium, said the Supreme Court. It also stressed that the terms of an insurance policy have to be strictly interpreted. The apex court observation came while setting aside an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) that ordered additional compensation in a road accident case. A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Bela M Trivedi said it is a well-settled legal position that in a contract of insurance there is a requirement of Uberrima fides, ie good faith on the part of the insured. “It is clear that the terms of insurance policy have to be strictly construed, and it is not permissible to rewrite the contract while interpreting the terms of the policy,” the bench said. The SC was hearing an appeal filed by the LIC against the judgement of the NCDRC that had set aside the order passed by the state commission. In the case, the woman’s husband had taken a life insurance policy under the Jeevan Suraksha Yojana from LIC under which a sum of Rs. 3.7 lakh was assured by the company. Besides this amount, in case of death by accident an additional sum of Rs. 3.7 lakh was also assured. The insurance premium of the said policy was to be paid six-monthly. However, there was a default in payment. On March 6, 2012, the husband of the complainant met with an accident and succumbed to injuries on March 21, 2012. After the death of her husband, the complainant filed a claim before LIC and was paid a sum of Rs. 3.7 lakh. However, the additional sum of Rs. 3.7 lakh towards the accident claim benefit was denied. “In the instant case, the policy had lapsed on October 14, 2011, and was not in force on the date of accident, ie on March 6, 2012. It was sought to be revived on March 9, 2012, after the accident in question, and that too without disclosing the fact of the accident which had taken place on March 6, 2012,” the SC said. The top court said apart from the fact that the complainant had not come with clean hands to claim the add on/extra Accident benefit of the policy, the policy in question was not in force on the date of the accident as per condition no. 11 of the policy, the claim for extra Accident benefit was rightly rejected by the Corporation. "Since clause 3 of the said terms and conditions of the policy permitted the renewal of the discontinued policy, the appellant-Corporation had revived the policy of complainant by accepting the payment of premium after the due date and paid Rs 3,75,000 as assured under the policy, nonetheless for the Accident benefit, the policy had to be in force for the full sum assured on the date of accident as per the said condition no. 11," the bench said. The apex court said the accident benefit could have been claimed and availed of only if the accident had taken place after the renewal of the policy. "The Court, therefore, is of the opinion that the impugned order passed by the NCDRC setting aside the order passed by the Commission and reviving the order passed by the District Forum was highly erroneous and liable to be set aside," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/premium-non-payment-can-get-claim-rejected-sc/articleshow/87475452.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Rush in city markets, but people not buying much||DHANTERAS AND DIWALILudhiana: With only three days to go for Diwali and Dhanteras on Tuesday, huge rush is being witnessed in the city markets, shops and auto dealerships. Unlike last year when very poor sales were reported, this year there is a bit of respite. But according to businessmen, the purchasing power of people has gone down as compared with the previous years and many have turned to online shopping. Some businesses that have low priced articles are witnessing a rush. Harpal Singh Sidhu, owner of an electronics store, said, “As compared with last year, we are seeing a good turnout of customers making purchases. Some of the much sought-after items are microwave ovens, washing machines and LED TVs. However, unlike previous years, few customers are turning up for big purchases. Luxury items, like costly home theatre systems, big-sized LED TVs, are not attracting buyers. It seems the pandemic has taken a toll on the spending power of people, besides many are indulging in online shopping, where they get more discounts and a variety of options for converting purchases into EMIs.”Tribhuvan Thapar, a city-based jeweller, said, “The overall situation this festive season is slightly better than last year. The articles that are in demand right now include coins of both gold and silver, glasses and silver statues. We are anticipating a pickup in sales on Tuesday and these may remain high till Diwali. Though our business too has been hit by the e-commerce giants and brands, we can unfortunately do nothing about it. Besides, the other factor hitting our sales is people preferring to buy low-cost articles for gifting as they see gold and silver out of their reach now.”Kamal Singh, manager of a crockery store, said, “We are getting a good response from customers during this festive season. There are a lot of enquiries for glassware, drinkware, cutlery and also products like lunchboxes, thermos and blenders. Unlike the earlier trend of buying only steel ahead of or on Dhanteras, this time people are buying anything that offers more value for money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rush-in-city-markets-but-people-not-buying-much/articleshow/87469339.cms||Mohit Behl

The petition filed on behalf of several aggrieved employees by Rahul Shiralkar stated that there are two vacancies of judicial members at Nagpur and both were not filled up since the last two years. When it is filled after an inordinate delay, the person who is appointed hardly gets a tenure to perform his duty. While fixing the petition for final disposal at the admissions stage, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare on Friday issued notices to the respondents, including the Central and state governments, asking them to reply within four weeks. The other respondents included the union department of personnel and training (tribunal) secretary and joint secretary and Maharashtra general administration department (GAD) secretary. “Government pleader Ketki Joshi to take up the issue with the state government and revert to this court with an appropriate response,” the judges said. According to the petitioner, the petition has been filed to air the grievances of hundreds of government employees whose several matters are pending before the MAT bench for many years. “No relief is coming their way in view of the indifference of the respondents in filling up both vacancies,” the judges said. Besides the judicial officers, Shiralkar contended that there is also shortage of other staff members, lack of video conferencing facilities and inadequate infrastructure at the city-based bench. “There are three posts of judicial members and only one stenographer has been provided. There are in all 39 sanctioned posts of administrative staff and judicial members out of which 15 posts are lying vacant,” he said. Quoting names of former HC judges like RG Deshpande, Kishor Rohee, MN Gilani, AP Deshpande and others, the petitioner said the MAT bench here was one of the best in the state, but now suffering due to vacancies. “The respondents need to look into the matter of shortage of staff and take immediate steps to fill up the vacancies so that functioning of the tribunal is not hampered. Non-availability of judicial members is causing great inconvenience to the litigants whose cases are pending since 2010. There are remanded back matters by HC with directive to decide the same within a specified period. However, it cannot be decided because of absence of judicial members in the tribunal,” he said. The petitioner said it is the duty of the respondents to fill up posts of members of tribunals as and when they are vacant, being the coordinating agency of the Union of India. “Till date there is no appointment made of judicial members for MAT, even though the consent of the retired judges are taken long back, causing inconvenience to litigants,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lawyer-moves-hc-against-vacancies-at-mat-bench-since-2-yrs/articleshow/87442410.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||VIP to get Phoolan statue in Nishad houses in Purvanchal||Lucknow: At a time when political parties in UP have geared up for the 2022 elections, there are also some that will mark their debut in the state. The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) is one such party aiming for a long run in UP by banking on the legacy of Nishad leader, Phoolan Devi. After the state government did not allow it to install an 18-ft statue of Phoolan Devi in 18 divisional headquarters on July 25, the day Phoolan died and what is observed as Shahadat Diwas, from November 15 the party will distribute a bust of the late leader among voters of 169 seats where it intends to contest. “Now the party will get her statue established in every house of Nishad brothers and sisters in Purvanchal,” said party national president, Mukesh Sahni. The 169 seats it has identified have 12-18% Nishad voters. The party’s mass outreach programme will start in every block of the seats from November 15. “Statues will be distributed in every block in these constituencies,” said party national spokesperson, Dev Jyoti. The party’s aim is to capitalise on her legacy at a time when other Nishad leaders and Nishad-centric political outfits are also staking their claim on her legacy. Phoolan Devi, in her tenure as MP, had raised the issue of reservation for Nishads on several occasions. This is what these parties are fighting for till date. And when the state government has already announced that it is working to make it possible, the Nishad-centric parties are being even more vociferous about the demand. The VIP has just wrapped up its Nishad Janchetna rallies held in 13 districts of Purvanchal from October 17-30. It has also started addressing Phoolan as ‘veerangana’ (brave woman). The party’s pamphlet printed on July 25 read, “Phoolan abhi zinda hai, hamare aur aapke vichaaron mein, maata behno ke sangharshon mein.” Phoolan was born in August 1963 to a Mallah family in Shekhpur Gudha ka Purwa village in Jalaun. The party’s pamphlet mentioned that she was put to non-stop harassment by a ‘specific community’ in the village but she “did not bow down” and eventually made her way to the parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vip-to-get-phoolan-statue-in-nishad-houses-in-purvanchal/articleshow/87474516.cms||Neha Shukla

To boost the confidence of students, the school education department had arranged a grand welcome with traditional music and cartoon characters, sweets, balloons, and gifts in almost every school entrance.Minister for commercial taxes and registration P Moorthy, Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, and Madurai South MLA M Boominathan welcomed students at various schools in the city with chocolates, flowers and gifts.In a bid to cheer up students, most schools had decorated the campuses with balloons, paintings and decorations. At Government Model Girls’ Higher Secondary School in Y Othakadai, students were welcomed by those who were dressed up as cartoon characters. In Chairman Manickavasagam Middle School, Devakottai, teachers offered ‘Aarathy’ for students.Keeping the SOPs as provided for senior students, school teachers at the entrance of the schools had monitored the body temperature of the kids. While schools with minimal strength invited all students between classes I to VIII, schools that have higher strength preferred to host classes for different classes on alternative days.A section of class I and class II students who are entering the classrooms for the first time had displayed apprehensions. “We interacted with the children who felt homesick, activities-based learning such as hopping and counting the numbers helped them mingle with their classmates,” E Bhuvaneshwari, Trichy Corporation Elementary School in E Pudur, said.A section of the parents become emotional to leave their children in classrooms after a year, the kids were hugging their parents, not letting them leave the school. Block education officer in Trichy district K Maruthanayagam said that the patronage for the reopening of schools was overwhelming. “Post the pandemic, parents have banked their trust on government schools, we have to sustain the patronage,” he said. Education department officials said that the school management were told to keep a check on the health of the lower-class students as they cannot express the illness properly.Private schools also witnessed good response on the first day and only a few students were absent.

---||Kozhikode||Kottooly GLPS: The odd one out with zero attendance||Kozhikode: While schools across the state reopened on a celebratory note after the long pandemic break on Monday, the Government LP School at Kottooly, located in an upscale residential neighborhood in the city, unfortunately remained the odd one out with nil attendance. The government school, under Kozhikode corporation, was not decked up with even a single welcome poster or garland. It could perhaps be the only government school in the state that had no trappings of Praveshanotsavam and none of its eight students turned up, and the classroom doors remained locked. The only ones in attendance were head teacher E Hamza and lady teacher Shanu Krishna and the school’s two support staff. Of the eight students in classes 1 to 4, six belong to families of guest labourers. Ajimudheen, one of the parents hailing from Assam, is the school’s PTA president. “While two students from a migrant labour family had gone to their homeland in Assam during Covid second wave, four students of two other migrant labour families have not come today because they are shifting to a new house,” said Hamza. Despite having a decent infrastructure, including well-maintained classrooms with tiled floor, a new playground and locational advantages, the school has been left behind in the much-touted Public Education Rejuvenation Mission of the state government. The 93-year-old school is located in a residential area, but children there have been flocking to an unaided CBSE school and an aided UP school in the area. “The student strength has dropped since the last one decade. With skyrocketing real estate prices, many families that sent their students to the school sold off their land and moved away. The new residents are rich and prefer other schools,” Hamza added. “We have all facilities here except students. If nearby residents enroll their kids here, they can avoid public transport, and it is easy for us to maintain social distancing in classes as there are only a few kids in each class,” said the headmaster. Corporation education standing committee chairperson C Rekha said that the school has not been getting adequate student enrolment and the corporation is planning a campaign to garner support of local residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kottooly-glps-the-odd-one-out-with-zero-attendance/articleshow/87473806.cms||---

The parents, who are Afghan nationals, want to return to India and be with their children, but are unable to get visas, as they claim their documents have been “cancelled” by the Taliban regime.Bunty Kaur, 40-year-old widow of Narayan Singh of Kabul, is there and her daughters, Sonakshi (9) and Seerat (5), are in Kundanpuri with their maternal aunt Kavita. Bunty told the Times of India over phone from Kabul, “My husband had died after an illness on February 26 this year and after that I went to India to immerse his mortal remains at Haridwar. Since my husband had left behind some money in a bank in Kabul, I went back before August 15, leaving behind my daughters in India. And after that I got stuck. Last Diwali we had celebrated in Kabul and this year I lost my husband and my children are away from me. So Diwali is not the same for us. We request Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to help us so that we can re-unite with our children.”In Ludhiana, Sonakshi, elder daughter of Bunty, has been waiting desperately to meet her mother. She does not know whom to approach to get her mother back home. Similar is the plight of the family members of Darshan Kaur of Sindhu Nagar, whose granddaughters, Manpreet Kaur (14) and Taranjeet Kaur (13), are with her and her daughter Channa Kaur and son-in-law Rajinder Singh, who has a medical store in Shor Bazaar of Kabul, are stuck there. “My daughter and son-in-law have been living in Kabul for more than 10 years and are Afghan citizens. My granddaughters Manpreet and Taranjeet, kids of Channa Kaur, came here after a bomb blast near a gurdwara in Shor Bazaar in February this year. In the blast our relative Sunny Singh had died on February 6 and relatives, Chocha Singh and Sher Singh, were injured. They didn’t want to live there because of fear. Who would have known that they would get stuck there after change in the regime. Now we have heard that their visas are no longer valid and they cannot come here as there is no embassy there. We are trying to help them. Last year, my granddaughters were with their parents on Diwali, but they will not celebrate this time. Wait for their parents is getting longer,” Darshan said.Her son-in-law, Rajinder Singh, told the TOI over phone from Kabul, “We couldn’t celebrate Dussehra and our Diwali is incomplete without our children. We are in touch with senior leaders of the community so that they can help us return to India.” His daughter Manpreet said on this Diwali, she has only one request that the government bring back her parents from Afghanistan. Another family is that of Kailash Kaur, an elderly woman whose son and daughter-in-law are stuck there and grandchildren are in Ludhiana. “My family members have neither money nor work. They are living inside a gurdwara. We want them to get visas so that they can return,” said Kailash. She said she had returned from Kabul two months ago after the Taliban took over.14 stuck there Fourteen members of various families of Ludhiana are stuck in Kabul. They are Afghan nationals, but they have kin here and want to return to India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/kin-stuck-in-kabul-their-diwali-will-lack-sparkle/articleshow/87469363.cms||Shariq Majeed

They are being trained in painting walls and several unskilled work so that they can become suitable for blue-collar jobs. The three-month rehabilitation programme was launched on Monday. The trainees will get Rs 100 as a daily stipend. The government will also help them find jobs. Out of the 20,719 beggars identified in a recent survey, 53% (10,987) were males, 46% (9,541) females and 1% (191) transgenders across 11 districts. The highest number of beggars were in east Delhi (2,797). Half of those surveyed were new entrants. Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said the purpose of the training programme was to provide skill training to beggars so that they could find economic opportunities in mainstream society. He launched the pilot project on livelihood support for beggars at two centres in Central district. Times ViewThe effort to turn beggars into productive members of society is welcome. The government needs to invest long-term in the scheme, which requires behavioural change from the participants. Skill upgradation should be followed by employment opportunities failing which the beggars could lapse into begging.Ashray Grih Katra Maula Bux, Roshanara Road and Ashray Griha (DUSIB night shelter), Khairia Mohalla, Roshanara Road were identified as the two centres for the rehabilitation of male and female beggars, respectively. “People are forced into begging because of their social and economic circumstances. They are the most vulnerable section of society. Keeping this in mind, we conducted a pilot survey to identify such people and formulated a plan through which they could be rehabilitated,” said Gautam. The department of social welfare in collaboration with Institute for Human Development conducted the survey to identify beggars between February and April. The exercise was commissioned by Delhi government as part of the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment’s pilot in 10 cities to develop a rehabilitation plan for beggars and eradication of beggary. The first step would now be followed by mobilisation and rehabilitation, including shelter, hygiene, health, skilling and linkages with employment avenues. The government has selected two organisations to impart livelihood-based skill training programmes at the centres. The experience gained from this exercise would be replicated in all districts in collaboration with various stakeholders, including Union ministry of social justice and employment, Union home ministry, Delhi Police, health department, WCD, DUSIB, DCW, among others. The rehabilitation plan would focus on different groups of beggars based on their needs and condition. This includes women, children, disabled and vulnerable categories, like drug addicts. For women beggars, self help groups and schemes would be formed. Disabled beggars would be referred to institutional and non-institutional care facilities. A multi-pronged strategy is being planned to rescue 4,871 child beggars by Childline, refer them to child welfare committees of states and link them to open shelters and welfare schemes for rehabilitation and repatriation. District magistrates and DCPs would be involved to mobilise those on the ground to identify drug addicts and refer them to deaddiction facilities. The prohibition department of the women and child development department would facilitate setting up of drop-in centres and community intervention programmes. After deaddiction, such people would be engaged in livelihood training programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mission-to-keep-beggars-off-the-street/articleshow/87474530.cms||AlokKNMishra

PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a review meeting with these six districts to discuss why their coverage was below the national average (78%). The Centre said that 48 districts in the country have not vaccinated even 50% of their adult population. From Maharashtra were Aurangabad (46.5%), Nandurbar (46.9%), Buldhana (47.6%), Hingoli (47.8%), Nanded (48.4%) and Akola (49.3%). The state on Monday held a preparatory meeting to discuss what their responses would be when Modi interacts with local officials on Wednesday. According to the state figures, Nandurbar has the lowest first dose coverage in Mahara-shtra, but even that’s 51%. Next are Akola and Beed with 53.2% and 53.4% coverage, respectiv-ely. CoWin figures showed that Aurangabad’s coverage was 55%, Buldhana 54.2%, Hingoli 55.1% and Nanded 57.2%. Maharashtra has given at least one dose to 73% of its population, although 20 districts are below the state average. “We are not clear what data has the Centre referred to. We don’t have a single district with less than 50% coverage. However, the coverage for specific categories, such as 18-44 or 45-plus, for some districts is below 50%,” said Dr Sachin Desai, state immunisation officer. He added that even before the Centre’s rap, all districts were asked to improve their pace. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), had on Sunday said that the state had more than 90 lakh doses. Individual districts are now sitting on stocks for more than 15 days. District officials are not happy about being labelled poor performers when the form-ula for vaccine distribution was uneven in the initial few months. Authorities from Aurangabad, which the Centre found at the bottom of the list in Maharashtra, said for months together a lion’s share of vaccines was given to the corporation though the rural areas have more population. “Aurangabad corporation has a population of 18 lakh, while 30 lakh people stay in rural areas. Yet, 50% of the doses were allocated to the corporation. We were short of doses when people were eager to get vaccinated. Now, when that eagerness has disappeared, we are receiving doses in lakhs,” said Dr Sudhakar Shelke, district health officer. The district is also encountering vaccine hesitancy from select pockets. State officials said the vaccine supply has been streamlined since the past two months and the coverage should have accelerated. An official from Hingoli said they have prepared micro pl-ans to pursue villages and talukas where coverage is slow. “If the PM asks for a road map, we have it ready,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-contests-centre-data-says-no-dist-with-lt50-vax-coverage/articleshow/87473823.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Police are now verifying CCTV camera footage near the crime scene to zero in on the offenders. The incident happened at Ramalayam in Ram Nagar colony of Hydernagar in the KPHB police station limits. Temple workers, who arrived in the morning, realised about the burglary and alerted police. The offenders entered the temple premises by scaling the boundary wall of an independent house adjacent to the temple. “The accused broke the lock on the side door grill and entered the temple. They broke open three hundis and stole another hundi from the temple,” KPHB police said.

With the fresh arrests, the total number of people held has gone up to 17 even as the main accused Bhanji Suthar continues to evade police. Police said the 10 accused were nabbed following intensive combing operations and information received through human and technical sources. The arrested attackers have been identified as Keshra Rabari, Arjan Rabari, Dinesh Jairam Maraj, Rajesh Maraj, Dinesh Ramji Maraj, Vela Ahir, Sava Koli, Chouda Koli, Navghan Koli and Momaya Koli. Earlier, seven people were arrested. Cops said that all these accused are residents of Mewadanagar locality of Ner village and were involved in the attack on the family of Jaga Vaghela. In his complaint, Vaghela has alleged that Suthar had held a meeting wherein it was decided to attack the family.  According to the complaint, the upper caste members, in this meeting, decided to deliberately let loose their buffaloes in his farm and damage the crops. When Vaghela and his kin rushed to the farm, they were attacked. It is alleged that the attack was planned as Vaghela and his family members attended an installation ceremony of a temple in the village despite being asked to not come. Police, however, have taken this allegation with a pinch of salt saying that the incident was a fallout of the political rivalry between Vaghela and Suthar as the former had been overwhelmingly voted as the sarpanch by the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/10-more-held-for-attack-on-dalit-family-in-kutch/articleshow/87472068.cms||---

The two victims were not known to the accused, who was drunk and killed both with a boulder, police said. Cops cracked the case after verifying CCTV footage and picked the accused from Habeeb Nagar. Nampally police said that around 11.30pm on Sunday, the accused, Khadeer, came across his first victim sleeping near a religious place in Nampally, picked a boulder and smashed it on him.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav’s Jinnah remark gives ammo to BJP||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav came under heavy fire of the BJP brass on Monday, a day after he invoked Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah claiming that he studied with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in the same institution to become barrister and fought for India’s freedom. CM Yogi Adityanath termed Akhilesh’s statement as his “shameful” display of “Talibani” and “divisive” mindset. Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya lashed out at the SP chief calling him “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah” and his party as “Namazwadi Party”. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said Yadav must have “burnt crackers” after watching the recent T-20 India-Pakistan cricket match. Singh’s reference to the said cricket match came days after sedition charges were slapped on three Kashmiri students in Agra for celebrating Pakistan’s victory against India. On Sunday, Yogi had said maintained that his government would “not tolerate” people who stand in support of the “enemy country” and praise it. BJP’s move to unleash caustic barbs at Akhilesh for his statement vis-a-vis Jinnah was seen as a precursor to a potential showdown between the two key political rivals in the run-up to UP assembly elections due in the next few months. BJP sources said that the party was in no mood to relent and was charged up to corner SP for pursuing minority appeasement for the sake of vote bank politics. Akhilesh had also left the BJP brass hot under the collar for saying that Patel had banned “an ideology”. “The same people who are speaking of national unity are trying to divide people on caste and religious lines,” Akhilesh had said on Sunday. Experts said Akhilesh was referring to a communique issued by Patel to ban the RSS, the ideological mentor of the present day BJP, in 1948 after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. This is not the first time that Jinnah has attained the centre-stage of political discourse in UP. Days before the by elections for the Kairana and Noorpur in May 2018, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of the RSS and Hindu Yuva Vahini had clashed with police demanding removal of Jinnah’s portrait from the campus of Aligarh Muslim University. This was after BJP MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam wrote to AMU vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor and sought a justification for Jinnah’s portrait, which has been hanging at the university since 1938. In 2010s, BJP stalwarts LK Advani and Jaswant Singh had triggered controversy by heaping praise on Jinnah.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: 12 lakh students reach schools on Day 1||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Over 12 lakh students reached schools on the first day, when the schools in the state were partially reopened after a 19-month gap caused by the pandemic. The attendance, considering the staggered reopening, was around 80% of the total strength. As per the ‘back to school’ guidelines prepared by the education department in consultation with health experts, children were welcomed at the entrance by their teachers and ushered to their respective classrooms. Surprisingly, the routine scene of kids crying out for parents was missing. “We are no strangers. We know each other through online classes. So, there is no question of being scared today as it used to be in the normal days in the past,” said Bindhu, a primary school teacher of Cottonhill school Thiruvananthapuram. As many as 131 schools could not reopen on Monday owing to various reasons. While some schools function as relief camps, many are inundated, and several others are in containment zones. A few schools remained shut due to local hartals. As many as 12,08,290 students reached schools across the state on the opening day. Of these, 11,130 are Class I students. The government has directed schools with more than 1,000 students to conduct classes by allowing only 25% of the students to turn up on any given day. “Considering the restrictions in force, only half of the students were supposed to attend school on the first day. There is overwhelming response from parents and students,” director of generation education Jeevan Babu said. General education minister V Sivankutty inaugurated the state-level School Pravesanothsavam at the Cottonhill school. The minister said there was no need to feel scared about sending children to school as the government has put in place a robust mechanism to ensure that schools function by strictly adhering to Covid-19 protocol. “The government has received support from all sections in the society for the school reopening. More than six lakh students have newly joined government and aided schools this year. The government has taken all steps to face all challenges,” the minister said. As clarified earlier, attendance is not must during this phase of school reopening. Students have been split into different batches so that the number of students occupying a bench could be limited to maximum two. Those who don’t wish to attend the school now have the option to continue their studies using the online system in place. Classes started on Monday for Class I to VII, X and XII. Classes for the rest of the standards would begin on November 15. Close to 43 lakh students are supposed to reach schools in two phases. Of them, 6,07,702 are newcomers. According to sources, there was an increase of close to 30,000 students who took admission to first standard in government and aided schools this year, compared to last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/12l-students-reach-schools-on-reopening-day/articleshow/87473837.cms||---

The villa is in the possession of a Tollywood hero’s family. Interestingly, police have recovered a card swiping machine during the raid on the villa on Sunday night. According to the FIR, apart from Rs 6.77 lakh cash, playing cards and casino coin box, investigators found a card swiping machine during the seizure done at the villa during the raid. Three cars, including two high-end vehicles, were also seized. Police were collecting details about the lease agreement between the actor’s father and G Suman Kumar, the prime accused in organising gambling at the villa. Police were also in the process to recover details about the number of transactions, including online payments, done by the organisers and gamblers. Perhaps, this is the first time a swiping machine was recovered from a gambling organiser in the city. All the accused were booked under the TS Gaming Act. It was only after the payment was made, either online or cash, Suman would allow the participants to play by issuing tokens, depending on the money placed as bet. Among the 30 accused, included Sriram Bhadraiah from Mahabubabad district, who was an MLA between 1999 and 2004. Police said that Suman Kumar had taken the villa on one day lease from the actor’s father, who in turn took the property on rent from a bureaucrat. “The accused were indulging in 3-card gambling on four different tables (a table on the second floor bedroom and three on the third floor bedroom) at the building. Suman had organised the betting and invited 29 other members,” the FIR said. Police would seek the custody of Suman in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gambling-racket-ex-mla-among-30-sent-to-prison/articleshow/87473819.cms||---

The high court made it clear that taking assistance was different from obtaining prior approval. The interim order by a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice A Rajasheker Reddy came after two PILs, one by law student Sri Dhruti Chitrapu and another by RTI activist Ganji Srinivas Rao, challenged the chief secretary’s office note on the grounds that it was an attempt by government to impose new curbs on people’s right to know. They also pointed out that it was beyond the purview of the CS of a state. When advocate general BS Prasad said that the chief secretary’s note was meant to ensure effective implementation of the law in furtherance of Section 5(4) of the RTI Act which asks PIOs to take assistance of relevant officials before furnishing information, the high court bench said: “Nobody is stopping them from seeking assistance. Law says assistance. But the CS note says prior consent. The Act does not support this interpretation of the law.” As the advocate general insisted that in certain cases PIOs had furnished incomplete information leading to problems, the bench shot back, “If there is a provision in the law that says that PIOs can seek assistance from officers, then inform them through a letter. Why did you issue this GO asking them to take prior approval?” The bench, while staying the chief secretary’s order, sought counters from the state within two weeks. The case has been posted for further hearing to December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cs-order-hurdle-on-rti-info-release-stayed-by-hc/articleshow/87473925.cms||---

A portion of the stolen money was recovered by police who have also booked two family members of the 13-year-old for receiving stolen cash. On the morning of October 28, a 35-year-old mechanic and used car seller from Zehranagar realised that Rs 5 lakh cash that he had kept in the almirah, had gone missing. After enquiring with all his family members, he confronted his son, a class 7 student at a local school, about the missing cash. “The boy told his father that his classmate had forcibly taken away his books at school and threatened him that he will only return the books if he gets money from his house. The boy’s father also alleged that the juvenile offender also threatened to beat his son and harm him if he did not get the money,” Banjara Hills deputy inspector, Md Hafeezuddin, said. Based on the complaint of the boy’s father, an extortion case was registered against the juvenile offender. Police said that when the boy was examined in the presence of the family and child welfare department officials, it was revealed that he gave the money to his maternal uncle who stays at Zehranagar and his mother at Bazarghat. “We are in the process of recovering the money. As the maximum punishment for the offence is below seven years, the boy has been produced before the child protection officer and handed over to the family. The two family members who received the money will be booked under section 411 of the IPC after the recovery,” the DI said.

With this, those who have received both doses of Covaxin can travel to Australia seven days after taking second dose without having to undergo quarantine. Granting recognition on Monday, Australian health regulator, Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said on its website: “Today, the TGA determined that Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech)…would be ‘recognised’ for the purpose of establishing a traveller’s vaccination status. This recognition is for travellers aged 12 and over who have been vaccinated with Covaxin.” Pointing out that the supporting information has been provided to TGA from the vaccine sponsor and WHO, TGA said: “Importantly, recognition of Covaxin...along with the previously announced recognition of...Covishield (manufactured by AstraZeneca, India), means many citizens of...India as well as other countries in our region, where these vaccines have been widely deployed, will now be considered fully vaccinated on entry to Australia.” “This will have significant impacts for the return of international students, and travel of skilled and unskilled workers to Australia,” TGA added. Hours after Australian ambassador to India, Barry O Farrell AO, tweeted about the recognition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his tweet on Monday evening, said: “I thank my dear friend @ScottMorrisonMP for Australia’s recognition of India’s Covaxin. It is an important step forward in the post-Covid partnership between India and Australia.” Sources at Bharat Biotech told TOI that the company had been submitting rolling data to TGA over the past couple of months, and this has culminated in the recognition. “Similarly, the company has been submitting data to regulators of many other countries to facilitate recognition of the vaccine to ease travel barriers for those who have taken Covaxin,” the source added. Australia’s recognition to Covaxin comes soon after the United States Centres for Disease Control (CDC) eased travel restrictions for Covaxin-vaccinated travellers last week by allowing trial participants to enter without having to quarantine. Oman too recognised the whole virion inactivated virus vaccine for travel purposes. So far, over 20 countries have either approved or recognised Covaxin, including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, Iran, Nepal, Estonia, Mexico, Philippines, Greece, Paraguay, among others.

According to official data, the town generates 1,800 metric tonnes of waste every month. This includes — 700 metric tonnes of wet waste, 500 metric tonnes of dry waste, and 600 metric tonnes of mixed waste. Experts say that the huge amount of mixed waste generated in the town highlights that sanitation officials are unable to ensure segregation of dry and wet waste. “Mixed waste leads to legacy (years-old) waste. To recycle dry waste properly, it must be segregated from wet waste at the source itself. Without segregation, waste gets contaminated,” Anoop Nautiyal, founder, Dehradun-based Social Development for Communities Foundation, told TOI. Rishikesh residents complain that sanitation workers who come for door-to-door garbage collection do not segregate waste. Aruna, a 25-year-old resident of Pragati Vihar, told TOI, “Firstly, the door-to-door garbage collection service is irregular. To add to that, sanitation workers empty the trash barrel in their vehicles in one go and do take the effort to segregate the waste. Besides, several residents are also not aware of the importance of waste segregation.” Another huge issue plaguing the town’s waste management system is that of bio-medical waste disposal. According to civic officials, no separate segregation or treatment method is followed with regards to bio-medical waste. At present, bio-medical waste is treated like dry waste in the town. This is a clear violation of the order issued by the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change which mandates the treatment of bio-medical waste before it is mixed with other wastes. Lastly, littering and garbage dumping in public spaces do not only hamper waste treatment efforts but also make the street dirty. However, all is not wrong with the town’s waste management system. Recently, manure prepared from 130 metric tonnes of treated dry waste was used in all the public parks of the town. Earlier this year, a legacy waste treatment plant was installed at the Govindnagar trenching ground. Also, the number of compost pits has increased in Rishikesh in the last few years. Meanwhile, on the issue of littering, sanitation inspector, Santosh Gusain, sanitary inspector, Rishikesh, said that those found dumping garbage on the roadside will be penalised. Despite several attempts, Rishikesh MLA Premchand Agarwal could not be reached.

Our elders rejected the two-nation theory and chose India as their country. If Akhilesh Yadav thinks that by making such statements he will be able to keep a section of the people in good humour, then I think he is wrong. He should change his advisers. He should read more (history),” Owaisi said on Monday. Owaisi’s comments came on Akhilesh’s statement in Hardoi on Sunday where he talked about Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lal Nehru and Jinnah in the same breath saying that they studied in the same institution and became barristers and got us freedom. BJP has already gone all guns blazing after the SP chief’s comment. All set to contest the 2022 assembly polls in UP, Owaisi has been addressing public meetings in different parts of the state for over a month now and had visited UP more than half a dozen times since September. Owaisi had joined OP Rajbhar’s Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, which has been apparently abandoned for all practical purposes ever since Rajbhar entered into an alliance with the SP. Owaisi not only took on Akhilesh for his Jinnah comment, but also attacked Rashtirya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary for his statement in which he talked about Asaduddin as a film star. “RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary should know that I don’t think very highly of the film stars. I would like to tell him that Owaisi will do what Chaudhary Charan Singh did for the jat community in UP. He turned jats into a politically significant force. Similarly, I will continue to work towards making the Muslims of UP and India as a whole a politically important section,” Owaisi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/owaisi-slams-akhilesh-for-jinnah-comment/articleshow/87474548.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The Bombay high court has directed the builder to give them “actual physical possession on Dhanteras, 2nd November 2021, by 1pm”. “It is a Diwali gift for us,” Ashwin Shah, secretary of the Santacruz West End CHSL, told TOI. The order by Justice Gautam Patel came on a contempt petition filed by the society against K Mordani Builders over the delay. The original five-floor building with 10 flats was given to the builder in December 2012. Mordani included the plot in a much larger slum rehabilitation project in Andheri and thus the building’s completion was held up. The society moved the high court in 2018. Some of SRA’s requisitions for handing over flats ‘absurd’: Bombay HCNine families of a Santacruz building will move into their redeveloped homes on Tuesday following a Bombay high court order. The reconstructed building is ground with a three-floor podium plus 13 storeys. It has a rehabilitation component for members till 5 floors and for sale beyond it. On August 27, consent terms were filed for part-occupation certificate till the 5 floors for 9 members, subject to compliances by the builder. One member exchanged her flat for a duplex. On October 27, society advocates Karl Tamboly and Tushar Goradia informed Justice Patel part-OC was not received. Instead, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) gave the builder a list of requisitions and demands. Justice Patel was miffed that 2 months later, members are without homes. “The SRA and the builder can carry on like this for as long as they wish but I see no reason why the members of the society seeking to get the rehab component should be caught in the cross-fire or adversely affected by this never -ending struggle between the builder and SRA,” he said in his order. Justice Patel slammed SRA, saying it does not seem to appreciate that it is a public body and its officers are public servants “meant to serve the interest of the citizens of the city, particularly the poorest”. He also said it seems “extremely peculiar” that SRA constantly complains that it suddenly discovered irregularities when it is a special planning authority and bound to monitor construction. Justice Patel termed some of SRA’s 12 requisitions as “absurd.” It required two completion certificates to be laminated. “Surely an OC and a citizen’s home cannot be held up because of lamination,’’ he said. One said the structural engineer’s licence expired on March 31. “But what of it? Licences expire and are renewed routinely,” he said. He directed SRA to issue part-OC by 5pm. Also, that “members be given actual physical possession of their respective units on Dhanteras.” SRA’s advocate Anoop Patil said part-OC will be subject to reasonable compliances. Mordani’s advocate Ankit Lohia said compliances will be completed by November 30. Justice Patel said if the developer does not comply, his right over the sale component may be curtailed and SRA will be at liberty to take such action “without affecting rehab component.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/some-of-sras-requisitions-for-handing-over-flats-absurd-bombay-hc/articleshow/87473839.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Tax collection grew 25% year-on-year against Rs 6,797 crore in October 2020. Gujarat had the second highest GST collection, lagging Maharashtra where the tax mop-up was Rs 16,355 crore in October. “There is an upswing in the demand due to the festive season and in the run up to Diwali due to which sales have improved across sectors. At the same time, the turnover of sales has also gone up due to rise in prices of certain commodities. As a consequence, the tax collection numbers have gone up,” said JP Gupta, principal secretary, state finance department.  According to Union finance ministry, the revenues would have still been higher if the sales of cars and other products had not been affected because of disruption in supply of semi-conductors. Even month on month, GST collection rose 9.2% against September’s Rs 7,780 crore in Gujarat. state GST (SGST) collection has also grown 40% in Gujarat during October. According to state government data, SGST collection stood at Rs 3,821 crore in October this year against Rs 2,731 crore of collection in the same month last year. “The number of e-way bills generated have also gone up 21%. This is also an indicator of improved demand and production,” said Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gst-collection-at-an-all-time-high/articleshow/87472939.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Delhi: Man shot outside Mahipalpur hotel by his business partners||NEW DELHI: A 52-year-old man was shot dead late Sunday night allegedly by his business partners to whom he had leased out one of his hotels in southwest Delhi’s Mahipalpur area. Police are trying to nab the suspect, senior officers said. According to the police, the deceased has been identified as Krishan Pal Sehrawat, a resident of Gurugram. A call was received in Vasant Kunj North police station from a man reporting that some men had shot dead his brother in Mahipalpur. “A police team that reached the spot found that the injured had been taken to Spinal Injury Centre where he was declared brought dead. His family was informed and the body was sent for a postmortem examination. A crime and forensics team was also called to the spot for a detailed inspection and a case of murder was registered,” said Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (South-West). During investigation, police found that Sehrawat had leased out his hotel Dolphin International, in Mahipalpur, to one Roshan Mishra about 10 months ago. “Preliminary probe revealed that the deceased was having some dispute with Mishra on the issues of pending electricity bills and non-payment of the lease amount. So far, Mishra and his associates are the prime suspects behind Sehrawat’s killing. Efforts are on to trace the accused. We have possible leads and they will all be soon arrested,” the officer said. Investigations so far have revealed that the victim was sitting and drinking with the main accused, Mishra, and his associates who had come to stay at the hotel around a month back. While three men can be seen in the CCTV footage, cops suspect the fourth would be in the car. According to information available till now, it seems that the victim was first asked by Mishra’s associates as to the reason for differences between them. Both the parties then were sitting together and the victim later could be seen in the footage accompanying the accused and dropping them outside when he was shot dead. The trio then sat in a car and fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-shot-outside-mahipalpur-hotel-by-his-biz-partners/articleshow/87474554.cms||---

Joined by members of the Haryana Waqf Board, they also sought removal of encroachments from mosques and Waqf properties to make space for the prayer congregations for the sake of peace and harmony. The memorandum was sent through the Gurugram deputy commissioner. The city currently has 37 designated namaz sites that were earmarked after protests erupted in 2018 over Friday prayers in open spaces. The past few weeks have seen similar protests, with two memorandums being submitted by various local outfits seeking a ban. One of the organisations, Sanyukt Hindu Sangarsh Samiti, had declared on Sunday it would perform Govardhan Puja at the designated Sector 12 namaz site next Friday. Haryana Waqf Board member Khurshid Rajaka, who is also chairman of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said prayers cannot be conducted regularly under police protection. “Prayers that are held against the wishes of the people are not in tune with Islam and national unity,” he said. Rajaka added that the issue was being used “to pitch one community against the other”. He said the Muslim community is “not adamant” and its members are “ready to accommodate and change for peace and harmony”. The Waqf Board has 19 land parcels in Gurugram, out of which six are vacant and the rest encroached. Rajaka said they have submitted the list of the sites to the administration, requesting it to free the land so they can be used for namaz. “We have requested mosques to conduct multiple rounds of prayers on Friday to accommodate as many people as possible,” he added. Some private individuals have also volunteered their land for namaz, Rajaka said. In the memorandum, the community has also demanded land in new sectors for construction of mosques, he added. Shahzad Khan of Muslim Ekta Manch said the issue has led to tension being created in the city every now and then. “We want to stop this tension forever, even if it means giving up some of the (namaz) sites,” said Khan. He added that the community is ready to offer namaz only at places identified by the authorities in consultation with all stakeholders. Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said a high-powered committee comprising officials from the administration, police and members of both the communities has been formed to resolve the issue. “It will discuss at length the sites, objections from the groups and possible solutions. Our priority is to maintain law and order and ensure peace and harmony,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/want-harmony-ready-to-curtail-namaz-in-open-areas-say-citys-muslim-groups/articleshow/87474546.cms||Bagish Jha

A total 2.1 lakh daily tickets were sold, with 83,000 on WR and 1.28 lakh on CR. It was still short of over 3-lakh sale of daily tickets to essential workers on an average on Sundays in October. The sale of tickets was stopped on October 27. The state government on Sunday directed CR and WR officials to resume issuing of daily journey tickets from booking counters on suburban networks to essential and non-essential travellers. Tickets are being issued to double vaccinated passengers who have completed 14 days since the last dose. On Monday, CR tweeted, “Any person having a medical condition that does not allow him or her to take the vaccine, and has a certificate from a recognised doctor can also avail of daily tickets from counters.” If a person is younger than 18 (for which vaccines are still not available) and when school or college starts, the student can also buy tickets from booking offices showing his ID card, sources said. Data on sale of daily tickets on a Sunday before Diwali during pre-Covid time (2019) was unavailable. A primary reason for resuming daily tickets was increase in cases of ticketless travel, which led to ‘increased risk’ of more Covid-19 cases in trains, an official said. Between April and October, WR detected 2.78 lakh cases of ticketless travel, with a recovery of Rs 13 crore. “On October 30 itself, fines of Rs 40 lakh were recovered for ticketless travel,” said WR chief spokesperson Sumit Thakur. On CR, April to October statistics show 4.3 lakh cases booked and Rs 16 crore fines recovered, said chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-ticket-sales-for-local-trains-cross-2l-on-day-1/articleshow/87473844.cms||Somit Sen

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Nine lesser florican chicks hatched in Velavadar National Park||RAJKOT: In a big boost to the conservation of the endangered lesser florican, the forest department has successfully hatched nine chicks in the last one year by artificially incubating the salvaged eggs in Velavadar National Park. The national park is a sprawling grassland and an ideal habitat for lesser florican, a bustard family bird, which lays eggs here during monsoon, particularly August. This increases the chances of eggs getting destroyed due to water ingress or eaten by some animals. Officials said three eggs were hatched last year and six this season and all chicks are healthy. The population of lesser florican in the country is 300-500 of which only 100 are in Gujarat. The forest department collected some eggs and artificially incubated them. A senior officer said, “We gathered all information about artificial incubation, the ideal temperature required and days taken for hatching. While nine chicks have been born in a year, another six eggs were saved this monsoon. All birds in an open enclosure inside the national park.: The chicks will be kept in captivity till they mature and they will be artificially fed. “These chicks take three to four years to become sexually mature. We will study their genes and if we find male and female partners for them, we will try breeding them naturally in their enclosure. If this is not possible, we will use assisted reproductive technology and try to produce chicks in the laboratory,” said the official. The forest department took the cue from houbara bustard conservation in the UAE to replicate a similar programme for lesser floricans in Gujarat. DT Vasavada, chief conservator of forest (wildlife) said, “We are now planning a special centre at Velavadar for conservation of lesser florican to hatch salvaged eggs artificially. We will release the second or third generation into the wild.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nine-lesser-florican-chicks-hatched/articleshow/87472128.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The deceased’s family said that she went outside the house to relieve herself when she fell into an open water tank at a nearby toilet. Police have registered a case in this regard and arrested the landlord of the house where the incident took place. According to police, the minor girl was residing with her family in rented accommodation at the house of one Sunil Yadav in Kapashera. “On Saturday, the girl went outside to play and went missing.

The girl’s father, in a police complaint, said that around 2.30 pm, his daughter went outside to relieve herself but she did not return. The parents thought that she went to play. “When she did not return even after a long time, we started searching for her. We searched till 4 pm and then returned home. Later, we again went to search for her and this time, we went near the bathroom that is situated in the balcony of the house,” the complainant said. “I saw my daughter’s slippers floating on water inside the nearby tank. The tank always remains uncovered and was full of water with a depth of 11 feet. We started removing the water with the help of a bucket,” he said.

---||Rajkot||5 striped hyena cubs born at Sakkarbaug zoo||Rajkot: The Sakkarbaug Zoo in Junagad for the first time witnessed the birth of striped hyenas. Two female striped hyenas gave birth to five cubs at the zoo on Monday. The captive breeding of the striped hyena is very rare because of its behaviour — it is shy and not a very social animal. According to sources, this animal is categorized as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as the global population of the animal is only around 10,000. With captive breeding of the striped hyenas having quite low success rate, there is a global concern for the conservation of the animal. Veterinary doctors said that not much information is available about the captive breeding of the striped hyenas. Zoo officials said that they will keenly observe how the mothers raise the cubs. If possible they will also try to rehabilitate the hyenas in the wild. With the arrival of the five cubs, the striped hyena’s number at the Sakkarbaug Zoo has gone up to nine now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/5-striped-hyena-cubs-born-at-sakkarbaug-zoo/articleshow/87472149.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Coimbatore||Governor urges agri graduates to tackle climate change||Coimbatore: Agriculture students and researchers should prepare for the devastating consequences of climate change like changing monsoon pattern, rising sea level, deadly heatwaves, intense storms and flash floods, Tamil Nadu governor R N Ravi said here on Monday.All these pose a serious threat to the agriculture sector, Ravi told students of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) during the 42nd annual convocation ceremony. “Although India is foodgrain surplus, the corresponding benefit of it has not reached our farmers, majority of whom are subsistence and small. A paradoxical situation where the gross food production is surplus and yet the bulk of food producers are poor has arisen due to decades of distorted agriculture policies, which though benefited a small number of big farmers, did not help the overwhelming majority,” he said.“I am informed that the incremental income due to adoption of TNAU crop varieties, management technologies and farm machinery by the farming community of Tamil Nadu is worth Rs 10,433 crore per annum,” Ravi said.Secretary of the department of agricultural research and education Trilochan Mohapatra stressed on the need to popularise micro-irrigation. “Only 40-45% of the agricultural area in Tamil Nadu is rainfed. It is important to harvest rainwater, store it and effectively use it through micro-irrigation. TNAU has put in a lot of effort to develop micro-irrigation technologies. The institution should expand it further to include more crops and cultivation systems, and increase the state’s coverage under micro-irrigation from just four lakh hectares,” he said.“Thanks to government initiatives, farm incomes have grown. We have so far documented 75,000 farmers, whose income increased manifold. Faculties of the institutions should document such cases with the help of students and encourage other farmers to take up the lead by sharing stories,” the official added.Vice-chancellor N Kumar and registrar A S Krishnamoorthy attended the event.TNAU has so far produced 30,230 undergraduates, 11,397 postgraduates and 3,504 doctoral graduates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/governor-urges-agri-graduates-to-tackle-climate-change/articleshow/87473854.cms||---

He worked as a mason and was staying alone in a rented house at Kangeyampalayam, police said.Varadharaj used to get into verbal spats with his neighbour C Anandan, 33, a wall painter, a police officer said. “Anandan, a bachelor, was also staying alone. Two days ago, Anandan borrowed a stove from Varadharaj but did not return it. Varadharaj pestered him with demands to return it and the duo fought over the issue. Following the spat, Varadharaj told Anandan that he was no longer welcome in his house. On Sunday evening, a drunk Varadharaj picked up a quarrel with Anandan. In a fit of rage, Anandan stabbed Varadharaj to death with a chisel and escaped from the place,” the officer said.Sulur police inspector R Mathaiyan inspected the crime scene and sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem.

---||Goa||Goa joins hands with Achrekar Academy to polish cricket talent||Panaji: The state government has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Achrekar Cricket Academy to identify 50 young players who will then be trained to follow in the footsteps of some of India’s biggest names. Sachin Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli, Ajit Agarkar, Ramesh Powar and Pravin Amre are some of the gems that Ramakant Achrekar, founder of the academy, polished to turn them into great cricketers. Achrekar passed away in 2019, but his star pupils are now carrying forward his legacy through the academy. “I have been involved in Shivaji Park academies where products like Shreyas Iyer and Shardul Thakur have emerged, so we know the depth of the formula which if implemented here, can work,” said former India cricketer Pravin Amre, now technical consultant for the Achrekar Cricket Academy. “This is going to be a process. It took around 12 years to build them (Shreyas and Shardul). We will need a long-term programme.” The state government, through the directorate of sports and youth affairs (DSYA), has entered into a 15-year partnership. No details have been provided, but sources said the focus is first on identifying 50 cricketers and then providing them with “scientific training.” “Goan children will now get the chance to play national level cricket. Anyone who has interest to join the academy can take admission free of cost. An international standard ground will come up and proper maintenance will be done,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday. The ground will come up at Navelim in Sakhali, the chief minister’s home constituency. Sources said Amre – who captained Goa in the Ranji Trophy in 2000-01 season – has asked for nine pitches on the ground and dressing rooms on a priority basis. “I have played Ranji cricket for Goa, so I know the roots here. Atul Shirodkar is a very passionate person. It was his dream that underprivileged children should get the facilities. That’s the whole idea. We want the infrastructure; cricket needs proper wickets and our goal will be to provide that,” said Amre. The chief minister said Amre will head the academy in Goa. “This is a long-term project,” said Sawant. “The academy will surely flourish in years to come. We have no fixed number of trainees. They will go on adding, whenever needed. Atul has taken the initiative. I thank them.” The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) was not consulted before signing the agreement, Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-joins-hands-with-achrekar-academy-to-polish-cricket-talent/articleshow/87495684.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Schools find it hard to maintain social distancing||Coimbatore: Panchayat union primary school (PUPS) in Kuniyamuthur has 1,065 students in Class I–V. As the school has only seven classrooms accommodating over 200 children in each class, it is difficult to maintain social distancing among students in the class. This has been the case of many primary schools in the district that are facing space crunch after the reopening of schools for all classes. “We asked only half of the students of Class III and V to come to school on Monday as we don’t want classes to be crowded. In this way, we can have students only once in a week,” a teacher from PUPS Kuniamuthur said. However, many private schools chose to invite all the students and conduct school for half a day. They say that all the students need to come to class on daily basis after reopening as alternate day classes may not work.“It may not be possible to take online classes for half of the class and offline class for another section of students of the same class as it will require two teachers a class. Therefore, we chose to have all the students in the school,” a teacher from a private school at Singanallur said. “We could manage on Monday as less children had turned up on the first day of reopening. But we will have to make alternate arrangements when more students would turn up in the coming days. Continuity will be affected in the alternate day classes which may not serve the purpose of offline classes,” the teacher said.Speaking to TOI, district chief education officer N Geetha said schools have been asked to try if they can take classes in two shifts a day. A few students may be asked to come in the morning and another few in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-find-it-hard-to-maintain-social-distancing/articleshow/87473875.cms||---

With AIR 23, she is all set to join an elite medical institution. Alwar resident Leena will be the first doctor in her family. She secured 710 out of 720 marks in the exam. She said she believed in her capabilities and prepared for NEET from NCERT syllabus. “Preparations done with similar type of study materials, notes, modules and NCERT syllabus is enough. I believe that if we prepare with the one type of study materials constantly, then we can score better. If you use different study materials or books, you tend to get confused,” said Leena. The last two years have been challenging for everyone because of the pandemic. Coming to online classes after offline classes caused some problems in the beginning for Leena but she soon adjusted to the system. Leena was a classroom student from Allen Career Institute for the last two years. Uttar Pradesh resident Aman Tripathi, who secured AIR 4, was studying in Kota for the last three years. A classroom student of Allen Career Institute Kota, Aman said hard work has no substitute and consistency is the key. “Constant support is all that an aspirant needs for exam preparation. I believe in consistency and made a proper study plan before starting my preparation. I kept myself away from distractions — social media, relatives, friends. It’s self-study that helped me get a grip on the subjects,” said Aman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/neet-results-leena-is-only-student-from-state-in-top-25/articleshow/87473877.cms||---

All four are co-accused with Union MoS for home Ajay Mishra Teni's son Ashish for allegedly mowing down four farmers and a journalist with their vehicle on October 3. A farmer, on the other hand, who is a suspect in the second FIR for "lynching" three BJP workers approached the high court for relief, but was directed to go to the lower court for anticipatory bail. The SIT has applied for a non-bailable warrant against him as he is absconding since his picture was released a week ago. So far, 81 witnesses have recorded their statement in the court and have been provided security cover as per the directions of the Apex court. A member of the SIT told TOI, “We have collected evidence against a suspect and his picture was released. Now, we came to know that he had approached the Lucknow Bench of the High Court, but didn’t get any relief. We are seeking permission to arrest him and his details will be shared after he is held for further probe.” Meanwhile, special prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “The bail applications of Sumit Jaiswal, Nandan Singh Bisht, Shishupal and Satya Narayan Tripathi have been rejected by honourable CJM Chinta Ram.

---||Nagpur||Musical mornings back this Diwali but signature events missing||Nagpur: With life returning back to normal, the musical events ‘Padava Pahat’ and ‘Diwali Pahat’ held early morning during Diwali are back, especially at open air venues. At least 10 groups have organized the morning musicals in the city starting November 2. But many popular organizers have decided to give it a skip this year too. Those who have organized the events have preferred open air venues. “Open air events are allowed with some rules and regulations. We are ready to follow these rules,” said Prasad Jogdand of Shiv Mavle Pratishthan. The Diwali Pahat of this group will be held at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Smarak Chowk, Bhandara Road, Pardi at 4.15am on November 4. The state government’s 15-point SOP for the open air events states that the seating arrangement should ensure 6ft distance between people, sanitization and use of masks at the venue. All artistes and technicians must be fully vaccinated. Accepting these rules is difficult practically, said some of the leading organizers. “Jam-packed auditorium is one of the highlights of our events. It would be difficult to adjust with 50% occupancy rule as everyone wishes to come and enjoy the music. As a precautionary measure to avoid crowds, we have decided not to hold events this year,” said advocate Bhanudas Kulkarni, known for organizing weeklong musicals during Diwali. Lackluster response from sponsors due to losses suffered during the pandemic, strict rules and regulations set by the government for indoor events and difficulties in controlling the crowd at open air events are some of the main reasons why organizers like Laxmi Nagar Nagarik Mandal have decided not to hold their popular Diwali Pahat this time. This year, these morning musicals will also miss the established names and artistes from Mumbai or Pune. Due to the budget constraint and uncertainty, many groups focused on local artistes, mostly emerging singers. A senior musician in Nagpur told TOI that he has been invited by at least two organizers but they quoted a meagre amount as honorarium. Badkas Chowk Mitra Parivar, Dr Girish Gandhi Foundation, Zenda Chowk Vyapari Mitra Parivar, Panthon Society Manish Nagar, Pioneer Society and Vishwakesari Foundation are some of the groups organizing open air ‘Diwali Pahat’ this week. Brahmanaad in physical form post Diwali South Central Zone Cultural Center (SCZCC)’s flagship monthly morning musical ‘Brahmanaad’ will resume in its physical from post Diwali. “We have decided to hold Brahmanaad on November 14. It will be held at SCZCC in the open air in presence of audiences,” said Dr Deepak Khirwadkar, director of SCZCC.

The accused, Vikram Kumar, claimed that he had been recruited in 2019. Following complaint by an RTI activist, Manoj Mishra, with relevant evidence to substantiate his claim that Vikram had never been inducted into the state police force, SP Amitesh Kumar asked SDPO (Sadar) Sumit Kumar to inquire into the allegations. Vikram, who belongs to Lakhanpur under Bhagwanpur police station area in Begusarai district, was arrested on Monday after the SDPO’s report confirmed that he was faking an SI. Vikram claimed to have first joined as trainee sub-inspector at the office of the DIG, Begusarai after his recruitment in the state police force in 2019. The sergeant major of Khagaria police lines, Hemant Kumar, said it was sheer negligence on the part of Mansi SHO Deepak Kumar, who allowed Vikram to join at the police station without verification. “The SHO should have verified it from the police lines. The police personnel transferred are first supposed to report to the police lines,” he revealed. He expressed surprise over the common rule not followed by the SHO in this particular case. “It’s quite strange. How can this happen?” the sergeant major asked. The SP said a show-cause notice has been issued to Mansi police station SHO for negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fraud-serving-as-si-arrested/articleshow/87472967.cms||Ramashankar

The department also destroyed 20 kg stale sweets, said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur. She said the teams, headed by food safety officers Anil Kumar and Ravinandan Goyal were tipped off about spurious cheese (paneer) being smuggled into Mohali. With the assistance of the local police, the food safety team set up a naka at Zirakpur and intercepted a vehicle. On checking the vehicle, the team recovered 5 quintals of spurious cheese which has been secured in a cold storage. A sample has been submitted in the laboratory for testing and once the report is received further action will be taken, she said. Later, the team conducted a surprise check at a sweet making factory in Zirakpur and seized 20 kg stale sweets, which were destroyed. The team took four samples of sweets being prepared at the factory and issued a warning to the factory owner. Food safety officers Anil Kumar and Ravinandan Goyal said a few shops were seen not displaying “Best Before Date” on sweets, after which warnings were issued to shop owners. In case of non-packaged or loose sweets, the container and tray holding sweets at the outlet for sale should display the “Best Before Date” of the product, which was made mandatory from October 1, 2020. So far in the month of October, 14 samples of milk and milk products have been taken in Zirakpur, he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: KEM outbreak was mainly due to Delta variant||Mumbai: The outbreak of Covid-19 among medical students at KEM hospital, Parel was caused by the Delta variant and its derivatives. A month ago, almost 30 MBBS students had tested positive for coronavirus, following which a round of mass testing and genome sequencing of the positive samples were carried out.  Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani confirmed that 43 samples were sent for genome sequencing, of which 34 were found to be Delta and nine were Delta derivatives. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said, “We were worried if it was caused by any of the new variants of interest, but that was not the case.”  Although the outbreak was caused by Delta, known to be highly transmissible, Dr Deshmukh said that the spread was contained within days. “It was probably because all but three of the affected students were fully vaccinated. We had tested close to 900 students, but we didn’t find any new cases after the initial lot. Most students were asymptomatic, and for the rest, symptoms were mild. Most have resumed studies,” he said.  According to the third Covid-19 genetic sequencing results released by the BMC on October 17, 54% had the Delta variant, 34% were Delta derivatives and 12% were other variants. In the second survey done in September, 80% of the samples were the Delta strain. Among Delta derivatives, A.Y4 has been the fastest growing in the state. However, civic officials believe the derivative may not be as lethal as the Delta variant that is believed to have driven the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kem-outbreak-was-mainly-due-to-delta-variant/articleshow/87473923.cms||---

Besides defying age, Asha’s achievement is also remarkable since she had a major car accident in the United States in September 2020 which left her with a broken shoulder. She underwent surgery, but soon hit the tracks after partial recovery — she ran her first ultra-marathon in Lucknow in December last year. “The injury was painful, but I was determined to participate in long races and was eager for global marathons. I feel I have outpaced aging,” said Asha, a grandmother of a four-year-old boy and 10-month-old girl. Asha started running in 2016 and has competed in 130 races, including 60 half-marathons (21.1km), 25 full marathons (42.2km) and three ultra-races (100km) since. “I was visiting my son in Pune when his friend casually asked me to participate in a 10km run. There’s been no stopping since then,” said Asha, who accompanied her husband Col (retd) Bajrang Singh in the 2020 Boston Marathon Virtual Experience, where he came first in the above 60 category among Indian participants. She plans to run two full marathons in November and a 24-hour race in December to qualify for the Boston marathon. Bajrang said, “She has had podium finish in almost all races. The challenge at her age is to maintain speed with the endurance needed in a marathon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/granny-defies-age-runs-her-way-to-coveted-ny-chicago-marathons/articleshow/87474614.cms||Isha Jain

The authority also directed the bank to hand over the under-construction residential project ‘Sunrisers’ situated in C-Scheme area to RERA. The authority will ensure the project’s completion and handing over of the allotted flats to the buyers. The order of nearly 100 pages was passed by chairman of Rajasthan RERA Nihalchand Goya on the complaints filed by Mukesh Agarwal and other allottees. Appearing on the behalf of the allottees, advocate Mohit Khandelwal said the residential complex, which was being developed and promoted by SNG Real Estate at Ashok Marg C-Scheme was launched in the year 2014. The flats were booked by many allottees after executing the agreement to sale with the promoter by paying lakhs of rupees as sale consideration. While purchasing flats, many allottees had taken housing loan from other banks vide various tripartite agreements and the flats were mortgaged to bank and regular installments were repaid. The entire record of the charge created by the bank on the flats were duly recorded on CERSAI. “Many allottees also got their agreements registered with the sub-registrar. In 2016, SNG Real Estate bypassed the legal provisions and without informing the allottees, mortgaged the entire project building on loan to Union Bank of India (Erstwhile Andhra Bank), thereafter, and obtained a term loan of Rs 15 crore from the Union Bank of India and later, due to non-repayment of the said loan by the promoters, the entire project building was attached by the Union Bank of India,” said Khandelwal. In 2020, Union Bank of India arbitrarily initiated the auction proceedings of 19 flats out of 38 when the maximum of these flats were already allotted to the allottees. Against this act of Union Bank, complaints were filed by the allottees before RERA to protect their interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rera-cancels-auction-of-flats-in-city-by-bank/articleshow/87473924.cms||---

PGIMER facilitated Panchkula’s first cadaveric kidney transplant, which was conducted at a private hospital and successfully transplanted kidney, pancreas and corneas in matching recipients in PGIMER. Prof Ashish Sharma, head of the department of renal transplant, PGIMER, said, “This was the first case of cadaveric organ harvesting by any private hospital in the Tricity and we are happy to see a healthy collaboration between the private sector and PGIMER to conduct cadaveric transplant.” Nipun, an IT professional, was admitted in the Panchkula hospital in critical condition. Later, he developed a massive brain haemorrhage and was declared brain dead. The bereaved family approached hospital authorities for organ donation. After all desired permissions were received from district heath authorities and ROTTO, PGIMER, a team led by Dr Ashish Sharma and Dr Neeraj Goyal, senior consultant, urology and kidney transplant from Alchemist Hospital, started organ retrieval from the brain dead patient. A green corridor was created between the private hospital and PGIMER to transport a kidney, pancreas and two corneas from Panchkula to Chandigarh with the help of Panchkula and Chandigarh Police. Sharing his views, Dr Neeraj Goyal said 95% of transplants in India are living donor transplants, whereas only 5% are cadaver (deceased donor).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/terminally-ill-patients-get-new-life-with-organ-transplantation/articleshow/87472996.cms||---

Sanjog Holey, arrested on October 29 this year, had been a tricky case even as a juvenile delinquent. After attaining adulthood, Holey became even more troublesome for the police, say sources in the department. Following sustained efforts, Tehsil police team had trapped Holey from a community toilet early in the morning. Apart from a murder under Lakadganj police station jurisdiction a few years back, Holey had been involved in repeat offences of burglaries, vehicle thefts and so on. Police said Holey was sheltered by a gang leader, Satish Gaur, after he had lost his father early. Gaur allegedly groomed him as a criminal and is learnt to be taking a substantial share of his stolen booty. In return, Gaur ensured Holey was bailed out after being arrested by arranging lawyers, paying for bond surety and bearing other legal expenses. Senior inspector Jayesh Bhandarkar of Tehsil police station said Holey had managed to escape during an action when rest of the gang members were arrested for preparing to commit dacoity near Pahelwan Baba dargah. “We have detected around eight offences, including four vehicle thefts, and rest of burglaries, thefts. He had also walked away with a bag of cash and other valuables from a doctor’s clinic,” said Bhandarkar, adding his team of head constable Laxman Shende, Kishor Garware, under sub-inspectors Swapnil Wagh, Sachin Sawarkar, assistant PI Sandip Bagul and others had nabbed Holey. “We have recovered four stolen vehicles and some valuables from him after custodial interrogation,” said Bhandarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/miserly-serial-burglar-saved-booty-for-bail/articleshow/87473926.cms||Soumitra Bose

Accordingly, the UT animal husbandry department on Monday collected 48 environmental and serum samples from Sukhna Lake. They will be sent to High Security Animal Disease, Hebbel in Bhopal for further investigation. Earlier, the department of animal husbandry organised a one-day training-cum-mock drill for prevention of avian influenza in the city. The training was given to 30 participants, including officials from the department of animal husbandry, department of forest, and the municipal corporation. The training and mock drill was conducted by scientists from North Zone Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar. Inaugurating the training programme, Manish Kumar Lohan, director, animal husbandry, Chandigarh, said bird flu is a highly contagious disease having zoonotic potential. “This disease causes huge losses in terms of mortality of birds and in trade of poultry and its products. As winter is setting in, there is likely risk of ingression of avian influenza , as it is trans-boundary animal disease. This training-cum-mock drill will be helpful to work against this disease as per latest guidelines and get all relevant department co-ordination to combat this disease in Chandigarh,” he said. The department has started active physical surveillance of all type of birds, which include commercial, poultry, backyard poultry and in particular migratory birds. The migratory birds are arriving in Chandigarh. They usually stay till February. Migratory birds play an important role in transmission of avian influenza virus. The department has activated its surveillance at Sukhna Lake, which has major potential area of migratory birds in Chandigarh during the winter, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/avian-influenza-ut-collects-48-samples-from-sukhna/articleshow/87473028.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Jewellers look forward to Dhanteras as buyers return in strength||MUMBAI: The signs augur well for Tuesday’s festival of Dhanteras, which is the main shopping mahurat of Diwali. Jewellers are receiving robust enquiries and bookings, and many of them plan to keep shops open till 10pm, expecting footfall to pick up during the late evening mahurat. The wedding season is picking up too. All the ceremonies that were postponed earlier are taking place now, so apart from gold, even the cloth market in Dadar and sundry businesses like fashion jewellery in Bhuleshwar are doing good business. Purchasing power has decreased, no doubt, but traders are happy that the footfall have resumed and “everybody is buying a little something”. The price of 22-carat gold stood at Rs 45,000 per 10 gm on Monday, while 24-carat gold was listed at Rs 49,400. Kumar Jain of the Shree Mumbai Jewellers Association said, “Customers are waiting to unleash their spending potential, which has been shackled since the lockdown. Plus the marriages that were postponed in 2020 are being solemnised now. We had visitors from Jalore, Rajasthan, who said there were 140 marriages in just two days in that cluster of villages.” Goldsmith Kanaya Kakad from Zaveri Bazar said traders were expecting good business as the stock market was headed in a positive direction. Deepak Devrukhkar of Mangal Murti Jewellers opposite Plaza Cinema, Dadar, said, “We expect Dhanteras to bring good recovery since Dussehra sales were beyond expectation too. I am expecting light jewellery and gold coins of 5-10gm to do well.” Devrukhkar, who is also treasurer of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vyapari Sena, said, “Even the cloth market is faring extremely well. Shops in Dadar were open till 10pm Sunday.” However, the age-old practice of buying utensils on Dhanteras has waned this year. Biren Kenia of Sagun Steel, Bhuleshwar, said, “Rates of steel, copper and brass have shot up by 30-40% in the last three or four months. So festive purchases and corporate gifting is dismal. But we are receiving a parallel segment of wedding buyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jewellers-look-forward-to-dhanteras-as-buyers-return-in-strength/articleshow/87473940.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Patna||Bihar: UP trader shot dead for spitting ‘paan’ on youth in Siwan||PATNA: A small-time businessman from Uttar Pradesh had to pay with his life for spitting after chewing ‘paan’ (betel leaf) in Siwan district late on Sunday. The deceased, Ehsan Malik (27), was a native of Shahbazpur village in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh. He used to sell clothes in the area. The incident took place at around 8.30pm when Ehsan was cooking his meal in his rented house at Purani Quila Pokhar under the Sarai police outpost in Siwan district on Sunday. He spit on the road after chewing ‘paan’ from the window of the kitchen. Coincidentally, a youth, who was passing by, got his clothes dirty as a few drops fell on his body. Enraged, he barged into Ehsan’s room and fired at him from point blank range, causing grievous injuries. The 27-year-old was rushed to the Sadar hospital in Siwan where the doctors declared him dead. The assailant identified as Golu Miyan, however, managed to escape after shooting at Ehsan. The station house officer of Sarai police outpost, Mohd Tanveer Alam, said the assailant, who was arrested on Monday, confessed to the crime. Two live cartridges and an equal number of empty cartridges were recovered from the spot, he revealed. Although Golu (18), a resident of Purani Quila in Siwan, had no criminal antecedents, he was carrying an illegal countrymade pistol with him, which hinted at his involvement in petty offences in the district. The body of the deceased was handed over to his relatives after postmortem. “Ehsan used to sell garments in rural areas and was staying in a rented house in Siwan to deal with his local customers,” the SHO said, adding that the accused was produced before a local court, which remanded him to 14-day judicial custody. Police have, however, failed to recover the weapon used in the crime. “Raids are on to recover the weapon used for killing the businessman,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/up-trader-shot-dead-for-spitting-paan-on-youth-in-siwan/articleshow/87473037.cms||Ramashankar
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav must apologize for comparing Jinnah with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: A day after Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav counted Mohammed Ali Jinnah as a freedom fighter in the league of Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that the Yadav had a ‘Talibani mindset’. Speaking at events organised in Moradabad and Faridabad on Monday, the chief minister cautioned people against falling for “Jinnahwadis”, who were trying to break the country for their selfish reasons. “Yaad rakhiye ye Jinnahwadi Ram bhakton par goliyan chalate hain. Ab kabhi Ram bhakton par koi aanch nahin aa sakti,” he said in an apparent reference to the firing ordered by then chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav at kar sewaks in Ayodhya in 1990. Yogi Adityanath slams Akhilesh Yadav over Jinnah remark, says 'Talibani mentality'Calling Akhilesh’s statement highly shameful, the chief minister said the people of UP would never accept someone with a divisive mindset who would glorify a person like Jinnah by comparing him with Patel. “He compared desh todo (those who divided the country) Jinnah with Patel, who is responsible for keeping the country united. Patel is the architect of India’s unity. Currently, work is being done to realise PM Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtra Bharat’ but the credit of envisioning and working towards a united country in an Independent India goes to Patel,” he said. Saying that Patel’s strength in not allowing the country to be divided further after gaining independence had led people of the country to recognise him as 'Lauh Purush' (iron man) and Yadav would be rejected by people across the country, especially in UP, for having dared to compare him with Jinnah. Yogi asked Yadav to tender an immediate apology to the people for his remarks, saying that those who talk of Jinnah in such terms are those who only think about their families and are not bothered about the people of the country. Unlike them, the CM said, his party treats all people like its family. In Faridabad, Yogi said that the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya was a symbol of their respect for the religious sentiments of the Hindus. “Our country represents unity and the culture of India is a treasure for humanity because this is a culture of non-violence, of harmony and respect for one another,” he said. The CM added: “Our religion has taught us to face difficult situations and overcome challenges valiantly rather than running away or resorting to easier solutions in rough times. Every religion inculcates in us the principles of humanity and welfare of all.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-akhilesh-has-talibani-mindset-must-apologise/articleshow/87474627.cms||Neha Lalchandani

As per the complaint, the incident occurred between March and July 2020, when the suspect promised to send her a gift comprising UK pound sterling. The police have booked the man and two others suspected of aiding him in executing the fraud. Police said the woman’s husband runs a furniture business; she is a housewife. “She frequents social media daily. In March 2020, she accepted a friend request from a man who claimed to be a UK based businessman. Once they got acquainted, he told her he wanted to invest in India and promised to send her a significant amount in pound sterling as a gift,” senior inspector Sardar Patil said. Police said the woman then asked him to first visit India. “He then called and claimed he was detained by customs officials at the Delhi airport and that the foreign currency was seized,” Patil said. At first, the complainant did not respond to the man’s plea for help. “She then received a call in which a woman claimed to be a customs officer. The caller said they would initiate legal action if the complainant does not pay a fine,” he said. She transferred Rs33.35 lakh to a bank account number provided by the woman caller. “Once the transfer was made, the suspect and the ‘customs official’ stopped answering her calls. She then realised she was duped,” Patil said. Pune cyber police said they have received 171 such cases since January this year. Last year, there were 70 such complaints. “People should be careful before accepting friend requests from strangers. They should never transfer money to strangers,” senior inspector D S Hake said. Cyberfraud expert Rohan Nyayadhish told TOI that people should be wary and avoid taking risks online, such as accepting friend requests from strangers. “People are increasingly falling prey to such tricks. Often the suspects, while chatting, win their confidence. Gradually, the suspect starts making promises to the victims. The trust is so high that people start believing in them,” Nyayadhish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-falls-for-uk-currency-gift-bait-loses-over-rs-33-lakh/articleshow/87473053.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Kolkata||Defunct wires to be removed from Exide-Tollygunge Phanri stretch||Kolkata: Defunct cable TV, broadband and cell phone wires will be pulled down from lamp posts along a 5km stretch between the AJC Bose Road-JL Nehru Road (Exide) crossing and the Tollygunge Phanri intersection. All Bengal Cable TV and Broadband Operators’ United Forum has taken up the job to clear the wire mess. In 2019, CM Mamata Banerjee had urged cable operators to remove the mesh of wires from lamp posts that were leading to visual pollution across the city. “We plan to begin clearing the dead cables from Exide crossing and Tollygunge Phanri intersection next month. This is a long and crowded stretch with heavy traffic, so the job will be difficult. We are chalking out a plan for the work and will employ more people than we did for the Ruby-Gariahat exercise 10 months back,” said joint convenor of the forum Tapash Das. It had taken nearly two months to get rid of the defunct wires along the stretch. “It could take even longer at this stretch since the road, especially the Bhawanipore area, has thousands of cable homes and defunct wires. There are markets and congested neighbourhoods along the way and the wires are perched at different heights,” added Das. Discussions are on with KMC for assistance. But the forum is ready to go ahead on its own. “Last time, too, we had done it on our own. We had arranged a hydraulic ladder for the job. This time, we are looking for better equipment,” said a forum official. More than 50km of dead cables had been removed between Ruby and Gariahat. The Exide-Tollygunge stretch could yield around 100km of dead wires, the forum officials believe. Meanwhile, the laying of the first underground cable TV wire duct in the city between Harish Mukherjee Road and AJC Bose Road – that had begun earlier this year - has come to a halt. “A technical difficulty has come in the way which we will sort out after Diwali. We hope to be able to roll out the underground cables very soon,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/defunct-wires-to-be-removed-from-exide-tollygunge-phanri-stretch/articleshow/87473085.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Kota city SP Vikas Pathak said a city dealer of ITC and Cadbury on October 26 lodged a report in Anantpura police station and alleged the gates of his godown and main office were found unlocked and at least 130 cartoons of cigarettes were stolen. Taking a serious note, separate teams under supervision of ASP Praveen Jain were formed that finally busted the gang of cigarette thieves.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid protocol takes a hit on first weekday test of train resumption||KOLKATA: After Sunday’s dress rehearsal, Railways faced the weekday test on Monday and hardly managed make any headway in enforcing social distancing rules. People threw caution to the air and shoved each other while boarding or disembarking the crammed compartments. Eastern Railway (ER), which carries the bulk of suburban passengers along its Sealdah and Howrah divisions, wasn’t expecting things to be otherwise. Going by statistics, ensuring 50% occupancy is “an impossibility”. According to officials, an EMU compartment can accommodate 124 passengers. Thus, only 62 must be allowed or around 750 should board a 12-coach train. From 8am to 11am, around 3,000 commuters ride a local train on an average. That’s 250 per compartment. Railway police personnel appealed to commuters constantly, trying to control the passenger surge. “We are making announcements, urging people not to jostle to board the rakes. RPF are using loudhailers to warn against contagion. From tomorrow, there will be more RPF personnel on trains,” ER spokesperson Ekalabya Chakraborty said. On Monday, ER ran 820 trains in 93 rakes on the Sealdah division and 380 services in 50 rakes in the Horwah division. South-Eastern Railway (SER), the other zonal railway headquartered in Kolkata, operated 49 EMU services out of its usual 190. At many stations, commuters demanded more trains to avoid the rush. Sealdah DRM SP Singh said: “We shall run 870 services by the end of the week.” In pre-Covid times, ER ran 920 services along the Sealdah division and 488 in the Howrah division. The scene was much like the pre-pandemic days, with long ticket queues and crowding at stations like Sonarpur, Baruipur, Barasat, Sodepur, Barrackpore, Serampore and Naihati. Trains along Krishnagore, Bongaon, Hasnabad, Gede, Canning and Lakshmikantapur were as crowded as the normal times. “Everyone wants to get in at the same time,” rued an ER official. Prasanta Das, a clerk at the state PHE department, said: “Can’t afford to wait for the next train. All this time, the staff specials ran and were cancelled off and on. From today, the office won’t accept late excuses.” If he was anxious, some were relieved. Jubilant hawkers at Sheoraphuli station worshipped a rake with garlands as the fastest and cheapest means of commute was back after six months. But passengers of Islampur station of the Bandel-Katwa section saw red because the specials were replaced with regular services, and the trains no longer halted at their station. ER officials were bracing for more unrest and Covid protocol violations. “Monitoring 206 and 176 stations in Sealdah and Howrah divisions, respectively, or the 286 stations of the two divisions is a huge challenge. Entry points can only be checked at Howrah and Sealdah stations,” said an official. Railways can’t add more locals either. For that, the tracks, crowded with long-distance, passenger and freight trains, would need an upgrade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-protocol-takes-a-hit-on-first-weekday-test-of-train-resumption/articleshow/87473075.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Vehicle sales in Mumbai down by up to 32% this Dhanteras||MUMBAI: Car and bike sales in the city have declined for the auspicious Dhanteras festival, which falls on Tuesday, as compared to the previous two years, transport statistics show. Experts said that one of the key reasons which deterred buyers from purchasing new vehicles was a hefty increase in fuel prices. Petrol prices were hiked by over 51% and diesel by 60% in the last one and a half years and are burning holes in the pockets of motorists. Petrol was retailing at over Rs 115 per litre and diesel at over Rs 106 as compared to petrol at Rs 76 and diesel at Rs 66 in April last year. Sachin Gawde, general manager (sales) at Velox Motors, said that with increasing petrol and diesel rates, people are now inquiring about CNG cars. He said “a shortage of semiconductors has also led to a delay in the availability of car models, resulting in sluggish sales this festive season”. According to vehicle registration data for a fortnight before Dhanteras, 2,447 cars and 6237 bikes were booked at various showrooms in Mumbai for Diwali deliveries. This was 12% fewer cars and 32% fewer two-wheelers than purchased during Dhanteras and Diwali last year. The corresponding figures for 2019 are 12% and again 12%. After Covid’s first wave, there was a rush to showrooms to buy new cars and two-wheelers during Diwali 2020. “Comparative sales had dropped this year,” said a dealer. The drop in sales had begun from Dussehra this year when 2,818 cars and 5,034 bikes were registered for deliveries on the auspicious day. This was 13% less for cars and 39% less for two-wheelers compared to Dussehra 2020. The silver lining was that the sale of cars in Dussehra was 3% more than the pre-Covid (2019) festival. “It is an abject failure of the state and central governments to provide any respite to common citizens in these times of economic uncertainty amid the ever-rising cost of living in Mumbai,” said Preeti Sharma Menon from AAP. A transport expert said that although expensive fuel could act as a deterrent and help reduce cars and bikes on the road, at the same time encouraging the sale of electric and CNG vehicles, it was time there was some correction in hefty fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vehicle-sales-in-city-down-by-up-to-32-this-dhanteras/articleshow/87473984.cms||Somit Sen

Rowing has been suspended since October 22. With trials for the national championship scheduled on November 17, athletes hoping to qualify for the event are desperate to start practising. “We will try to remove the fountains by 7am on Tuesday so that if the rowers wish to start practice, they can do so. We will also write to the state pollution control board to seek advice on alternative means to improve the water quality, be it through mechanical means or chemical ones,” a KMDA official said. West Bengal Rowing Association secretary Aniruddha Mookerjee said he hoped the obstacles in the course would be removed at the earliest as much time had already been lost. “Rowing should begin in earnest from Wednesday. Rowing could not be done for over a week as there could have been an accident leading to injury to rowers and damage to equipment,” he said. Functionaries of all three rowing clubs at the lake -- Calcutta Rowing Club, Lake Club and Bengal Rowing Club -- have welcomed KMDA’s decision. “We are glad the agency listened to our argument and decided to act on it. We too will explore alternative means to improve the water,” said CRC secretary and Bengal Olympic Association vice-president Chandan Roychoudhury. Green activist Bonani Kakkar said: “Experts said a solution of bleaching powder and potassium permanganate may be worth exploring. The method was used by KIT for many years until recently.

Both the candidates, Shlok Soni and Prasham Shah, have scored 705 out of 720 marks in the exams that were held on September 12. While Shlok Soni has secured AIR-60, Shah has bagged AIR-100. Prasham Shah“I want to get admission in AIIMS-Delhi but it seems a little difficult looking at my rank. My aim was to secure a place in Top 50 AIR. I joined coaching classes for NEET exam preparation from Class 8. My father is an orthopaedic surgeon at a hospital in Ankleshwar. As the exams got delayed due to Covid-19, I started feeling tense,” said Shah. He said the bright side of the lockdown was that he got to spend almost a year with his family members. Shah, with AIR-100, resides in Ahmedabad’s Sabarmati area. His father is an ENT surgeon. “The exam paper was tougher this time as compared to last year. There were some tricky questions that were tough to crack. I have got the marks that I expected. It’s not important how many hours you study, it’s important how well you study,” said Shah. He did not completely give up on mobile phones and gadgets but used them in a limited manner while preparing for the exams.

The scheme was approved in June and ended on October 31. “The deadline for applications is over, but we have started the process to extend it. The proposal for extension has been tabled before the committees concerned,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s water supply department.Pawaskar said PMC had earned Rs20 lakh from the scheme. The connection at residential properties were legalised and no commercial establishment has come forward to reap the benefit of this scheme. Under the scheme, all those “permissible connections” installed before June 1, 2021, were eligible for regularization. A PMC official said the initiative did not intend to give an approval to every illegal connection. Only those which were currently illegal due to non-completion of formalities were to be regularized, the official said. PMC norms state that if any property has six flats, one 1/2-inch connection is allowed. If there are 12 flats, a 3/4-inch connection is given and for any property with more than 24 flats, one 1-inch connection is allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/poor-response-to-pmcs-amnesty-scheme-for-water-connections/articleshow/87473104.cms||---

Association’s state president Pravin Kale on Monday said that around 30 proposals submitted to the government for opening of biodiesel outlets across Maharashtra were gathering dust due to lack of awareness at the official level. “We are running from pillar to post to get clearance for the pending proposals. During follow-ups, we realised that the government officials are unaware of the official biodiesel policy of the state and the Centre. It is leading to inordinate delays in getting necessary sanctions and clearances,” he said. Kale said the delay in permitting official supply of biodiesel has given rise to rampant unauthorised sale of mixture of chemicals, which are being sold in the name of biodiesel. “Although Maharashtra does not have a single authorised biodiesel outlet, rampant sale of substandard quality of fuel named “biodiesel” is taking place in different places. Such fuel can cause potential damage to vehicles as well as the environment,” he said. While the Biodiesel (Manufacturing, Storage, Supply, Selling) Policy, 2021, of the Maharashtra government governs the biodiesel market, Kale said different competent authorities responsible for giving the NOCs and clearances need awareness on the legal framework. As per All-India Biodiesel Association, which is an umbrella body of manufactures, traders, suppliers, transporters and retailers, authorised biodiesel can be made available for sale in retail at a rate of Rs 96-97 per litre, which is cheaper than diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/govt-authorities-unaware-of-policy-biodiesel-association/articleshow/87471486.cms||Prasad Joshi

Further, Chandigarh was made the shared capital of the two states and of the union territory itself. This day is commemorated as the Foundation Day of Chandigarh. To celebrate the day, an exhibition, “Chandigarh-down the memory lane” has started at the Chandigarh Lalit Kala Akademy (CLKA) gallery at the underpass linking Rose Garden to Sector 17. The exhibition, organised by CLKA, will be on view from November 1 to November 14 from 10am to 8pm. The exhibition brings together an assortment of vintage photographs that show the city in its nascent stages. As immigrants flocked to the city in search for new moorings after being displaced by the traumatic partition, the institutional, cultural and residential buildings helped them to step out of the village life into a new and modern way of living. The curated images capture the almost barren city before it started teeming with people and greenery. The pictures displayed in the exhibition show different colours of city beautiful. Talking to TOI, chairman, CLKA said, “It gives me immense pleasure to be part of such a city. With this exhibition, we celebrate the foundation of a city that embodied the dreams and aspiration of thousands of Indians looking for an identity post independence. We are very excited to display different personas of City Beautiful. We also acknowledge the contribution of many unknown photographers who captured for us rare glimpses of the city as it came up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/snapshots-of-citys-journeys-from-birth-displayed/articleshow/87473107.cms||---

These rates will be increased for the first time in 30 years. PMC’s legal officer Nisha Chavan explained to TOI, “The civic administration enters into various contracts, which need to be studied and drafted properly. The law department does this work for various agencies, which sign the contract with us and get legal fees from the respective company they are working with. These fees had not been increased since 1991. Now, a hike has been proposed to increase PMC’s revenue.” As per the old rates, fees ranged from Rs50-1,000. Now, a hike of nearly five times has been mooted in some categories, with a new range of Rs 200-5,000. According to the proposal, PMC carries out 17 different types of contracts. They include undertakings, affidavits, leave and license, lease agreement, commercial contracts and project work contracts. “The new rates have been finalised considering market rates that private firms charge. Though our rates are far less, a sizeable increase is proposed. This hike also aims at giving respectable remuneration for manpower and intellectual property of the civic staff,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/legal-consultancy-fees-revision-likely-after-30-yrs/articleshow/87473110.cms||---

In Kumar’s (22) instance, granting him bail on Saturday, the court held that merely on the basis of WhatsApp chats, it cannot be gathered that he used to supply contraband to Khan (23) and Arbaaz Merchant (26), especially when Khan, with whom he chatted, has already been granted bail by Bombay high court. In the case of Khan, the same court rejected his bail on October 20, observing there is material in the form of incriminating WhatsApp chats that shows his nexus with suppliers and peddlers. “Moreover, WhatsApp chats prima facie reveals that accused no 1 (Khan) is dealing in illicit drug activities of narcotic substances on a regular basis. Therefore it can not be said that accused no. 1 is not likely to commit a similar offence while on bail,” the court had said. The court also refuted the defence plea that WhatsApp chats without the relevant certificate under the Indian Evidence Act cannot be looked into. “Even if assuming that there is no certificate under Section 65 (b) of Indian Evidence Act, at the stage of investigation, it is not necessary,” the court had said in Khan’s bail order. During Khan’s bail arguments, the prosecution had submitted there was ample evidence in the form of his WhatsApp chats with foreign national and unknown persons dealing in drugs and investigation in this regard is going on. It said there was a reference to hard drugs and bulk quantities in chats, which cannot be meant for consumption. Opposing Kumar’s bail plea, the prosecution had said there are Whatsapp chats between Khan and Kumar in respect of the contraband. Khan and Merchant were eventually granted bail by Bombay high court in the cruise drugs bust case on Thursday. The detailed order copy is yet to be made available. They were arrested on October 3. The NCB had allegedly recovered 6 gms of charas from Merchant’s shoes. Referring to the drugs, the special NDPS court also said Khan “was having knowledge and thus it can be said that it was in ‘conscious possession’ of both (Khan and Merchant) the accused.” The court said record shows Khan and Merchant admitted to being friends for long, travelled together to the party and were apprehended together. Kumar was arrested on October 6 on the basis of the now-retracted statement of Khan and the alleged WhatsApp chats. NCB allegedly recovered 2.6 gms of ganja from his Powai home. In Kumar’s bail order, the court said NCB failed to bring on record specific evidence to show that he was dealing in the business of supplying the contraband. The special NDPS judge observed, “Except WhatsApp chats with accused no 1 (Khan) there is no other evidence to show that the applicant (Kumar) was indulging in such activity. Merely on the basis of WhatsApp chats, it cannot be gathered that applicant used to supply contraband to accused nos 1 & 2 (Khan & Merchant), especially when the accused no 1, with whom there are WhatsApp chats of applicant, is granted bail by the high court.” In Khan’s case, the court had observed that perusal of the WhatsApp chats reveal there are his conversations about drugs with unknown persons. “There is prima facie material showing that accused no 1 was in contact with persons dealing in prohibited narcotic substances as alleged by the prosecution,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-views-wa-chats-differently-in-aryans-and-another-accuseds-cases/articleshow/87473988.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Pune||Duo booked for duping man of Rs 1 lakh for ‘LIC bond’||Pune: The Sangvi police are searching for two women after a 46-year-old Pimple Gurav resident lodged a complaint accusing them of cheating him of Rs 1 lakh under the pretext of an investment in a ‘Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) bond’. The two women posted him a receipt after collecting the money from him, but he realised he had been defrauded when he visited the LIC office and found that the latter had issued no such receipt. Police sub-inspector (PSI) Santosh Yede of the Sangvi police told TOI that in February this year, one of the two women contacted the complainant on his cellphone and claimed that she was from LIC. “She told him that LIC had introduced bonds under which people could get nine per cent interest on their investment,” Yede said. He said that after a few days, the two women went to the complainant’s house. He allowed them in as they showed him identity cards. The women then explained the scheme to him. “The complainant decided to invest in it and gave them a cheque of Rs 1 lakh,” Yede said. He added that after the amount was debited from the bank account, the complainant started pursuing the duo. “However, the women did not give him proper answers,” Yede said, adding, “After some days, the complainant got a receipt via post.” When the complainant went to the LIC office to check about the scheme, he found that the receipt was bogus and that the women were not working there. “We have registered a case under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the duo,” Yede said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-booked-for-duping-man-of-rs-1-lakh-for-lic-bond/articleshow/87473119.cms||---

Apart from this the child panel also asked the NGOs to plan on distributing gifts to children in slums on Diwali. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) said, “During pandemic, the children were unable to go to schools and do their usual activities so in this week-long celebration, we have asked all the NGOs to ensure that maximum number of children participate. Moreover, focus will be especially on those living in shelters so that they can participate in the various events.” During the meeting, the NGOs gave various suggestions for the week-long celebration including awareness campaigns, street plays, Bal Mela, rallies and Bal Sabha among others, though the programs are yet to be finalised. Camps will be set up in the children shelters also for checking their mental as well as physical health. Recently the commission had distributed Covid aid kits to 170 child care institutions in the state which included both private and government-run shelters. The kit containing 13 items was distributed in anticipation of the third wave of Covid. “As this is festival season, we have also urged the NGOs to plan on distributing goodies like sweets, clothes etc to the children who lost their families and are staying in shelters or those who stay in slums so that Diwali can be a happy occasion for them as well,” added the chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/childrens-day-to-be-week-long-celebration/articleshow/87473995.cms||---
---||Bareilly||Akhilesh Yadav has ‘Talibani mindset’, must apologise for comparing Jinnah with Patel: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||BAREILLY: A day after Akhilesh Yadav counted Muslim League leader and Pakistan founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah among freedom fighters like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the Samajwadi Party chief had a “Talibani mindset that believes in destroying the social fabric of the country" and demanded an apology from him for his “divisive statement”. Other leaders of the BJP, too, attacked Yadav for his remarks, with deputy CM Keshav Prasad terming him “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah” and his party as “Namazwadi Party”. While UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh claimed that Yadav must have cheered India’s loss at the T-20 cricket match against Pakistan, UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said the country considered Jinnah a “villain responsible for partition”. “Comparing Jinnah with freedom fighters is the politics of Muslim appeasement,” he tweeted. On Sunday, Yadav had spoken of Patel, Nehru, Gandhi and Jinnah as leaders who fought for India's independence while addressing a public meeting in UP’s Hardoi on the 146th birth anniversary of Patel. In a video of the event, Yadav was heard saying, “Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammad Ali Jinnah studied in the same institute. They became barristers and fought for India’s freedom.” Yadav had also mentioned the ban imposed on the RSS by Patel. “It was iron man Sardar Patel who imposed a ban on a particular ideology (a reference to RSS). He also fought for farmers and is known as ‘sardar’. The ruling party claims that it is working on the path shown by Sardar Patel. If this is true, then the BJP must withdraw its decision on the three farm laws. The step will be a true tribute to Patel who worked in the interest of farmers,” Yadav had said. Yadav's statements drew flak from the UP CM as well. At the passing out parade of deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) at Police Lines in Moradabad, Yogi said comparing Patel with Jinnah was a “shameful act”, adding that Yadav “must apologise to the people of the nation for making such a divisive statement”. “Yadav has compared Sardar Patel, who worked for the unity and integrity of this country with Jinnah, who had a divisive mindset. He even mentioned other freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru while praising Jinnah. This act of comparing Jinnah with people who fought for freedom of our country shows nothing but the divisive mentality of Yadav,” said the CM. Yogi added: “His (Yadav’s) Talibani mindset has come to the fore and this shall not be tolerated by the citizens of this country, especially the state of Uttar Pradesh.” The CM said the BJP has been following Patel and working for India’s unity with the vision of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ (One India, Great India). “The SP chief has glorified Jinnah and praised him. These people work on the Talibani mindset that believes in destroying the social fabric of the country and dividing in the name of caste and religion. Such an act is unacceptable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/akhilesh-has-talibani-mindset-must-apologise-for-comparing-jinnah-with-patel-yogi/articleshow/87471428.cms||Maria Khan

The publishers are enthused by the response for the magazines that hit the stalls about two weeks ago and the demand for subscription is coming from every corner of Maharashtra. School teacher Shubhada Sahasrabudhe said, “For me, more than the sweets and the lighting or any other festivity during Diwali, my celebration is reading the magazines. I wait for them to hit the stands and for the last 30 years I have been picking and choosing rich literature from these magazines. I have a collection of special issues.” For many years, the Diwali magazines have been a great attraction for ardent readers and especially the older generation. Editor of Ruturang Diwali magazine Arun Shevate said, “I refrained from bringing any online version of the magazine because I felt that the literature is mainly picked by the 40 plus crowd. They want the magazine to be felt in hand and are not so used to the digital version. We tried the PDF format last year as there was no option due to the pandemic, but it did not work.” The theme this year for Ruturang magazine is native places and the attachment that individuals have to it. The magazine features an article by cricket player Sachin Tendulkar who has shared some of his memories of childhood. Resident of Kasba Peth Vishnu Deshpande, a 78-year-old retired government officer said that one day of the shopping spree during Diwali is dedicated by him for Diwali magazines very year. Deshpande said, “Till a few years ago, it was just me going to Appa Balwant Chowk to pick the best literature but now I am accompanies by my 13-year-old daughter who has also developed a taste for reading these magazines.” The Srujansamwad Publication has come out with ocean as its theme this year and titles as 'He Sagara'. Editor Gitesh Shinde said that the magazine was a great mix of literature from the environment field with personal experiences, poems, must visit tourism spots on sea shores among others. “An interesting article in the magazine is by Medha Soman who has written about the ancient importance of the ocean in Vedas and Shlokas. We have also republished an article written by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar from 1942 written in a newspaper titled Janta Khas,” added Shinde. Another magazine titles Samwadsetu has also garnered a very good response soon after it was released post Dasara. Editor Vandana Bokil Kulkarni said, “We are very optimistic with the kind of response we have got this year for the magazines. It is almost like a demand from our readers that this year there should be no compromise and we have lived up to their expectations and brought out a gem. There are continuous online queries to post the magazine by courier or other method to outstation and we have been able to fulfill it. After a month, we will also be coming out with the online version.” The Kilbil Celebration Diwali Magazine has come out in audio format this year and is available free in YouTube. Gandhar Kala came out with this novel idea of audio magazine. Last year, the same magazine was released in video mode with participation from 30 children.

The National Testing Agency had conducted NEET on September 12, but the results were delayed due to pending judicial matters. It was on Thursday that the Supreme Court gave the go-ahead to NTA to release the results. Mrinal Kutteri (Telangana), Tanmay Gupta (Delhi) and Karthika G Nair (Maharashtra) are the first three rank holders in the country. The first three rank holders in the state are Karthika Nair from Mumbai followed by Hriday and Vaishnavi Sarda. Hriday, a football enthusiast and Liverpool fan, is the son of anaesthesiologist Dr Vishal Mohite and IT professional Trupti Mohite. “When the answer key was released, we had a feeling that he would get top marks. He has always been good at studies and has worked hard for this,” his father said. Hriday said he had been studying hard for his entrance exams. “I have been wanting to become a doctor since I was in Std IX or X when I was in DAV Public School. I knew I would be in the top 50 rank holders but I did not think I would be in the top 20,” he said. Hriday has been preparing for NEET for the past two years. He is also a KVPY scholar. Durgesh Mangeshkar, an entrance exam expert, said that despite a tough paper, NEET 2021 marks vs ranks matrix remains similar to NEET 2020 which again points to the fact that 2021 batch was more attuned to online studies and overcame the fear of Covid-19 to crack NEET 2021. Almost 19,000 students scored over 600 marks this year just like in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-neet-topper-hriday-mohite-second-in-state-after-mumbai-girl/articleshow/87473150.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: As Covid-19 cases dip, NMC goes easy on citizens sans mask||NAGPUR: With dip in coronavirus cases, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s initiative to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour has taken a back seat. Data obtained from the civic body reveal that cases of penalising citizens venturing out without mask started declining from May 2021. In an act of abject carelessness, a large number of people can be seen moving about publicly without wearing face mask. Yet, the NMC’s civic cops have been penalizing an average 15 to 30 citizens a day only. Data from June 2020 to October 2021 revealed that the highest number of people without mask were penalized in October 2020 when the Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) had recovered Rs34.40 lakh fine from 6,880 citizens. The least number of people — 143 — were penalised in August 2020. In the last 17 months, Nagpurians have cumulatively paid Rs1.89 crore as fine for roaming around in public places without wearing mask. The civic cops in the field say they are facing resistance from the citizens after catching them without mask. “Most of the citizens show their double vaccination certificate, when caught,” said the NDS team members. Not only this, even elected representatives have started interfering with the NDS action against Covid protocol violators, they said. TOI visited many public places including markets, railway station, Ganeshpeth bus depot, Mor Bhavan city bus depot and found scant or no regard for the Covid-19 protocols. With Covid curbs eased and cases down, markets are abuzz with shoppers in view of the Diwali festival. And not only shoppers, but even shopkeepers and their employees were found without mask. “Though the infectivity has gone down, the pandemic is not over yet. Cases are still being reported. We must be careful for some more days. Precautionary measures like masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing are must. Many people have stopped wearing mask. This is risky. Masks are useful in many ways, especially during Diwali. You can protect yourself from several infections, and pollution too,” said Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, member of Nagpur District Covid-19 Task Force. In this calendar year, initially the civic cops had penalized approximately 125 citizens daily for not wearing mask. In January, as many 3,920 citizens were fined (Rs19.60 lakh fine recovered), February (4,241 penalized and Rs21.20 lakh recovered). The data of both Covid-19 cases and people fined for not wearing mask started crumbling from July. The Covid cases reported in the district were 2,833, while the NDS had penalized 792 citizens for violating mask must rule. In October 2021, the NDS caught 897 citizens without mask. Since then, the cases of penalizing citizens without mask had never crossed even 1,000 a month. In May, 408 citizens were penalized, while it was 465 in June. Deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Bhagat admitted the civic cops are going slow in penalizing citizens violating Covid-19 guidelines. “I will ask the NDS team to intensify the drive against violators of Covid-19 protocols,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man ‘jumps bail’, surety gets time from court to look for accused||Mumbai: In a relief to a man who stood surety for an accused who allegedly jumped bail in a 2009 financial fraud and corruption case, the special CBI court has granted him time until December 1 to find the accused and bring him before the court to stand trial. The man had stood surety for the accused in 2012 for a sum of Rs 50,000. As the accused, Dilip Joshi, remained untraceable, a warrant was issued against him and later a notice was also sent to the surety. While the prosecution had opposed the surety, Kailash Wankhede’s plea for more time, special CBI judge MR Purwar said that in response to the notice, he had duly appeared in court. “It shows willingness on his part to produce the accused before the court. However, according to him some more time is necessary in order to search and produce the accused before the court. Considering the prevailing facts and circumstances and present scenario I am inclined to allow the prayer,” the court said. A surety’s bond could either be attached or subsequently forfeited if the accused remains untraceable. The prosecution had opposed Wankhede’s plea and contended that it is the duty of the surety to keep track of the accused and to produce him in court as he has executed surety bond. In 2011, the accused was released on conditional bail. He partly deposited Rs 25,000 as cash security. He later violated bail conditions and the amount was forfeited. A non-bailable warrant and proclamation was issued against him. In February 2012, the accused was produced in court and sent to judicial custody. Again, he applied for bail. He was directed to be released on bail on furnishing solvent surety of Rs 1 lakh besides cash security of the same amount. The accused deposited the cash surety and following a plea, the court allowed him to furnish one or more solvent sureties of Rs 50,000. He had to deposit additional cash security of Rs 50,000. Wankhede presented himself as his surety. When the accused failed to appear in court, a bailable warrant was issued to the accused and a notice sent to Wankhede. On September 22, Wankhede’s lawyer came before the court. On October 6, Wankhede said he wanted to bring the accused forward and sought time. The court granted time. On Saturday, again Wankhede moved another plea stating that he had looked for the accused but failed. He said that since he fell in the interim, he did not get time for the search. He sought another month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-jumps-bail-surety-gets-time-from-court-to-look-for-accused/articleshow/87474056.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Reviewing the Covid situation in two talukas of Niphad and Yeola, Bhujbal, who is also the state food and civil supplies and consumer protection minister, on Sunday said the wave of infection in several countries around the world was a reminder that Covid infection was far from over and the community need to take protective measures to ensure infection and transmission is at the lowest. “It is important to protect people from infection and best way is to get vaccinated.

---||Pune||Koregaon Bhima inquiry panel suspends ‘all hearing’ over accommodation in Mumbai||Pune: The Koregaon Bhima Inquiry Commission has written to the state suspending “all future hearing” (in Mumbai and Pune) till the government provides suitable accommodation in Mumbai. Since June this year, the commission has been pursuing with the state government the issue of having a more spacious premises where the hearing can be held by observing Covid safety norms. “The present premises in Mumbai have been provided by the State Information Commission office. But it is not sufficient to accommodate the kind of rush expected at the future proceeding (November 8 to 12) involving some VVIP witnesses,” the commission’s lawyer, Ashish Satpute, told TOI on Monday. After repeated letters and emails, the two-member commission, headed by Justice J N Patel (Retd), had given an ultimatum at its last meeting with the secretary, home (special), on October 28 to provide a suitable accommodation or else there is no other option but to suspend the hearing. According to the letter dated October 31, sent by the commission’s secretary, V V Palnitkar, to the state chief secretary, the additional chief secretary (home) and the principal secretary, home (Special 2), the panel had sought a suitable accommodation like the Sahyadri government guest house or the Yashwantrao Chavan auditorium or any other suitable place near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. The letter cited the earlier two communications on June 21 and October 23, besides, a couple of e-mails, and stated that the commission chairman, Justice Patel, had made a specific request to the home secretary to take up the matter with the state chief minister. “It was also made clear that if suitable accommodation was not provided till October 29, the commission would suspend its hearing schedules,” the letter added. The then government under Devendra Fadnavis set up the inquiry commission in the wake of the January 1, 2018, violence at Koregaon Bhima where thousands of Dalit community members had gathered as part of the Koregaon Bhima Shaurya Divas Abhiyaan to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle between the British and the Peshwas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/koregaon-bhima-inquiry-panel-suspends-all-hearing-over-accommodation-in-mumbai/articleshow/87473206.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Police ban sky lanterns close to airport, stay vigilant||Kolkata: Apprehensive over the increased use of sky lanterns during Diwali and Kali puja this year — following Supreme Court allowing green crackers — Bidhannagar Commissionerate banned sky lanterns within a 10 km radius of the airport including several neighborhoods like Birati, Madhyamgram and Dum Dum. “A notification regarding the same has been issued by the CP Bidhannagar. Police stations have been briefed for implementation,” said Surya Pratap Yadav, deputy commissioner (headquarters) of Bidhannagar City Police. “Last year, people were not in a mood to celebrate, and despite the firecracker ban, the use of sky lanterns was limited. That is not the case this year. For want of anything else to celebrate, people may take to releasing sky lanterns,” an airline official warned. Controllers manning the ATC tower at the airport will be vigilant about sky lanterns and immediately report it to the Airport Operations Control Centre (AOCC) for relaying the information to Bidhannagar Police. Kolkata Airport authorities had written to the Bidhannagar Commissionerate about the threat posed by sky lanterns — that rise to a height of 3,000ft — to aircraft, particularly around the approach funnel over Lake Town, Salt Lake and New Town. “If lanterns get sucked into the aircraft engine, the thin wires that form the structure can cause major damage,” an airline engineer pointed out. Sources in Bidhannagar Commissionerate said raids have already started to seize sky lanterns. On Monday more than 100kgs of banned firecrackers were seized. “Sky lanterns can cause fire incidents within airport as oil companies have fuel storage depots in the premises,” said a senior police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-ban-sky-lanterns-close-to-airport-stay-vigilant/articleshow/87473205.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The move is also aimed at easing snarls caused by the traffic spilling over from the Chakan-Talegaon and Chakan-Shikrapur state highways. The recent rains have left these highways in a poor state and the reopening of companies in the industrial belt around Chakan has led to an increase in heavy and industrial vehicle movement. This has been causing congestion during peak morning and evening hours, police said. The issue was discussed on Sunday at a meeting involving Shirur MP Amol Kolhe, Chakan industrial body representatives, and officials from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Public Works Department (PWD), which maintain the highways. Assistant commissioner of police (Chakan zone) Prerna Katte said, “About 30,000-40,000 heavy vehicles ply on these two narrow stretches daily. Most of them are 20-30-wheeler trucks. Gaping potholes have developed during the monsoon have made matters worse,” Katte said. “We have decided to carry out the necessary repairs to both stretches. Our team surveyed these roads on Monday,” he said, adding they were preparing a long-term solution for Chakan-Talegaon road. Dilip Batwal, secretary of Federation of Chakan Industry, said they have for long sought a traffic management plan. “This will certainly reduce traffic congestion on these roads. Each day, thousands of industrial employees are stuck in traffic at least for an hour. We have urged companies to prepare their schedule as per these changes,” he said. Inspector Sunil Godse of the Chakan traffic division said they have deployed personnel at key junctions to manage vehicular flow, “We are working in tandem with NHAI and industrial bodies to mitigate the traffic congestion,” Godse said. Meanwhile, a section of transporters and drivers have sought a dedicated parking zone for heavy vehicles. “This will eliminate roadside parking, which takes up a lot of space,” said Rahul Alhat, a transporter. Ganesh Bhadale, a driver, said the authorities could consider widening the Chakan-Talegaon Dabhade and Chakan-Shikrapur roads. “The current width is inadequate and not suitable for industrial vehicles,” he said. Shirur MP Kolhe could not be reached for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-restrict-heavy-vehicle-traffic-in-chakan-from-today/articleshow/87473200.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand records over 470 % rain surplus in October||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand recorded 474% surplus rainfall in October, mainly due to the 'unprecedented' heavy rain spell across the state on October 18 and 19, the regional meteorological centre said on Monday. According to the Met office, the Himalayan state received 203.2 mm rainfall against the normal of 35.3 mm in October. The state had registered a 99% rain deficit in October 2020 when just 0.1 mm rainfall was recorded against the normal of 35.3 mm, while in 2019, the deficit was 9%. "October usually remains a dry month. However, this time around, very heavy rainfall occurred continuously for 48 hours," said Bikram Singh, director of the Met office. Among the 13 districts, Bageshwar and Almora registered the maximum rainfall of 1,139% and 1,035% respectively. Meanwhile, Nainital district — which was the worst-hit in the heavy rain episode — recorded 831% surplus rainfall in October. In a record, the district received 535 mm rainfall in just 24 hours on October 19. Subsequently, Nainital town got cut off from the rest of the state for over two days. Before this, Nainital had received 313 mm rainfall on September 15, 1957. According to government data, at least 79 people were killed and 24 others sustained injuries in rain-related incidents that took place in different parts of the state on October 18 and 19. Besides, the search for the three people — who went missing as a consequence of rain-triggered occurrences — is still ongoing. After the rain spells, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had said that three days of incessant rainfall in the state caused damages to the tune of Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 crore. The official estimate of the damage is still awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/due-to-unprecedented-48-hours-heavy-rain-spell-uttarakhand-records-over-470-rain-surplus-in-october/articleshow/87472336.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Pune||Loud fire crackers cause increase in lost pets: Activists||Pune: Animal activists have taken to social media to explain the detrimental effects that loud fire crackers have on dogs and cats, in order to encourage people to celebrate Diwali in a more mindful manner. “In the last five days, over 15 dogs have ran away due to the sound of crackers. In Wakkad, we have a close-knit group who works for animal welfare and we keep an eye out for any new dog spotted in the area. We have started putting up posters in places such as paan shops, medical shops, and ATMs with messages on how to celebrate while being sensitive to animals that coexist in our space,” said activist Anita Shetty, founder of Wakad Animal Rescue Group. She cited an example of how a dog ran away from her society due to the sound of crackers and found refuge in a nearby medical shop. “Shivering profusely, he refused to come out of the shop. After much coaxing, I carried him home,” she added. Surashree Deshpande, animal activist, said, “Every Diwali, there is a surge in the number of pets reported missing. While sometimes they are found, many times they run out on the street and traffic, or get disoriented and lose their way home.” Bhairavi Dumale, resident of Sinhagad Road, has five dogs. “My dogs get so anxious with loud sounds they hide under the bed or in dark corners. The worst is they stop eating overanxiety.” Chinthana Gopinath, a rescuer, said, “The situation is worse for strays. You can coax pets by being careful. But if stray dogs are brought home, it is against their instinct to live in closed spaces. Disoriented and distressed, they end up running frantically and get displaced, usually finding themselves in danger.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/loud-fire-crackers-cause-increase-in-lost-pets-activists/articleshow/87473209.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: State’s Oct GST collection 2nd highest this yr||Mumbai: Maharashtra’s GST collections soared in October, registering a growth of almost 17% over the previous month. Collections were Rs 19,355 crore, the second-highest figure this year after April. Data shows the October collections were Rs 2,771 crore higher than September’s Rs 16,584 crore. Indeed, the October GST revenue in the state is 23% higher than it was in October 2020. GST is a consumption-based tax and is an indicator of economic activity. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country and it is the main revenue earner for the state government. GST revenues reflect transactions made in the previous month. Officials say the rise in collections reflects not just the onset of the festive season, but also the release of pent-up demand with the lifting of lockdown-like restrictions. “Since Covid-19 cases are down, the state started significantly lifting restrictions on movement. This allowed people to travel and shop more freely and there was a release of pent-up demand. That’s why the figures have shot up,” said a senior official. The data also shows the GST collection from April-September this year is 46.4% higher than the same period last year. During April-October in 2020, collections were Rs 81,499 crore while this year they were Rs 1,19,313. This is a rise of 37,814 crore. Last year, the national lockdown was very stringent with most sectors, barring agriculture, closed. During the state lockdown in April and May, agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services were allowed to stay open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-states-oct-gst-collection-2nd-highest-this-yr/articleshow/87474066.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Aurangabad||Key accused robbed bank to repay loan; 3rd man surrenders||Aurangabad: The third accused in the Jalna bank heist case — in which Rs 24 lakh in cash and gold ornaments worth Rs 3.5 crore were stolen — surrendered before Beed’s Gevrai police station on Monday morning. The arrested accused has been identified as Charan Pawar. He surrendered before Gevrai police station’s assistant inspector Sandeep Kale. Subsequently, he was taken on record by the Beed police and was then handed over to the Gondi police station of Jalna district. The investigation in the case has revealed that the key accused, a furniture trader named Abdul Muqeed Kasam, had decided to rob the bank to repay a debt of Rs 5 lakh. Muqeed did not have the money to purchase a firearm, so he took Rs 1 lakh from a private moneylender at an exorbitant 40% rate of interest and purchased the firearm for Rs 65, 000 from a suspect (who is yet to be arrested). The armed robbery by three masked men, committed in a span of seven minutes, took place at the Buldhana urban cooperative bank’s Shahgad branch on the Solapur-Dhule national highway, during the day on Thursday. In a joint action carried out by the two district police teams, accused Muqeed and Sandeep Solunke, a waiter from Majalgaon, were arrested on Saturday, and cash of Rs 9.5 lakh and gold ornaments worth Rs 3.4 crore were recovered. Gondi police station inspector Shitalkumar Ballal said, “The furniture trader was in debt and was under tremendous pressure to repay the money. The second accused (Solunke) dreamt of visiting hotels as a customer, instead of working as a waiter and being abused by customers.” The officer said the suspects have confessed to making three futile attempts to rob a bank. Each time in the past, despite reaching the bank’s entrance, they had failed to muster the courage to actually commit the robbery. The officer said Pawar's exact role and the motive to become involved in the robbery will come to the fore only after interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/key-accused-robbed-bank-to-repay-loan-3rd-man-surrenders/articleshow/87471505.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu to seek payment banking licence, could be first state to get it||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government is planning to seek a ‘payment bank licence’ soon from the Reserve Bank of India to help it efficiently manage its funds and effectively monitor its disbursal, while implementing welfare measures for the needy. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, Tamil Nadu minister for finance and human resources management, told reporters on Monday that the state could become the first to get such a licence. “But prior to that, we have to create necessary infrastructure and link the sub-treasuries. It will not take five years to get it. Maybe a few months from when we put up the papers,” Thiaga Rajan said. The finance minister had stressed on the need, while presenting the revised budget on August 13 this year, for linking the 250-odd sub-treasuries for effective monitoring of disbursal and remittances. But the key challenges include creating the required infrastructure and training the people. Meanwhile, a special task force, established by the department of finance and headed by Reeta Harish, special secretary, finance, has tracked and recovered Rs 1,946.3 crore, lying idle in various accounts of different departments, that can be immediately remitted back to the government’s account. These are money that have been accounted for by the state exchequer as spent after being allotted for various schemes, but not spent due to closure of schemes or inefficient implementation at lower level of the government machinery. They were actually residing in some other accounts of the government, away from the purview of accounting and auditing systems. “This is only a trailer. With much more data to be collected and collated by the task force, we expect to track and recover several times more of the money recovered so far. It will be ‘multiple X’ of what has been recovered. This gives me the confidence that we, under the guidance of our chief minister (M K Stalin), would be able to fulfil all the poll promises much earlier than expected,” Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said. In order to prevent recurrence of such instances of idle non-utilisation of funds in the future, direct disbursal of funds from the government treasury to the ultimate beneficiaries will be soon done through an Integrated Financial and Human Resources Management System (IFHRMS). The state government is also working on a ‘data purity’ project to ensure state government doles reach the hands of only those who deserve it. “By undertaking such initiatives, we are not curtailing the disbursal of funds for ‘old age pension’ or PDS card holders, but are only monitoring it to make it more effective. Efficient disbursal will enable us to offer assistance to more deserving people, who need financial assistance. We are targeting to enable at least 10% more deserving people get the assistance in every district,” he said. Turning his attention to the state’s finances, Thiaga Rajan expressed confidence that he will be able to reduce “revenue deficit” for the first time in seven years. “It is not an easy task. We will do better and I guarantee you,” he said. “We have borrowed Rs 10,000 crore lesser than last year and have spent Rs 13,000 crore on capital expenditure to enhance economic growth. Though the indications on the revenue front is fairly good, from August this year, the actual numbers indicate that the economy is still in the 2019-20 level,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-to-seek-payment-banking-licence-could-be-1st-state-to-get-it/articleshow/87474069.cms||D Govardan
---||Kolkata||PCB red-signals fireworks made in West Bengal, says none has green stamp||KOLKATA: The Supreme Court order on Tuesday, which allowed the sale and purchase of green firecrackers during Kali Puja-Diwali, Chhath and Jagaddhatri Puja, brought relief to the fireworks industry but police and and the state pollution board officials are now faced with the Herculean task of ensuring only permitted crackers are used. The Supreme Court as well as the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) made it clear that only fireworks certified by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) would be considered green, and hence, permitted during the festivals. But members of the state fireworks association conceded none of the crackers manufactured in Bengal was certified by NEERI. They, however, claimed most followed the parameters set for the non-polluting tag. Burrabazar Fireworks Traders’ Association joint secretary Santanu Dutta said sparklers, flowerpots, charkis, rockets, shells and some other varieties of fireworks, manufactured following the SC order, would be available in the market. “Fireworks units in Bengal have not been able to acquire the green cracker logo and code from NEERI due to financial constraints. But most manufacturers have reduced the content of barium, the chemical considered most polluting, by nearly 60%-70%,” he claimed. Not only no firecracker manufacturing unit in Bengal makes NEERI-approved products, most factories here are functioning without a licence as they have not been renewed since last year. TimesViewAir pollution has been shown to have a direct impact on vulnerability to serious Covid infections. So implementation of norms this season must keep two things in mind: ensuring Covid-appropriate celebrations and keeping environmental pollution low. Responsible behaviour from citizens will be the key.WBPCB officials pointed out only 869 manufacturers in India produced green crackers and none existed in Bengal. “All green fireworks are certified by CSIR-NEERI or NABL-accredited labs and each of those packets has a unique logo and a QR code. One can scan the code with the NEERI app to ascertain its authenticity. So among the sellers, only a few will be able to sell a handful of genuine green fireworks,” an official said. Green fireworks were made with smaller size of shell to have reduced usage of raw materials of uniform, acceptable quality and additives, as dust suppressants, to reduce emissions with specific reference to particulate matter (PM), said a WBPCB scientist. It led to at least 30% reduction of PM and 10% gaseous emission, he added. Sabuj Mancha convenor Naba Dutta expressed fears of polluting fireworks being passed off as green ones. “The state must ensure polluting fireworks aren’t used,” he said. Pointing out they would work in close coordination with PCB, police assured that all cops had been asked to download the NEERI app so that they could scan fireworks. “We have been told to look for the logos of CSIR-NEERI and Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation and then check the authenticity by scanning the QR code. As Bengal does not have any green firecracker manufacturer, we will check the source to filter out the fake crackers,” said an officer. Environmentalist Subhas Datta said fireworks that displayed lights had more harmful chemicals than that in noisy ones. “We need to be more conscious about the environment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pcb-red-signals-fireworks-made-in-bengal-says-none-has-green-stamp/articleshow/87473216.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 13-month-old ATM fraud case solved||KOLKATA: The arrest of the ATM mastermind Saubeer Banerjee alias Sk Shahid Alam by Tollygunge Police last Saturday has now led cops to solve other shoulder surfing cases inside ATMs, one of which is over 13-month-old. On Monday, Tollygunge Police told Biswanath Dey Roy (69), retired engineer, that Banerjee had duped him of over Rs 6 lakh. The money was the engineer’s savings after over 40 years of service at multiple tyre factories. “Roy was Banerjee’s first victim in a crime spree that saw multiple senior citizens lose their hard earned money. So far, we have found him involved in four cases in Netaji Nagar-Tollygunge-Lake-Kasba area,” a senior officer said. He is also under scanner in 18 other cases. Police got leads from a few shops located in and around the Dhakuria-Lake-Golpark areas after studying hours of CCTV footage. The sleuths said the accused operated from the Durgapur-Raniganj belt too. “I was heartbroken when I lost the money. Rs 13 was all that was left in my account. The case was eventually taken up by the anti-bank fraud section. On Monday, when the cops showed me the photograph of the accused, I instantly recognized him,” said Roy. “I suspect my ATM card was swapped with anothercard at a boutique where I was shopping on October 19 last year,” added Roy. According to the police team technical surveillance and source information helped them nab the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/13-month-old-atm-fraud-case-solved/articleshow/87473215.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Handicap youth threatens minister Rajesh Tope after health dept exam fiasco||NAGPUR: Controversies surrounding the exam for the Group D posts of the health department refuse to die. After an alleged paper leak on social media, a physically challenged youth has rushed a letter to health minister Rajesh Tope to either give him a job or grant permission to die by suicide. He also has made a video in this regard. Santosh Phad, the son of a poor farmer from Nanded, who claims disability in one hand and leg, was shocked after he and another aspirant were allotted the same roll number for the exam held on Sunday across the state for filling up of about 6,205 vacancies, including those of Class C. Phad was allotted Dr Ambedkar College as the exam centre. The invigilators at the college told both the aspirants to appear for the paper and assured to take up the issue with health department officials later. The exams have been marred by controversy ever since they were announced by the government to fill up vacant posts across government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCH) in Maharashtra, in the aftermath of the pandemic. Earlier, the papers for both Class C and D were scheduled on September 25 and 26, but due to lack of preparations, Tope was forced to defer them. The decision sparked a tug of war with the opposition as BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar demanded the minister’s resignation over creating confusion among students. The aspirants, too, cried foul as they were allotted centres far off from their native places, like Phad, who came all the way from Nanded to the city on Sunday morning by traveling overnight. After Sunday’s exam, there was news across the media of an alleged paper leak on What’sApp, which was later denied by the Maharashtra public health department officials. Phad, who works part time in a library to support his family and education at his native place in Mahur, said he had been preparing for a job for the last many years and was hopeful of cracking the exam. The poor youth, who had to take a loan for buying tickets for coming to Nagpur, asked Tope whose marks would be taken into account as he and another aspirant had the same roll number. “As there was no place for sleeping at night at Nagpur, I decided to travel overnight. But when such things happen, it causes a lot of mental agony. Even my parents are worried. Now, I have no where to go rather than commit suicide. For how long will I continue to depend on my parents?” he asked angrily, adding that even the news of the paper leak had caused him trauma as he had sincerely appeared for the paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/handicap-youth-threatens-tope-after-health-dept-exam-fiasco/articleshow/87474071.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Aurangabad||Latur SP orders disciplinary action against constable||Aurangabad: Latur superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale has ordered disciplinary action against a police constable after he posted an objectionable video on social media groups meant for the Latur police’s official communication. Constable Amit Lahane, a 33-year-old currently posted with the Charlie squad, simultaneously posted an over six-minute-long video with ‘communally charged misleading content’, in the ‘Quick Response Charlie’ and other groups of the Latur police on Thursday morning. Quick Response Charlie group comprises senior police officers of the district and constables from 10 police stations who are responsible for bike patrol. The group is used to ensure quick response to any alert or emergency call received by police in Latur town. Pingale said, “Such acts are unacceptable and unbecoming of a policeman. We have ordered disciplinary action against the constable so that it sends out a strong message that any act showing unprofessionalism, bias, communal and corrupt approach will not be tolerated.” An officer privy to the departmental inquiry said that about 50 minutes after the constable posted the video, the group admin and Charlie squad in-charge PSI Kamlakar Kodre posted a message appealing to all the group members to not post any irrelevant posts in the group. However, constable Lahane refrained from deleting the post. Sources said that following the latest incident, Latur SP has issued an ultimatum asking the policemen to abstain from committing acts that may bring a bad name to the police. A senior police officer recalled that earlier too a constable from Latur police was suspended by the then superintendent of police Rajendra Mane after he (the constable) had posted communally charged, misleading videos and posts in different groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-sp-orders-disciplinary-action-against-constable/articleshow/87471515.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The 145-ft pandal at Sreebhumi in Lake Town designed like the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, had attracted huge crowds and forced police to stop revellers from entering the nearby lanes from Nabami. Justice Prasad asked the state why crowds were allowed in the pandals when there was a court order barring entry. Sabyasachi Chatterjee, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner, said the PIL would be listed on Tuesday or Wednesday.

---||Delhi||Delhi may see its first 'very poor' day around Diwali||NEW DELHI: The city’s air quality, which has been hovering in the poor category for the past six days, is likely to turn very poor around Diwali, which will be celebrated on November 4. Experts said the air quality was likely to start deteriorating on the Diwali day due to stubble burning and winter inversion and, if banned firecrackers were burnt, it might get badly impacted. Data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which has been measuring the air quality index (AQI) since 2015, showed 2016 had the most polluted Diwali with a reading of 431 and 445 on the day after. Delhi’s 2020 Diwali was the worst since 2016 as the festival was observed in mid-November with unfavourable meteorological conditions. AQI, which was severe at 414 on Diwali, increased to 435 the next day. In 2019, an AQI of 337 — very poor — was recorded on Diwali, which stayed in the same category at 368 the next day. A bigger spike was seen in 2018 when AQI rose from 281 — poor — on Diwali to 390 — very poor — the next day mainly due to firecrackers. Similarly, AQI deteriorated from very poor to severe in 2017, despite the festival falling in October. Experts said Delhi had not recorded a very poor air day this winter, but the air quality might turn worse during Diwali. SAFAR’s founder project director, Gufran Beig, said, “The wind direction is likely to change from easterly to northwesterly on November 4, making it favourable for transportation of pollutants released by stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi. High local wind speed is currently allowing dispersion of pollutants, but calm wind conditions are expected from that evening.” The Diwali pollution blows up when the bursting of firecrackers, calm wind and colder nights are combined with stubble burning, he added. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, “There is an additional concern this time that stubble burning may get concentrated within a shorter time frame and contribute to the first smog episode during Diwali.” Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory, said AQI might reach around 350 on Diwali. “The other triggering factor is the atmospheric thermal boundary layer, which is generally low due to short day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-may-see-its-first-very-poor-day-around-diwali/articleshow/87474074.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The statements made by Patil along with NCP leader and labour minister Hasan Mushrif directly hinted that the former will be the candidate of the Congress-NCP alliance. Patil — while speaking at Kagal, the home turf of Mushrif — said he hopes that all corporators of Kagal town council will vote for him in the MLC election. In 2015, Patil had won the MLC election by defeating Congress rebel and BJP-backed candidate Mahadevrao Mahadik by a slender margin of 68 votes. Mushrif said this time there is no strong opponent against Patil. “He (Patil) is winning the election. BJP has to field a candidate, but they do not have any candidate to contest the election. The election will be a cakewalk for Patil,” he said. The local body corporators and members of zilla parishad vote for the MLC election. During the 2015 election, Patil had recieved support of 220 elected members of the local bodies, while Mahadik had received 152 votes. According to sources, Mahadik is once again likely to give the election a try, but the recent defeats of the BJP has put him on the backfoot. However, in political circles, it is said that Mahadik has the acumen to turn the tide in his favour at the last moment and therefore it is unlikely that Patil will be spared by his political opponents. It is also likely that the MLC election will be postponed as the elections for several local bodies have been withheld due to the pandemic for last two years. Though whatever claims are being made by the leaders, success of parties in civic body elections is key for MLC elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satej-patil-to-be-cong-ncp-candidate-for-mlc-election/articleshow/87471518.cms||---

---||Goa||Benaulim, Velim locals upset over unscheduled power cuts||COLVA: Unscheduled power outages since the past two day across Benaulim and Velim constituencies, lasting nearly three to five hours long, are greatly inconveniencing locals, affecting businesses, those working from home, students attending online classes and tuitions and those answering board examinations. Sources said that most of the hotels across the Cavelossim and Varca stretch have been operating on generators since Sunday, due to the disruption. Officials from the electricity department have blamed the outages on faulty circuits and snapping of transmission lines. Velim assistant engineer Jorge Fernandes said that thunder and lightning on Sunday evening resulted in power circuits developing faults. Due to this, they had to organise a power shut down to rectify the problem. Meanwhile, N Moraes, assistant engineer attached to the Benaulim sub-station said that due to a faulty circuit there, a switch-over could not be done to restore power supply to Carmona sub-station when supply from the Velim sub-station was disrupted. The Velim power station supplies power to Carmona sub-station, which in turns electrifies the coastal villages of Cavelossim, Carmona, Orlim and partly Varca. The Benaulim sub-station covers the villages of Colva, Betalbatim, Benaulim and the rest of Varca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/benaulim-velim-locals-upset-over-unscheduled-power-cuts/articleshow/87474111.cms||---

He also disputed claims that the state exchequer was not empty. “How will the stock of Punjab’s people improve? Does anyone ask? There are two ways – either you give a lollipop in the last two months, this free, that free, offer them the stars after five years of political slugfest. Where will you give it? That’s the question that you should ask. Is forming the government, to grab power, the only objective in Punjab? By lying to people, making 500 promises or is it to ensure welfare of the people? For welfare you need a roadmap. Politics is no longer a mission but a profession. The image of the ugly politician must be erased. That is the mission of my life. People should say in Amritsar that they want their children to be honest politicians,” said Sidhu. He was speaking at the function for formation of Sanyukt Hindu Mahasabha, Punjab. He added, “Whoever tells you that the exchequer of the state is not empty is lying to you. If that is true then give Rs 50,000 salary to the ETT teachers. Do you have surplus money to pay them? Pay the contractual employees. That is what that exchequer is meant for. It should be for the last man in the queue and not for those indulging in selling sand and liquor.” Chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had claimed recently that it was wrong to say that the state exchequer was empty. Sidhu added, “There is a debt of Rs 5 lakh crore on Punjab. Municipal corporations and rest houses have been mortgaged by these chief ministers. It is the general public that will have to pay back the debt. The direct taxes are so high, and petrol and diesel are so costly. Indirect taxes are Rs 50,000 crore in this state that you people pay.” “That is why wherever there is a question of compromise, I reject any position so that I don’t lose your trust. I am willing to lose everything since it is a ‘dharamyudh’ for me. I would continue to tell people that they should vote on agenda and not on lollipops,” he said. “Will you give voters on false promises and Diwali gifts or will you ask what the roadmap is to take Punjab out of this mess,” he asked. He announced that he will not take the second pension if he wins again in the elections, nor will his wife. Referring to those present on the occasion, he said, “My mother was a Hindu and father a Gur Sikh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-slams-lollipop-to-voters-calls-exchequer-not-empty-claims-a-lie/articleshow/87474107.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Light at tunnel’s end: Firecracker sellers in Kolkata shift to candles, diyas||KOLKATA: Desperation has prompted them to switch to selling candles, diyas, battery-operated Chinese lights, idols and other Diwali items. On Monday, however, when they tried to find out if they could procure green crackers and sell them alongside these, most manufacturers said green crackers had to be procured from outside the state and there was no time for that. The names and posters on several stalls still advertised firecrackers, but the counters only held diyas and candles. All stalls at Janbazar, Free School Street, Chandni Chowk and Hati Bagan have changed wares. “We had stocked up on firecrackers, but the blanket ban had forced us to arrange for alternatives so that we could somehow survive. We will have a huge problem returning the stock too,” said Biman Santra of Bijoli Baji Ghar at Janbazar. Sellers from Champahati and Nungi are now supplying candles, diyas and electronic lights. “The moment we heard about the Supreme Court relaxations, we started inquiring about green crackers, but there is hardly any supply. There is no clarity on what is green and what is not,” said Subol Dhara, who owns a stall at Burrabazar. A member of Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association said all big dealers and sellers in the city have only 5% to 10% green crackers among the total cache of fireworks in stock. “Very few sellers have NEERI-approved green crackers. But we are awaiting the detailed SC order and the subsequent order from Nabanna or Lalbazar before initiating sale of those from Tuesday,” said joint secretary Santanu Dutta. Dhruv Narula, spokesperson of Sara Bangla Atasbazi Unnayan Samiti, said, “It was a huge moral victory. But there is no time to procure green crackers now because they come from Tamil Nadu.” Environmentalists, however, said lack of a checking mechanism for green crackers — except for scanning a QR code — would make it difficult to contain non-green ones. Most sellers said they will be selling only LED lights, sky lanterns and diyas. “Our Chennai counterparts said there was hardly any supply of green crackers. The cost of a single green cracker is quite high because of the demand-supply gap,” Arun Sishodia, a cracker trader at Old China Bazar. “We are sending fireworks artisans to Tamil Nadu. Fourteen artisans from Nungi and 17 from Champahati will go in the second week of November. They will be trained for 12 days and each participant will be certified by NEERI on low-emission, low-decibel fireworks,” said Babla Roy, general secretary of the Fireworks Development Organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/light-at-tunnels-end-firecracker-sellers-shift-to-candles-diyas/articleshow/87473229.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While Geethanjali was ranked 23rd nationally, Pravin was ranked 30th. Last year, for the same marks, TN’s Srijan got all India 8th rank. This year, 1,10,971 candidates from TN registered for the test. Trainers said students this year scored higher marks compared to previous year due to more time for preparation as the exam was postponed to September 12 following Covid-19 second wave. Geethanjali, of Green Park Coaching Centre, told TOI she could not express her happiness. “I was aiming for a rank, but did not expect first rank in the state.” The girl who prepared for nearly 18 hours a day and wrote at least 50 mock tests, said she wanted to become a surgeon. “I also have another idea. To become an IAS or IPS officer after pursuing civil service examinations after completing my MBBS.” she added. Her father C Anbarasu is a poultry farmer, mother A Sumathi a home maker, while her sister S A Sangamithra is a final year MBBS student at Dharmapuri government medical college. Pravin, from the same coaching centre, wants to become a cardiologist. “Coaching and model examinations held at the coaching centre helped me a lot,” he said. His father M Madeshwaran rents material for construction work, while his mother M Jaya is a home maker. Hayagrivas M B of Mogappair in Chennai, who secured 705 of 720 and got all India 56th rank, said he expected better marks. The student of Velammal Vidyalaya in Mel Ayanambakkam said, “I want to join either AIIMS in New Delhi or Jipmer in Pondicherry.” Neya Chander, a city student who got 701 marks and got AIR 118th rank, said that though the paper was lengthy, conceptually, the question paper was not very difficult. “Time management was key,” she said, adding that she is yet to decide on the college to join. Neya Chander trained in Allen Career Institute. Sourav Mondal, head, FIITJEE (Medical), Tamil Nadu and Kerala, said the number of students scoring above 600 marks went up compared to previous year. “I think the cut-off marks will increase.” Santosh Singh, academic head of Chennai-based Allen Career Institute, said a good number of students in Chennai and suburbs could get into government medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/2-namakkal-students-score-710-of-720-marks-in-neet/articleshow/87474094.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Civic body invites EoI from architects for Vilappilsala mini township||Thiruvananthapuram: In a move aimed at making fruitful use of the extensive land at Vilappilsala, the city corporation has invited expression of interest (EoI) from a panel of architectural firms to design a mini township in the area. Ever since mass protests forced the closure of a waste treatment plant at Vilappilsala in 2011, the corporation has been trying out various plans to make good use of the land. As per the latest proposal, 36 acres of land is available for the township. The architectural firms have to design the township in such a way that spots are needed to be identified for urban forest, apartments, convention centre, residential cum training centre, a warehouse and a vehicle yard for abandoned ones. A topographic survey will be conducted prior to the design of township. Separate detailed project reports will be prepared for each project and based on fund availability, each project will be implemented in a phased manner. Indoor game facilities and residential facilities for technological university are also being planned in the township. In 2017, the budget envisaged a proposal for establishing an amusement park at Vilappilsala on build operate and transfer mode at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The project, however, did not take off. Officials said the land owned by the corporation at Vilappilsala is of good value and if a project could be implemented there, it could have multiple advantages. Since the closure of the waste treatment plant, local residents have viewed the corporation’s every move with scepticism. Even when corporation officials tried to transport cows to Vilappilsala factory premises, the neighbouring residents sternly objected to the move. The civic body desperately needs an image makeover for Vilappilsala. The CAG report recently tabled in the assembly has flagged the failure on the part of the city corporation to safeguard blasted rubble obtained from the Vilappilsala solid waste management project which resulted in loss of Rs 31.02 lakh. The corporation had awarded the work of ‘sanitary landfill at Vilappilsala - preparation of land fill site’ related to solid waste management project to a private firm for an agreed amount of Rs 6.66 crore. The agreement was executed in March 2010 with the date of completion in November 2010. The work consisted of six components. Due to public agitation, the government had to foreclose the project in December 2011. The contractor had executed site-development works partially and the total value of work done was calculated as Rs 1.31 crore. Final payment of Rs 75 lakh, including retention money was made in March 2017. As per the agreement, for executing the component ‘site development works’, a quantity of 3,100 m3 hard rock was to be blasted for an agreed rate of Rs 6,109 per 10 m3. The CAG report says that the audit observed that though the work of blasting was done before the closure of the plant in December 2011, the measurements were recorded in the measurement book (M-Book) only in December 2014 by the officials. Scrutiny of the M-Book revealed that a quantity of 5,094.13 m3 hard rock was blasted against the agreed quantity of 3,100 m3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/civic-body-invites-eoi-from-architects-for-vilappilsala-mini-township/articleshow/87441766.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The NCSC has already issued a notice to Maharashtra government for facts on the issue to be submitted by Friday, and has also sought evidence from marriage registrar and other bodies to ascertain the facts about Wankhede’s religion. NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik has alleged that Wankhede is a Muslim who had fraudulently claimed the SC status to qualify for government service. Sampla told TOI that Wankhede submitted his caste certificate which was issued in 1995 when he joined the government service and he got married in 2006.Sampla said that according to the papers shown by the officer, he had declared himself a Hindu in the marriage register and his child was also declared a Hindu. “We are ascertaining the facts.

A final picture on how colleges make the transition will emerge by the end of this week or early next week.  Asok Mukhopadhayay, principal of Seth Anandram Jaipuria College said, “We have morning, day and evening shifts. We might call students of different shifts on alternate days. The final decision will be taken next week. We have also decided to continue with online classes for students who might not be able to come to the campus.” Madhumanjari Mandal, principal of Scottish Church College said, “We discussed several strategies today and a final decision will be taken later this week. But whatever the final plan the priority will be following the government’s Covid guidelines.” Deepali Singhee, principal of JD Birla Institute said, “For the science section we are thinking of catching up with practical classes while theory classes might continue online. For BBA and Commerce where we have a lot of students we plan to call them on alternate days. A final plan will be in place by early next week.” At Vivekananda College, authorities might split students from each semester on the basis of odd even roll numbers and call them to the campus on alternate days. “This way we will be able to maintain social distancing and all the students will get an opportunity to come to college,” said Tapan Kumar Poddar, principal of the college. Several students’ bodies have already started demanding that colleges and universities vaccinate the remaining students immediately, sanitise classrooms and arrange proper hostel facilities before reopening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-mull-various-options/articleshow/87473266.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Delhi: At 3,971, single-day farm fires touch season's peak||NEW DELHI: At 3,971, the season's highest single-day stubble burning fire count was recorded in neighbouring states on Monday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences. Before this, the highest fire count in a single day this season was 1,826 fires on Saturday, SAFAR data shows. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital was 281 in the 'poor' category on Monday. Though the count of farm fires rose from 1,734 on Sunday to 3,971 on Monday, the impact of stubble burning to Delhi's air was less. The share of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 was just 7% on Monday due to unfavourable wind direction and speed. The farm fires mostly remained low in October this year as compared with the same month in 2020, but experts said the fire count is likely to witness peak in November. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, "Due to frequent rains and delayed withdrawal of monsoon, stubble burning, which usually picks up in October, got deferred this year. Farm fires can spike soon as farmers will be in a rush to dispose of the stubble. The agencies concerned should be prepared with an emergency action plan to control fire and smog." In 2020, the highest number of single-day farm fires was recorded at 4,528 on November 6. Experts said during peak stubble burning window, the fire count is expected to go up to 3,000-4,000 a day. SAFAR, in its bulletin on Monday, said, "The air quality of Delhi is likely to remain in upper end of poor category for the next two days due to prevailing winds coming from west/south-west direction, reducing transport of emissions from stubble burning. Prevailing shallow mixing layer height reduces dispersion of pollutants."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-3971-single-day-farm-fires-touch-seasons-peak/articleshow/87474102.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Prices of leafy greens drop across Pune with arrival of fresh harvest||PUNE: Fresh arrival of harvest has caused a welcome 30-40% drop in the prices of leafy vegetables in the wholesale and retail markets across Pune after nearly three weeks of inflation. A bunch of coriander, which had sold for Rs 60-100 in the retail markets over the last two weeks, came down to Rs 20-30 (retail) and Rs6-15 (wholesale) on Monday. A similar trend was observed in the prices of other leafy vegetables as well – a bunch of fenugreek is being sold for Rs 12-20 wholesale and Rs20-30 in several retail markets. The prices of one bunch of dill (shepu) has dropped to as low as Rs6. It sold for over Rs 20 last week. Spinach is the cheapest leafy green in the market, with a bunch costing Rs 3-9 wholesale and Rs 10-15 retail. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at the Gultekdi market yard, said, “The rates have fallen due to fresh intake of all leafy vegetables. On Monday, we got over 92,000 bunches of coriander. The past few weeks, we were getting around 60,000 bunches which caused prices to soar. The prices will drop below Rs 10 per bunch only we get over 1.3 lakh bunches per day in the wholesale market. There is good demand, which is why the rates have remained high for three weeks.” However, the prices of other vegetables remained high. Potato was auctioned for as high as Rs 25 per kg on Monday at the market yard. “The prices of onion have come down, slightly by Rs 4-5 per kg. but that of potato has increased by Rs 5-6 per kg,” said Balasaheb Bibve, head of the potato and onion section at the market yard. The prices of kitchen staples like tomato, cauliflower, capsicum, and cluster beans were still high in wholesale and retail markets. “The duration of leafy vegetables’ harvest is less compared to other vegetables. As a result, vegetables like tomato, cluster beans, cauliflowers, okra, brinjal will not arrive in such large quantities, so it will take at least a few weeks for the prices of these vetegales to reduce,” a trader said. Last week, TOI had reported vegetable prices were likely remain high for a few more days. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and commission agents, who were expecting the arrival of vegetables from neighbouring states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, said the stock did not come through.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/prices-of-leafy-greens-drop-with-arrival-of-fresh-harvest/articleshow/87473255.cms||---

The accused is a resident of a village in the Hatkanangale taluka of Kolhapur district. According to the police, on Sunday morning, the minor’s mother had left for work. The girl’s father was at home with her. “However, after some time, the father noticed that the girl was not at home. Neither was she anywhere near the house nor in the bylanes where she usually played with other children,” a police officer said. “The man, along with some local youths, started searching for the girl. After a couple of hours, the girl’s body was found wrapped in a white cloth near an old burial site,” he added. Police found injury marks on the girl’s body that was sent for post mortem. It was revealed that the girl was strangled by hand. Jayashree Gaikwad, additional superintendent of police, said, “The autopsy report showed sexual abuse.

Nair, a Panvel resident, who scored 720/720 in NEET-UG and shared the top position in the country, turned 18 on Sunday. Though she was targetting the perfect score, she was not expecting to actually get it. A student of DAV Public School in Panvel, Nair will be considered as the third-ranker for the counselling round. Including the national topper, Maharashtra has two rankers — Hriday Mohite and Vaishnavi Sarda — in the top 20. NEET-UG results were announced on Monday. On Thursday, the Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to the National Testing Agency to release the results. Of 15.4 lakh students who appeared for the test, 8.7 lakh qualified nationally. Speaking to TOI, Nair said that she would want to join AIIMS, Delhi, which is the best in the country. “I have always found physics very tough and had to put in extra efforts. I relied entirely on NCERT books for my preparation,” said Nair, whose father works for a private logistics firm and mother is a computer science lecturer at a Navi Mumbai college. While her interest lies in oncology, she would explore other fields too, she said. She found this year’s NEET paper tougher than the previous years, but managed to crack it well. Previous years’ question papers and mock tests helped her in practising for the exam. “Studying online in the pandemic was no tough task. There are students who may find it difficult to understand lectures online, but the teachers were helpful and we were saving time in commuting to school and coaching class,” said Nair. Hriday Mohite, from Pune’s DAV Public School, ranked fifth with a few others but in counselling ranks 14th in the country and second in the state. The football enthusiast is the son of anaesthesiologist Dr Vishal Mohite and IT professional Trupti Mohite. “When the answer key was released, we had a feeling that he would get top marks. He has always been good at studies and has worked hard for this,” said Dr Mohite. Hriday wanted to become a doctor since his school days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-100-neet-score-for-panvel-girl-as-she-turns-eighteen/articleshow/87474136.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Pune||Citizens in Pune step out for last-minute shopping sans Covid precautions||PUNE: Eateries and stores, for both gold and garments, have been teeming with lastminute Diwali shoppers. While the season seems to be good for business, one thing missing among both the shoppers and the staffers is their adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols. With social distancing completely forgotten, shoppers and staffers can be seen with masks hanging from the chin and hardly any establishment is checking for Covid-19 vaccination certificates. People were spotted without masks at a store on Laxmi roadAshish Sikarwar, an IT professional who was out with his wife for shopping, said, “We came out to buy clothes. It is crowded everywhere. We tried to go to Laxmi Road first, but it was packed. People are behaving as if Covid-19 is no longer a threat. We then came to the Aundh-Baner area, which has less shops. But here also, people’s masks hardly cover their mouth and nose.” TimesViewThe last-minute Diwali shopping is resulting in huge crowds on city streets and even inside the shops. Several shopkeepers and buyers have thrown caution to the wind and are seen not following the Covid safety protocol. The health ministry, which plans to take a review of relaxations post Diwali, must ensure that during the festivities, people do not let their guard down.Another shopper, Raji Nair, said despite gold prices being high now, the shops had at least a 30-minute waiting time. “Till last week, only the evening hours were bad. But now, even the mornings were crowded. We have taken both jabs, but we left our parents at home due to the crowd,” Nair said. Prerna Goyal, a shopper, said people were even taking off their masks inside the shops, especially near the trial rooms. “Hardly any employee in the shops wears a mask. We went for dinner after shopping and all the tables were occupied. I hope the cases do not increase after Diwali,” she said. The laxity regarding adherence to Covid-19 safety protocols were not just limited to shops and restaurants. “Yesterday (Sunday), my son and I went up the Fergusson hill. Many cricketers on the ground were without masks, even when they were sitting on the sides and not playing. We came back and ate misal. While the restaurant board said the seating capacity was 36 and 18 could be seated, every chair was occupied. I actually counted 63 people inside. Even at some malls, they are just conducting temperature checks only,” another resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-step-out-for-last-minute-shopping-sans-covid-precautions/articleshow/87473263.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Covid-19: Post-Diwali situation review crucial, says Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the post-Diwali review of the Covid-19 situation would be crucial for any further relaxations. “The situation has to be closely watched because the state has unlocked almost all the sectors. We have been urging people to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour. We have to be cautious despite the dip in daily cases and the weekly positivity rate,” he told TOI, adding that the daily cases were currently fluctuating between 1,000 and 1,500 in the state. On the huge rush during Diwali at almost all places, the state health minister said the local authorities should keep a strict watch and ensure that there was no violation of the norms during the festivities. He said people naturally want to celebrate during the festivities, but they cannot do so throwing caution to the wind. Recently, the Centre in its daily briefing said fresh Covid cases across the country per day was below 20,000, but eight states, including Maharashtra, continued to register more daily cases. Kerala led the tally with over 7,000 cases every day, followed by Maharashtra with over 1,000 cases, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam. The back-to-back festivities — Dasara, followed by Diwali — has hit the pace of daily vaccination, too. Tope said there were enough vaccine doses and the local authorities had been urged to device new methods to ensure that all the adult beneficiaries were vaccinated at the earliest. Tope said the issue of considering the health status on the Aarogya Setu for allowing people with one dose to participate in all economic activities was still under consideration. “We are yet to discuss the same as the Centre has not allowed to reduce the gap of Covishield doses. We shall review the situation after Diwali,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/post-diwali-situation-review-crucial-tope/articleshow/87473270.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Vasu-Baras is considered to be the first day of Diwali. Srikant Jadhav, a cattle owner at Shukrawar Peth, said, “Govatsa Dwadashi is called as Vasu-Baras in Maharashtra and is considered first day of Diwali. According to the saying ‘Din din Diwali - Gayi Mhashi Owali', the Hindu families worship cow and calf on this day. Usually, people abstain from eating wheat and milk products on this day.” Jadhav said they celebrated Vasu-Baras by performing arti of our cow and her calf. Many women from the city had also gathered at our place to worship the pair and to offer 'Puran poli' food to the cow. Dr Vishwasrao Bagal from Sri Panjarpol Sanstha, Shahupuri, a shelter place for abandoned animals, said, “There are around 280 cows in our shelter home, which was started by legendary king Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj way back in 1906. Thousands of people donate food, fodder and money to take care of the animals. Today, hundreds of women came and donated fodder, jaggery and performed arti of the cows and calves.” Meanwhile, markets were flooded on Monday with people rushing to make last minute purchases like lanterns, lights, clay lamps and clothes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/festive-rush-in-markets-diwali-celebrations-begin/articleshow/87471572.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The teams led by additional commissioner Sagar Setia took action at Transport Nagar, Jalandhar Bypass, Rajpura highway, Jalandhar and Mohali.Director of investigation HPS Ghotra said, “Several inspections are going on at multiple places, including Ludhiana, Rajpura, Jalandhar and Mohali, by our teams. In Ludhiana, based on specific inputs about ferrying of unaccounted goods, the godown of a transport company was inspected at Transport Nagar, several documents were impounded and three trucks loaded with goods were detained for further verification and finalisation of tax and penalty.” He said, “In another action, inspection of a cold storage facility in Karabara, near Jalandhar Bypass, is going on as we have got leads that the company is storing goods of different persons at its unit but these are not accounted in the books of the real owners with the intention of evading tax.”Ghotra added, “In addition to these two actions, a vehicle loaded with 190 bags of tobacco was intercepted near Rajpura. It was plying without any valid documents and the case is under verification for realisation of tax and penalty. Besides, four ply and timber taxpayers from Rajpura were purchasing goods without invoice from Yamunanagar and evading taxes. Therefore, they were inspected for irregularities. The finalization of the tax and penalty will take some time for verification of stock and documents have been impounded.”Ghotra said two vehicles carrying diamond, gold and silver jewellery from Airport Road, Mohali, were intercepted by the department's team on October 27 for verification. The goods were coming from Mumbai airport through two logistics companies. The tax and penalty will be ascertained after completion of verification of goods and documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/i-t-dept-inspects-transport-firm-cold-storage-facility/articleshow/87369782.cms||Mohit Behl

The Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner, Rajesh Patil, said around 85% residents had received their first jabs in the civic limits. He said now they were focusing on vaccinating the residents in slum areas and other pockets, where the vaccination had been less. Patil said, “Through the door-to-door vaccination in the civic areas where the drive is yet to pick the pace, the unvaccinated people are getting their protection against Covid. Not only the slum areas, housing societies would also be covered under it.” The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has a target of around 17.66 lakh population in the vaccination drive. Of them, over 14 lakh have received their first jab. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s chief immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar, told TOI, “There are a few pockets where we have been told that the vaccination has not received a satisfactory response. We have informed our ward officers to look into such areas and sensitise the residents about the importance of the inoculation drive, which is free of cost.” Devkar said they were expecting a sharp drop in vaccination because of Diwali. “Once the festive season is over, the vaccination will pick up pace,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/door-to-door-drive-in-pcmc-slum-areas/articleshow/87473277.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Madras HC quashes 10.5 per cent vanniyar quota, calls it ‘discriminatory’||CHENNAI: Holding that caste-based reservation is impermissible, the Madras high court has quashed 10.5 per cent quota law for vanniyars, introduced by the AIADMK government minutes before the Election Commission announced the April 2021 assembly election. “Treating vanniyar community as a separate class from the other MBCs amounts to discrimination among same category of castes,” ruled a division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice K Murali Shankar on Monday. The court decided to quash the reservation as unconstitutional on seven grounds, which included the competency of the state to provide reservation based on caste, whether reservation can be provided without quantifiable data on population, socio-educational status and representation of the backward classes in services. Holding that the very basis of classification in the name of caste is a clear case treating equals unequally, resulting in reverse discrimination within the MBC, the judges said: “We conclude that there is no data, much less quantifiable data, available with the state before the introduction of the law, to show the three different degrees of backwardness to make three sub-categories, as mandated by Indra Sawhney case, nor there is a data to show the inadequate representation of a group.” Ticking off the micro-classification of MBCs into MBC (vanniars), MBC (DNC) and other MBCs as being wholly arbitrary, the judges said there is absolutely no acceptable reason for the division. There is no material or data to differentiate MBC(V) from other MBC as a separate class. Treating one caste — vanniakula kshatriya, including ‘vanniyar’, ‘vanniya’, ‘vannia gounder’, ‘gounder’ or ‘kander’, ‘padayachi’, ‘palli’ and ‘agnikula kshatriya’ — as separate class while treating the similar castes differently is discrimination, the judges held, adding that the impugned law categorised 6 sub-castes and 115 other castes into two sets and tried to give higher proportion of reservation to one caste and deprive the others. More importantly, referring to the union government’s constitutional 102nd amendment denuding states of the power to include castes in reserved lists, the judges said: “The Constitution (102nd Amendment) Act, 2018, came into existence on 11.08.2018 and the Constitution (105th Amendment) Act, 2021, was enacted on 19.08.2021 and whereas the impugned Act 8 of 2021 came to be enacted on 26.02.2021 and therefore, we hold that as on the date of enactment of the impugned Act, the State Legislature has no power to enact such legislation and accordingly, the State Legislature has no competency to pass the impugned Act. The state legislature has no competency to enact Tamil Nadu Special Reservation of seats in educational Institutions including Private Educational Institutions and appointments or posts in the services under the State within the Reservation for the Most Backward Classes and Denotified Communities Act, 2021”. Also, as per Article 31-B of the Constitution, until the Act placed in Ninth Schedule is amended or repealed by the competent legislature, the said Act shall continue to be in force, the court said. Therefore, without amending the 1993 Act, bringing a special legislation to provide internal reservation to vanniyar community is against the Constitutional provisions, the judges said. When counsel arguing in favour of the state law sought to highlight the fact that quashing it would put a question mark on the prospects of candidates who had already been admitted under the 10.5 per cent quota, the court said: “It has been made clear through an interim order that admissions and appointments made providing the reservation will be subject to the outcome of the pleas. Suspending the order will only complicate the issue.” The judges further recorded that ‘so far as the reservations for Muslims and arunthathiyars are concerned, the population figures are enumerated in every census and based on that, the backwardness and inadequate representation has been studied and a valid commission report has been submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/madras-hc-quashes-10-5-vanniyar-quota-calls-it-discriminatory/articleshow/87474132.cms||Sureshkumar

IMD has forecast very light to light rain, thundery activity, lightning and gusty winds in Pune during November 4-6 in the city. They said that the spells could be even moderate at isolated places in Pune district ghat areas, owing to emergence of a low pressure system over the Arabian Sea. The location of the system over Arabian Sea with its north- northwestward movement is likely to run nearly parallel to Pune district, as a result the upcoming rain spell in city areas will be at a light one, the officials said. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, told TOI, “The low pressure area over Comorin area and adjoining north Sri Lanka coast persists,which is likely to emerge into Southeast Arabian Sea during the next 48 hours. Thereafter it is likely to move northnorthwestwards and become more marked during the subsequent 48 hours.” IMD has forecast scattered rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning over south Konkan and Goa, south Madhya Maharashtra till November 5 and over Marathwada during November 3-5. Isolated heavy rainfall is also likely over Konkan & Goa on November 4-5. Kashyapi said that the cloud amount will increase over Pune during the afternoon time from November 3. “We also expect very light to light rain, with 1-2 intense spell in Pune city around November 4-6, while rainfall is likely to reduce thereafter,” he said. Kashyapi said that though November rain was unusual, it can occur especially if a system like the current one appears. “Strong easterly-south easterly winds will be bringing moisture over parts of Maharashtra during the next few days,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/light-rain-in-pune-dist-on-main-diwali-days-likely/articleshow/87473286.cms||Neha Madaan

The court posted the matter to November 15. Kejriwal, while holding a dialogue with the business community in Bathinda on October 29, had alleged that a “Jojo tax” was being extorted from it and if the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) formed the government in Punjab in 2022, this tax will be off. Angry over it, Jojo had threatened to take Kejriwal to court. His lawyer, Sanjay Goyal, by his side, Jaijeet Singh Jauhal said that: “Kejriwal has the habit of making wild allegations before the elections for political mileage. In the past, he made allegations against late Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia, only to later tender apologies to them after the elections. Now with the Punjab assembly elections approaching, he chose to target the finance minister through me.” On December 6, 2018, Jauhal had filed another defamation case against Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal, and his wife, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, and her brother, Bikram Singh Majithia, for Rs 10 crore, alleging that they had made baseless allegations and insinuations against him of collecting illegal money. The case is at the evidence stage in Bathinda court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/jojo-tax-claim-punjab-finance-ministers-relative-takes-aap-supremo-to-court/articleshow/87474156.cms||---

The book stall owners in the city say that demand for the book ‘Juvenile Justice Act 2015’ and also its Malayalam translation ‘Balaneethi’ by Karakulam Manoj has risen steadily over the past few weeks. Sukumar book stall near Overbridge junction has already sold more than 300 books on the title. People are also asking for the book ‘Indian Penal Code’ and its Malayalam translation. “Usually only a few copies get sold, but now more than 300 books have been sold out in the past few days. Advocates were the only customers for those books. But now the situation has changed. People, including advocates, police officers, representatives of legal bodies and even common people, come and ask for the books,” says a book shop owner. The book sellers believe that the sudden demand of these books has risen in the wake of Anupama’s case. She had alleged that her father P S Jayachandran, a CPM member, kidnapped her new-born child three days after she gave birth in last October and abandoned the baby in a government owned orphanage. “I believe there is a trend of purchasing law books whenever social issues arise. People come to the shop and enquire about the books on that particular topic. For example, the arrest of Aryan Khan had sparked a demand for books based on narcotics and drugs,” said Santhosh Kumar, owner of Sukumar books stall. Satheesh S, manager of Neethi law house book stall also talks about the rise in sales. “There has been a rise in people enquiring about juvenile acts in the past few days,” he confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/high-demand-for-books-on-juvenile-justice-following-adoption-row/articleshow/87441792.cms||---

Many prefer to make these snacks at home, while those who don’t have much time at hand prefer buying them from the market. However, due to inflation, the price of these readymade snacks have gone up this year — in the range of Rs 20 to Rs 50 per kg. Arpita Sadale, an online snacks seller, said, “As the cost of essential raw materials like cooking oil, dry fruits, flour and ghee have increased due to rising fuel and LPG prices, we had no option but increase our rates accordingly.” Shubhangi Raut, another sell from Sane Guruji Vasahat, said, “If the price of raw materials goes up, the rates of the finished products will also increase. Compared to last year, the prices ave increased between Rs 20 and Rs 50.” Due to the price rise, many people are preferring to make the snacks at their homes. Pallavi Kulkarni, a primary school teacher, said, “Earlier I used to make few items at home and purchased remaining products from outside. This year, in order to save money, we have decided to make the snacks at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/readymade-diwali-snacks-become-dear/articleshow/87471576.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Neighbouring Goa, which is smaller in area and population compared to Uttara Kannada district, attracted a large number of tourists across the globe.“The main income source of that state is tourism and we should be in a position to compete with them,” he said.With an airport coming up near Karwar, the coastal areas of Uttara Kannada can attract a large number of tourists from different countries. So, setting up casinos in the sea is important, he said. It can be done with the participation of private parties. Hotel, water adventures, forest and water tourism can be increased, he said.“One cannot stop people from spending money in casinos. People from Uttara Kannada and other districts go to Goa and spend it in casinos. So, if we set up casinos here, money will be spent in our district,” he said.When reminded that the BJP had opposed when previous the Congress government had proposed casinos in Arabian Sea, off Karwar, Hebbar said that it was true. But stances change with the time, he added.The state government will make an all-effort to restart work of the Hubballi-Ankola railway line which was stopped because of some “environmentalists”, the minister said.He said the environmentalists were preventing development in the name of the environment. “The development, generation of employment, tourism and the preservation of environment should go hand in hand,” he said.Karwar MLA Roopali Naik, Uttara Kannada DC Mullai Mugilan, SP Suman Penekar, ZP CEO Priyanka M, Assistant Commissioner Vidyashree Chandaragi were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/uttara-kannada-should-have-casinos-says-minister-hebbar/articleshow/87472428.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||With power tariff cut in Punjab, Cong is countering AAP, SAD||Chandigarh: With its decision to slash electricity tariff by Rs 3 per unit, the Congress hopes to counter its political rivals – Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), who have made promises of 300 units and 400 of free electricity to seek votes for the 2022 assembly elections. While announcing the decision to reduce power tariff by Rs 32on Monday, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi expressed an apprehension about the 300 free units proposal. He claimed that the existing electricity infrastructure load wouldn’t cope up if smaller consumers also begin consuming 300 units. A survey had found that “self-respecting consumers” rather wanted affordable and uninterrupted supply instead of free power, he added. AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal had on June 29 announced that if voted in, the party will provide 300 units free, besides ensuring 20 hours of uninterrupted supply in Punjab. This was followed by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal announcing on August 4 a 13-point agenda to be implemented on forming the government, promising 400 units of free electricity to all residential consumers, a discount of Rs 10 per litre on diesel for farming and 75% quota in private sector jobs to Punjabi youth. Even PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu had pitched for 300 units of free power, besides lowering tariffs for domestic consumers. Sidhu had said in a tweet on July 4, Punjab already provides 9,000 crore subsidy but must do more for domestic & industrial consumer giving power at Rs 3-5 per unit, instead of surcharge-inflated Rs 10-12 per unit, along 24-hour supply with no power cuts and up to 300 units free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/with-power-tariff-cut-in-punjab-cong-is-countering-aap-sad/articleshow/87474161.cms||---

Last week, the weekly positivity rate (WPR) dipped to 3.1% in the rural areas. It was 1.8% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits and 1.6% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The district health officials stated that Pune’s WPR was below 4% for a major part of the past two months. Only in the first week of September, the district had registered an average WPR of 4%. The district health officials stated that the true test would be after Diwali. “We shall have to do an assessment after Diwali festivities. We are keeping a close watch to check if there is any sudden rise in cases,” a health official said. The district’s weekly Covid review meeting was not conducted last week. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar would convene the meeting again post-Diwali. If the WPR continues to remain low, some more relaxation in timings are expected, especially for theatres. The state’s Covid task force members cautioned residents to be careful because some districts were still registering a higher WPR than the state average. The state’s WPR was 1.45% last week and eight districts —Sindhudurg (3.21%), Pune (2.6%), Palghar (2.28%), Sangli (1.0%) Solapur (1.83%), Nashik (1.67%), Satara (1.63%) and Ahmednagar (1.47%) — registered a higher WPR than that. “The second wave has receded, but the local authorities should keep a strict watch on the situation,” state task force member Dr Rahul Pandit told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-dists-wpr-stays-below-5-for-two-months/articleshow/87473288.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The monthwise caseload shrunk by almost 46% in October as against the previous month, accounting for less than 500 daily cases on an average. The monthly tally in May last year stood at 6,050. But then May was also one of the months, along with March and April, when the infection rate wasn’t high either, experts said. Data by district health office revealed that among 12,528 cases recorded in October, the rural and Cantonment areas together added highest 6,910 cases, while the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits recorded 3,260 and 2,358 cases, respectively. The rural areas accounted for most recoveries too in PMR in October. In fact, October’s recoveries in rural parts (9,085) stood way ahead of its monthly caseload. A total of 15,677 patients were discharged in PMR in October. PMC and PCMC limits also recorded more discharges than positive cases in October. As many as 3,971 patients recovered in PMC limits in the month, followed by the PCMC area (2,621). Health officials said they were monitoring daily cases. “Daily cases have dropped considerably in city limits in October, but we have been on alert since further relaxations were announced last month. Citizens should make use of masks at public places,” an official from the PMC’s health department said.

---||Hubballi||Industrial estates in twin cities lack facilities||Dharwad: Hubballi-Dharwad is possibly north Karnataka's largest industrial hub, but its industrial estates are suffering from a lack of infrastructure and a reduction in productivity.Dharwad is geographically located in the centre of north Karnataka and has good connectivity. However, the industrial estates situated in Belur, Tarihal, Mummigatti, Kotur and Lakamanahalli are lacking basic infrastructure as a result of which the industries are unable to utilize their full capacity. The failure of the KIADB in handing over these estates to the local bodies since last two decades has added to the woes of the entrepreneurs.The outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown have rubbed salt in the entrepreneurs’ wounds. The majority of industrial units in industrial estates are small-scale, auxiliary industries that supply accessories to big and medium-sized enterprises. Due to the fact that the large and medium enterprises that purchased the products of small units cut their production, the demand for auxiliary products decreased as well, according to an industrialist.The main problem confronting small units in industrial estates is inadequate power supply. “The electricity supplied to us was enough for the technologies available to us 20 years ago. Now that technology has advanced, we require increased energy. Inadequate coordination between Hescom and KIADB has hampered the industrial units' access to adequate power. To enhance our power supply, we must purchase our own transformer,” Shrikant Thite, head of the Dharwad Growth Centre Industries Association, explained.He said there have been many discrepancies by the KIADB in the development of industrial area. " There are instances of green belt space being used for other purposes. As a result, the industrial area has not been transferred to local governments. Those who have purchased the land do not have documents to prove the ownership. When we approach banks for loans, the lenders require proof of tax payment. When we approach banks for loans, the lenders require proof of tax payment. How should we pay the property tax if the owners' names are not on the records of right?" Shrikant said. Shrikant demanded that the government approve the establishment of an industrial unit by Aequs Private Limited on a 300-acre plot of land near Itigatti as soon as possible so that small businesses can thrive again. The sole consolation for industrialists is that the central government gave financial help in the form of bank loans during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/industrial-estates-in-twin-cities-lack-facilities/articleshow/87472439.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI
---||Chennai||Tribal kids trafficked to pollinate Tamil Nadu cotton farms||CHENNAI: Chasing birds in the Jawadhu hills forests on an August afternoon, 13-year-old Sakthi and his friends Tirumurthy and Prabhu were approached by a middle-aged man offering them clothes, money and mobile phones. The man loaded them all on his motorbike and rode four-and-a-half-hours away to the cotton fields of Siruvachur in Perambalur district. The children toiled from dawn to dusk, manually pollinating cotton, and harvesting the produce. Every year during the cotton season (August to January), Malayali tribal children from Kalvarayan, Jawadhu and Vellimalai hills are trafficked to work in unforgiving conditions in villages across Kallakurichi and Salem. They get to the field around 4am to remove anthers from the flowers of the lines selected as females – a process known as emasculation. They then cover the emasculated flowers with a plastic strip to avoid pollen contamination, collect pollen grains from another set of flowers from lines selected as males, dust them over the emasculated flowers, and leave them to fertilize. “If we work from early morning till 6pm, we get Rs 300,” says Sakthi Vel, a 15- year-old tribal boy who worked on the fields last year. “If we take breaks other than for lunch, or if the plants don’t produce enough bolls, they cut our pay.” Local residents sympathetic to the children say police have failed to take action against the traffickers, despite being alerted frequently. “Tribal families face discrimination and neglect from police too. They turn around to blame the parents for not keeping a watch on their children but never file cases,” says K Mahalakshmy, a teacher in Jawadhu hills who takes up tribal causes. Tiruvannamalai SP, A Pavan Kumar says the local police have been trained to organise awareness programmes on child labour, and rescue operations were conducted as recently as last month. “We intercepted a bus carrying children from Jawadhu Hills to work in cotton mills,” he says. “Local officials are always to take complaints,” S Murugan, the district project director of Childline in Tiruvannamalai, says their records show 250 children from Jawadhumalai have been working in Siruvachur in recent months. “The numbers may run into hundreds if we start counting the children from other hills working in all the farms,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tribal-kids-trafficked-to-pollinate-tn-cotton-farms/articleshow/87474162.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

The Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamna’, said that had anyone else but Modi held the Bible to his forehead, ‘bhakts’ would have started a cleansing campaign. “Modi not only met the Pope but also held a copy of Bible to his head presented by the Pope. By doing so, Modi sent a strong message to fundamentalists in the country. India is secular, Modi told the world from the Vatican. Modi suddenly meets Nawaz miyan, he also meets the Pope, all this suits Modi. If someone else had done it, blind bhakts would have said tauba tauba. The nation, religion, culture, would have been corrupted and cleansing campaigns would have started. Modi will now have to tell blind bhakts what to do through ‘Mann Ki Baat’!” the editorial stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-hits-out-at-blind-bhakts-after-modi-meets-pope/articleshow/87474202.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad district administration to raze 338 labour colony quarters from November 8||AURANGABAD: On the directives of the district administration, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Public Works Department (PWD) put out a public notice on Sunday night informing that 338 quarters in the Vishwasnagar Labour Colony will be bulldozed starting from November 8. Apart from claiming that the structural audit of these structures have concluded them to be dilapidated and dangerous for living, the notice has also warned of legal action against illegal occupants of these quarters, some of which had been constructed in 1953-54. The rest were built in 1980 and 1991. Amid police bandobast, the notice was put on display on a large flex board in the colony spread across 20 acre of prime land adjacent to the VIP Road, opposite to the district collector’s bungalow. For decades, the quarters, which have even been sub-let by original occupants, have remained a bone of contention as residents have strongly opposed the district administration and PWD’s move to reclaim them. Over the past several years, the residents have contested the cases in Supreme Court, but failed to get any relief. Authorities said the decision to vacate the colony, which currently is occupied by the second and third generations of the government employees, who were originally allotted these quarters in the 1980s, and even their tenants, should have been vacated about a couple of years ago. “But the general as well as assembly elections forced the administration to put the issue on back-burner,” said a senior official from the district collectorate. Following his visit to the labour colony, MP Imtiaz Jaleel termed the move being announced on eve of Diwali as ‘ruthless’ and demanded the state take a considerate view instead of making hundreds of people homeless.  “On one hand, the government has been floating schemes to help people have their homes, on the other hand, people residing in quarters for decades are being made homeless. In my opinion, these people should have a reservation in the development done here,” he said. Echoing the residents’ sentiments, he said that labour colonies in other parts of the state have been regularized and these quarters should also be regularized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-dist-admin-to-raze-338-labour-colony-quarters-from-nov-8/articleshow/87471584.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Central scheme for property mapping launched in Khunti||Ranchi: The Jharkhand government on Monday formally launched the Centre’s Svamitva Yojana from Karra village in Arki block of Khunti district. Under the scheme, the state department of revenue, land records and registration will join hands with the Survey of India to create digital records of immovable properties belonging to residents of rural areas in the state. Launched on August 24 last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme has been rolled out by the Union ministries of panchayati raj and land revenue. In Jharkhand, more villages under 4,345 gram panchayats across 24 districts will be brought under this scheme. Notably, Khunti was the epicentre of the Pathalgarhi movement during the tenure of former chief minister Raghubar Das as locals erected plaques declaring self-governance and forbidding the entry of outsiders into their respective hamlets. Acting tough, the then government had lodged FIRs against thousands of Pathalgarhi sympathizers and put many behind the bars. Chief minister Hemant Soren, who was due to inaugurate the scheme virtually from Ranchi, skipped the event at the last minute. L Khiangte, the additional chief secretary of the state revenue, land records and registration department, filled in for Soren. The state government said in the initial phases, more than 175 villages under the Arki block will be brought under the scheme. Svamitva stands for Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas. States like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have already begun implementing the scheme’s first phase. After inaugurating the scheme, Khiangte said, “Under the scheme, the district administration will team up with officials of Survey of India and will visit the villages, mark the property’s boundaries along with taking aerial pictures of an immovable property (such as houses, farms and land).” He further said, “ The photographs will then be used to create digital land records and its owner will be issued property cards.” Khiangte added that the digital records will prove beneficial in upholding the rights of the landowners and disbursement of welfare schemes among the beneficiaries. On a macro level, the state government will also be able to map the peripheries of human settlements in the rural areas through the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/central-scheme-for-property-mapping-launched-in-khunti/articleshow/87472775.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Jharkhand police had sent then Ranchi (city) SP Manoj Ratan Chothe along with other officers to Patna to interrogate Imtiaz Ansari, the death row convict of the seven serial blasts, who hailed from Sithio village under Dhurwa police station here and nabbed at the Patna railway station where a bomb exploded in one of the bathrooms. After two days of intense interrogation, the state police got information about several persons and phone numbers involved in the crime. Based on Ansari’s statements, the police raided Iram lodge in Hindpiri here on November 4, 2013, and seized 27 L-shaped bombs, three each in nine groups. They also found that timer clocks used in the bombs were of the same company as those used in the Patna serial blasts and the earlier explosions at Gaya in Bihar. During the interrogation of Imtiaz, the state police also came to know Haider Ali, another criminal who was awarded the death sentence in the crime. Police said Ali was responsible for brainwashing and luring some of the perpetrators of Sithio village to take part in the conspiracy to conduct the serial blasts. More than three groups comprising two persons each were sent to Patna for committing the crime, police added. The district police had also carried out raids at Irba in Ormanjhi block to nab several suspects before the NIA took over the investigations. Recounting the operations Chothe said, “Since national security was involved, I along with a team of officers under the guidance of the special branch, the then Ranchi SSP and the central agencies worked hard to crack the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/2-death-row-convicts-in-patna-serial-blasts-have-roots-in-jkhand/articleshow/87472737.cms||Sanjay Sahay

With more than Rs 300 crore being distributed as bonus by the companies among their employees in Steel City and in the adjoining ancillary town of Adityapur, traders expect that a major chunk of the amount will be spent during the Dhanteras-Diwali period. The traders of vehicles, jewellery, home appliances and electronic gadgets have already predicted a jump of 20% in sales. Even the sale of vehicles has gone up apparently with many applying for loans during this time. HDFC employee Shailesh Tiwary, who has works in the bank’s car loan department, said, “As per whatever I have gathered about car bookings from various showrooms, Dhanteras and Diwali bookings would see a jump of about 20%.” The proprietor of Gamharia-based Maa Kalyani showroom, R M Kumar, said bookings for two-wheelers is expected to go up this year. Market sources have hinted at 900 plus bookings for two-wheelers on the eve of Dhanteras. “Even home appliances like refrigerators and washing machines and smart TVs are in demand this year,” proprietor of Sakchi-based National Electronics Raja Singh said. Smartphones, like every year, are in high demand though the middle-class customers are going for the moderately expensive ones, as per Sunny Mishra, who owns a mobile shop in Kadma market. Kitchen appliances’ dealer Santosh Gupta said, “Even though e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon have mushroomed like anything, customers still prefer buying utensils physically and so, I expect a good business during this time.” Seeing the surge in demand, the trade bodies expect that around Rs 400 crore will come into the market during the Dhanteras-Diwali period. “State and central government employees and the business class, along with those working in private firms, spend their money in purchasing new items during this period. So we expect a surge in revenue during this time,” Confederation of All India Traders’ national secretary Suresh Sonthalia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cap-on-biz-hrs-removed-traders-expect-surge-in-sale-during-dhanteras/articleshow/87472753.cms||B Sridhar

Even those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other types of respiratory ailments stand the risk of developing pneumonia, if exposed to the smoke. Talking to TOI, professor (critical care) and head of the trauma centre at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Ranchi, Dr Pradeep Bhattacharya, said, “People, in general, should try to avoid inhaling the smoke emanating from bursting crackers. Last year after Diwali, some people had to be hospitalised because they developed complications after inhaling that smoke. The risk increases manifold for those whose lungs have got damaged because of Covid-19. Such people are more vulnerable as the harmful chemicals present in the smoke damages the lungs further.” Dr Brajesh Mishra, who is the head of chest and tuberculosis department at Rims, said, “Lungs once damaged take time to recover and those whose lungs have been damaged by coronavirus should stay away from the smoke of crackers. The risk becomes higher in kids and senior citizens with COPD and asthma as they are more likely to develop pneumonia due to the change in weather as well as the because of the smoke which damages the respiratory tract.” Orchid Medical Centre’s senior pulmonologist Dr Nishith Kumar said, “These firecrackers contain heavy metals like lead and arsenic which enter the bloodstream and can cause short and long-term complications, including irritation in the respiratory tract. It can also result in vomiting, weaken a person’s immunity and worsen the condition of those with COPD, hypertension and cardiac ailments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/covid-survivors-asked-to-remain-cautious-as-city-gets-ready-to-have-a-blast/articleshow/87473046.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Later in the day, cops from Town police station reached the hospital to pacify the protestors.

Though Meshram denies having received any notice, sources in the NMC’s transport department confirmed that the show cause notice was received by the corporator’s office. Addressing a press conference, Meshram claimed that the notice was served to him after district guardian minister Nitin Raut’s directions to NMC’s additional municipal commissioner Deepak Meena. He further said that the NMC administration has no power to issue a show cause notice to any elected representative. He alleged that Meena had been misusing his position in the NMC. “On September 18 this year, Meena had used the NMC car (MH31/BZ317) for his private trip to Gondia. As per NMC rule, any vehicle owned by the civic body cannot go out of city limits without the permission from mayor and municipal commissioner,” said Meshram. The corporator also claimed that when the NMC driver pointed the rule to Meena, he allegedly transferred the former. “Despite the weak financial position of NMC, Meena has allegedly forced the civic administration to renovate his official chamber on the first floor of the administration building,” Meshram alleged. According to Meshram, after he used 60 Aapli buses for transporting affected citizens of a state government scheme, the additional municipal commissioner had served show cause notice to two officials from the transport department. He further pointed out that Meena has no authority to intervene in the transport department. To a query, Meshram said that he had not used the buses free of cost. “I paid the requisite fare of Rs3,000 for each bus utilized for providing transportation to the affected beneficiaries of Ramai Gharkul Yojna,” he said. He further alleged that even the Congress had used the MSRTC buses for their national leaders’ public meetings in the city. “We never played dirty politics,” he claimed. Additional commissioner Meena refuted the allegations levelled by Meshram. “I have never misused my power. I am following the works delegated to me by the civic chief,” he said. About taking the NMC car to Gondia, Meena said that he had taken prior approval from his superior. He further clarified that all the staff in his department were transferred as per procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-corporator-gets-nmc-show-cause-for-using-aapli-buses-in-rally/articleshow/87473380.cms||---
---||India||Plucked away by traffickers, kids toil in Tamil Nadu's cotton fields as ‘pollinators’||Chasing birds in the forests of Tamil Nadu’s Jawadhu Hills on an August afternoon, 13-year-old Sakthi Kumar and his friends Tirumurthy and Prabhu are approached by a middle-aged man offering them clothes, money and mobile phones. The stranger gets the trio to accompany him on his motorbike and they ride four-and-a-half-hours to reach the cotton fields of Siruvachur in Perambalur district. The children pay a heavy price for succumbing to the lure of seemingly easy rewards. They are made to toil from dawn to dusk in the fields – from manually pollinating cotton to harvesting the produce. Every year, during the cotton season from August to January, Malayali tribal children from the Kalvarayan, Jawadhu and Vellimalai hills are trafficked to work in unforgiving conditions in villages spread across Kallakuruchi and Salem. They get to the fields around 4am to remove anthers from the flowers growing in rows identified as females. The child labourers cover the emasculated flowers with a plastic strip to avoid pollen contamination, collect pollen grain from another set of flowers in lines selected as males, dust them over the emasculated flowers and leave them to fertilise. “If we work from early morning till 6pm, we get Rs 300,” said Sakthi Vel, a 15-year-old tribal boy who worked there last year. “If we take breaks other than for lunch, or if the plants don’t produce enough bolls, they cut our pay.” Sakthi, Tirumurthy and Prabhu are students of K Mahalakshmi, who teaches at the state-run school at Arasaveli. For years, the 36-year-old has been knocking on village doors, alternatively pleading with and reprimanding parents until they agree to send their kids to school. When the school reopened following the long pandemic-induced break, at least 200 students didn’t turn up. It transpired that they were working in the cotton farms of Siruvachur, Attur and Thalaivasal. At least 25 of them, including Sakthi, had been lured away without their parents’ knowledge. When the boys didn’t return home, the parents combed the Jawadhumalai forests and then reached out to A P Nandakumar, MLA of Anaikattu. Hours later, they got a call from Sakthi, who informed them from a borrowed phone that he and the boys were working in a cotton farm owned by one R Gunasekar in Siruvachur. When TOI contacted Gunasekar, he denied cultivating cotton, let alone employing kids.S Murugan, the district project director of Childline in Tiruvannamalai, said 250 children from Jawadhumalai had been working in Siruvachur in recent months. “The numbers may run into hundreds if we start counting kids from other parts.” Tiruvannamalai SP A Pavan Kumar claimed rescue operations were conducted as recently as last month. “We intercepted a bus carrying children from Jawadhu Hills. Local officials are always ready to take complaints.” Mahalakshmi said influential landowners and their brokers continue to scour the hills for child farmhands. “Their noses are trained to sense poverty and desperation.” The police allegedly fail to take action against the traffickers despite being alerted frequently. Childline’s Murugan said there were instances of children being trafficked for a year. “The brokers pay an advance of Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 to the kids’ families and promise to send them back with upwards of Rs 30,000 for a year of labour. This is, of course, a sham.” Sakthi and his friends were stealthily dropped off at the Tiruvannamalai bus depot after a month of being used for backbreaking work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/plucked-away-by-traffickers-kids-toil-in-tamil-nadus-cotton-fields-as-pollinators/articleshow/87475728.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

On October 29, the ministry issued guidelines for sustainable eco-tourism in forest and wildlife areas. The guidelines call for developing eco-tourism in and around designated sites in the forest and wildlife-rich areas and ex-situ conservation areas, and such designated sites will include sites of biological, geographical, geophysical, and eco-heritage importance such as mangroves, sacred groves, mudflats, beaches, streams, wetlands, waterfalls, rivers, hills, caves etc. The guidelines lay focus on promoting eco-tourism by maximizing outputs that support nature and natural resources in their original forms while minimizing any negative externalities arising out of interactions between people and nature. The guidelines will be applicable to all protected areas (PAs), which presently number over 900 across the country, and many potential sites located in public, community, and private forests outside the PAs irrespective of the ownership of the land. The guidelines allow third-party involvement in determining the carrying capacity of eco-tourism sites by taking into account the wide diversity of environmental, physical, social, and economic criteria of development and management of eco-tourism sites as well as institutional capacities of their managers. Taking a dig at the new guidelines, environmentalist Debi Goenka said, “The MoEFCC is still not able to distinguish between eco-tourism and wildlife tourism. The fact that these guidelines are meant to be applicable to wildlife areas clearly indicates that wildlife tourism is being equated with eco-tourism.” Goenka added, “Secondly, the attempt to allow temporary structures to be constructed in forest lands within PAs needs to be strongly opposed. What is needed are larger areas that are free from disturbance and construction.” The policy also calls for the local community to be the key stakeholder of eco-tourism. The central government will provide for participatory frameworks that encourage resource mobilization by a group of stakeholders in the development, operation, and maintenance of eco-tourism zones. These frameworks shall ensure that equitable benefits flow from eco-tourism accrues, besides resource investors, to local communities, tribals, and other traditional forest dwellers including by way of enhanced livelihood opportunities. Wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar says the guidelines are contradictory. On one hand, the MoEFCC is planning to amend the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 giving relaxation to eco-tourism activities, but on the other, it states that ecotourism facilities or structures on forest lands shall be subject to the provisions of the FCA. Bhamburkar added, “The ESZ norms would be diluted for construction work in name of eco-tourism and unauthorized constructions near tiger reserves may be regularized. The success rate of joint forest management (JFM) has already been a debatable issue and again such involvement of committees in name of revenue generation won't be fulfilled. Interference in wild areas needs careful planning otherwise it would be more disturbing to wildlife.” The guidelines also call for working towards developing eco-tourism sites across the country and improving the way in which action on eco-tourism is coordinated with other sectors and synergies are exploited in the best possible manner. It also talks about streamlining regulations and simplifying processes and procedures while taking into consideration the objectives of relevant sectoral policies. WHAT IT AIMS AT * Promote low-impact nature tourism which ensures ecological integrity of the eco-tourism sites and their environment. * Promote biodiversity, traditional ecological knowledge, and heritage values of India’s wilderness. * Engage local communities for sustainable use of indigenous materials through financially viable value chains thereby helping such local communities become Atma Nirbhar. * Promote partnerships amongst stakeholders for mobilizing resources and developing and promoting nature tourism, as well equitable sharing of benefits. * Enhancing the potential of India as a global eco-tourism destination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centres-eco-tourism-norms-call-for-boosting-entrepreneurship/articleshow/87473805.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Chandigarh||Punjab begins verifying stubble machines for subisdy payment||Bathinda: Aiming to plug loopholes in the misuse of subsidy money meant for disbursement for crop residue management (CRM) machines, the Punjab agriculture department on Monday made individual farmers, gram panchayats, primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) and custom hiring centres (CHCs) to bring their machines to block agriculture offices for a physical verification. A subsidy amount of Rs 105 crore has been sanctioned for 10,300 machines purchased so far by farmers and various groups. In all, subsidy is to be given to 31,970 machines in the ongoing fiscal. After physical verification, the subsidy amount will be deposited in the accounts of purchasers. Subsidy of 50% is provided to individual purchasers, while it is up to 80% for groups. With 10,300 machines coming into the state till now in the ongoing fiscal for crop residue management, the total number of machines available in the state have rise risen to 86,926. It is expected the availability would cross 1 lakh machines in the state this year, said officials of the state agriculture department. Out of the proposal for subsidy on 31, 970 machines, 10,023 machines are for individual farmers, 15,498 for CHCs, 5,543 for panchayats and 906 for PACS. In the last three years, subsidy has been given for 76,626 machines, which include happy seeder, paddy straw chopper, shredder, mulcher, super straw management systems, super seeders for in-situ crop residue management and balers, rakes for ex-situ management. Agriculture department officials said by providing subsidy on more machines, they could think of minimising paddy stubble burning. Data so far shows there is a drop in crop residue burning cases and area where stubble is burnt as compared to previous year. Farmers Gurmail Singh and Kulwant Singh, who have purchased machines on subsidy, said it was peak time for them to either harvest the paddy crop or to manage the fields for next wheat crop. “The department should have done physical verification earlier when farmers were free,” said Gurmail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-begins-verifying-stubble-machines-for-subisdy-payment/articleshow/87474580.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Goa||Environment protection will be priority in devpt projects: Gadkari||Panaji: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Monday assured Goans of adhering to international environmental standards while bringing development to the state even as he sought the cooperation of the people in completing projects. “We are working to inaugurate the Mopa international airport by 2023 — even one-lane of the highway to Mopa airport is ready — but we need cooperation from the people. Many in Goa go to courts over environmental concerns,” he said. “Ecology, environment and development can go hand-in-hand. I am also a staunch supporter of environment protection. We are ensuring that every new road constructed is a green road by planting new trees,” Gadkari said, adding that his government wants to adhere to international environmental standards. We are hoping for even bigger success in developing Goa while freeing it from air, water, sound and all other pollution, while also working to boost its economy, he said. Gadkari also said that much more development will be brought to Goa if Goans continue their support to chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP, hinting at the upcoming polls. “What was not done in Goa in 50 years has been done within the last five to seven years and it is right before your eyes. We have given priority to development.” The development brought about in Goa by the BJP government so far will only appear to be a trailer as compared to what the party’s next term in the state will bring in, Gadkari said. “Asli film to baad mein shooru hone wali hai (the real film is yet to begin). So we are expecting your help,” Gadkari said, making an appeal for support at the upcoming 2022 Goa assembly polls. He said that his ministry is exploring vehicles run on alternative energy sources in a big way. “I will soon be using green hydrogen-run vehicles in Delhi. All these measures will reduce pollution to a major extent soon,”he said. “We have fulfilled every infrastructure demand that the Goa CMs, MLAs, MPs came to me with. Goa is already a progressive state, but in approving all the projects it was my dream that Goa should grow as an international tourism attraction, its tourist inflow should swell. From 2014 until now, infrastructure works worth Rs 12,000 crore have either been completed or are nearing completion here. Any pending work will be completed in 2022,” he said. New works worth another Rs 40 crore are being approved in the year 2021-22 for Goa, said Gadkari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/environment-protection-will-be-priority-in-devpt-projects-gadkari/articleshow/87473865.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Tap inland waterways, says Gadkari||Panaji: Highlighting the untapped potential of inland waterways, Union minister of state for roads and transport Nitin Gadkari urged Goa to get its act together and utilise the state’s rivers for passenger and cargo movement. Addressing the state’s industrialists, Gadkari said that Goa needs to take advantage of the Centre’s policies and schemes and quickly implement projects that are centrally funded such as the Sagarmala project and the national waterways project. “If the people are coming to the airport, they will go to the sea near to the airport and directly via sea route they can go up to their hotels. I tried my level best at the time when I was shipping minister, but I couldn’t get success for that.” Gadkari said that Shiroda MLA Subhash Shirodkar has proposed a metro rail system for the state, which he would consider along with the feasibility of an electric Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS). “There are a lot of new technologies available in the world so we can use public transport system on electricity but this is the time for Goa to develop water transport because the potential is already here,” said Gadkari. He said he had tried developing waterways transport in Goa along with former chief minister Manohar Parrikar and had even explored the use of hovercraft, but the plans never saw the light of day. He also urged Goa to focus on pharmaceutical, electronic, medical devices and drone manufacturing which offer huge potential in the future. Pointing out that the logistic cost in China is 8% as against 16% in India, Gadkari said that Goa has the advantage of using its natural waterways which is a cost effective mode of transport. He urged the state to complete the electronic manufacturing cluster at Tuem so that manufacturing units can setup in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tap-inland-waterways-says-gadkari/articleshow/87473874.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The photograph was of two kids — aged 9 and 11 — seated on the pavement, completely immersed in studies and oblivious to the shuffling feet, grime and cacophony on the road. Their mother, a widow, runs a paan shop on the pavement. Impressed by their eagerness to learn, people stepped forward to help. A family has taken the mother and two children — Sonia and Azmira Khatun — in to provide them a decent shelter. Another helped them with new clothes and a third got them admitted to a boarding school. “I still feel elated at the fact that all this started from a picture which I had casually clicked during one of my random street photography sessions. I thank the good Samaritans who have come forward to help these children and transform a family’s destiny,” said Mudar Patherya, a social worker, who had shot and shared the photograph. Patherya had clicked the photograph in August, while walking down Bentinck Street in central Kolkata when he spotted the children studying on the pavement. While editing it later, he noticed the hunched posture of one of the children that touched him. Patherya, with the help of one of his colleagues, tracked down the children and provided them with school stationery and also shared the photos with some of his acquaintances and also on Instagram. Garments retailer Karan Goenka got them new clothes from his factory. Social entrepreneur Vinayak Lohani came forward to admit them to his residential boarding school for free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pic-of-sisters-studying-on-a-street-turns-lives-around-for-the-two/articleshow/87475794.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Goa||‘Use of ethanol can address high fuel cost and pollution’||PANAJI: Chastising earlier governments for ignoring his calls to adopt the use of ethanol as a commercial fuel, Union minister for roads, transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Monday said that ethanol is not only cheaper, but also better for the environment. The Union minister also said that inclusion of fuel under GST will help reduce retail cost but the decision has to be taken by the GST council. Addressing Goa’s industrialists, Gadkari said that rapid increase in the production of ethanol and its adoption can help India completely stop import of crude oil after five years. “From 2004 I am the main advocate, constantly arguing for ethanol. But when any out-of-box thinking is there, it is difficult and at the time people were taking more time to support it. Now, people are supporting ethanol,” Gadkari said at a meeting to outline the Gati Shakti national masterplan. He was responding to a concern raised by the industry about the high fuel prices and the efforts being taken to reduce them. Gadkari said that since 70-80% of the country’s fuel requirements depend on imports, the Centre can do little to reduce the prices. He said that the Centre has taken a decision to promote flex-engines that can run on ethanol as well as petrol. He said that Bajaj Auto, TVS and Toyota have agreed to manufacture vehicles with engines that can run on either of the two fuels. “Petrol cost is very high compared to ethanol. It is time for the country to accept the new technology because it is less polluting than even electric because we are making electricity from coal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/use-of-ethanol-can-address-high-fuel-cost-and-pollution/articleshow/87473899.cms||---
---||Delhi||Citing SC, NGT, Delhi high court says sale of firecrackers banned||NEW DELHI: Sale of firecrackers is not permitted in the national capital as per the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court, the Delhi high court said Monday, refusing to grant any relief to traders. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, hearing a plea by several traders against the complete ban on storage and sale of firecrackers, said that the petitioners ought to approach the SC or the NGT. "Please go to the Supreme Court. It is already looking into the issue today. Seek clarification. (HC is the) wrong forum. Inform NGT. They are a specialised body," the judge said, prompting the traders, seeking permission to sell their stock for use outside the city, to withdraw their petition. TimesViewStrict enforcement over the next few days would be key to stopping those illegally selling firecrackers. That's imperative in ensuring that the city's air doesn't worsen alarmingly after Diwali.If someone were to come from an area 'A' having good air quality, the point of sale would be Delhi, which is in contravention of orders of the Supreme Court and NGT," the court observed, noting that they can sell it outside Delhi (wherever legally permissible). Considering that Diwali is only three days away, the court permitted the petitioners to withdraw their plea while clarifying that the issues raised before it as well as the challenge to the legal validity of the ban, was still open. The NGT, on December 2, 2020, had directed that there would be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during the Covid-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the "poor" category or worse. In July, the Supreme Court had refused to interfere with the NGT order while observing that scientific studies are not needed to ascertain the side-effects of firecrackers on the health of citizens. The petitioners contended before the high court that in the terms of the SC order, sale of green firecrackers can be permitted in the national capital if it is not for "use" but the HC opined that the Supreme Court order prohibited both sale as well as use of fireworks. "NGT imposes a ban, Supreme Court refuses to interfere... Once NGT has banned it and Supreme Court has said nothing, where is the consideration by Supreme Court of NGT order?" the judge wondered. It also observed that the Covid-19 pandemic was not over and it was time to be careful. "Have you seen the interview of the AIIMS director, where he says probably the surge has started? Now we have to be careful," the judge pointed out. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee on its part said the sale and use of firecrackers cannot be permitted in the city which is still witnessing "poor" air quality. It stated that the petitioners may be permitted to take their stock outside Delhi after accounting for "how much" and "where" their stock was going. The AAP government asserted that Covid restrictions were yet to be lifted completely and for the last one year, the government was not allowing the use of firecrackers. The authorities have seized thousands of kilograms of firecrackers pursuant to the raids carried out by them, the government counsel informed court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citing-sc-ngt-delhi-high-court-says-sale-of-firecrackers-banned/articleshow/87475791.cms||---

He said that the observatory is expected to rival the Eiffel Tower as an international tourist attraction. “The main Zuari bridge will be completed by September 2022. We are trying to inaugurate one-lane of the project before the code of conduct comes into force,” said Gadkari. Stating that the two towers will have a revolving viewer gallery and restaurant, the Union minister said, “We are also trying to construct a walkway and art gallery. I will be looking at the designs today. All tourists will be able to come by the water route to the project.” “Boating, parking and a food mall will be provided at the base of this project. Goa’s culture, handloom, cashews will be on display and sale by small-scale local businesses. I will give instructions to issue the tender for the project today itself,” Gadkari said, speaking after inaugurating the 3.84km-long missing link road connecting Loutolim to Verna industrial estate. The project was constructed at a cost of Rs 184 crore. “From 2014, we have received Rs 10,500 crore from a single ministry for a small state like Goa. It had never happened in 60 years of Liberated Goa,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said, adding that all pending highway expansion projects will be inaugurated before Goa’s 60th Liberation Day celebration on December 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-zuari-bridge-to-be-ready-in-sept-2022-says-union-min/articleshow/87473918.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||New method to test age of custom milled rice||Chandigarh: The Food Corporation of India (FCI) said on Monday that the paddy procurement for Kharif marketing season (KMS) 2021-22 was on in Punjab since October and it had now started receiving the custom milled rice (CMR), which will go under a new age test. The central government has introduced a “mixed indicator” test for determining the age of milled rice. This method will nullify the possibility of accepting older stock. “The samples that make the indicator green or avocado green will be accepted while those that turn it yellow, yellow orange, or orange will be rejected as “not fresh milled”. The FCI has given Punjab the target of producing 40 lakh million tonnes (LMT) of fortified rice out of about 113 LMT expected as CMR. This fortified rice is to meet the demand of welfare schemes in Punjab and other states. The rice millers have orders to enhance their automatic blending capacity to deliver fortified rice that is blended uniformly. The millers must have the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) license to works as food operators and they must also furnish its copy to the FCI before delivering the fortified rice or CMR consignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-method-to-test-age-of-custom-milled-rice/articleshow/87474604.cms||---
---||India||Benami asset? I-T attaches MahaRERA chief’s SoBo flat||MUMBAI: The I-T department has provisionally attached a flat owned by Ajoy Mehta, former state chief secretary and now chairman of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA), as they suspect it could be a benami property of Pune businessman Avinash Bhosale. Mehta is said to have bought the flat last year from a shell company linked to Bhosale for less than market value and is now staying in it. “It is a bona fide purchase and I used all my savings from 35 years of government service and FDs. Nothing is left in my bank account and one can verify it. I paid more than the government-determined market rate for the flat,” said Mehta. The I-T department has restricted any further transactions related to a flat bought by Ajoy Mehta in Samata Cooperative Housing Society near Mantralaya under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act. Anamitra Properties Pvt Ltd, a shell company controlled by Bhosale, had bought it from the son of late Justice Sharad Manohar in 2009 for Rs 4 crore after taking a loan from Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd. I-T is examining all transactions between Anamitra Properties, Indiabulls and its group company. Last October, Nikhil Gokhale, one of the two directors in Anamitra Properties, sold the flat to Mehta for Rs 5.3 crore, though the market value was reportedly over Rs 10 crore, on Bhosale’s instruction. I-T claims that Anamitra Properties, which has no business activity, was the benami owner of the flat on behalf of Bhosale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/benami-asset-i-t-attaches-maharera-chiefs-sobo-flat/articleshow/87475795.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Ludhiana||Punjab’s first bio-CNG plant starts paddy straw collection||PATIALA: Punjab’s first stubble-based bio-CNG plant has started collection of paddy straw from the agricultural fields from its surrounding villages even as the commissioning of the plant is expected for January 2022. The officials at the compressed biogas (CBG) plant at Bhutal Kalan village of Lehragaga in Sangrur have already collected around 10,000 MT of paddy straw for their operations to produce biogas and manure. The plant is one of the largest CBG plants that will produce more than 33 tonnes of CBG or bio-CNG per day and is capable of collecting and utilizing over 1 lakh tonne of paddy residue each year. However, following delay in the harvest this year due to untimely rains, the authorities at the CBG plant are forced to collect the paddy straw from the area falling in more than 20 km radius against the 10 to 15 km radius plan. Ashish Kumar, CEO at CBG plant, said, “We have a target to collect 30,000 MT of paddy residue this year and we will achieve it easily as we had already collected 10,000 to 15,000 MT of paddy straw. We are collecting paddy stubble for the operations during the year whereas the wheat stubble may also be collected in April-May. The commissioning will be in January 2022. We would have collected stubble from 10 to 15 km radius of our plant, but due to delay in harvesting this time, we had to collect stubble from villages beyond 25 kms of distance. We have all the straw collecting machines owned by the company with an investment of Rs 12 crore. Next year, more machines will be purchased. These machines are operated by the staff, around 60 in number, hired by the company for stubble collection and round bales each weighing 450 kg are piled.” The experts had vied that the farmers in the area would prefer to burn their paddy straw instead of waiting for the collection of their stubble by the CBG plant. The farmers claimed they were waiting to sow the wheat crop from the mid of November but the harvesting of paddy was already delayed. The farmer leader in Bhutal Kalan village claimed that around 50% of paddy was harvested in their village as the rains had hit paddy harvesting. BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) block leader Harjit Singh Bhola said, “The window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of next crop, wheat, is too short now and farmers do not prefer to wait for long for the stubble collecting machines of biogas plant. The initiative of the biogas plant to collect stubble free of cost from the farmers is commendable, but due to rains and delay in harvesting this year, the farmers would burn stubble instead of leaving it for biogas plant or incorporating into the fields for decomposition. Moreover, some farmers revealed that the plant owners collect dry stubble only, but at this time the moisture is high following delay in harvesting.” After Bhutal Kalan, the CBG plants in Fatehgarh Sahib and Khanna (Ludhiana) will be operational and will produce 2.25 tonnes and 12 tonnes of CBG, respectively. In Punjab, the setting up of 23 CBG plants are in the pipeline till 2023-24, and all these CBG plants collectively will utilize nearly 9 lakh tonnes of paddy. PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said, “Under the ex-situ management of the state government, the biogas plant has started collecting paddy residue. We are making a lot of efforts by creating awareness among the farmers. Recently, we launched a green brigade from Punjabi University for awareness. We hope the area under fire will decline again this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjabs-first-bio-cng-plant-starts-paddy-straw-collection/articleshow/87474622.cms||Bharat Khanna

Holding placards with slogans like ‘Struggle of Indian farmers is our struggle’, they extended support to the protesting farmers in India. Some even held up banners saying that the PM was not welcome in Scotland. Modi is in Glasgow to take part in the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) meant to tackle climate change on an urgent and committed basis by all countries of the world. The umbrella body of protesting farmers, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha claimed that their demands against corporatisation of food and farming systems, and for an MSP legal guarantee were the pathways to tackle emissions from agriculture and food systems. SKM said it has urged the diaspora of continuing with the strong solidarity and building pressure on the Indian government. SKM said there was a black flag protest against Haryana agriculture minister J P Dalal, MP Dharamvir Singh and MLA Ghanshyam Saraf at Bhiwani in Haryana. Farmers staged a sit-in at the police barricades and the BJP leaders had to escape amid heavy police protection on a kaccha road after their event. In Punjab too, farmers are protesting against state government ministers and Congress leaders against meagre compensation announced for cotton crop damaged due to pink bollworm infestation.

Four of the accused were women. Accepting the police's B-summary report closing the case in which the father of the student had falsely claimed that she was sexually assaulted by them in the principal's office when she went to collect her transfer certificate, the court observed "one shudders to think that if there was no CCTV footage, the accused would have been required to go through prosecution for serious offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. TimesViewGrave responsibility lies upon the investigation agencies and courts, especially in cases relating to sexual offences. The investigating authority has to maintain a fine balance between taking steps towards arresting the accused on the one hand and ensuring that people are not framed and unfairly prosecuted on the other. Those who falsely implicate people should be penalized, because such accusations can destroy careers and lives.Police must carry out thorough probe to rule out false implication of innocent people". Ensure the innocent don’t have to face trial, affects whole life: JudgeC alling for thorough investigations, the judge said innocent people must not be made to go through an ordeal of trials and investigation as their whole life is affected mentally, physically and financially. The father had earlier filed several police complaints against the school authorities alleging corruption. The judge further observed that the probe agency and courts have to be alert. “The court has to safeguard the interests of all the parties involved to ensure that innocents are not harassed and the offenders are punished,” the judge observed. The court pointed out that the CCTV footage totally falsified the father’s case. It said four of those accused were seen sitting or doing other activities during the time the alleged incident occurred. “The victim at no point of time can be seen being subjected to sexual assault. The complainant has made very serious allegations against the principal, teachers and peons of the school. There was a background of earlier dispute. None of the witnesses has stated that the alleged incident occurred. Further, there is nothing found in the mobile of the respondent as alleged,” the judge said, adding that while the father may have grievances against the school, he should take recourse to due procedure to resolve them. “I find that the police have collected proper material by carrying out thorough investigation and it does not appear that it was biased. I do not find any merits in the contention of the complainant (father) and in view of material on record,” the judge said. The father had alleged that on June 27, 2018, when the child had gone to the female principal’s room, she sexually assaulted her. It was further alleged that the child screamed for help but no one came forward. The father also said the other accused too sexually abused her.  It was alleged that while a female teacher showed the girl obscene videos, another filmed her and she was then threatened by the principal. The father went to cops on the same day and an FIR was registered. Police recorded the statements of the minor and others from the school. The minor was sent for medical examination. Police told the court that from the statements, CCTV footage and other material, the complaint was false and a ‘B’ Summary was sought. A B Summary report is filed when police find a case to be false or when there is no evidence. Seeking rejection of the B Summary report, the father filed a detailed reply contending that the police investigating the case were bribed, hence, a false probe was carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cctv-clips-help-eight-get-all-clear-in-pocso-case/articleshow/87475887.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Mamata hits out at Cong, says ‘it cheated us and the people’||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday ratcheted up her aggression against the Congress and said the party that had contested against Trinamool in Bengal should not expect an alliance in other states. “We were with the Congress. We left because they (Congress) cheated us, cheated the people. We formed the government in Bengal thrice. We took Congress along while forming the first government. They left after we pulled out of the UPA government at the Centre in protest against rising LPG prices. The Congress supported the CPM then,” Banerjee said, pointing to the developments in 2012. The chief minister was speaking at the inauguration of the Janbazar Sammilita Kali Puja on Monday. Banerjee held that the Congress didn’t put up a fight against the BJP since Narendra Modi became the PM in 2014. “They opposed the BJP in public, but compromised with them and reached an understanding midway. We do not compromise.” The Trinamool chief buttressed her argument after her recent experience in Goa. “Our posters were being torn off. Some people waved black flags at me. But they didn’t come in the way of a Congress leader (Rahul Gandhi) travelling in a convoy of hundred cars during that time. He also had posters hung across Goa. Not a single poster was defaced,” the CM said. Banerjee likened TMC with people who would suffer but hold their heads high. “There are two categories of people; one that would go with the tide while the other would hold the head high and suffer,” she said. The Trinamool chief, however, didn’t want to gloss over her stint in the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre in 1999. “Yes, we were part of the NDA alliance led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Our support to the NDA was based on a common minimum programme,” she said. But Banerjee drew a difference between the NDA government under Vajpayee and the BJP government that enjoyed absolute majority under PM Modi. “Our party leaders are being beaten up, their cars are being attacked in Tripura. We are not being allowed in Assam and Uttar Pradesh. Some people also gather at my Delhi residence and shout slogans. They shouted slogans at me in Goa. I replied with a namaste because people in Goa will blacklist them soon,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-hits-out-at-cong-says-it-cheated-us-and-the-people/articleshow/87474241.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP MLAs to abstain from Bengal assembly session to mark festivals||Kolkata: BJP MLAs are going to abstain from the Bengal assembly session from Tuesday; they will take part if the session continues beyond November 16, leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari announced on Monday. Party MLAs would remain with people and celebrate Gorkha and Adivasi festivals instead, he said. “Preceding governments didn’t propose an assembly session during this time. Even CPM leaders who didn’t participate in pushpanjali and called themselves atheists didn’t want an assembly session during Dashain, Lakshmi Puja, Deepavali, Goru Khunta, Jagaddhatri Puja,” Adhikari said. The leader of opposition, however, refused to call the abstention a boycott. “We are not boycotting the session. As many as 68 BJP MLAs recorded their attendance in the obituary session today. We are here to voice the demands of people who elected us,” he said. “We will participate from November 16 if the assembly business advisory committee decides to continue the session till that time. The speaker didn’t call an all-party meeting ahead of the session,” Adhikari said. His reference to Gorkha festival and Adivasi heritage dropped broad hints about BJP’s plan to consolidate its support base in the Hills, and renew the Adivasi connect in Jangalmahal that it had lost to a large extent as evident from the 2021 assembly poll results. The leader of opposition, who had during the bypoll campaign focused on the recent attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, seized the opportunity to mail a proposal to the speaker to include names of “nine victims of Sanatan Dharma” in the obituary resolution adopted on Monday. “I sent an email to the speaker drawing his attention to the killings of nine members of Sanatan Dharma in Bangladesh, including Pranta Chandra Das of Iskcon’s Noakhali temple. The speaker didn’t accommodate my proposal,” Adhikari said. BJP MLAs later held a silent march outside assembly premises and observed a minute’s silence at the B R Ambedkar statue on the premises in memory of Bangladesh victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-mlas-to-abstain-from-bengal-assembly-session-to-mark-festivals/articleshow/87474177.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Chowdhury, instead, pointed out how RSS shakhas had increased manifold in the state during TMC tenure. “There were 200-250 RSS shakhas in Bengal during CPM tenure. They have increased to 4,000-5,000 during Trinamool’s term. Bhowanipore (Banerjee’s home turf) has got directly linked to Nagpur (the RSS HQ),” Chowdhury said. He held that while the BJP aimed at a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, the Trinamool eyed a “Congress-mukt opposition”. Trinamool MP Saugata Roy trashed Chowdhury’s allegation. “What Adhir Chowdhury has said is untrue. I don’t know of anyone who is more opposed to the BJP than Mamata Banerjee. The BJP is in power at the Centre that helped swelling of RSS shakhas. I would instead ask Adhir babu to tell people that he will not join the BJP. Chowdhury has come to understand that he is not going to win the polls next time,” Roy said. Chowdhury also came down on the Bengal government for its “careless stand” that resulted in crowding of local trains when the Covid graph was again on the rise. “The state government should have taken the step with caution when 27% of its population has got double vaccination against the 33% all-India average. The state should have negotiated with the railways and demanded an increase in local train services to avoid crowding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/adhir-slams-growth-of-rss-shakhas/articleshow/87474295.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Prime accused in executive murder, accomplice arrested in Mumbai||KOLKATA: Vickey Haldar, the prime accused in the murder of senior executive Subir Chaki and his driver Rabin Mandal at Chaki’s ancestral home on Kankulia Road in south Kolkata on October 17, has been arrested after being on the run for a fortnight in Mumbai, where he had been working as a security guard in an under-construction building. Vickey (26) alias Biki and his close aide Subhankar Mondal (35) were picked up in a joint raid by the Kolkata and Mumbai police after a dramatic chase in the parking lot of the 48-storey building on St Xavier’s Street, Parel (East). They were produced before a Mumbai court and are being brought back to Kolkata. The duo, after committing the sensational murder of the Kilburn Engineering Ltd managing director, had tried to throw the cops off their trail. “We arrested the two accused from the parking lot of the building around 9.10pm on Saturday,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “During questioning, we became certain that they were the two main assailants. They had fled the city on October 18, a day after committing the twin murders. They reached Mumbai either late on October 19 or early on October 20. They knew a few people from Diamond Harbour, who were working as labourers there. It was through them that they took up the jobs as watchmen at the under-construction building. We hope to produce them at the Alipore court by Tuesday.” Mondal is from Basanti in South 24 Parganas, and had met Vickey at the Fern Road construction site where Vickey worked — also as a security guard — before committing the crime. The two became close friends in a short time and Mondal readily agreed to be part of Vickey’s plans to earn quick money, said cops. The cops claimed that the duo first bought tickets to Parasnath in Jharkhand, but changed trains and reached Mumbai. Sources said they had even tried to change their appearance, but failed. “He seems to have made acquaintances in jail after he was arrested for trying to murder his father. He is still using tricks to dodge pointed questions,” said a source. The arrests take the total number of those nabbed in the case to six. “Prima facie, we believe that these six accused conspired together to commit the crime. But we are questioning main accused Vickey and are not dismissing that chance that fresh links might still emerge. Besides ascertaining the exact motive, we are also questioning Vickey about the loot and the arms used to commit the crime. Once we have the answers, we will ascertain the exact sequence of events,” said an officer. The others who have been arrested in this case include Mithu Halder (42) — Vickey’s mother — and her three recruits Sanjay Mandal (34), Bapi Mondal (27) and Jahir Gazi (25). The police said they plan to question the accused together in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prime-accused-in-exec-murder-accomplice-arrested-in-mumbai/articleshow/87474728.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Police to acquire 226 electric vehicles to cut surging fuel cost||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police will soon induct into its fleet 226 electric vehicles to counter rising diesel prices and escalating maintenance costs. The e-vehicles, to be taken on lease for eight years, will help phase out 200-odd diesel vehicles that are around 15 years old. The proposal has received clearance from Nabanna. The city police force has around 4,000 vehicles but regularly hires transport for special law and order duties. The new vehicles are likely to be divided among the traffic, wireless and other units, with the traffic police getting at least 78 vehicles Lalbazar sources said the office of the deputy secretary, home and hill affairs department, had on September 13 issued a letter granting Rs 8.8 crore for the purpose. Following the budget allocation, a government agency was roped in to complete the tendering and procuring process. An additional CP has been assigned the duty of coordinating with various agencies for the quick arrival of these vehicles. At least half-a-dozen quick charging points will come up across nine police divisions. Each e-vehicle takes close to eight hours to get fully charged. The performance of the first batch of e-vehicles will determine its extensive use in the coming days, the sources said. “At a time when diesel price has shot past Rs 100 a litre, we expect to save Rs 40 crore in the next eight years if the diesel rate does not slide rapidly,” said an officer. “The average cost of electricity consumed by an electric vehicle is estimated to be 90 paisa to Re 1 per kilometre. On the other hand, the average fuel cost for a diesel or petrol vehicle is around Rs 8.5 per kilometre,” he added. On a monthly basis, the officer claimed, the average maintenance cost of the existing vehicles ranges between Rs 50,000 and Rs 60,000 every month. “By this logic, the expenditure per month should be a fraction of what we spend now,” he said. According to senior officers, there are two primary concerns — how frequently the vehicles need to be charged given their rough use and whether the charging centres will be adequate to charge all the cars. “The rule will remain the same as in our diesel cars — keep the charge above 50%,” said an officer. Earlier, Kolkata Police had procured some battery-operated vehicles to patrol around Rabindra Sarobar but this is the first time electric vehicles will be deployed for formal policing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-police-to-acquire-226-electric-vehicles-to-cut-surging-fuel-cost/articleshow/87474738.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav not to contest 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls||LUCKNOW: Sitting MP from Azamgarh and Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav has declared that he won't contest the 2022 assembly elections. He also said the SP has entered into an alliance with Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) for the state polls. On the issue of joining hands with estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party, the SP chief reiterated his earlier stand that he was open to it. “He and his party leaders will be honoured adequately,” Akhilesh said. The SP chief had earlier said he was open to leaving seats for Shivpal and accommodating “his people”. Akhilesh was interacting with the media while on his visit to Hardoi on Sunday when he was asked if he would contest the assembly polls himself given that he was a sitting MP from Azamgarh. “I will not contest the assembly elections,” he said. Akhilesh also announced that the SP-RLD alliance was well in place and a formal announcement on seat-sharing would be made soon. The SP chief's statement has put to rest speculations over possible talks of alliance between the RLD and the Congress which originated after photographs of a meeting between Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary that took place in Lucknow on Sunday, started doing the rounds on social media. Later, RLD sources said the two leaders had met at the airport and it was a mere coincidence. SP leaders also came strongly in defence of the SP chief’s decision not to contest the assembly pools. Sources said Akhikesh’s decision not to contest assembly elections stemmed from the fact that contesting assembly elections himself would leave him preoccupied with canvassing for himself and spare less time for him to campaign across the length and breadth of the state. Senior party leaders said senior leaders not contesting assembly elections was nothing new. Apart from Akhilesh, a host of top politicians like Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati and chief minister Yogi Adityanath had stayed away from the assembly elections only to take the MLC route or through bypolls. “SP national president himself will be in the fray or not is inconsequential as the party as a whole will contest the 2022 assembly polls on the name, face and leadership of Akhilesh Yadav himself,” said party spokesperson MLC Udaiveer Singh. Akhilesh is at present busy with his statewide 'Vijay Yatra' which was launched from the Ganga Ghat in Kanpur and entered into its second phase from Hardoi on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-not-to-contest-2022-polls/articleshow/87474640.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

This assertion from the court came in response to the argument raised by the counsel for the accused applicant, who sought to draw a presumption as to the easy virtue of the victim woman while trying to derive the theory of consensual sex. In the case, the victim and the accused had met on a dating site and allegedly, on the false promise to marry, the accused had sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, he went back on his promise leading to the registration of an instant case against him by the woman. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that he and the victim met on a dating site. In view of this fact, it was submitted that within four days of their meeting, the establishment of physical relationship by the victim demonstrated that it was a case of consensual sex. It was also argued that there was no talk of marriage between the two and, therefore, the allegation that they had indulged in physical relationship in the name of marriage proposal was not made out. Declining to take into consideration the theory of consensual sex advanced by the applicant’s counsel, the court in its decision dated September 14 observed, “Dating sites are not an indication to have judgment on anybody’s virtues. Merely, two adults meet on a dating site, and on the third day of meeting him, exchange of words are able to garner confidence that the other party is willing to marry and in the name of marriage, if physical favour is sought, then that will not amount to characterizing a victim, as a person of easy virtues having consented to physical relationship without there being any provocation like promise to perform marriage.” While rejecting the anticipatory bail application of one Abhhey Chopra of Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida), Justice Vivek Agarwal said that the applicant is free to surrender before the court below and participate in the court proceedings. “He may also, if advised, apply for regular bail, which the court concerned shall consider on its own merits, without getting prejudiced from the order passed here,” the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/being-on-dating-sites-no-parameter-to-judge-virtue-says-hc/articleshow/87475964.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The special court observed that one shuddered to think that if there were no CCTV footage, then eight accused—a woman principal, teachers and peons of a city school—would have been required to go through prosecution for serious offences under the PocsoAct. The court accepted the police’s B-Summary report, closing the case where the father of a student had falsely alleged that she was sexually assaulted in the principal’s office. “Police need to carry out thorough investigation to rule out false implication of the innocent people so that they are not made to go through an ordeal of trials and investigation as their whole life is affected mentally, physically and financially,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pocso-cant-be-misused-says-court-as-cctv-rebuts-charges/articleshow/87475998.cms||Rebecca Samervel

While the AG could not be contacted as his phone was continuously busy till the filing of this report, his son, advocate HPS Deol, told TOI that reports about his father’s resignation were not true. There was no official confirmation from the state government about Deol’s resignation. The Punjab government had notified senior advocate APS Deol’s appointment as Punjab AG on September 27. He had replaced senior advocate Atul Nanda, who had resigned following the resignation of Captain Amarinder Singh as Punjab CM. The advocate general is the senior-most law officer of the state and enjoys a rank equivalent to a state cabinet minister. There has been a long-drawn political slugfest over Deol’s appointment by the Congress government led by Charanjit Singh Channi. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu had openly opposed two appointments by his own party’s government — that of Deol and the new DGP, Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota. Sidhu had even resigned on September 28 in protest and had later raised the issue with party leader Rahul Gandhi on October 15. Deol’s appointment as AG had also triggered a debate as he had represented former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini, who has been facing charges in the Behbal Kalan firing incident related to Punjab’s sacrilege cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposed-by-sidhu-deol-quits-as-punjab-ag-just-after-a-month/articleshow/87476073.cms||---
---||Business||Bandhan consortium, state to own Nicco Park||Kolkata: Nicco Park, Bengal's own Disneyland and an integral part of the city's tourism landscape for three decades, looks all set for a change of hands. Nicco group, the private partner of the amusement park joint venture with the West Bengal government, has sold off its major shareholding to a consortium, comprising Bandhan Employees Welfare Trust (BEWT) and independent investor Angsuman Ghosh, which was the highest bidder for the 25% stake in the Salt Lake property. The state government, which owns the 40-acre land, holds around 26% stake in Nicco Park & Resorts (NPRL). The erstwhile private promoter Nicco Group had an agreement with the state government for NPRL land. Nicco Corporation, the cable manufacturing division of the Nicco Group, went into liquidation earlier. It had a 25% stake in NPRL, which, after being auctioned, got caught into legal wrangles two years ago. Nicco Group also has an additional 15% stake in NPRL. It is learnt that a board meeting has been called on November 12 to reconstitute the management of this amusement park. “The new structure of the board will be decided in the meeting. The article of association will also be framed afresh,” added sources. The sources close to the development pointed out that BEWT had shares in its holding company, Bandhan Bank, which had to be diluted during the stake sale of the lender. “The trust had some money following stake sale, which was utilised for this,” added sources. When contacted, NPRL chairman Nandini Chakravorty, who is also the state government’s principal secretary for tourism, told TOI that it was a long legal journey for securing the rights of the state government. “The validity of the Nicco Park joint sector agreement has been upheld and it is truly a vindication of the efforts of the state government. The state government supported Nicco Park to evolve as one of the most important amusement parks in the country and will continue to do so in the years to come,” she added. Incidentally, the liquidator of Nicco Corporation appointed by NCLT, Kolkata bench, had floated an invitation for EOI on October 2, 2021, for the sale of 25% stake of NPRL The date for auction was later extended on October 11. BEWT submitted the bid documents on October 26. The bidding was held on October 28 and BEWT had emerged as the top bidder. According to sources, BEWT had to pay Rs 35.5 crore for 25% stake in Nicco Parks. It has also appointed the VC Corporate Advisers for the mandatory open offer for the rest of the shareholding in the company. The public shareholding in NPRL is around 34%. Out of that, 14% is with the Bhagnani family, which acquired a stake in this amusement park in the last few years. Arpita Sen, the committee member of BEWT, said it would invest further for the improvement of the amusement park. “It is giving entertainment to the children, that is why we invested in the park,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bandhan-consortium-state-to-own-nicco-park/articleshow/87473787.cms||---

The Tamil Nadu assembly had in February passed the then ruling AIADMK-piloted bill providing internal reservation of 10.5 % for Vanniyars, with the incumbent DMK government issuing an order in July this year for its implementation. It had split the aggregate 20% reservation for MBCs and denotified communities into three separate categories by regrouping castes and provided ten per cent plus sub-quota for Vanniyars, formally known as Vanniakula Kshatriyas. “Is the state government empowered to do internal reservation. The Constitution has given enough explanation. The legislation providing for internal reservation is cancelled,” Justice M Duraiswamy and K Murali Sankar ruled. The judges said the state government cannot come out with such a legislation. This had been explained in the Constitution. The petitioners contended that if such a reservation was implemented, then the Vanniyar community would enjoy reservation in jobs and admission while 25 other castes under MBC and 68 others would have to share the remaining quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/madras-hc-quashes-10-5-vanniyar-quota/articleshow/87476018.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya slammed Yadav, calling the SP chief “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah”. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and BSP president Mayawati also hit out at Yadav for speaking of Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Jinnah on Sunday in the same breath as leaders who fought for India’s independence. Adityanath said, “I was listening to Akhilesh ji’s statement yesterday. He was comparing Jinnah, who divided the country, with Sardar Patel, who brought the nation together. This is a shameful statement.” The CM said this cannot be accepted and everyone should condemn it. “Yadav should regret his statement as insulting Sardar Patel will not be accepted,” he said. “Sardar Patel is the basis of India's unity and integrity, and also is the nation’s architect,” he said, adding that under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi the belief of ‘ek Bharat, shresth Bharat’ is being taken forward. BSP hit out at Yadav on Monday for speaking of the two leaders in the same breath and alleged that there is a “collusion” between SP and BJP. In a tweet, Mayawati alleged that Yadav’s remarks on Jinnah and the BJP’s response to it are part of a well-thought-out strategy of the two parties to vitiate the atmosphere. Owaisi also criticised Yadav, saying that Muslims who stayed in India had rejected Jinnah’s two-nation theory and Yadav should instead talk about the present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-slams-akhileshs-jinnah-remark-as-talibani-mentality/articleshow/87476106.cms||---

A review shows that there is no room in the most-visited premium tiger reserves like Tadoba, Pench (Maharashtra) and Pench (MP), and even sanctuaries like Umred-Karhandla-Paoni, where there is regular sighting of a tigress with five cubs in Gothangaon, are pulling many tourists. Though buffer zones of MP Pench and Tadoba were open for tourists during monsoon, most of the visitors during weekends were from nearby areas as there were travel restrictions due to Covid. “After the parks started full-fledged from October 1, there is ‘revenge’ tourism with many tourists coming from other states too. Tadoba is witnessing traffic from Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad and other states. A group of 35 students visited Tadoba this week,” said naturalist Himanshu Bagde. According to Pench Tiger Reserve field director Prabhu Nath Shukla, Pench saw 1,400 bookings with over 7,000 visitors in October alone. “We have visitors from even West Bengal and Maharashtra. Bookings for November month are also full. While there is no room in Umred-Karhandla also, occupancy in Bor tiger reserve in Wardha is over 50%,” said the field director. Sandeep Singh, a resort owner from MP Pench, said, “Visitors flooding the parks are helping promote wildlife conservation. Though tourists from the south are still not part of the crowd, both Pench reserves are pulling good crowds and resorts have full occupancy. Regular tiger sightings in both buffer and core area are generating a lot of interest.” Aarti Bafna of Champ Town from Pune said, “After remaining indoors during Covid-19 for long, we were delighted to be in Tadoba from October 28-31, with a batch of 35 students. It was not just about tiger or leopard sightings but we came to know about a gamut of issues related to local culture and people’s lifestyle. The students got basic lessons about nature and plants during the walking trail. We plan to visit again in December.” Wildlife tourism is the safest form of tourism as there is complete physical distancing, as per wildlife lover Aditya Joshi. “Secondly, there are regular tiger sightings in the buffer and core areas of Tadoba,” he said. Bagde adds that apart from jungle safari, Tadoba offers other attractions like cycling, kayaking, boating, nature walk, butterfly park and machan stays in the buffer zone. “Sighting of popular male tigers like Waghdoh, Sirkada, Matkasur and tigresses like Junabai, Jharni, Madhuri and Chhoti Madhu in the buffer zones are reason for widespread bookings. With cubs of a couple of tigresses on separation stage, there have been multiple sightings,” said wildlife lover Nikhil Abhyankar. In the core area too, Pandharpaoni queen Maya is being sighted with her lone sub-adult cub. Besides, sub-adult cubs of Chhoti Tara, Sonam and Lara have also been sighted in between. Tadoba deputy director (core) Nandkisore Kale said the occupancy is almost full. “Though there are some cancellations due to the T-20 World Cup the effect is very minuscule. The black leopard sighting in Pandharpaoni-Jamni and tiger cubs on the verge of separation have improved tiger sightings drawing visitors,” said Kale. The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the arrival of overseas tourists in India “The flow of domestic tourists is the only way forward now. It is turning to be a major job generator,” said Bagde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-covid-lull-tourists-get-a-kick-out-of-tiger-sightings-in-vid-parks/articleshow/87473024.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||Bypoll: Huzurabad count today; high stakes for TRS, BJP||HYDERABAD: It will be an end to five months of political slugfest on Tuesday, with the victor of Huzurabad bypoll finally known. The counting of votes will begin at 8 am at SRR College in Karimnagar town and the fate of major parties in the high-stakes bypoll is likely to be decided by 11 am. Though exit polls have indicated an edge to BJP candidate and former TRS minister Eatala Rajender over TRS’ Gellu Srinivas Yadav in the bypoll held on October 30, the ruling party is hopeful of coasting to a victory on the back of its welfare schemes and sops announced during the bitter campaign. Congress’ young face Balmoor Venkat is projected by exit polls to be an also-ran, with the grand old party likely to lose its vote share massively. The election was necessitated after TRS sacked Eatala Rajender from cabinet over land grabbing allegations. ‘Lapses in transportation of VVPATs to counting centre’The campaign cacophony was tuned for voters on a single note: To stick with their six-time MLA Eatala, now out of TRS, or sail with TRS to give a stamp of approval to KCR’s sops and promises. Both TRS and BJP deployed senior leaders, leaving no stone unturned for a win in this grudge match. The voters too didn’t disappoint at the end of the high-voltage campaign, coming out in droves for a record turnout of 86.6%. There were incidents of skirmishes during voting, but in all, poll authorities declared polling to be peaceful. The BJP had alleged there were lapses in transportation of VVPATs from constituency to counting centre in Karimnagar and a probe was ordered by the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ECI has made elaborate arrangements for counting. There will be 22 rounds of counting on 14 tables for 306 polling booths. Each round is expected to take about 30 minutes. “Huzurabad mandal will be taken up initially, followed by Veenavanka, Jammikunta, Ellanthakunta and Kamalapur,” a senior Karimnagar official said. The ECI has imposed Section 144 at counting centres and banned victory rallies after the result. Apart from Eatala, Gellu Srinavas and Venkat, 27 Independent candidates are in the fray. Ahead of polling, TRS objected to allotment of symbols similar to its car to avoid a repeat of voter confusion as it allegedly happened in Dubbak bypoll. If Independents gain votes due to confusion, it may tilt scales again in a close contest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bypoll-huzurabad-count-today-high-stakes-for-trs-bjp/articleshow/87476175.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Noida||2 RRTS routes may branch out from Gzb station, link Hapur and Khurja||Ghaziabad: The Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is likely to have two offshoot corridors that will link Hapur and Khurja. The routes are expected to branch out from Ghaziabad station, where additional platforms will be built for the extensions. Officials in the NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said separate tracks would be laid at Ghaziabad station for integration of the Hapur-Khurja lines. “Provisions have already been made for the extended corridors, which will branch out from Ghaziabad station. For that, we will construct additional tracks and platforms at Ghaziabad. This will allow seamless integration of the two corridors in the future,” said an NCRTC official. Officials said it was not clear when NCRTC, which is executing the RRTS project between Delhi and Meerut, would make a formal announcement regarding the two extensions. But they claimed that additional tracks would anyway be laid at Ghaziabad station. “So, whenever a decision is taken to expand the corridor, NCRTC will not have to construct additional infrastructure. Much of it will already be available at the RRTS station in Ghaziabad,” a senior official said. When the RRTS project was conceptualised in 2006, the links to Hapur and Khurja were among the eight corridors the government had planned in total. However, only three of the eight routes got approval. They were the Delhi-Meerut, Delhi-Panipat and Delhi-Alwar corridors. The 82km Delhi-Meerut link has made the most progress among the three. “Work on the Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor is going on in full swing. On the two other routes, work is in the preliminary stages,” the official said. Once the Hapur and Khurja routes become operational, Ghaziabad will emerge as a major transit hub. The station is anyway being connected to the Red Line of Delhi Metro on the Dilshad Garden to Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda route. “A 120-metre foot overbridge is being constructed to link the RRTS station with Bus Adda,” the official said. The RRTS station in Ghaziabad is being built at a height of 24 metres from the ground and the rapid rail tracks pass over the Red Line. The station is the highest point of the entire corridor from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut. On the ground too, efforts are being made to link the Ghaziabad station with all means of transport without creating a traffic mess in the area. Dedicated pick-up and drop zones will be created for passengers. Of the 82km corridor, the 17km stretch from Sahibabad to Duhai is the priority section. Work on laying the tracks has already begun here. A total of 70.5km of the RRTS corridor will be on elevated platforms. The rapid rail project is expected to become operational by March 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-rrts-routes-may-branch-out-from-gzb-station-link-hapur-and-khurja/articleshow/87474680.cms||Abhijay Jha

Nagpur reported five while Akola and Washim one each. There was no new case in remaining eight districts, which is not rare any more. The Covid-19 graph has remained at the baseline across the region, especially in rural areas. On Monday, 11 patients recovered. More recoveries and fewer new cases once again brought the number of under-treatment patients (active cases) down to 93 – lowest since the first wave set in last year. As it was Sunday on October 31, the testing numbers dropped in all the districts. Of the 2,143 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, only 0.30% came positive. Apart from Nagpur (34), no other district in the region has more than 20 patients under treatment. On Monday, five patients recovered in Chandrapur district, bringing down the ‘active case’ count to 16. Of the five patients detected in Nagpur from 1,282 tests, four are from Nagpur city while one from other state. The city also saw four patients recovering. Now, 34 patients are under-treatment in the district, with 24 of them in NMC limits, eight in Nagpur rural areas while two patients from from other districts/states. Wardha: No reports were received for the tests conducted in the last 24 hours. Caseload, recoveries and toll remained unchanged at 49,407, 48,071 and 1,326, respectively. Six patients are under treatment. Chandrapur: The number of active cases dipped to 16 as the district recorded zero detections as against five recoveries on Monday. There were no Covid deaths. The caseload remained at 88,814, including 87,256 recoveries and 1,542 deaths. Yavatmal: The toll remained unchanged at 1,787. There are five patients under treatment. The administration received only 12 reports. Of the 72,909 patients so far, 71,117, including two on Monday, have recovered. Amravati: No new case, no recovery and no Covid death ensured that the number of active cases remained at seven only. Bhandara: The district maintained its status of zero cases on Monday. Only 19 tests were conducted. There are three patients under treatment. Gondia: For the sixth consecutive day, no new case was detected even as 46 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. There is no active case for the last six days. Gadchiroli: All 135 tests conducted in the last 24 hours came negative and there were no recoveries too. Now, two patients are under treatment. Akola: One out of 133 tests came positive, which took the caseload to 57,884. The district has seen 56,735 recoveries so far. The number of under-treatment patients has reached 10. Washim: One new patient was detected on Monday, taking the caseload to 41,769, including 41,769 recoveries and 639 deaths. Now, three patients are under treatment. Buldhana: Only 26 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. All came negative, which happened for the 20th time in the last four weeks, while one patient recovered.

---||World||At COP26 meet, world leaders dial up ‘doomsday’ warning||GLASGOW: World leaders turned up the heat and resorted to end-of-the-world rhetoric on Monday in an attempt to bring new urgency to sputtering international climate negotiations. The metaphors were dramatic and mixed at the start of the talks, known as COP26. For British PM Boris Johnson, global warming was “a doomsday device” strapped to humanity. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres told his colleagues that people are “digging our own graves”. And Barbados PM Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, added moral thunder, warning leaders not to “allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction”. After apocalyptic warnings from those three and a few others, a handful of more sedate — sometimes detailed — speeches followed. US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel avoided soaring rhetoric and delved into wonky policy. “Climate change is already ravaging the world. There’s no more time to sit back,” Biden said in a more measured warning that also apologised for his predecessor’s temporarily pulling the US out of the historic 2015 Paris agreement, something he said put the country behind in its efforts. “Every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases”. In addition to coaxing big carbon-polluting nations to promise more stringent emission cuts, French President Emmanuel Macron said European nations now have to shift from promises to action. Earlier, Johnson — who is hosting the summit in the Scottish city of Glasgow — likened an ever-warming Earth’s position to that of fictional secret agent James Bond: strapped to a bomb that will destroy the planet and trying to defuse it. He told leaders that the only difference now is that the “ticking doomsday device” is not fiction and “it’s one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock”. The threat now is climate change, triggered by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, and he noted that it all started in Glasgow with James Watt’s steam engine powered by coal. Johnson also pointed out that the more than 130 world leaders gathered for the leaders’ summit portion of the UN climate conference had an average age of over 60, while the generations most harmed by climate change aren’t yet born. The conference aims to get governments to commit to curbing carbon emissions fast enough to keep global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed 1.1C. Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7C by the year 2100. The other goals for the meeting are for rich nations to give poor nations $100 billion a year in climate aid and to reach an agreement to spend half of the money to adapt to worsening climate impacts. But Mottley, of Barbados, warned negotiators are falling short. “This is immoral and it is unjust,” Mottley said. “Are we so blinded and hardened that we can no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?” “We are already gasping for survival,” chimed in President Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan of the Seychelles, another island nation. “Tomorrow is not an option for it will be too late.” Guterres struck an equally gloomy note. “We are digging our own graves,” said the UN secretary-general. “Our planet is changing before our eyes _ from the ocean depths to mountaintops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events”. The speeches will continue through Tuesday, then the leaders will leave. The idea is that they will do the big political give-and-take, setting out broad outlines of agreement, and then have other government officials hammer out the nagging but crucial details. That’s what worked to make the historic 2015 Paris climate deal a success, former UN Climate Secretary Christiana Figueres said. “For heads of state, it is actually a much better use of their strategic thinking,” Figueres said. In Paris, the two signature goals — the 1.5C limit and net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — were created by this leaders-first process, Figueres said. In the unsuccessful 2009 Copenhagen meeting the leaders swooped in at the end. Thousands lined up in Glasgow on Monday to get through a bottleneck at the entrance to the venue. But what will be noticeable are a handful of major absences. Xi Jinping, president of top carbon-polluting nation China, won’t be in Glasgow. Figueres said his absence isn’t that big a deal because he isn't leaving the country during the pandemic and his climate envoy is a veteran negotiator. Biden, however, has chided China and Russia for their less than ambitious efforts to curb emissions and blamed them for a disappointing statement on climate at the end of the meeting of G20 leaders in Rome this weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/at-cop26-meet-world-leaders-dial-up-doomsday-warning/articleshow/87476136.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Coal contractors go on 1-day token strike||NAGPUR: Contractors engaging mining equipment with Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) went on a daylong token strike demanding compensation for rising diesel prices, on Monday. The strike, which also took place in other subsidiaries of Coal India Limited (CIL), coincided with foundation day of the mining PSU. Contractors in WCL went on a 24-hour strike while those in other PSUs stopped work for 10 hours. Earlier, there were plans to go on an indefinite strike. “As the association in other subsidiaries had not served notices to their management, a single shift strike of 10 hours was held,” said Lokesh Jain from the Nagpur unit of contractor’s association. He said there are plans to go on an indefinite strike from November 10 if the demands are not met. A WCL official said the strike could have impacted production. The exact assessment is likely to be made on Tuesday. “The Monday strike shows that there is unity among the contactors and they can go on an agitation again if needed,” said Jain. The contractors have been left with piling losses due to high diesel rates. “They have also demanded advance payment from WCL so that they can pay wages,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coal-contractors-go-on-1-day-token-strike/articleshow/87473117.cms||Shishir Arya
